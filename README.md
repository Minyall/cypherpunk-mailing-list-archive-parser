+ PPE timezone I've assumed is the same as PST due to the fact that none of the posts with it are during daylight savings (Oct-Dec 92), and some of the posters (i.e. T. C. May) are based in CA.
+ There are some posts dated Tue Sep 07 12:36-57 that crop up in 92-96. These all have the same message-ID (one that indicates the message ID isn't found). As such I'll be categorising them in as "messages with unknown date/time" in the year whose archive they're from.
+ There are some posts from the first few days of Jan 1999 in the 1998 archive. I believe these are genuinely dated and will archive them as such.
+ There appear to be messages from the Extropians@gnu.ai.mit.edu / extropians@extropy.org mailing list mixed in too, but they all appear relevant to the cypherpunk mailing list, so I'll be leaving them in place.
