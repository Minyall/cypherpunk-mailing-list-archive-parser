re RU-486: has recently been proven to make a nifty "morning-after" pill (is
this abortion? only if you believe in the sanctity of blastula) and a study
in (I believe) S. CA. is beginning on effectiveness in brain tumors... seems
as if this drug has possible wide theropeutic (aw, who can spell?) uses
beyond directly sex-lined situations.  And RU-P5 is due out 2Q93.
-a2.
