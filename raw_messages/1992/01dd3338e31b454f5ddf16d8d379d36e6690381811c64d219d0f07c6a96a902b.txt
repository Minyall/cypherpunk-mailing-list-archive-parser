Keith's CD-for-a-pad idea is a variant of a book code.  In a book
code, parts of the key are in various standard books, often the bible.

Advantages: easier key distribution.  

Disadvantages: key material is public.  Should an internal spy learn
the few bits of addressing information (which CD, where), the cipher
is compromised.
