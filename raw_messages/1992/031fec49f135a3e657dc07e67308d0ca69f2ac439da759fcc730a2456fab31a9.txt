OK, folks, the interview went off beautifully (thanks Tim).
As mentioned earlier, if anyone wants a copy of the tape,
I'll be happy to send one.  Unfortunately, I'm going to be
a little slow making copies because my cassette deck is 
crippled at the moment, so be patient.  Email me if you're
interested.

** Important request: Is there a kind soul out there who would
be willing to transcribe the interview (~40 minutes total)???
I just don't have the time.  If you can do it, I will mail you 
a copy of the tape gratis (total value: $1.50 + postage!).

   --Dave.
