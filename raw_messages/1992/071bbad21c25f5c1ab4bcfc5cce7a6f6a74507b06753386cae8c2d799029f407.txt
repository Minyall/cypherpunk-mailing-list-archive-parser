John Draper asked for comments on a proposed interface to the Rander box.
I would recommend using different characters to start and stop the
transmission; if you use one character for both it's easy to get out of sync.
^S and ^Q are traditional, of course, and hardware flow control is another
option (Perry's suggestion).  Of course, not everybody's machine handles
hardware flow control adequately.  If you've got a dip switch annyway,
you may want to use one switch to choose hardware or ^S/^Q.
