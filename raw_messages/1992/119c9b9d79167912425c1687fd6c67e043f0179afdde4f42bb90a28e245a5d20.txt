Well whenever I try to come up with some nifty crypto scheme, I always
seem to think it is too easy to break if you know its being used but then
I dont like doing too much 'expensive' crypting and I usually find some
cheap algo which uses a more expensive one for key trading.

Has anyone tried using the microsecond counter from unix as a random
source ?  Its obviously *not* going to be good if you want a continuous
stream of random numbers, but if you need them just 'every now and then',
what about it ?

Something like this would be used:

	struct	timeval	tv;
	long	rand;
	...
	gettimeofday(&tv, NULL);
	rand = tv.tv_usec + tv.tv_sec;
	...

Very unlikely to get a duplicate, esp. if you dont need the number
more often than 1 per second.
