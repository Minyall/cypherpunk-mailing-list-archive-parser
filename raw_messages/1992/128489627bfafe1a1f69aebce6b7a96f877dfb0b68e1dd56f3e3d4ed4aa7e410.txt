Are you saying that contributing to this mailing list (let alone
*subscribing* to it) necessarily implies that one is using the PGP
code?


If so, take me off.

As a counter to that, would you or Perry necessarily imply that
subscribing to a "KrAcKeR" magazine makes you an evil
"KrAcKeR"?
 
Anyway, if you can figure out the unix commands to navigate through
your mail-box, then you should have just enough intelligence
not to have jumped to any short-sided conclusions like the one
you proposed above.
 
Then again, I could be wrong.
