Yanek Martinson makes some very good points about the legality of
TEMPEST:

Thanks, Yanek!

And could I suggest to all of us that we be very careful in the
language we use when disagreeing with others? "Treason's" demand that
Perry now "SHUT UP" is intemperate and counterproductive.

Our list is not moderated, that is, there is no censor or moderator
holding people back when they feel the temptation to spew bile all
over the list. With hundred of folks now on this list, great care must
be taken.

Sorry to waste list bandwidth on this point of list etiquette.
