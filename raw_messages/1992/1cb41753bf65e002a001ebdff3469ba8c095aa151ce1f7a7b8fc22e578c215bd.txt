Sigh... well, I guess I can see if the people I know who are interested,
would do it as a freebie...

Funny thing is, when I first looked into crypto for dissident purposes, back
in 1981 or so, I was interested in a PKS implementation, but someone else in
my circle persuaded me that OTPs would be preferable in some cases.  Now
here we are with a PKS and I'm still making noises about OTPs.  

Guess the debate is closed for the moment... congratulations, y'all, for
good arguements in a good tone.  
Now the well is about to close for the night, so I gotta scoot. 
Be back soon...
