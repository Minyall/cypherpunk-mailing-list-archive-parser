this will zero out the inode it also does NOT clear the data blocks
just the inode pointers to the data blocks. infact if you do this.

(this you *will* need to umnount and fsck your
system [or reboot if you did this to you root partition]).
in fact if you do this with out deleteing the file first you run a good
chance of crashing the system.


normaly I would say "do not try this at home" but then I would rather
you shot yourself in the foot at home (as opposed to shooting yourself
and who ever is on a public system)

I will post some C/Perl code that will work as a /bin/rm replacement in a
few days.
