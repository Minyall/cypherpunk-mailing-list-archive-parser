Only problem is, once we start anything like a formal barter system, it
comes under the IRS.  The way to avoid that is to keep it a volunteer
organisation with an expectation of time commitment to projects or to
payment of membership dues.  Not-for-profit organisations are of course
regulated in a minimal way (think of your local Model Railroad Club), but
the accounting isn't as strict and the membership transactions don't have to
be reported in detail.
