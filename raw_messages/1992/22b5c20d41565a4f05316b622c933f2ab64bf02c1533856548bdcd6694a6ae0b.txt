The most pressing thing is not to integrate encryptions in mail handlers,
but at the level of ether.  Ether is an enormous security hole.  I can walk
up to anything running ether with my notebook, plug in, and listen to all
traffic.  Therefore, ether cards need public key encryption built in, so
they can communicate with eachother in a secure way.  This also applies to
all other low level protocols.
