Tim,
Why not use a back-biased germanium diode, or other noisy semiconductor
junction?  Seriously, the NRC has allowed the smoke detector people to
spread those little radioactive chunks of Americium for too long.

John Walker of AutoDesk actually built an IBM-PC card that generated
random numbers from a radioactive source.

All the best,
