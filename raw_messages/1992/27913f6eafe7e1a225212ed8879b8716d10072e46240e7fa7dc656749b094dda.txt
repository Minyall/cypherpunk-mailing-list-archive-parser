The mail handling stuff we discussed at the last cypherpunks meeting
will implement what you requested.  The particular thing that hadn't
occurred to me in what you said is that a mailing list supplier could
provide those extra services of anonymity in a way very accessible to
users of the mailing list.  That could make such anonymity slightly
easier to spread.
