		 [1.5 .. 2.5]	encrypted text
		 [3 .. 6]	regular text
		 [7 .. 8]	line noise

	 This is a very simple measure.  There are other measures to look for
	 the deviation from an expected distribution, which give much more
	 accurate distinctions.  One can very easily separate languages from
	 each other just by looking at such measures.

Where does uuencoded [compressed] binary lie?  I would suspect it lies
right around where encrypted text is.  Presumably straight encrypted
text is statistically random [7..8], but that when you8 encrypt to
just the ascii subset is when you lose the entropy.
