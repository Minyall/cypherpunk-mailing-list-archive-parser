It seems that registration would defeat the advantage
of a public key system, but it would not prevent private
encrypted messages from being hidden from casual traffic
analysis or even notice by public key wrapping.

This would make registration rather useless against a
conspiracy and thus hard to justify in the face of commercial
and constitutional opposition.
