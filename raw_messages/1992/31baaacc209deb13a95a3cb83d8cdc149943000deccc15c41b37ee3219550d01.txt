Hey, Kidz....


I don't mean to point out the obvious, but when you mention a certain
scheme for secure transfer (3 initials, you guess), or a certain organization
dedicated to keeping it from the public (3 initals, you guess again),
THEY READ IT.

OK?  Did I make my point?
If not, we're going to unsubscribe from this list like a bat out of hell.

Over,
