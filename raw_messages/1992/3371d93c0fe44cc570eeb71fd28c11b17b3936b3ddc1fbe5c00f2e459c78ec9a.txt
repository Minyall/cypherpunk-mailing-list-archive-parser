I have to echo Phil's comments here. One of the things that might be
worth a few minutes is for this group to hash out (pun intended) a set
of guidelines for "when it's o.k. to sign a key". I have been
talking to some people about personal applications of cryptographic
technology, and I'm frequently surprised when even people with a DP
security background want to rush to certify keys they've received via
email, etc. 

I'm thinking something along the lines of "If I'm in a real-time
communications mechanism, and on the phone at the same time, and I
receive their key at the moment when they told me they hit the return
key - then it's probably theirs"...It would be prohibitive to list all
of the possible permutations, but it might go a long way toward
building the right habits if we brainstormed about a few firm
guidelines for the uninitiated as to what constitutes responsible key
management. 

I confess to some personal bias, because I know the PEM folks are
watching to see how robust our key distribution "web" becomes over the
course of its evolution, and I'd like to be able to show them a
convincing argument against centralized key management, empirically...
