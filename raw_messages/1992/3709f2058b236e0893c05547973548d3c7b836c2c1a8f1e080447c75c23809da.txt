I think that signatures should be kept.  If you really want to be
anonymous, you have bigger things to worry about than your sig showing
up or not.

And if I want to build a pseudonymous identity for myself, I might
want to have a sig for that identity.  I wouldn't want the remailers
stripping that out.

Perhaps it would make sense to have a header field which indicated if
the sig should be kept or not.
