" ... some kind of hardware device which isolates the line and all that."

I believe part of the MIDI specification includes explicit decoupling of
each device from the network via optical coupling. ( Ref: _MIDI systems
and control_, Francis Rumsey ... "The interface incorporates an opto-iso-
-lator between the MIDI IN  and the device's microprocessor system. This
is to assure that there is no direct electrical link between devices ..." )

Anyhow, such a component is commercially - and easily - available.
