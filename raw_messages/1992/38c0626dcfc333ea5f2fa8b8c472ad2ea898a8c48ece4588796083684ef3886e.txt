   Has anyone tried using the microsecond counter from unix as a random
   source ?  Its obviously *not* going to be good if you want a continuous
   stream of random numbers, but if you need them just 'every now and then',
   what about it ?

This should be in an FAQ:  Unixes have different levels of granularity
in the microsecond counter; some systems may only have a 10 ms (that's
10000 microsecond) resolution to their clock.  So you can't necessarily
depend on a getting lot of bits of randomness from this method.
