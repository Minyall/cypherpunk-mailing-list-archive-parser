Its a rather bad source. Operations of a computer system are
suprisingly low on entropy. I'd guess that, if I needed to and had
enough resources, I could break such a generator without more than a
few months work, and even get the system to break it semi-automatic.

No one here seems to think in terms of cryptanalysis and how people do
it when they come up with their schemes.
