What else has Chaum written about?  I saw his Scientific American
cryptomoney article, and have heard of his dc-nets, but what other
protocols has he discussed?  Any pointers on journal articles would be
appreciated - I think tomorrow I'll hit the library and go sifting for
everything Chaum has written!
