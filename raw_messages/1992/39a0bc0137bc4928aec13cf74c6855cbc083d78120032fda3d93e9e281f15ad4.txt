"Should everyone on the list be given a set amount of digital cash to start
 the 'poker game', or will we choose a smaller, representative sample? "

Maybe we should generate some digicash with a PostScript printer, just to
make it interesting.

I wonder how public key cryptology would effect efforts to counterfeit ?
It seems to me that this same technology could make cash much harder to
forge ... even allowing one to actually _print_ one's tender, authenticated
by the information buried in the serial number of the bill ... and it would
be the serial numbers that the bank would track, not the actual pieces of
paper.
