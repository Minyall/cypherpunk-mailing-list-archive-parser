Right.

Exactly.

uuencoding will have a slightly lower single-character entropy than
the ASCII armor PGP uses because just about every line begins with the
letter 'M'.  This will skew the distribution slightly.  But a better
way of distinguishing uuencoding and ascii armor is to see that in
falls in the same entropy class, and then just looking at the
alphabetic subsets used.
