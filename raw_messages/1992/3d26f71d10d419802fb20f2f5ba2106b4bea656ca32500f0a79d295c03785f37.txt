RSA is putting on a conference on public key cryptography on the SF
peninsula on January 14th (conference) and 15th (tutorials and
exposition).  Last year's conference was smaller (one day) and quite
interesting.  Many of the best cryptographers in the world attended.
It's worth prying yourself out of your usual haunts for.

The conference is free.  Registration is "extremely limited, and is
first come, first served".  Phone +1 415 595 8782 and ask for
Conference Registration, to reserve your place (and a place for anyone
else at your company who's interested).  I'll see you there!
