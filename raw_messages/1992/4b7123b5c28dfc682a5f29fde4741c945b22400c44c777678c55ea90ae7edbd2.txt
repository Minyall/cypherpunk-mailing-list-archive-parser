There's a cheap fix for the particular problem you mentioned, Hal. 
(Of course, that's usually the case, and it's usually too weak a fix
to help generally, but I think this one gives us back the ability to
use anonymity here.)  

The cheap fix is to make sure that the last remailer in the chain
(the one closest to you) is your own!  That way you can ensure no
one else checks its translation.  No one else can be sure which is
the second-to-last hop, so they can't tell who owns the last
remailer.
