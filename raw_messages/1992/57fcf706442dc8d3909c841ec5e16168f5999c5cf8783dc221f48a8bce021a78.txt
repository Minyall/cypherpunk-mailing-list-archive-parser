Hell, there's real-world examples today that some of my friends have
been harrassed for: "Obscene materials".

OK, sexually explicit photographs are a trivial example. Friends have
gotten harrassed (by US customs) for zines containing weird shit, not
just sexually explicit. The US/Canada customs people are living in
another century and reality plane.
