I myself read my own mail on an MSDOS machine acting as a terminal
over a dialin.  The unix host is not overly secure, and I'm not about
to go putting keys on it.  I've been thinking about how to solve my
own encryption problem, you can be sure.

But most of the people on the list are reading mail on Unix machines,
and a simple piping interface is the first thing to implement.  I myself
may not use it at first, but it is a start.
