We've created a secondary list, cypherpunks-announce@toad.com.

If you want to keep in touch, but don't want the volume of mail the
full list produces, get yourself switched over.

And remember not to post such requests to the whole list.  Thanks.

The welcome message follows.

Eric

Welcome to the cypherpunks-announce list.

This is a low-volume list for announcements, news, and meeting
schedules.  It is not a digest.  It is moderated by Eric Hughes, also
the maintainer of the full list.

Each of you has at some point been on the full list and asked to be
dropped for mail volume.  If you really don't want to be even on the
announce list, send mail to 

	cypherpunks-announce-request@toad.com

and ask to be removed from the announce list.

Eric
