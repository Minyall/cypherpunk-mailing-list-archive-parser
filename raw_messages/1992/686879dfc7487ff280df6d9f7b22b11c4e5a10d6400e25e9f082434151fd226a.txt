You've certainly showed us that you believe this Perry, but otherwise
this statement contains no educational content.  This, to me, sounds
like a grown-up version of "Is so!!!" backed up by "My bank account
can beat up your bank account!"

I'd really like to know if ID is required or not, for one, because
that seems to affect the banks liability vis-a-vis presentation of
false credentials.

You made a claim of fact.  I'm asking for you to provide a reference
in support of your claim.  Simple rational discourse.

Now you're putting words into my mouth.  I made no judgement as to
whether I thought this was a good state of affairs.
