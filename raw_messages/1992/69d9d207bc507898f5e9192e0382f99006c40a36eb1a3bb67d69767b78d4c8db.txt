Phil's comment are right on.  There is a need for you secret keys
to be easily and physically relocatable.

It is my own opinion that there will be a market for personal
protection devices only when data is worth money.  Data will be worth
money when some data _is_ money.

I refer to this as WEEM: Write, Erase, Encrypt Memory

Depending on the silicon size and production volume, you could
probably use this device for all modular exponentiation operations.
Or a cheap version could use a DSP module from a cell library and do
all the arithmetic more slowly.

Not only a keypad, but a full 4-function calculator with an LCD
display as well! :-)

Smart cards have the disadvantage that their die size is pretty
severely limited.  They have to fit within the thickness of a credit
card and withstand repeated flexure.

Much better for this application is the PCMCIA standard, which has
plenty of room for circuitry.
