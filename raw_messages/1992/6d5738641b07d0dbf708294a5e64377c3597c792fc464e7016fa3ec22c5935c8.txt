Gudday,

People were suggesting that someone write a mailer with PGP
support, and because my site uses lots of PCs connected to an
internet host, I was thinking of using an SMTP-client based
system. That much I think I can do.

However, I am also now trying to learn to program for Windows,
and the idea of a windows based PGP is quite nice, and with an
integrated mailer it would be great.

Is anyone else working on either of these two things?

What are the implications (security wise) of using something    
like windows where tasks aren't really that hidden from each
other and that swaps to disk?

I notice that PGP bothers to erase its stacks and work areas. It
seems that this would be a lot less possible under windows. 

Comments?
