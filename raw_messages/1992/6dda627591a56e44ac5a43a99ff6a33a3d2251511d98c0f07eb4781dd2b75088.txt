I've had this list gatewayed into a newsgroup locally since it started, 
as long as people are reasonably disciplined (what us, disciplined) about
keeping the same subject line, then the volume of this list is quite managable.
OTOH - there is no way I could have handled this volume in my regular mailbox.
