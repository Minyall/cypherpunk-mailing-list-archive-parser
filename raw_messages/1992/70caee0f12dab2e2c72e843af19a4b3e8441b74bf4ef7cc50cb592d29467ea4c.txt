Hi all...

I was at the latter part of the Washington 2600 meeting, feel free to ask me 
questions if you want.

By the way, today's article about the event was yet another example of the 
media promoting hysteria about technologically competent people. The whole 
article was of the "A hacker is someone who breaks into systems" model. It 
makes me sick, and I think that the crypto community (the part NOT employed 
by DoD) is next for this sort of misrepresentation.

Cheers,
Bob Stratton     Engineer, InterCon Systems Corp.     strat@intercon.com
