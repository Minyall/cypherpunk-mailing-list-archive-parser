A lab proven method:  Take CD-ROM.  Place in standard kitchen microwave. 
Set on high power cook for 5 seconds.  Press start.  Watch the action. 
Hang resulting artifact on wall as curiosity, which is all it's good for
now.  Let the wave air out a little (this won't fry it).

A great way of trashing obsolete but confidential CD's, and perhaps the
cypherpunk equivalent of flushing the dope stash.
