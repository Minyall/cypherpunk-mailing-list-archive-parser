You don't have to tell anyone that your remailer is behind the anon.100
address.  You could just (anonymously, of course) announce that a
remailer is running, and can be reached by sending message to the
anon.100 address.  This way, no-one but the admins at pax can know
where the remailer itself lives.  This could be useful in case 
remailers are banned.
