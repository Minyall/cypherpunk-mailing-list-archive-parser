Re. Ten Reasons Why I Don't Use PGP:

This is exactly why we need a decent user interface.  The ideal would be a
public-domain wordprocessor, which could be fairly simple, with a menu
option for encrypt/decrypt, signature, and so on.  I've been working on
something like this for my OTP, and would be glad to participate in a
project to do it for PGP and other systems.
