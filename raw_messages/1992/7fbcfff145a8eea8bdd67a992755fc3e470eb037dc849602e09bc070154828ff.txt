There is a bit of confusion about the various lists and addresses.

My main address is hughes@soda.berkeley.edu.  The remailer runs from
this account.  All the perl scripts are there.

The account I use to maintain the mailing list is on toad.com, as well
as the mailing list itself.  Its software is nothing but sendmail; no
perl scripts.
