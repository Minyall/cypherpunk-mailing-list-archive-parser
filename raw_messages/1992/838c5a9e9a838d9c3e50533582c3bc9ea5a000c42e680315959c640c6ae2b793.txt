Greetings CypherFolk,
 
I'm still in Europe, researching combinations of sleep deprivation and extended
train travel, but the time for return to sf.ca.us is drawing closer. I'm still
temporarily off the c-punks mail alias due to technical/fiscal reasons so buzz
me directly at <deltorto@applelink.apple.com> until January 93.
 
Appended below is my brand-spankin'-new 512-bit public key. Give it a workout
so I can see if it works (out). I have an interesting keyring from over here if
anyone is interested. Will attend meeting anytime in '93 if I'm notified so we
can pass the baton -er- floppy.
 
   dave del torto
