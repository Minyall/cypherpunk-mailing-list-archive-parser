If you don't want to be on this list, that's fine.

BUT PLEASE STOP CLUTTERING MY INBOX WITH THE UNSUBSCRIBE REQUESTS!!! I
AND MOST OF THE OTHER RECIPIENTS OF THIS LIST CANNOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT
IT!!

There is a convention on the Internet that if there is a list called
foo@bar.domain, the maintainers of this list will be on a much smaller
list called foo-request@bar.domain.  Send requests there to get added
or removed, not to the whole list.  If you get a bounce, then, and
ONLY THEN, should you send to the whole list.

So, if you want to get off the list, send mail to
cypherpunks-request@toad.com.  It's not hard.  And it will keep large
numbers of people from wanting to kill you.

Flame off.
