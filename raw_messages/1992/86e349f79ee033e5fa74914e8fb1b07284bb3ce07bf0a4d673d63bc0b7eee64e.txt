I don't think space-collapsed signatures make any sense; they're only
going to mess up

If you're going to do any canonicalization, do either exactly what PEM
does, or canonicalize tabs and trailing spaces out of the message at
posting time.  Then do the same canonicalization on the receive end
before the signature is verified.

If a message transfer path is still "lossy", stop using the unencoded
body and just live with radix64 encoding.
