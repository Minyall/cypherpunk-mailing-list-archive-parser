How about using ps -laxww as a source of randomness?  Of course it would be
run throug something like MD5 to get rid of the structure.  This would
not be good on a multi-user system because ps command may have been 
modified to log the person invoking it, time, and output to somewhere.

But on a personal workstation that you trust, it could be a pretty
good source of unpredictable data.

This is not my original idea, I think it was suggested in one of the
multiple precision math packages I looked at recently.
