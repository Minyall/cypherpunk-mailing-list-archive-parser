One incentive would be for the BBS operators to phase in a policy that
they will accept no e-mail which is _not_ encrypted.  Comments?

And how does your BBS software tell whether or not you've just sent
encrypted mail, plaintext mail or line-noise?
(in an encryption/decryption-at-user's-end scenario)
