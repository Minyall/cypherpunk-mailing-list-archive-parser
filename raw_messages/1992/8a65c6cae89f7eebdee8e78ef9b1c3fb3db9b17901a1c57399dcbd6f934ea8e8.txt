Just to point out, though, this is not foolproof. A good impressionist
can fool people, especially if they are extremely skilled. A person
with Rich Little's or Peter Sellers' level of skill can sound
astonishingly like the original person (although a sound spectrograph
isn't fooled, other humans can be).
