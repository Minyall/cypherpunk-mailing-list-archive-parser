In reponse to Dean T. message.

I agree.

Re: low tech - The extropians uses several Perry(TM) filters
to prevent unwanted bounces AND unwanted posters OUT.

For a more high tech solution I can imagine some sort of public or
private key needed to make a post 

- An example being some a public key that was in some manner 
signed by a trusted member of a list - I am weak on the techincal
end/side but basically unless the message is "trusted" it doens't
get through.
