PS:  I too think that other key certification models besides "hierarchical"
are appropriate.  I think we can start from PEM software and PEM message
formats and evolve and experiment as appropriate.  Before you ask, currently
there is no PEM software widely available.  It's in alpha test.  It will
be released in full source code, and its development was funded by DARPA.
