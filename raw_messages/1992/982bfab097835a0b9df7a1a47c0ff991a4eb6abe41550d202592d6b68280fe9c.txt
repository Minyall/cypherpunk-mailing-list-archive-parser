This seems equivalent to the old "dictionary" or "book" cyphers that
people sometimes used. Good cryptanalysts broke them routinely. I'll
leave it to your imagination how one might do it, but I'll just note
that if you picked a few arbitrary bytes, say bytes 30-40, of all the
CDs in the record store, you would find that those few bytes likely
distinguish all but prehaps a token number of CDs.
