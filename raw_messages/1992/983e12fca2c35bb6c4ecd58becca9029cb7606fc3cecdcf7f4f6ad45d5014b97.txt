Cypherpunks of Cypherspace,

I just found a new FAQ and bibliography in sci.crypt. It's by Larry
Loen and is intended as a stopgap FAQ, as sci.crypt hasn't had a good
FAQ in a while. It doesn't cover the digital cash, anonymous
remailers, crypto anarchy, etc. kinds of stuff, but it answers FAQs
about one-time pads, ciphers, RSA, etc.

Since this is a mailing list, I will not forward it. (It's 26 or so
screenfuls of VT-100 screens, which is fairly long.)

Also, I still have the "Crypto Glossary" available for forwarding to
any newcomers to this list.
