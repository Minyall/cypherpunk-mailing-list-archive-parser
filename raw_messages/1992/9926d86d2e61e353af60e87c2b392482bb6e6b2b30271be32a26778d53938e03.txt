Fellow cypherpunks:

There is a new anonymous remailer for our use.  Its address is
elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu, its name is "remailer03", and here is the
public key:

-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----


Also, here is a script I have to use the remailers.  It is the
ultimate in brute force :-)  Perhaps if more people implemented
remailers, a general script can be written to bounce mail off them
all, or a subset of them all, in the style of Bill's scripts which were
recently posted.  It didn't take long at all to set up: I spent most
the time installing perl in my account, and tracing down an annoying
bug that was my fault - I forgot to make the *.pl files executable.
