"On a related note, I noticed an article on electronic money in a recent
 issue of _the_Futurist_.  It kept on coming back to the big advantage of
 cryptomoney:  it is completely traceable.  The main point was that
 cryptomoney would eliminate black marketeering (including the drug trade)."

I don't think cash will _ever_ be eliminated. If it is, someone will make
their own ( banks did this for many decades in North America ) and these
will fill the role.

There will always be transactions which will not justify the cost of the
overhead in hardware and transaction processing, and market pressures will
reward those whom develop a way to avoid this overhead, IMHO.
