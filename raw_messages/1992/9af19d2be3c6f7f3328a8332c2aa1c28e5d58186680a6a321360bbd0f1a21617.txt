Re BBSs and encrypted email.  Of course it would eliminate liability; well
I would expect the Powers That Be to simply outlaw the use of encryption on
BBSs or find some legal convolution which has a similar result.  The only
way we can win on this is to do what we're doing: get this stuff out there
far & wide before anyone has a chance to stop it.
