Mail typically wants to get sent to multiple receivers, all with
different private keys.  I vaguely recall that the way PGP works is it
generates a symetric cypher key and encrypts the message with that,
then encrypts the generated key with the public key of the intended
receiver.   Is that how it works?

Given that, it should be straightforward (and maybe it already does)
encrypt the generated key with several public keys so you get one
package that can be unsealed by any of several different receivers.

Are there other ways to handle sending to multiple receivers?
