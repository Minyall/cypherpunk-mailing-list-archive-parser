 U> How about the idea of a secure Internet Relay Chat?

I'm fairly interested... version 2 of PGP is generating some interest here in the FidoNet, though it has some serious problems, design problems. (It's "ASCII armor" method (ala UUENCODE) is delicate and fussy, for example).

I am considering becoming and "introducer" for parts of FidoNet. I can't seem to get past the problems of how to assign reliability to public keys I receive over an unsecured email channel to begin with.  No other method is practical.

Alas, I can't take part in much it seems, the UFGATE was hobbled to intentionally prevent us FidoNet people from entering text into message headers (For example "Request-Remailing-To:"...) because we'd take over the planet or something I guess (we are apparently contagious).

Doesn't this imply that the unencrypted message would have to travel from the originator to the server? Or do you mean to send to X I'd request X's public key from the server, then encrypt, etc?
