I've installed Eric's anonymous remailer scripts at remailer@rebma.mn.org.
Rebma is my home machine...  It's not right on the Internet, but it is a
Telebit connection away.  Feel free to use it as you see fit.  I don't
have Hal's PGP additions, but I am interested in running them.

Hal's messages said he hoped more people put up remailers so that they could be
chained together.  Sounded good to me.
