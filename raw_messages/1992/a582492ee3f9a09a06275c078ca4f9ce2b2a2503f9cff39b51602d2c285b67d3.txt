We've made a small change to the way mail gets sent out to the list
which should alleviate the bounced message problem.  The change went
into effect last night.  It should take care of most, but perhaps not
all, of the problems.

So, take heart.  Starting in a few days, please _do_ forward bounce
reports to cypherpunks-request@toad.com.  At that point I'll want them
for further debugging.
