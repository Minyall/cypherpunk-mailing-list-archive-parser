It is very hard to generate really random numbers no matter what you do.
See the famous RAND book "One Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal
Deviates" for their adventures trying to generate random numbers by
counting particle emissions from a radioactive source.  Even after
all kinds of statistical massaging there were still correlations in the
output.
