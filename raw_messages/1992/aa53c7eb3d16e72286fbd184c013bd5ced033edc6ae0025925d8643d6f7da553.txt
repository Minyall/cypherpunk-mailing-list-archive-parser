Physical security for pgp is also necessary if you store your pass
phrase in memory.

As far as modification, detection is good enough, but you'd better
make sure your program to detect modifications is not itself
compromised!  (Does anybody detect an imminent arms race here?)

Eric Hollander is correct.  Ideally, your keys and your encryption
mechanism should be kept secure.  At some point in the future, a small
card which contains all of this will be standard equipment, as well as
a port to plug it into.
