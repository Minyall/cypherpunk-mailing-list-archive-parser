	 That is fine as long as you trust all the entities that designed,
	 built, (modified :-), programmed, installed, and administer the system.

You can inspect the design, the code, the installation, and probablyu
even the administration of the system.  That would typically be
economically infeasible, however, so to reduce your expense, you'll
have to trust someone (preferably someone who stands to lose a lot if
they defect).
