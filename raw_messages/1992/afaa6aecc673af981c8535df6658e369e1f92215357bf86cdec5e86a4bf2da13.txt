Hello ,

I wish i knew the internet address , if any
, to which one should ask so to subscribe
to the 'sci.cryp' usenet's bb . I'd like
to know either what cypherpunk stands for ?
I'm interested in mathematical processing
of datum ( well datas or datum....a key issue
no doubt ) . Anyway i thank you in advance .
Regards    Louis Safer
