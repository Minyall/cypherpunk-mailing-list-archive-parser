You needn't timetravel to come up with instances of underground heroism.
There is RIGHT NOW an underground dealing with AIDS meds. And there may be,
soon, an RU-486 network. <Bruce Sterling is publishing a very funny story
about this called Are You For 86?> These are worlds away from traffic in
sleazy recreationals for profit.

<Sounds even PC, ne? Of course, illegal and sleazy shd be clearly
distinguished. How about LEATHER GOODS? Heh: nasty costumery, best advanced
designs. Slings if not arrows of outrageousness. Branks, quirts. Hee.>

<Keep in mind that this is meant to be an involving GAME. Games should be
