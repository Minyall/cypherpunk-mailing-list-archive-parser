I passed over "emoney" et al, because I thought they just sounded
lousy.  Too brute-force... "crydets" I like, though.  BTW, it was
"cryp", like "scrip".  Any further suggestions before the RFD?  :-)

Does anyone have a current contact for Chaum, or maybe know the
fellow, in order to ask him how, well, PKP he's going to be about
the whole thing?
