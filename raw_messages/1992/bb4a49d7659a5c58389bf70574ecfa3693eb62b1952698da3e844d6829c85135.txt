why doesn't someone set up a random number source on a internet host
avalible on a tcp/udp socket? thus if I want some numbers all I have to
do is:

	telnet random_host rand_port > ./random_data_file


the use a pseudo-random generater to select from my random number stream
for a unique random number set.
