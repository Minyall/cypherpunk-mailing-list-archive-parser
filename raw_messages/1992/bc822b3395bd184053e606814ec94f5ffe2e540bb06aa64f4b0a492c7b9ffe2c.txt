Announcing a New Service: "Primes 'r Us"

Your full-service crypto dealer.

-specializing in selling large primes to those gullible enough to use
them
-discounts for really big primes!
-we can sell you random numbers, too...and we promise not to tell what
you bought!

Now you can be spared the hassle of generating primes for your RSA
algorithms. Now you can let "someone else do the driving."

Better yet, Primes 'r Us can handle all your cryptographic
needs...we'll generate your primes, computer your keys, and supply
your random numbers!
