I pulled it down and found it to be a "nice little app" with certain
problems evident from the beginning.  The major bug is **no source code**!!
 How can I trust an app to make my keys?  Why don't I just ask the NSA for
them?

What I would have liked (and expected) was a set of diff (or changed) files
from the PGP 2.0 distribution, and perhaps an extra top-level app-maker
file to put the nice wisiwyg on top.  This would show me an example, and
let me build PGP into other apps that I might build.

The next bug is no email address for Z. Fiedorowicz, so I can't complain to
him directly.

And the third apparent bug (now I haven't used this much yet) is that the
help file offers help for the standard MPW-style command line operations,
but the app is entirely menu-driven.

I hope that ZF doesn't take this as purely negative.  I am sure that he did
a good implementation, and I thank him for doing the work and for providing
a nice gui.  But I would especially like to get the source code (preferably
as minimal changes to the standard distribution so that it is clear that
the same internals are used for each).

Thanks,
Fen
