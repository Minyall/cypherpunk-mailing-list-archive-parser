Hey, this means you!  Have you sent me the name of the software you
use to read e-mail with yet?

Even if you've never posted to the list or replied to any of the
messages, I expect to hear from you.

I not only want to collect a list of names of software, I want to know
which ones are in most common use.

Eric
