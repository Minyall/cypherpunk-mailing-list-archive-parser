I'd like to point out that higher data rates are very very desirable.
One would like to be able to cut a pair of CD's for use as one time
pads in a reasonable amount of time -- at 9600 baud its going to take
a LONG time to do. You can always run multiple units in parallel, but
its probably good to get the cost/bitrate ratio as low as possible.
