Those of us who support the freedom to use cryptography, run PGP, and
write whatever programs we wish (cryptographic and otherwise) should
be aware that the boycott against Lotus and Apple is still on.  By
making PGP run on Macintoshes and with Lotus Notes, we improve the
usefulness of those systems and thereby help our enemies take away our
rights.
