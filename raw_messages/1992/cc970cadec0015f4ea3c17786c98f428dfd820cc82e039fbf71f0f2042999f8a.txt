That would not help in the least.  The person can still send mail 
through your system, they would just not use you as the first hop.

Make sure you don't think 'rm -rf /remailer-logs' actually destroys data.
It merely de-allocates the i-nodes.  You need to know which physical
device the filesystem is on, (let's call id /hdxxx) and then do
'cat /dev/null > /dev/hdxxx' which overwrites with zeroes all data
on that partition.  For that reason it may be preferable to keep all
such information opn a filesystem of their own, so you don't have to
destroy much other data along with it.

If you use swapping or paging, you need to clear out those devices
too, and then turn the machine off to remove all data in RAM.
