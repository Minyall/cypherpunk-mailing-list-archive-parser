Let me continue to be a broken record.  Cryptography is all economics.

You want unconditional security, you pay.  Period.  Sometimes it's
worth it, sometimes it's not.  It is not up to the cryptographer to
make the economic judgement, it is up to the user.

This idea of "delays" providing security for a mix is a common, but
incorrect, notion.  I don't think Marc is incorrect about this here,
merely unclear.  In a well used mix system, the latency time to
accumulate ten messages would be only a few minutes.

It is the reordering of the output messages with respect to the input
that provides mix security.  Any delay in merely a consequence of the
time to collect.
