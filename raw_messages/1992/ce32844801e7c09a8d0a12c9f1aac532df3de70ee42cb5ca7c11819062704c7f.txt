This is a test of my new anon-remailer based on Hal's code.  It does not
yet feature pgp (pgp is having a hard time compiling on soda, but that
will change soon...)

To use it, just use the Anon-To: field in the header and mail
to hh@soda.berkeley.edu

There will soon be an even fancier remailer at soda (and not running out
of my account).  Details as they become available.

sincerely,
nobody
