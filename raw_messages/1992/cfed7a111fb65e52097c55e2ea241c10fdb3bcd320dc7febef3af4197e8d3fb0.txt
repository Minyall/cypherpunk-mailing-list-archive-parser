Dean:
>Are there other ways to handle sending to multiple receivers?

1) You can send it to a service which copies the message and resends
it as many times as you need.  Or send it yourself.

2) You can have the multiple recipients each share a key and let them
trust each other.  (Not recommended for the paranoid).

3) You can use a secret sharing system which is tied to a private key,
such that revealing the secret allows for the derivation of the
private key.  The secret itself is a different private key.  (I'm not
up on the details of these schemes.)
