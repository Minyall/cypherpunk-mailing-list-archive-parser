No.  The patent law prohibits anyone from "making, using, or selling" 
anything covered under the patent.  Selling it makes it more likely
that the patent holder will come after you, as they have a greater
chance of getting some money from you.

I am not a lawyer, I am sure someone here can explain all this in
greater detail, or correct me if I'm wrong.
