not quite.  you need something like

  dd if=/dev/null of=/dev/xxx bs=verybig conv=sync

this will zero out every block on the disk.  but this is overkill --
why not just apply this technique to the individual logs, zeroing
out their data blocks?

ps:  is it certain that zeroing out the data blocks thoroughly destroys
the data?  i've heard that a "shadow" of some sort may remain.
