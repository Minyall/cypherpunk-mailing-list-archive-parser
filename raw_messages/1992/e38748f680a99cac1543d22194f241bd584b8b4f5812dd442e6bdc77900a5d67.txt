[ a different way ]

Before we consider splitting the list, we should ask whether there are
a significant number of people who would take less than all of the
sublists.  I really don't know.  If the purpose is just to provide a
way to know what "kind" of message you're about to read, we could use
a "tag" the way sci.v-w does, if we find this necessary.  I personally
don't object to this kind of list volume.
