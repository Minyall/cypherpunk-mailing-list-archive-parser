After reading the details of that (formerly) secret back-room agreement
between NSA and SPA, I don't think I'll *ever* trust a commercial
encryption package, especially one for which source code is unavailable
for scrutiny.

I've learned an important lesson in this business. You can never depend on
someone else to ensure your privacy. You have to do it yourself.
