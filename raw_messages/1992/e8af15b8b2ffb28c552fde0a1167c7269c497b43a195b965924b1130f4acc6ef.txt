Pardon, but isn't 2600 magazine a magazine by crackers for crackers?
2600 is named after frequency of the disconnect tone used in blue
boxes, isn't it? What I'm afraid of is that I will get confused with
one of them -- I'm not sure they are necessarily being misrepresented.

The tragedies come when idiots raid Steve Jackson Games and sieze
copies of "Cyberpunk" instead of shutting down the infants breaking
into TRW. Blurring the distinction between hackers and crackers is the
last thing we need.
