I agree 101% -- I'd rather have a "bad" system in place, with people
asking for a good one (and roundly complaining about the short-sighted
implementors :-) than to sit and wait until we can implement the
"right" system.

I'd much rather have email users want privacy and rag about their
compromised system. Even a relatively poor one buts some substantial
blocks into routine bulk monitoring of traffic...

As frequently happens, the real problem is not technical.
