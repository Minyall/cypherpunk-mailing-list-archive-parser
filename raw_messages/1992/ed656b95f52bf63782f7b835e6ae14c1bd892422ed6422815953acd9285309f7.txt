I can suggest a way to "distribute" a one time pad, even though the 
people never meet.  Just agree over the phone on which CD ROM to use,
and some forumula for an offset into the CD ROM.  You might want to
throw away some of the data to make the bit stream less regular, but
with 600 meg, who cares?  Keith Henson
