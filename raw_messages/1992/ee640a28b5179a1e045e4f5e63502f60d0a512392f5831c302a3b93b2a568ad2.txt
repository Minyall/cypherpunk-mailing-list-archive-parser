Hal Finney, Tom Jennings, Eric Hughes, and others are working on
solutions to the "ease of use" problems I cited in my posting.

This is a major drag, destroying the feedback loop of reading mail and
responding to it immediately. And, as Hal alludes to, it requires
extra stuff, like PERL scripts, which complicate matters.

Here's hoping. Several people claim to be working on a real Mac port.
(I thought the idea someone had of doing it inside a HyperCard stack
was a good one..HyperCard supports a CLI and so could run PGP, and
HyperCard newsreaders exist, so in perhaps the two could be united.)

Zimmerman's PGP has spurred people to think about the many practical
issues of P-K crypto...authentication systems, keyrings, user
interfaces, and so on. This alone is a major step forward.
