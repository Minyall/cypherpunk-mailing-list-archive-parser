(Hi Efrem!)

Yes but. The ole "chilling effect". Everyone talks about ENCRYPTION
and SECURITY, what I want is PRIVACY.

You can have privacy today, but if you have to sneak around, if
privacy is not the background assumption, it gravely limits your
ability to live and act freely.

Yes, you will always be able to find co-conspirators, but it would be
a weak version of the world in which we could presume privacy to
begin with.
