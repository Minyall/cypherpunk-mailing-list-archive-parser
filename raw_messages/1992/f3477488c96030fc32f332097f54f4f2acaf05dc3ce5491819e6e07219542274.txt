Re: tying voter and crypto registration issues togther.

An excellent idea, if both succeed.  But since voter registration is
already a partisan issue, tying crypto registration to it make crypto
a partisan issue.  And once you've made it a partisan issue, you've
lost, fundamentally.  

The way to succeed on any issue is to avoid polarization along party
lines.  One should not assume that there will be automatically a large
opposition.
