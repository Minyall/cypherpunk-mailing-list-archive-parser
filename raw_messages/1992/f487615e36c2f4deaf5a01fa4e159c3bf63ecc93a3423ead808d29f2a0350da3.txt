I'm impressed. Maybe in 2-3 months this'll all shake out a bit, with a
Mac version (rumored to be in beta), more "push-button" PGP systems,
etc.

By the way, Tom has generously agreed to talk about PGP, mailers,
FidoNet, etc., at our Crypto session at Hackers. (I'll be sending out
a more complete status report soon.)

(Also, I have changed the last line of my .sig to reflect my current
unwillingness to mail my PGP key to all of those who are asking for
it. Hopefully this will soon change.)
