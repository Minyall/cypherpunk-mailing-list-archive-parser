I would note that even the current remailers can double as
mail-sorters to sort your crypto mail into different bins.  This lets
you just peruse them once a day, and keeps your higher priority mail
separate.  I like this solution because more people will then have
built-in remailers.  Right now it only is set up for UNIX, but the
ideas can be reproduced elsewhere.
