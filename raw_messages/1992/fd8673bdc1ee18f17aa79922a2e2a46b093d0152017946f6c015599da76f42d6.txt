Hugh's comments brought up a idea to me.

RFC 822 is the standard for the format of Internet mail messages.
Anybody interested in the remailer should eventually read this thing.

In it there is already a standard header field "Encrypted."  It
accepts two optional arguments, a decryption type and an identifier
(say, for key lookup).  So we have a way of automatically telling
encrypted message without doing pattern recognition on the body.

I propose a couple more header fields.  "Digest" for signed message
digests.  "Key-Mgmt" for the distribution of new keys and key
compromise certificates, i.e. for automatic key distribution.

What else do we need to make a fairly automated crypto mail system?

Eric
