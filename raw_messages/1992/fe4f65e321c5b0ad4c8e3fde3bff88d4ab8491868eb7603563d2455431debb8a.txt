If portability was a problem, the Mac would certainly be an answer.

Howabout actually trying to be Real Programmers and writing Real Software,
like the folks who did all the work that you are now benefiting from?
Instead of writing dead-end software that will only live on one platform?
I know it isn't the Macintosh Way, but you might learn something.

The last thing PGP needs is an installed base of Mac users who are
always stuck three revs back because they forked off their own wierd
version and couldn't upgrade when the rest of us do.
