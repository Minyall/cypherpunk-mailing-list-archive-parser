Factoring is only one method.   

Case in point: solving the game of Go has been proven to take
exponential time *and* exponential space.  An encryption algorithm

P.S.: I'm installing procmail over here...get version v2.91 (I fixed a segv
in v2.61 [on SunOS] yesterday and should have just picked up the newer 
version first.)
