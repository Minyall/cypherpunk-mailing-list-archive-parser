I say lets get tattoos. If you _really_ are committed than
you won't have any problems with this. 

Seriously, it is possible to get fake tattoos printed up
with your design. I suggest either the classic heart with
the word "Freedom" or "Privacy" replacing "Mom". They should
last several days and they could be cheap enough to give
out for grins.
