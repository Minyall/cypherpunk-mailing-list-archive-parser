I, too, aspire towards anarchy, but I don't ignore the tools around me. 
Not voting in today's society is a cop out.  It is most certainly not
perfect, and the choices suck, but it remains one of the major voices you
have today in the world.

Anarchy works best when people are informed.  Education is key.  Simply
bad-mouthing other's works is not giving people a choice to decide which of
two views they feel are better.  Rather, it just fuels the fires of apathy
(that the governemnt have been fanning for so long).

Cypherpunks are trying to change the world.  Sounds like you're just going
to whine about it.  Positive action will always be more effective.  And
better received.
