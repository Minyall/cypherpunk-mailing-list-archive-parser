Essentially this is correct, but as Phil Karn already pointed out... spread
spectrum is easy to de-spread.

However, Motorola has a cordless phone called the Secure Clear phone that
operates at 46 to 50 MHz (standard cordless phone freqs.) that has 
"encryption" between the handset and the base.

After calling motorola I am not impressed... they use frequency inversion.
Their support person stated that the goal is to "stop casual eavesdroppers 
that might use baby-monitors or police scanners."  Which is fine and good.
I know, from personal experience, the problems that can arise from cordless
telephones being monitored and the information used against a person.

The Motorola and Cincinatti Microwave phones can help with the casual listeners
that are out there (and there are quite a few of them!), but neither will
stop an interested party with resources to spare.  :)
