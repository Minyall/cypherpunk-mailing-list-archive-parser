From what I gather CELP takes about 10 to 15 MIPS and LPC takes
somewhere under 5 MIPS on DSP chips.  Instructions including
fixed point multiplies and accumulations (not counting divisions).
Thats quite a load for a 68020 to bear and still do encryption
and communications isnt it?

I have been working on an encrypted link protocol,  I have
written a unix end (w/ sockets for debugging) as well as
some prototype amiga ends (nothing nice yet).  It is basically
a term program with an encrypted mode built in.  I have released
the unfinished but operational unix end so far (link.tar.Z)
but have been too pressed for time to work on it lately.

I am also working with a DSP chip and plan to implement LPC
at bandwidths of about 2000 bps.  This will be low quality
(less than toll quality, but "good enough" for..  well for
me :)
I hope the end product will be reproduceable for under $50.
(I am using the ADSP 2105 DSP microcontroller which offers
10 MIPS for about $12)

Someone has mentioned that there is a ZYXEL chip that has
CELP built in to it,  this might be a faster way to go,
does anyone have more details?


I plan to incorporate the two when I am finished to allow
encrypted voice between two endpoints,  and hopefully
also over some networks (were delay time doesnt cause too
much problems,  long distances over packet switching
might not work so nicely).

progress:
  I have developed and implemented the protocol engine of
the link protocol and written a unix end.

  I have started assembling (but not programming) the DSP
board,  I plan later to add on-board d/a and a/d but
for the time being I will be importing samples from the
amiga, and retrieving LPC coded data.


I am encouraging other people to use my protocol engine
and incorporate it into terminal programs.
