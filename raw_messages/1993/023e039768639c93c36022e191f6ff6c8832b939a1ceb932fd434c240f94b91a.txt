I hear concern over privacy and also over erasure of White House tapes.
I pose the following question: Should an institution have the right
to private communication? Is the White House an institution?
Notice that I say "should" not "does".
Which sort of world would you rather live in. I have mixed feelings.
If we say that all computer communications should be accessible to courts
then the effect will be to displace some communications from computers.
