	On a related note, the current maintainer of the loop file
system patches for Linux has released the latest version, which
includes DES encryption support (as I understand it, the code lets you
mount a file as a file system, and just happens to have support for
applying a function to the file... and the patches as released support
specifying a DES key at mount time.) It's a start. Patches are on
tsx-11.mit.edu and nic.funet.fi (ie. outside the US -- the maintainer
lives in Switzerland :-)
