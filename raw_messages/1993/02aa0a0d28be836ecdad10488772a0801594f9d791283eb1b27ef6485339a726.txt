OK, now for something completely different:

A few years back, a sculpture was created and presented to the CIA by
an artist who inscribed the base of the work with a cyphertext.  He
refused to tell anyone what it said, but I think he later acquiesced
and told the DCI.  Has anyone heard anything more about this?  Was
the cypher cracked?
