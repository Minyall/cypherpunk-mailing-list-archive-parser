To all of those interested in the cypherpunks hardware list:

I apoligize for the delay- I expected to have it on-line by now.  It is
really close to running, I'm just getting some errors from the ListProc
software that my SysAdmin is ironing out right now.

It should be running within 24 hours.

later,
-john.
