I always encrypt stuff when I send it to the remailers. I always encrypt to myself along with the remailer, in case I need to look at the message again. But since trying to decrypt a message reveals the id's of the keys that can decrypt it, this reveals information about the sender of the message that wouldn't be available if I only encrypted to the remailer.

A partial solution - I generated a new key pair to use for the encrypt-to-self function (a nice short one). I put some meaningless nonsense in the id, so anyone who observes my message on its way to the remailer will no know it is from
