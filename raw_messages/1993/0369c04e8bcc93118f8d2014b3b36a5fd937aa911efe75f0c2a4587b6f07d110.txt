I was just thinking.  My roommate mentioned that he saw an ad for 
a service available in europe.  They send you an 8mm tape evey week
that has all the USENET traffic on it.  I was thinking that a large 
corporation thinking of hiring me (or you, you just never know!) could
pay some service to scrounge up all the USENET posting you have made for
the last, say, 10 years, and run them through a filter to get a feel for
the nature of the posts (assuming you were too prolific to have the 
job-hunters read _al_ of your posts).

This really scared me, so I think I will start making more frequent
use of the remailers in the future.

Just my $0.02 (revalued to $15.00 with recent inflation)
