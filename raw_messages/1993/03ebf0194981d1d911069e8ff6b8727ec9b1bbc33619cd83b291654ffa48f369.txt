I also find it interesting that, while the President directed that the fact
of access to keys by Law Enforcement Officials should not be hidden from the
public, the fact of access to keys by ithe intelligence community (i.e.
FBI/CIA/NSA) was not to be similarly disclosed.

They probably ran the client at the far end of a 9600-baud straw on a bad
archie day.

A government dork.

I find it more damning that the government basically bought-off AT&T by
promising them contracts; whatever happened to competetive bid? I find it
highly unlikely that the contracts in question are for clipper-based phones;
we already know the government doesn't plan to use clipper technology
itself, since it can be suborned by LEO types.
