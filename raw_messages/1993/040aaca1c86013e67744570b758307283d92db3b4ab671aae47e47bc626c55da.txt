Steven Levy was interviewed on FM91.7 (san francisco public radio, I
forget the call letters) this morning.   My patch cable isnt working for
some reason, or I would have caught it in a ulaw file.

I don't know the name of the show, or if they will rebroadcast it, but
if you're interested, you might try to track it down.

As one might expect, he did a good job of introducing some hard-edge
issues in fairly-mainstream-but-technical media...
