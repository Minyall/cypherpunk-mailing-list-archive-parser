I was not prepared to receive newsgroup mail on a service like AOL. I just
can't deal with it because I can't read it offline and respond with my Point
like I do my newsgroups from UUCP.

Please turn off the flow; stop sending me this.

All I want to know is if this newsgroup can be req from the internet via
UUCP.
