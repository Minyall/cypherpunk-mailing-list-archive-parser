Yes, I did. If hashing doesn't work, you'll have to say why not. It's a
technique that works in most other situations.

As I said, we can tackle this if anyone cares to...it's unclear that
this is an invitation, but assuming it is: hashing gives a first-pass
screening good for every 1/256 calculations, given the assumptions I
stated. For each collision more work is needed...but you haven't invited
that analysis, nor addressed it yourself.

Impractical? Your response to Karl implied that it was *impossible*. If
you wish to apologize to Karl, and say that it is merely "impractical",
then I will agree with you and drop the subject. The expense required
definitely indicates that it is "impractical."

Clearly you are preparing to drop the argument because you sense that
your tactic of flaming didn't work. I welcome the lessening of flames,
so thank you for that. We could use less flames here.
