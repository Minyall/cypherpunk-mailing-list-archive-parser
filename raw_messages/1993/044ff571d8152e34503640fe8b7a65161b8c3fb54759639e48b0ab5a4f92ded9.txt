Does anyone know of a commerical source (or schematics) for a good random
bitstream generator -- something that you hang off of COM1 and read random
bytes from?

Can anyone refute the claim that you can only generate truly random numbers
using hardware?  I recall seeing a proof that totally random numbers could
only be generated by an infinitely large program.
