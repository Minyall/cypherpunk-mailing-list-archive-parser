Cyphertexts: I was thinking, you do your actual comms in a PKS and then
decrypt on disc and then reencrypt same over to OTP with an innocuous
covertext stored alongside... oh poo, now of course; I was mistaken.  You
take your PKS cyphertext and generate a spurious OTP covertext from there.

Okay, my error.  Sorry....
