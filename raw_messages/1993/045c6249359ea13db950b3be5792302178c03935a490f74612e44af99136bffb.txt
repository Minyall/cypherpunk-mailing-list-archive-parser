I do not think that any solution which requires deception in order to
work is a good solution for creating a social agreement.

We should implement systems that are upfront about their activity.  We
wish to say "I am protecting the privacy of others, and in doing so I
am protecting my own."  We do not wish to say "Who, me?" and be
roundly disbelieved.
