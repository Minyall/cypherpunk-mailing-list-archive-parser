An idea that I have never used, but was suggested to me by my father, goes
like this:

RING RING

me: Hello

??: Mr. Peter Baumbach, I am calling from ICK inc. to offer you ..

me: Excuse me, but I am busy right now. Could you give me your name and
   home phone number, and I will call you back later?

??: Huh? I can't give you my home number, that's private.

me: But you know my name and number.  This hardly seems fair.
