The secret key on the secring.pgp is IDEA-encrypted... So, it is only
as strong as IDEA, and your passphrase.

To break the security, someone needs to be able to:
	1) Obtain your secret keyring.. This is either watching it
go over the net, reading the file system, borrowing your floppy, or
whatever, and
	2) Obtain your secret passphrase...

Only when both are accomplished can they get to your secret key,
although once they have accomplished #1, they can try to break the
IDEA algorithm...
