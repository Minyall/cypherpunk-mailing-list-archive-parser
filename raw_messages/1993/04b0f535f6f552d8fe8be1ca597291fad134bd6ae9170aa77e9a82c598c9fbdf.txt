This raises a question...  I don't think this has been addressed yet (I
am a bit behind in my mail) and might be worthwhile putting in the FAQ...

If I just dreamed up a new gee whiz "new" cypher, should I post it to the
list for comments, or is this frowned on?  (As it happens, I happen to
have what I **think** is a new approach to cyphering, and the answer to this
question will determine wheter anyone hears about it or not...)

Is there a comprehensive list of short "already been done" types of
cyphers?  (Whether failed or "still" succesful.)  A good book?
