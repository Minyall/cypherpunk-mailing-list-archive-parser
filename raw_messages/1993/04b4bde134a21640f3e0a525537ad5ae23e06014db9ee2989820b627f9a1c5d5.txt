	I like this idea.. How about alt.remail?
	And a header:

::
Request-Remailing-To: remail@extropia.wimsey.com
Error-ID: &DNANC*WHS

	If the message is dropped the remailer posts a note to
alt.remail saying, "Remail message &DNANC*WHS has been dropped." Maybe
some sort of ID-encryption similar to that used in Chaum's digital cash
algorithim could be used for security.

	This would require that the operator of the Fidonet gateway be
cypherpunk-friendly. I think it is best if all modifications/ideas be
made *only* to remailers, for I doubt that we will have much control of
other net-elements.
