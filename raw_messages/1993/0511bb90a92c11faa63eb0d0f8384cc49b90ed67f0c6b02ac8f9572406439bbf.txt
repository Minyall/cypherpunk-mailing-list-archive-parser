I question the legitimacy of ITAR.  There, it is no longer unquestioned.
Which enumerated power of the congress is the president enforcing here?

Raise all possible questions at the earliest convenience.  It is the
responsibility of your adversary, not the court, to argue the otherside.
Justice is supposed to be blind.  Anything else would IMHO be denial of
due proccess, and should be overturned on appeal on those grounds.
