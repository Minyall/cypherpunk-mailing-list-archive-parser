The classic Russian model (late 1800's through the October Revolution) was
to have three-person cells, each of which had one person who knew one
person above them in the hierarchy and someone who knew one person below
them.  This makes for good security as there is no redundant information in
the network and one failure breaks the chain.

I don't have any specific citations in mind, but the Russian history
instructors at A&M might be a good place to start.
