And now for something different regarding crypto:

In studying for my FCC Technician's license I ran across FCC 97.113
(Sub-part 113 of Part 97 of Title 47 Code of Federal Regulations), which
prohibits the use of codes or ciphers to obscure the meaning of a message.

Besides preventing me from using Pig Latin in voice communications, this
*seems* to prohibit the use of any deliberate encryption (as opposed to
compression) of data transmitted via radio, such as the computer packet ->
radio -> Internet gateways.

The data highway may be encryption-tolerant today, but the off-ramps are murder.
