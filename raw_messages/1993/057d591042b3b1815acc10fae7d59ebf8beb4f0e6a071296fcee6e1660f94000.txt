Ok, PKP now effectively has a monopoly. Is an antitrust action 
appropriate?

The timing of this announcement, just after Clipper got set back hard, 
may be significant. It would have raised far fewer suspicions to put the 
license out to bid and then make sure PKP got it. My partner, who rejects 
conspiracy theories out of hand, described the action as "stupid". The 
folks at Meade may be running scared.

The announcement is viewed by some as unnecessarily verifying PKP as a 
previously hidden asset. If someone is overreacting, perhaps those 
fighting for freedom are getting to them.

Doug
