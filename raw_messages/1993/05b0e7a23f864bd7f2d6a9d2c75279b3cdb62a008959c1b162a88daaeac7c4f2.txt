John Markoff regularly writes good and informed articles that he has
clearly researched (if that's the right word) by reading usenet and
possibly lists like this one.  Yet I've *never* seen the guy post.  John,
if you're reading this, drop me a line to say hello just so I have your
email address, in case I ever want to mail you something.
