Yes, but they are not trying to gain any media attention.  If the CPSR
or EFF is the main media presence, then fine; the role of cypherpunks
is to write code and spread memes.  The only downside I see to this 
approach is that EFF and CPSR are afraid of being critical about
wiretapping in general--that's how their press releases read.  If they 
have a deeper agenda, it doesn't show.

The attention getting name *could* be used for certain kinds of 
media and then branching off with pointers to EFF and CPSR would
be a good strategy.
