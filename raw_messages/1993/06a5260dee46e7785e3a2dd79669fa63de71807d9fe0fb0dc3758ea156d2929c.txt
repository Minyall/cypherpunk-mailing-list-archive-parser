	I'm not good at perl, so I can't solve this problem on my own. (I
hardly know anything about perl, actually.)

	Upon repeated tests of my remailers, I noticed that if there's
more than one blank line between the header and the header-pasting, then
the pasting doesn't take place. Does this happen with other people's
remailers? How is your script different from mine? How can this be fixed?
