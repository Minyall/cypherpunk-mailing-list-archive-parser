Well, my opinion is - the only way to go is to SHORTEN the transition
period. Switch to all-encrypted e-mail ASAP.

Agreed. Theoretically possible - practically infeasible. Plus imagine
message size... Plus it depends on how clever a scanner-program can
be - if eavesdroppers have enough CPU power, they could check for
the "validity" as well, i.e. right word sequences, not just
amount...

Again, it will, or will not work, depending on how smart the scanning
program is. There's no reason why it can't detect, that your letters
don't form valid English (German, Swedish, Arabic, whatever) words,
*or* the words don't form valid sentences...

I repeat - the surest way is to get over the hump sooner.
