This is a vague hint that Clipper development is not going quite as
planned -- delayed at least 2 quarters (half year!). I sure wonder what
is going on in the trenches. All you Mycotronx employees out there,
feel free to post anonymously :)

I just got off the phone with someone at AT&T Surety Communications, the
date given for availability of clipper chips for inclusion in products
is  1st quarter '94 (January).  The previous date was 3rd quarter '93
(September), which was obviously missed.  The date originated with a
U.S. government agency.

Will the date get further out still?

[I got confirmation Mykotronx is unhappy about the delay]

{ I know some people who might be happy .. djf}

For those not willing to wait, you can purchase Telephone Security Devices now,
and for an extra $100 you can get a free upgrade to the Escrow Encryption
Standard latter.  Any more delays and I might not bet on it.  The existing
nongovernment TSDs used a Type IV proprietary encryption algorithm and NOT
DES.

(I'll wait for January before ordering a pair)
