A little over a month ago, I called Mykotronx and asked for information
about the Clipper chip. Their response was vague: we're working on some
ap notes, but they're not ready yet.

I called back today. The person who answered the phone put me on hold for
a minute, then came back and told me she had spoken to the VP of
engineering and that the ap notes would be ready in four weeks.
It looks like Clipper has really been put into high gear.

When they are ready, I'll try to get them and post the interesting
stuff here.  -- MikeIngle@delphi.com
