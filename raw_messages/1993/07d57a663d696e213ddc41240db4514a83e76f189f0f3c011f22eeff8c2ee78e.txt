     I think you're confusing pseunonymous with anonymous.  The goal is to
send data somewhere WITHOUT A TRACE as to where it came from.  If you used a
single e-mail address, [someone] could track it down, watch for logins, and
trace the line.  If you used MANY e-mail addresses it would clog the net..
remailers seem to be the way to go these days.  TTFN!
