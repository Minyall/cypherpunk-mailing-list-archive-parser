I saw their package at Fry's last weekend.  It has a double DES
mode too.  It seems to have only manual encrypt/decrypt.  The right
way to do it is have a device driver do it for you (say, a 
Mach user level pager for a crypto disk).


	   Data Encryption
           Standard or RSA Data Security Inc's standards are not secure
           because their basic algorithms have been given to the
           National Security Agency. VinCrypt's source code will not
           be passed around,

Great spin, but not much more than spin.
