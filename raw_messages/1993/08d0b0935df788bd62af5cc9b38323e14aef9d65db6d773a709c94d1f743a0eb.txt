	cs60a-qu@cory.eecs.berkeley.edu

Policy:
	At this point I log everything and delete it daily, manually.
This will change, RSN. (It was for debugging purposes.) I will change
it so that the archive.* files are not created. (By editing the
maildelivery file.)
	It's run on two school systems, and netcom. The cory account
will disappear at the end of the semester, but I will hopefully be
able to have that mail forwarded to sameer@netcom, and once I get my
semi-permanent class account next semester I'll try to get stuff
forwarded to there.
	Soon I will have linux running on my roommate's computer with
a net connection via UUCP (Hopefully SLIP eventually) and I'll run a
remailer there, under my physical control.
