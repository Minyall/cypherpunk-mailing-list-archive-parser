I have been out of town for the last week, so I missed some CP mail.
It looks like some good things are happening with remailers, though.
Kudos to Karl, Sameer, and the others for their work!

I have received many messages to my remailer in the last week which
came from remail@tamsun.tamu.edu, which were PGP-encrypted apparently
in an effort to get my remailer to send them.

They did not work, though, because there was no "Encrypted: PGP" header
to trigger the remailer's decryption.  This can be arranged by
creating the message something like this:

========================================================
::
Request-Remailing-To: hfinney@shell.portal.com

::
Encrypted: PGP

- -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
<rest of message>
- -----END PGP MESSAGE------
========================================================

This would then be sent to remail@tamsun.tamu.edu.

I don't know whether the multiplicity of such erroneous messages is
just due to one person stubbornly re-trying, or whether there is an
error in one of the new programs for creating chained remailer messages.
