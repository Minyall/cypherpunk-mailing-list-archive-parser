	For exactly this reason, I don't think that this is a very good
idea. The discussion here started as a search for a way to make
encrypted data not look like encrypted data. (Once it becomes illegal).
If encoding in LSBs becomes a famous technique, then once data
encryption becomes illegal searching the LSBs will become standard
procedure for that data cops.
