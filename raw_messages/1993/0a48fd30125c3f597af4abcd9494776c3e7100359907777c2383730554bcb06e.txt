That sounds like the Inslaw case, in which their "PROMIS" (for
"Prosecution MIS") software was allegedly stolen/taken by government
agencies for various uses. 

There are many tangled threads to this story: the murder of Danny
Casolaro, back doors, Ed Meese, Cabazon Indian Reservation, Dr. Earl
Brian, Contra arms deals, Iraqgate, Israel, NSA SIGINT facilities,
Elliot Richardson, and on an on.

This story comes up frequently and was described here in Cypherpunks
some months back by Kelly Goen, if I remember correctly.

I won't recap the story tonight. Check out alt.conspiracy for some
discussion (though you may have to wait a while for this topic to come
back around).

My opinion: There's something to the stories.
