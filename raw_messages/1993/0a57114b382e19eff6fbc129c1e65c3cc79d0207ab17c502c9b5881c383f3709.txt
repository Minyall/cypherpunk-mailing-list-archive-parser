like i said, with care.  just as i have to be careful that my sys admin
isn't snoopy.  but that's not my point.  if you do exercise care, you
can send anonymous mail, just like you can communicate anonymously with
other media (if you are careful).  remailers institutionalize anonymity,
nothing more.

if your point is that dishonesty makes privacy necessary, i agree.
but i do *not* agree that total honesty makes privacy unnecessary.
