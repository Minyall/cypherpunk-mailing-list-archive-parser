I think someone else brought this up:

Write the whole skeleton with the proper crypto hooks and then
distribute it without the crypto library.  You could replace it with
xor, or a crc, or something.  The crypto library could be distributed
more carefully.

After all, with pgp etc. source, it isn't the crypto that's hard, it's
the OS interface code.

I'd love to have such a thing for Linux BTW...
