Well, first - I believe DES was designed with 64 bit keys in mind,
and then due to some technical (unspecified :-) reasons he key was
shortened to 56 bits (and 56-bit version was submitted to NBS).

While longer key indeed offers little protection against attacks
like differential cryptanalysis - it's hard to argue that it can
blow brute-force attack out of the water...  And I'd be somewhat
more concerned about an adversary cracking my DES-encrypted mail
via brute force, than tapping my channel and collecting  2^45 of
plaintext-ciphertext pairs to deduce my  DES [randomly selected]
key (:-).

N'est pas?

Well, of course a government (any government :-) could build such a
thing... After all, don't they get all those tax money? (:-)
