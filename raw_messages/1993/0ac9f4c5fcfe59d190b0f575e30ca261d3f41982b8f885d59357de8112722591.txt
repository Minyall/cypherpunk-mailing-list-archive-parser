Considering what we've currently had to rely on, charity seems like
as good a place to start as any.  Perhaps when escrow clients operate
like wais in conducting a search of the available sources, and utilizing
feedback to reduce noise and identify likelihoods of correct decryption,
or perhaps this would never work at all.  Monitoring would still be
necessary.
