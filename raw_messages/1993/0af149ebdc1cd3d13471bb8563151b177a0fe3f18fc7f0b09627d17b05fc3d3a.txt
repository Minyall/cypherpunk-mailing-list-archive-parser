Hi Folks,

	The following is NOT a joke.  It is a real service being
provided by President Clinton.  If you feel you have something to  
say,
send them a letter.  I heard they will reply to most messages.

 From: The White House <75300.3115@compuserve.com>

          As you know, this is the first time in history that the
White House has been connected to the public through electronic mail.
We welcome your comments and suggestions for ways to improve your
Public Access E-mail program.
