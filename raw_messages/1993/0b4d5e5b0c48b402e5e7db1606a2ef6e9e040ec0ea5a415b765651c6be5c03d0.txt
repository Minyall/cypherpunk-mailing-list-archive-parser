Sorry for the bad permission bits.
There is a flat ASCII version of the paper by anonymous ftp:
   netcom.com:pub/Silk/DSR1.txt
It will soon move to
   netcom.com:pub/joule/DSR1.txt
 
It is also available by anonymous ftp at
 
netcom.com:/pub/joule/DSR1.ps.gz and netcom.com:/pub/joule/DSR1.rtf.gz
