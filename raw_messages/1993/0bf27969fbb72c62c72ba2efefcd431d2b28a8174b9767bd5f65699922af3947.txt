    Hi.  Just picked this up from alt.dcom.telecom.  Doesn't it seem like
an illegal invasion of privacy to do something like this?  Or maybe
I just don't have the whole picture. Anyway, here it is:


>GOING FROM A TO B.  You're in your car.  You're at A.  You want to go
>to B.  You have no idea where B is.  So you go to a Sprint payphone
>and use its TeleMap service, give the telephone number of your
>destination, and receive precise directions. (Tampa Tribune 9/12/93
>B&F 5)  Of course, if you have a wrong phone number, that may be a
>problem.  You may go to C, wherever that is.
