I've spent the summer working on a SMTP/POP client that runs under
MS-Windows.  There are two ideas behind it. First, widespread acceptance of
global communication will require that mass market user don't have to learn
vi/emacs/... and Second, once the email composing and reading is done on a
local, controlled PC, we can trivially pipe messages in and out of PGP,
RIPEM, or your favorite encryption algorithm. This second part will allow
folks to send all their mail encrypted, which will not only spread the
word, but hurt traffic analysis.

But, I need help. I've got all the front-end stuff working, and can handle
the SMTP/POP protocols. But I can't get Windows to talk reliably with a
raw async link. (I don't want to require SLIP or PPP, as lots of sites
are too clueless to offer it.)

I need a robust communications library. It has to do as well as possible
given an inherantly inreliable link. I've bought three commercial sibraries,
and none work.

Cypherpunks write code. I've been trying. If someone wants to help,
please reply, and we can work out detailed specs of the API I have in mind.
