Why write your own problem?  Get the sendmail sources from any number
of ftp sites, modify them a little, recompile, and use your own
sendmail instead of your OS's for delivery.  Then, you can keep
limited logs for debugging in a place you can delete them when you're
done.  The only catch is that running as you instead of root, you
can't listen on port 25.
