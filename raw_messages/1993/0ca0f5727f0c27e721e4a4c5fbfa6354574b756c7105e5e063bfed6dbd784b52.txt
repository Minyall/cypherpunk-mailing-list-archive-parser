I've got a working version of a JPEG steganograpy program.  It uses
modified cjpeg/djpeg sources to stick arbitrary files in JPEG images
and then extract them.  It needs testing.

The files are in ftp.cs.ubc.ca:pub/pickup/jsteg.  There is a copy of
the JPEG-v4 sources (or use your own), a context-diff of the source
changes (use "patch -p0" in the directory above the sources), and a
test ".jpg" file.  Assuming everything works correctly, running

  djpeg -crypt filetoread.txt miyazaki.jpg > /dev/null

will extract the steganized text into the file "testout.txt" and dump
the PPM file.  (The extracted text should be an exact copy of the
"USING" file in the JPEG-v4 distribution.)  To steganize a file, use

  cjpeg -crypt filetohide.txt image.ppm > image.jpg

or replace "image.ppm" with "-G image.gif", etc.  If "cjpeg" reports
that it's unable to inject the file, compress the file or use a higher
"-Q" parameter.  In general, the stegfile needs a final JPEG file
that's at least eight times larger.
