Yes, however, this isn't too feasable.  There's a great quote somewhere in
Don Lancaster's Secret Money Machine II that goes along the lines of a
bit of text being translated to Russian and back which illustrates just how
(in)effective these things can be:

IN: The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
OUT:The vodka was great, but the mean is rotten.
