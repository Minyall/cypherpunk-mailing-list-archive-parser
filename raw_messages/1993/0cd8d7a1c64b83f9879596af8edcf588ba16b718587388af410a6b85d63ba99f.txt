This letter is not intended to start a flame war about patent rights,
licensing, or anything similar.  Reply directly to me.

I've spoken with Jim Bidzos, president of RSADSI, about this very
issue recently.  They have a very easy to understand principle that
governs the use of their patents.  I am rephrasing it; at no time was
this actually spoken.  It's very simple: "If you make money with it,
so do we."  Their licenses are not out of line with patent licenses
generally (and not just computer-related ones).

If you make public domain software and use it for personal use, RSADSI
will not come after you.

If you make commercial software and sell it without obtaining a
license, they will after you.  If you use the software as a
"mission-critical" part of your business and do not obtain a license,
they will come after you.

There are grey areas between these two poles.  I do not address them.
