The problem with this is that public-key encryption is slooooow. I
never thought of having a fixed key for each user; even the STU-III
ignition keys get reloaded every so often.

Until I implement DH key exchange, caller & callee must have some way
to agree on a key. This is far from ideal, but (based on PGP's RSA
implementation on my Mac) I don't think RSA would cut it.

One possibility is to use a PGP-style keyring; the caller can encrypt
the session key with the callee's pubkey and transmit it. I think that
this is less secure than DH, though.

More comments are way welcome! Thanks.
