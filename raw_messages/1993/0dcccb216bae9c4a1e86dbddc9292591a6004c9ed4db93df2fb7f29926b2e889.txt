It would seem that both the sender and reciever need to be exactly
syncronized to within 1/4 of a bit for this to work.  Since voice
data requires about 64Khz, if you spread this by a factor of 32
(for a scrambling frequency of 2.048Mhz) this would mean the sender
and reciever would need to be synced to well within 500ns of each
other.

Isn't this a bit difficult?  How do they do it?
