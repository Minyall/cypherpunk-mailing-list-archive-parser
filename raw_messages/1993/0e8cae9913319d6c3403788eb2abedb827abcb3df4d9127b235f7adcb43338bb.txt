I may be able to help out in a DOS project (though I seem to be migrating  
quickly to Linux as it stabilizes...)  Perhaps the GPL'ed program term  
would be useful in serial multiplexing applications.  It's quite nice for  
Unix boxes, letting all kinds of streams coexist (even redirecting TCP/IP  
ports over serial without the overhead of SLIP/PPP).  I believe I've  
heard someone on comp.os.linux or gnu.misc.discuss talk about hacking DES  
into term, so it sounds doable.  I'm not sure how much the code assumes  
Unix serial device handing, but I'll have a look at the code.
