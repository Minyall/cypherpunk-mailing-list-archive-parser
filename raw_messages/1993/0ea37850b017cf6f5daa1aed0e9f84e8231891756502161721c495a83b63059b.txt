 Although the material is interesting, my mailbox is getting flooded..
perhaps the mail should be compiled into a newsletter or 'zine format
and mailed monthly. Phrack magazine is sent with an automated mailer..
If you want more information.. send requests to root@stormking.com.

 Please seriously consider this, the bulk of mail vs. my time to deal with 
the volume of little messages is limited, and it is much better if it's a monthly o r weekly newsletter which I can download and browse at my leisure. It really is not much work to have a program dump all the mail into a file, then another program send out the file monthly.
