Netnews group "comp.security.announce" seems to be the product of CERT.
About once a week, on the average, they post something relating to
the security of some specific operating system. The few postings that
I have seen seem directed to the sys-op (typically Unix) regarding
some common practice with security implications or often holes in
the defaults that some system comes with.
What I have seen there is technical and not political.
