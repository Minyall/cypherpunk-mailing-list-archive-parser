Nothing but increased notoriety, and the immediate presumption of guilt in
the minds of many.  "Well, if you don't have anything to hide, then why are
you hiding it, huh?"  Sadly, many people subscribe, consciously or
unconsciously to the sort of thinking that Ed Meese liked to promulgate:
"If they weren't guilty, then they wouldn't be suspects."

Note that nobody is, as far as I know, trying to extract Packwood's diary
by sheer force of arms.
