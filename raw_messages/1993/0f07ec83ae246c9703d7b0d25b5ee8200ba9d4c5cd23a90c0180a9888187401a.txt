True. But the question is, specifically what are you suggesting "all of us"
do right now? When I say specifically, I mean for instance not just
"find out information about XYZ" like you said before, I mean the
"and then what?" part as well. Most of us will probably do our best to
learn whatever we can rather than ignoring the situation. But *then* what?
What's your suggestion?

Besides that, I mean. :-)
