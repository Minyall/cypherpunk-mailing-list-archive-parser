     Hey 'Punks!  I found a kit to build a hardware encryption device.  The 
whole kit costs less than $120 and both partys need one.  There rather slow 
however, the top speed is only 1200 baud.  I found the article on it BYTE 
September '86.  Here's the address of the place that sells the kit
     CCI
     P.O. Box 428
     Tolland, CT 06084

     If anybody does get this kit and trys it out I would be interested in how 
it turns out.  Drop me a line.  Thanks, Michael
