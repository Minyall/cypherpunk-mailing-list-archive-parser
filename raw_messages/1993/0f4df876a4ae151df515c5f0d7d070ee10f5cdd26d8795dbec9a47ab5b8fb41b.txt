I just spoke to Phil Zimmerman on the phone (8/27 about 10am).
He told me he plans to attend the Extropganza tomorrow, and
to use the occasion to hold some kind of press briefing of his just-
announce product "ViaCrypt", a commercial version of PGP.

He asked me to send out this E-mail request for all of you who
know any press people to invite them to attend.

Unfortunately, Phil was unable to tell me exactly when he expects
to arrive.
