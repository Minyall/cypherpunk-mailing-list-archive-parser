If I owned a PC clone or a Mac, I'd be sitting pretty.  If my host machine
was Unix, I'd be fine.  But I'm using an Atari emulating vt100 off a 
VAX 6510.  Is there any help for me?  How can I be a cypherpunk?

I want to be using PGP, but I haven't found it for either machine I'm on.

Any suggestions?
