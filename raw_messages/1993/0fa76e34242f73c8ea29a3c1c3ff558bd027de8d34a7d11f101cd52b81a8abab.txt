	This I find quite interesting... As a guess, if I were to
attempt such monitoring, I would start with a pair of off-the-shelf
modems, but I don't know the details of modern compression (v.42) or
wire encodings to know how easy that would be to make work...
	Anyone have more details on how the tap was accomplished?
