This is completely beyond the scope of Cypherpunks -- this isn't a
list about anarchism, its a list about cryptographic privacy. I'll
gladly suggest a few books for you, though...

"The Machinery of Freedom" by David Friedman (yes, THAT Friedman's son).
"The Enterprise of Law: Justice without the State" by Bruce Benson

Both are likely available from Laissez Faire books, at 800-326-0996.
They have a free catalog. 

Benson's book is a thick, detailed and scholarly work that
concentrates solely on legal and judicial systems. Friedman's work is
a light survey of all sorts of libertarian and anarchist topics, from
monetary systems to a discussion of private judicial practice in
medieval Iceland.

Having presented some references, I suggest we now abandon the topic
of anarchism -- it isn't the purpose of this list. I think its
appropriate that people like me not hide our positions, but thats very
different from discussing them in an inappropriate place. There are
lots of discussion groups on the net for propertarian anarchists to
chat in -- and this is a list for cryptography.
