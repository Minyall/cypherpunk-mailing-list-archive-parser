First off, 'we' ARE involved.  This case is IMPORTANT, and can have far-
reaching consequences for us.  This reminds me of the old story that starts
out 'they came and got the Jews, and I said nothing because I wasn't a Jew...'.

Agreed, it IS important!

The attorneys and other experts looking at this case apparantly don't share
your lack of enthuasism.  Even in the very early stages, the groundwork that
is laid in a case like this is of TREMENDOUS importance to the outcome of
the case, regardless of how long it takes to be resolved.  Frankly, I'm
surprised at your lackadaisical attitude - if you had been involved in the
justice system in this country for any length of time, you'd have realized
that EVERY step taken along the way is IMPORTANT, regardless of how trivial
or unimportant those steps appear now.  Cases involving billions of dollars
have been decided by trivial details.
