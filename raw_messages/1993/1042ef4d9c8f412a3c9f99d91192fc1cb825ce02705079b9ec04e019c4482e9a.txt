What has happened is that the price the consumer sees has gone up.
AT&T used to subsidize local service with long distance service --
this cross subsidy has ended. Local service is not deregulated
anywhere in the U.S., so your friend's study is meaningless.

Long distance prices have dropped dramatically, even taking subsidy
elimination into account. Competition works, George. Fabian socialism
is what doesn't.
