Hi all,
Has anyone apart from me experienced problems with Vesselin's perl
scripts for ELM that came bundled with pgp2.2? I'm running ELM 2.4 pl21,
on a Sparc IPX, and basically, sometimes morepgp works, and sometimes
it doesn't. mailpgp is proving fine. 

Now, I'm no perl wiz, so I can't really dive in and fix it, nor am I
asking for someone to fix it (unless they want to), but it would be nice
to know that it's just not my utter ineptitude...  ;=)
