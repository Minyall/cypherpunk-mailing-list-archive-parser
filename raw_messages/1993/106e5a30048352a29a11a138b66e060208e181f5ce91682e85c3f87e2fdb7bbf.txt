I have found one Usenet Gateway that works with anonymous remailers,
at least for the present.

    group.name.usenet@decwrl.dec.com

For example, to use the Cuperman wimsey remailer to post to
rec.video.cable-tv send a PGP-Encrypted message to:

Remailer <remail@extropia.wimsey.com>
Subject: <code>

[Encrypted message body follows]
To: rec.video.cable-tv.usenet@decwrl.dec.com
Subject: A Pirate Replies

=========================================================================
If you want to make any anonymous posts, I would jump on this quickly,
as I expect this remailer will sooner or later join utexas in blocking
anonymous posts.

I support Edgar Swank's call for the Cyherpunks remailers to support
anonymous posting directly.
