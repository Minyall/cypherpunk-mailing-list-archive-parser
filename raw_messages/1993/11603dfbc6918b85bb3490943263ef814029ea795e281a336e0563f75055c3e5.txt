I'm sorry that "you can't go along" with that, but I'm afraid that you
don't have much choice: it isn't your list. Many of us have gotten
burned out from a number of very long arguments on this list, and
politics was not part of the charter to begin with. If you insist on
discussing it, might I suggest that there are many places where the
discussion would be appropriate, like talk.politics.crypto,
alt.privacy, talk.politics.misc, or many other places?
