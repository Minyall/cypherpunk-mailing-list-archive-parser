Actually, there is a rather old (for the PC) abstraction called FOSSIL
(Fido Opus Seadog Serial Interface Layer ... or so).  It is essentially
an extention/replacement for the BIOS int 0x14 driver.  It is certainly
possible to further extend this for encryption by adding some functions
to the interface.  The two FOSSILs I know of are X00 and BNU - They can
be found in oak.oakland.edu:/pub/msdos/fossil
