This is Peter Hum, a reporter with a major daily newspaper in Canada,
e-mailing all you cypherpunks. Since the talk is flowing about t-shirts and/or
journalists, I thought I would renew my request for help and information.

For now, I'm researching:

1. encryption issues in Canada
2. privacy in Canada
 
I'd appreciate any e-mail, phone calls or faxes with suggestions on
sources, how to proceed, and so on. Confidentiality is assured.

I should mention that I'm an English professor by training and not a
crypto-specialist. I'm also new to the Net (one month on), but I should
add it was the WIRED article, among others, that sparked my interest. 

Hope to hear from you,

Peter Hum
