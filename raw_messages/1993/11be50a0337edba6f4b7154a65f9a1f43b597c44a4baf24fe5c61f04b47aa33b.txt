This isn't precisely what I meant.  What I mean is that, whatever the
source of or type of wires that carry this "data highway" traffic, for the
dominant use and format of it to be modelled on the tired and all but
useless one-to-many format of tv would be disastrous.  I don't care who
builds, it, only what I can do with it.
