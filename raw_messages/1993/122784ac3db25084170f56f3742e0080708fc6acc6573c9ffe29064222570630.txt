Well, I've had dealings with a couple of business clients who refuse
to use freeware PGP it because of 'the shaky legal ground'.  We
explained that as a government agency, we can use PGP legally, and
because (in each case) the business already had rights to use RSA for
their own purposes, there was no problem.  They said if they could buy
it, that'd make it a lot easier to use.  (These same businesses refuse
to distribute FSF/GNU code for similarly vague legal reasons.)
