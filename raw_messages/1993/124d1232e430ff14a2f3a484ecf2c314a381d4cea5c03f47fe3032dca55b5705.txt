Definition?  I have seen not this asserted even by theorem.  Not
surprising, since the statement is patently false.  There are
2^{\aleph_0} finite bit strings, and only \aleph_0 of those are
subsequences of pi.

For those of you without a math background, this means "They all just
don't fit."
