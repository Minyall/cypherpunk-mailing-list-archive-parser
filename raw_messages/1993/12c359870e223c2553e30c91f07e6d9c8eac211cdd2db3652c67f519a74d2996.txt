 Actually, it is a rather typically badly written piece on the so-called
"cyberpunks" and attempts to throw in the buzz words. It is factually
inaccurate in places and the EFF is seeking a retraction for what was said
about it in the article (the author passed 's problem when they asked for
a retraction).
