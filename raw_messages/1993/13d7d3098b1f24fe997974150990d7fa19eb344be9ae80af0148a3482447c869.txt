Haha...  but seriously, I know someone who ran a BBS, and his wife had
Multiple Personalities Disorder.  She has 5 or 6 different accounts on
the system for each of her different personalities.  It was pretty funny
to watch the different persoalities talk on the bulletin boards...most
people did not know who those accounts actually belonged to.

Yeah and I'm a trill currently possessing this body like Dax on DS9 hahaha...


But since you brought up what you call "legitimate" personalities, let
me pose this philosophical question to you: Suppose a human is born
healthy, but with no cerebral functions, ie braindead.  Suppose I am an
old man who is dying, but neurology has advanced to a point where I
could transfer myself to inhabit that body, and live normally
thereafter.  Would that be a legitimate soul?  If true names are linked
to biological entities, what is my true name?  How do you define a true
name?  It's not a trivial question because there are a lot of extropians
who would do that if they had the chance...
