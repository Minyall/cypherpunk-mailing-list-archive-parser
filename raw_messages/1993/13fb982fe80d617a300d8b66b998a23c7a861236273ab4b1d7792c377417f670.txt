I've got a recently good idea for a shirt I've been working on for
a bit, but my funding fell through.

Anyone want to bank an initial run?

fyI, on my recent return from Boston I sat across from a guy wearing a
Secret Service logo'd polo shirt with the acronym 'C.A.T.' on it.
Anyone know what it stands for?  He went to sleep before I could
bother him.
