My apologies to anyone who has tried to use the anonymous remailer at
rebma.mn.org in the past several weeks.  I upgraded the system, and forgot,
apparently, to test out the remailer.  No one reported that the remailer
wasn't working, and it didn't occur to me to test it until today.  I 
imagine that people who weren't successful were experimenters who chalked
up the failure to something they'd done wrong.

It's working again, now.

Here's the PGP key.
