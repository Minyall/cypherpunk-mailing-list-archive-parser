Nobody, when I read the original post I assumed the "we" you're talking
about was 'we, the Cypherpunks.'  I.e., if NSA were truly Evil Incarnate
Central, the Cypherpunks would be fighting "a Valiant War ["We Are Fated
to Lose"]".  For a moment there, nobody, you nearly had me believing
you.  But read the rest of the post, and the above 'slip' becomes much
less interesting:

The NSA is caught up in bureaucracy, so the Cypherpunks need not lose.

Cypherpunks are not fated to lose, because the NSA's attempts are fated
to fail.

If you give me some time, I can contact the author of the original post
-- remail@tamsun.tamu.edu -- and have him post a confirmation of my
interpretation of his original post.
