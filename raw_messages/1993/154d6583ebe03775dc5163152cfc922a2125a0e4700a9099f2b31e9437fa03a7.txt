Well, yeeeeesss... but....

It all depends on the intended target audience. If our users are pretty
sophisticated netfreaks, I agree that the philosophy of the system ought
to be "only do what the user asks for". But if the users are
non-computer-literate people, seeking a source of support and
understanding in this vast mess of e-mail and netnews, I feel they need
and deserve all the hand-holding and safety switches the software can
provide.

So it seems there is room and need for *different* remailers.
