---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Hartford Courant on August 5, 1993 (page b-4) stated that a 21 year
old computer BBS operator was arrested for maintaining a computer
bulletin board that had a bomb making recipe.

Michael Elansky was charged by the West Hartford police with inciting
injury to persons or property - a felony charge - and risk of injury
to a minor.

He was held in lieu of $500,000 bond (in CT the bond for a person accused
of murder is normally $100,000)

Det. Capt. James Gustafson said the case was "sealed" and no information
could be released.

Michal Elansky's father said information from the Anarchists Cook Book
(Available from Paladin Press, P.O. Box 1307, Boulder, CO 80306,
phone 303-443-7250) was on the bbs placed there by person or persons
unknown; it was impossible for his son to keep track of due to the
number of calls to his bbs.

And so, Big Brother now says that passing along information will get
a person 21 years old locked up on a half a million dollars bail, while
accused murderers get out on  100,000 dollars.  The newspaper did not
say if the computer or the files from it were taken.

Can the people who were on that bbs look forward to a "Visit" from
the servants of Big Brother?

Will they be arrested if they downloaded VERBOTEN information?  Will
there be MASS ARRESTS of people who have knowledge that is no longer
permitted?

Time will tell
