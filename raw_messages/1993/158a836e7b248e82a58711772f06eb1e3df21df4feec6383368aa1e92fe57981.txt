One reason I gave out my number is to allow people to ask me specific
questions that refer to how they run their *specific* systems--it may be
that they're not risking ECPA liability, given the particular conditions
they're working under. 

But one think I think sysops need to realize is that ECPA is the *default*
setting.

On some of my interpretations of ECPA, reasonable lawyers may disagree,
but at this point most FIDO sysops who assert that ECPA doesn't apply
haven't read the statute.
