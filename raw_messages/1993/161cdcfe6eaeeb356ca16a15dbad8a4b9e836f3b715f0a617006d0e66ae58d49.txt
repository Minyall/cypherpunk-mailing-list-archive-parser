The point is not to erect insurmountable barriers against anonymous
newbies.  In an environment where 'free speech noise' is a problem,
some barrier to entry should be expected.  The cypherpunks list
already uses one barrier to entry, namely, we use a mailing list
rather than a newsgroup.

Pseudonyms don't come free, neither in time, effort, nor money.

Authentication, in this context, can take many forms.  It could be as
simple as sending a key to the mailing list server.  It could be
developed to require someone to vouch for the pseudonym.  It could
require a sponsor who would read and repost until a separate
reputation develops.

The point is to put a bound on the noise from disrupters both
inadvertent and intentional, not to completely prevent noise.
