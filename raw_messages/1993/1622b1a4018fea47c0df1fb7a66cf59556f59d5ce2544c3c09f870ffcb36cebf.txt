Do the money-laundering laws require reporting all transactions,
or only movement of currency and gold?  Digicash is most like EFT,
which is transmitted encrypted today - does all of that have to be reported,
or only the "real" paper money that backs up the numbers?

As far as using digibanks on Native American territory, most of the
rules restricting Federal control seem pretty flexible when the Feds want
something, and even states can often get away with restricting gambling
on reservations.  Also, the Constitution gives CONgress the power to
regulate commerce with foreign nations, Indian tribes, and between states,
so they can still regulate any interactions between digibanks on
Indian reservations and elsewhere.  (Sigh - the Commerce Clause has been
rabidly overused, but it's written in a way that lets them do nearly anything.)

There's also the issue of tribal law, but most of the tribes are probably run
by small numbers of reasonable people that you can talk to about things,
and you can at least shop around to find them, unlike Federal bureaucracies
which you're stuck with.
