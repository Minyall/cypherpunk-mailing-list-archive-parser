My main goal for cypherpunks is to get people to defend their own
privacy, rather than relying on someone else to provide it for them.
There were several different methods recently mentioned that allow
people to take control of their own email flow.  I would suggest that
all those who would rather have another way of accessing the list do
so on their own computers.

In addition to all the methods for handling mail mentioned before, the
remailer source code includes a rewrite of slocal in perl done by Hal
Finney.  Available from soda.berkeley.edu:pub/cypherpunks/remailer.
