I think you are reading those replies through rose-colored glasses.
They were politely telling you "no way."

Please keep in mind that it is impolite to _impose_ your beliefs on
others, and to punish people that don't believe as you do.  That's
what certain governments that people on the list are concerned about
do.  People don't respond well when forced.  All you will do is
alienate them.

I suggest you offer an incentive for signature use rather than a
penalty for non-use.  For example, the "Quarterly Cookie Quota" (QCQ),
a pledge to send a package of cookies (good ones, too) to a signer
picked at random.  This will cost you $100 a year, less than the
time/$ cost of modifying the mail list software.

Bottom line: Use Carrots, not Sticks.  Using sticks is counterproductive,
especially when you try and use them on ornery jerks like the membership
of this list (humble correspondent included in that characterization).
