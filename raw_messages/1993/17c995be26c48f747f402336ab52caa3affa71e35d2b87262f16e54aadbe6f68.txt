Dear Mr. Ferguson,
 
        Thanks you very much for writing to inform me of President
Clinton's new initiative in telecommunications encryption technology.
 
        I was not aware of this proposal as presented by the new
Administration.  Your letter does reveal that you are very
knowledgeable in the details of the "Clipper Chip".  You have
expressed clearly the impact the "Clipper Chip" technology and program
would have on government and private business.
 
        I will seek more information concerning this new initiative
from the Clinton Administration.
 
        I appreciate being made aware of this proposal and learning of
your specific insights.
 
        With kind regards, I am
 
                            Sincerely,
 
                            /*signed*/
 
                            John Warner

Just say "NO" to the Wiretap (Clipper/Capstone) Chip(s)
   I love my country, but I fear its government.
