Can someone comment on the efficacy of this technique when used in
conjunction with encryption modes other than ECB, and/or with the
simple XOR "pre-scramble" technique?  I agree that it "couldn't hurt",
security-wise, but of course it does introduce a (slight) processing
overhead.  If it introduces no real additional security, I don't see
the point.  (Enlighten me!)

(This for some reason reminds me of the way little kids tie shoes;
they sometimes make enormous knots which, ultimately, are weaker than
a simple bow.)
