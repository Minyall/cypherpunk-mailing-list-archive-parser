the only use that whould  bring is to get us to get more serious about
key extange and to develop easier software for reading/scaning encrypted
messages.  On the other hand it would no benefit us in the way of that
it would not us to get our messages and views to the world.  (Last I
checked this was not a exclusive email list).
