Could somebody please direct me to either an address or ftp site where I
can get the latest pgp-info file?  

I have one from a few months ago.  Just wondering if there have been any
updates.  

The info file I have can be found by "finger zeek@io.com"  

Any help is appreciated.

Thank you,
