Just be sure not to get out of your car -  there are different rules that apply 
to cars without occupants in them, though your state's rules may  vary.

But it's much better to avoid getting to that stage.  Be friendly in your
non-cooperation, and if a hostile-looking  cop wants to see whether your papers are in order, give him your license,  registration, insurance papers, 
*and* your ACLU card ("Don't leave home without it").

As a friend of mine says to cops, "If you've got a legal right to search 
my car, I'm sure you will, but if you need my permission, you don't have it."

Of course, this is no longer really cypherpunks material, just regular punks :-)
