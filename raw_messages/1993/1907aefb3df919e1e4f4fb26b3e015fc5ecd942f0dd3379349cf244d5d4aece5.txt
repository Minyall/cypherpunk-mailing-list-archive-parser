Nope. Not true. Some ADCs digitize with _more_ than the final
resolution and then do rounding or noise-shaping. And ADCs even at the
LSB can still have structure caused by other things, such as the image
itself (a binary image with thresholding will have the "LSB" certainly
not random noise! Q.E.D., by induction.) 

This can give the LSBs in the final product (image, DAT, CD) nonrandom
noise characteristics. This is what we're talking about.

Huh? What if the "processing" is "do nothing"? Why will LSBs be
changed consistently? I must be misunderstanding your statement.

Key generation and sharing (if necessary) is separate from the stego issues.

In various ways, depending on what you're doing. Separate from the
main analysis of stego and image statistics/
