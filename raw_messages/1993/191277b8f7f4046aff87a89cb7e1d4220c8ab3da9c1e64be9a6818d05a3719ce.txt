If I remember coorectly it's KerberosV uses an MD5 hash of /dev/mem.
This covers everything reported by "ps", "netstat", "iostat",
"vmstat", "pstat", and a lot more kernel stuff that's very difficult
to predict for any machine that's up and running on a busy network
for more than a few hours.

Still, probably not 128 bits worth of entropy.
