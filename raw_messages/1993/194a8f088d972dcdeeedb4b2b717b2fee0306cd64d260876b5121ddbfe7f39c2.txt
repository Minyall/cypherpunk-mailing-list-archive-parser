I've arranged so that the pub/cypherpunks/incoming directory will
accept uploads now.  So if you have stuff to send, please ftp it to
that directory rather than using e-mail.  Of course, if you don't have
ftp access, please continue to use email.

For those of you who tried this before, the problem was that the
wuarchive ftpd that the system was running needs a line in its
configuration file to say that uploads are peritted in a directory.
