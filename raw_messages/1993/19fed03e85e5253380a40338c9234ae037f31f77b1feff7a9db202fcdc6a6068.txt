Data may become a basic service, some day, but the market is not
ready for it today.

I am against forcing companies to offer products that no one wants.
(no one = a major part of there market).

Current efforts like PSI IP over Cable and $500 Hayes modems that
can talk 230+ kbits per second (w/ compression|V.Fast) will provide
plenty of cheap networking for those who want it.
