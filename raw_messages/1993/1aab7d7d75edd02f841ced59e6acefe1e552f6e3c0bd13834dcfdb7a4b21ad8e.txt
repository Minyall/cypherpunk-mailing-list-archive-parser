Hey, y'all...

The response to the proposal for the punk hardware list was overwhelming (or
at least far beyond expectations).  I will get it set up hopefully on Monday,
or Tuesday at the latest of next week.  I just have to get my sysadmin to
get moving and set of the list on the ListProcessor.

There is a minor problem, which I want to spend very little time worrying about,
concerning the name of the list.

All I've come up with is the boring "punk hardware" or "punkware", or the
cryptic "punk-net."  The punk-net name derives from the discussion of an
underground, wireless net (which got me interested in forming the list) but I
think that discussion about that net will probably be a minor part of the list.

Perhaps we should get away from the "punk*" naming scheme-- I don't know.

Let me know what you think it should be called... I'll determine the name by
a psuedo-democratic process (I'll use the name that's proposed the most, unless
 I think there's a better one.).

So, let me know what you think it should be called, but let me know soon-- when 
it's on-line I'll post info on how to subscribe.

rave on,
- -john.
