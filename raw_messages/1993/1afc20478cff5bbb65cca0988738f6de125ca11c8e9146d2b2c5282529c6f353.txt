RE: Press Blitz

I have found from experience, with some success, that the best way to
handle press if you to contact local press and present yourself
as a local expert on the subject. This gives them a local connection
for their stories. You should have apack ready to send them, including
copies of the White House documents, and a 1 page fact sheet of your own
pointing out the problems with the proposal. Present yourself as a local 
computer scientist who sees the deeper issues behind this proposal and wants
to air them.

The major national newspapers are already covering this but its the smaller 
local papers that most people read. Only a few million people total read the
NY Times, Washinging Post etc. Thinks of the millions that read their local 
papers and get to them. If they respond, this will be killed.


History of Clipper:

As I mentioned before, Iwas at the NIST press Conference on Fri. They 
responded to a question by saying that they had been working on this for 4 
years and had been implimenting it for 14 months.


Suggestion for campaign name:

Clip the Clipper!


Mailing List:

No CPSR, etc. were not involved as a cabal supporting this dingbat proposal. 
If you beliueve that then go back to reading your endless 
JFK/CIA/Mafia/aliens conspiracy theory books and let the rest of us go on 
living in the real world. They have put together a very slick electronic 
media blitz here, sending the proposal to every applicable newsgroup etc.
