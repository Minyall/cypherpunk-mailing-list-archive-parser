The rest of my .sig selection, in case anyone cares:

"Just another repulsive variation on psychopunk depravity and
 perversions.  Honest people would be repulsed by it."   -- L. Detweiler

"Your hideous criminal clock, your insidious time 
 bomb, is tick-tick-ticking."		-- L. Detweiler

"They have written customized software for pseudospoofing and style 
 analysis for cyberspatial warfare across the many lists."  -- L. Detweiler

"I think all the cryptoanarchists, radical libertarians, and cypherpunks
who promote drug use seem to be in favor of a sort of social sadochism [sic]
and masochism."		-- L. Detweiler
