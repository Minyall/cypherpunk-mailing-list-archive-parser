Let me clarify the discussion here about PC terminal software.  There
are two distinctions I'd like to make.

The first distinction is between a terminal program and a mail/news
reader.  Terminal access is necessary so that all functions of the
dialup service which are not mail/news can still be accessed.  An
integrated mail/news reader is desirable because this is a primary
activity of many users.  Ideally, you want both.

The second distinction is between stream and file encryption.If you
want to encrypt the underlying channel, you need a stream cipher and a
D-H key exchange.  If you want file encryption, you want a block
cipher and public keys for communications.

These two distinctions are correlated.  The terminal nature of such
software requires support for stream encryption.  The mail nature of
such software requires file encryption.  PGP is a file encryptor, not
a stream encryptor.  You can't use PGP for the terminal line; you can
you it for email.

One useful discussion would be to examine just what hooks are
desirable.  The capability 'encryption' is too broad; one needs to
specify just what variety and what purpose is desired.

It is for exactly reasons like this that one of the hooks should be an
ability to specify how one gets one's mail.  For Unix, I would suggest
POP, as Paul Ferguson has mentioned.  For online services like
compuserve, aol, etc., a separate protocol which spoofs their mail
readers into sending you your mail en masse could be written.

This also implies the existence of offline mail readers.

Trying to spoof a whole mail system on a terminal seems doomed.
Offline readers are the way to go.

What editor you use is another hook.  I use Desqview, and I love to be
able to spoof Desqview into spoofing my editor (which is _always_
running) into editing my reply.  So the hook has to be a bit more
flexible that running an executable.
