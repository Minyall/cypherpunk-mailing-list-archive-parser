It occurred to me that determining whether a set of random bytes is
actually a crypto message could be reduced to the halting problem.
Given this, it would be theoretically impossible to prove that an
uncrackable message was indeed a crypto message.  The revelation here
(for me, anyway) is that if arbitrary crypto were made illegal, the
burden of proof would be on the prosecution which would have to crack
the message (at least partially).
