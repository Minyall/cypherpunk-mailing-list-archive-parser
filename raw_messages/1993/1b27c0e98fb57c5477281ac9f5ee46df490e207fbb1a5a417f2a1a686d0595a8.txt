All are patented in so far as one of the patents covers ALL public key
schemes. Some, like Rabin's scheme, have possible technical advantages
over RSA.

(For the curious, Rabin's scheme is provably equivalent to factoring,
whereas RSA is not. Rabin's scheme is, however, vulnerable to chosen
plaintext attacks, but adding things like initialization vectors stops
that from being a problem.)
