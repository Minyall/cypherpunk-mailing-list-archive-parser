Hi everyone.
I know this is not the focus of the cypherpunks, but I was hoping one of
you folks out there might be able to point me in the direction of a
technoid who could testify about how easy it is to manipulate GIF images. 
Please respond by private message (ssteele@eff.org) so I don't cause any
more noise on the list.  Thanks.
Shari
