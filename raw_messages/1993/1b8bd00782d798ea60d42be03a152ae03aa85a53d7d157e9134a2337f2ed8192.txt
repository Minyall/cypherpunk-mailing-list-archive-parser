apparently you are so clueless as to never have heard of a kill file.
or are too insane to implement one yourself if your software doesn't have one.

please, join the rest of society. don't be such an incredible jerk. it
wouldn't be so bad if you just left me alone, but the whole point of
your venemous rudeness is that you ASSAULT PEOPLE.

I really do feel sorry for you.
