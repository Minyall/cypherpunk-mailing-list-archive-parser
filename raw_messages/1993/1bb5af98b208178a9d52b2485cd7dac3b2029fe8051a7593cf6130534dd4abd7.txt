Clipper TM chip is a registered trademark of Intergraph Corp.

The so-called Clipper chip which was recently mentioned here
and in other media
with respect to encryption is being used in violation of that trademark.  

The Intergraph Clipper chip is a Unix microprocessor, originally 
developed by Fairchild Semiconductors, and has no relationship
to the encryption chip whatsoever.  

I mention this here with the hope that someone reading this will
intercede before the group alt.privacy."clipper" is established.
