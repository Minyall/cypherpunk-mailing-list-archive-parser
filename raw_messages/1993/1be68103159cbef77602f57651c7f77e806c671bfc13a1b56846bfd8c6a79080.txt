	I read somewhere on the net a *very* interesting interpretation of
the 3rd amendment, which cypherpunks might find interesting.
	It was claimed that in colonial times, the British authorities
quartered troops in people's homes as a form of surveillance. E.g. Tom
Jefferson is suspected of conspiring with friends to communicate
privately :-), thus the local British military leader learns of this
suspicion and quarters troops in Tom's home.
	Under this interpretation, it was claimed that the 3rd amendment
provides protection from government surveillance.

	I think it's stretching things a bit, but a very interesting way
to look at it.
