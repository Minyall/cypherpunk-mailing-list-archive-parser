I seem to recall a major article on Inman in Covert Action Information
Bulletin back in, oh, 1982 or so.  It might have even spanned a couple
of issues of the magazine.  It was chock full of dirt (the kind only CIAB
could dig up), but unfortunately I can't remember many of the details.
Would anyone on the list happen to have a copy?
