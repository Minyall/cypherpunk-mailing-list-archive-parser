With UNIX it's quite simple to grep for "-----BEGIN PGP
MESSAGE-----"... and ditch messages that match.

I guess one could also run the incoming mail through a spell-checker
and reject messages with greater than %99 failure rate.

Neither of these require actual examination of the message by a human,
neither reveal content of a message to a human.
