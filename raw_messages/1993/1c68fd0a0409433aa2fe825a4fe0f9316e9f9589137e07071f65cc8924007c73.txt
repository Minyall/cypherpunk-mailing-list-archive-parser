We're sposed to be anarchists right? :) 'sides alt.* groups come out daily
with little or no discussion. Ours wont rock boats, at least in it's creation,
the content is a different story. Personally I hope it doesnt degenrate into a
narc fest for people who have grudges against people... that would be sad..

I vote to just make it. Not all will like it, but then they are maybe the ones
who will feature in it (great way to shut them up :).
