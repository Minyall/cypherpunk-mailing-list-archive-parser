  So far I have gotten three (3) positive replys to rideing the Crypto
Bus to Usenix, thats about $800 each round trip.  Unless I get an
avalanche of riders in the next couple of days I am not even going to
try to get a bus.
  If you need to know more about the idea of chartering a bus for bay
area folks (and anyone along the way) to Usenix, contace me.
