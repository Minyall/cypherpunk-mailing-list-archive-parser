Wouldn't it "look like a signature" if I just copied at the end
of an article the actual signature of some other, signed, article?
That would be a true signature, just not mine and not for this
article.  It sounds as though it would meet the suggested requirement,
but I don't see how it would accomplish the goals.  I could do it
with a macro, or maybe use a special .sig for posts to this list.
It wouldn't add anything to my software.

What am I missing?
