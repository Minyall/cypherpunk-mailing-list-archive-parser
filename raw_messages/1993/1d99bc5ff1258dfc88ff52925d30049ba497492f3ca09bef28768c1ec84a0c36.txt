You can, but the key can't be a regular RSA key.

That's right, don't use RSA as such.

Choose two RSA keys.  Make one as Hal describes for signing.  Use the
other one for receiving.  The public key in this system is a pair of
public RSA keys.  You break symmetry, and lose automatic PGP support,
but it seems to have the characteristics required.
