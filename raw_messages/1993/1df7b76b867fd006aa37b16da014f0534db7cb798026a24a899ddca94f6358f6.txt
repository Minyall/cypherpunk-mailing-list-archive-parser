Amateurs regularly develop systems and claim fantastic things for
them. They then turn out to be trivial to break. This has made people
who are even semi-pro like some of the folks on this list shake their
heads and say "oh no, not another one" every time someone who hasn't
read the literature claims to have come up with "the new great
cryptosystem". This is the reason that people tend to be so skeptical
of the constant stream of new proposals from such individuals. Its
nothing personal -- its just the sort of jaded attitude you get when
this sort of thing happens repeatedly.
