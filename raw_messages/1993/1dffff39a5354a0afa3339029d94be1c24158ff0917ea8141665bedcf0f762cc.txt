I think a large stink should be made at this point, to bring our
legitimate privacy concerns to the attention of net admins, and to
flush out who it was who threatened pax's net connection.

I'm really uncomfortable with the way that the pax anon remailer was
shut down on what seems to be pure hearsay.  I think we need a little
more guts from our anon administrators.  Stick to your guns!  Make them
at least deliver an ultimatum to you so you know where the threat came 
from.  

A note on whether we cypherpunks should "lie low" -- it's always
possible for us to go underground and hide from the authorities. 
I don't believe we should do this until it's absolutely necessary.  
As of now, we are legitimate net citizens.
