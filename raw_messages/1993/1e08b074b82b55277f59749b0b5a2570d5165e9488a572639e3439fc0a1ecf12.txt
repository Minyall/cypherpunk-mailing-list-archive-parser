You bet there is a cypherpunks cause, and if there isn't there should be.
The cypherpunks cause: to promote encryption and other privacy software
usage on the Internet until it is beyond the control of totalitarian
governments.  In other words, to protect the privacy rights of all by 
making privacy universal.

Any questions?
