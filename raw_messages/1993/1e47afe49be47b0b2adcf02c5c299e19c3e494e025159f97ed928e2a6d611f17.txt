I used anonymous ftp to connect to soda.berkeley.edu and wandered through
the directory structures in search of WORDPWD.ZIP, but to no avail. Has
anybody else picked this software up from there?

I get a giggle out of demonstrating just how 'secure' the encryption 
schemes in popular PC packages really are...
