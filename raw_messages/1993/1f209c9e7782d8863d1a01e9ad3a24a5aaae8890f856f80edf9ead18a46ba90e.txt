I've got friends who've had unlimited, unsupervised access to color
copiers at their schools or offices (art students, designers).  It's
not such a big deal.  I have even color-xeroxed currency several times
(mainly for a zine I used to edit, wherein we encouraged people to
deface money).  The reactions of the employees of the copy shops ranged
from complete indifference to "you know, this is illegal," but I never
had anyone refuse.
