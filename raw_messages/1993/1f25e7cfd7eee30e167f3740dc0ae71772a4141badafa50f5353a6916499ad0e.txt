I suspect that you will get several comments about the proof that DES
isn't a group.  That doesn't apply here since you have not claimed that
f() is DES -- only that it's DES-like.

I would expect the strength of triple-DES to show up in Diff.Cryp. attacks,
but maybe not.

Meanwhile, I stick to my sci.crypt suggestion:

	compress|des|tran|des|tran|des

If you could get more details from your KGB friend about that attack,
there are one or two people here who would be very interested. :-)
