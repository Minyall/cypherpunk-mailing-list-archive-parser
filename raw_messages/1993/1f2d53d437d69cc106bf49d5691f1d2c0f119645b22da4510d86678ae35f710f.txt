I haven't had time to confirm this yet, but I thought everyone here would
want to see it ASAP.  I'll get back to the list with confirmation.

>What I know:
>  Yesterday, Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown presented to Congress a report on

>export policy, including proposals for legislation.  Included in this was a  
>proposal for updating the Export Control Act to allow export of many items  
>currently restricted for out-dated security purposes.  The Commerce Department
> 
>estimates that $40 billion per year in sales are lost to such restrictions.  
>  Attempting to get a copy of this report lead me into a bureaucratic maze,  
>eating up an unknown amount of telephone charges and producing no results.

>What I want to know:
>  Is crypto on the suggested list of changes?  If not, whose office should we

>In any case, it seemed like something the EFF would want to know about, hence
