Due to my posts to sci.crypt and elsewhere that I was distributing PGP,
I recieved the following, and after that a very biased textfile on the
dangers of having PGP and how terrible it is.  Can anyone verify that
this is a real threat?  Last I heard PGP *MIGHT* violate a patent, but 
that this had not been decided yet.  Please reply soon, and by direct 
email.  If it is the Real Shit, I don't think they are going to give me
long to ditch PGP...  :(
