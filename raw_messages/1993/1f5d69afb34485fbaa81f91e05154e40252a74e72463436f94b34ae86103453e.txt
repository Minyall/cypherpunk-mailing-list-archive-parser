   BTW, you can't take the cards apart.  They fry themselves if you try.

Uhh.  Well, not exactly.  The cards don't fry, but presumably the
*key* inside them does.

I've seen a SecurID card which had been pried apart; when you put the
two halves back together, the LED went on again, apparantly into some
"initialization mode".

One assumes that the internal key had apparantly been fried; it was,
however, apparantly possible to reinitialize the card with a new key.

This may not defeat their security, but it may make it possible to
recycle their old cards instead of buying new ones..
