 it really doesnt work out... MANY ways are inherent in the scheme
to eventually match a face with an account. If you always pay
in cash, if you always where a mask(WAIT MASK??? well I think you get the IDEA)
credit cards will; eventually be traced and bank accounts discovered
unless one started taking their precautions before the information age...
now the only absolute privacy/anonymity will be the ones that can
insure it with technology
   cheers
