PGPC 2.2 is available for anonymous ftp from 129.82.156.104
in /pub/pgpc/pgpc22.tar.[Z,gz]

It is available in either gnuzip or regular compress.

Read the README.  It comes with a makefile that will add the 
public keys to your public keyring... you may need to edit that
if you don't need it (or want it) to add the keys.

I added support for the encrypted remailers... it's quite slick now, 
IMHO.  It can nest as many rounds of encrypted remailing you want,
and it will also mail through anon.penet.fi into the remailers.

I also signed the archives, and put the signature certificates
in near the archives, you can get my public key from fingering
nate@monet.vis.colostate.edu

have fun,
