Well, since no one else seems to have mentioned it and it seems somewhat
important to the general purpose of this list, I thought I would make sure
poeple knew that PGP 2.2 is not out and available at ftp sites.  Here are
the sites listed in the announcement in alt.security.pgp:

nic.funet.fi:pub/msdos/incoming
garbo.uwasa.fi:pc/incoming
src.doc.ic.ac.uk:tmp/pgp

I snagged mine from src.doc.ic.ac.uk, so I know it is at least at that
site...
