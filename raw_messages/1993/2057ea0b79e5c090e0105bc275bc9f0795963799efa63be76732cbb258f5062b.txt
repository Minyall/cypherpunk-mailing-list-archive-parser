Um guys, it was already posted here over a year ago by myself and another
person. It's a simple port bouncer and not that hard to write. 

treason: just post it. it's no big secret.

If anyone is in a hurry it's been up for ftp as /pub/perl/telserv.c on
coombs.anu.edu.au [150.203.76.2] since Nov 92. It's still there.
(Note it's C code not perl, thats just the tree I maintain).

Mark.
