HELP!

I'm looking to find out about the ITAR regulations on export of crypto to
the West Indies.  A company that I do consulting for sends out demos that
contain some database crypto stuff and they are concerned now that they have
a request from outside the United States.  Any pointers to where I can 
find information on this would be extremely helpful.  Thanks.
