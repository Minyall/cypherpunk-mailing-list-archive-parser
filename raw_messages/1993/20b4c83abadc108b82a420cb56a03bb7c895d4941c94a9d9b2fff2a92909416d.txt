Sending mail to anXXXXX@anon.penet.fi compromises your anon.penet.fi id,
unless you're careful to use passwords, and if you're sending the message
directly, you can switch the  format to naXXXXX@anon.penet.fi.  But, 
- Does the cypherpunks mailing list have any anXXXXX@anon.penet.fi subscribers,
	or is Eric careful to switch them to naXXXXX in the list?
- Is there any way to tell?
- If mail is forwarded, either by something like cypherpunks that patches
	up header lines, or by someone else (e.g. a forger, or some cypherpunks
	subscriber, or somebody  forwarding their mail to their anXXXXX account),
	will that also compromise the id, or will that just compromise the
	id of the forwarder, if known?
- How good is anon.penet.fi about checking this stuff for non-passworded users?
