At risk of irritating some folks who already saw this, a crosspost:

> Medvinsky, Gennady and B. Clifford Neuman. "NetCash: A Design
> for Practical Electronic Currency on the Internet" Proceedings
> of the First ACM Conference on Computer Communications Security
> (November 1993) [available via anonymous FTP,
> <URL=ftp://prospero.isi.edu/pub/papers/security/netcash-cccs93.ps.Z>].
> Addressing the pressing problem of how to conduct fiduciary
> business on the Internet, Medvinsky and Neuman describe a
> system that allows clients, merchants, and currency servers to
> interact in a secure fashion over an insecure medium.  The
> framework presented here addresses, to varying degrees, the
> following issues: security, anonymity, scalability,
> acceptability, off-line operation, transferability, and
> hardware independence.  The authors readily admit that this
> scheme does not solve all of these problems perfectly, but it
> does allow for the integration of other protocols when utmost
> anonymity and offline capabilities are required. - DR
