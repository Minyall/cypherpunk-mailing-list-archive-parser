Mr. Newsham, please tell me how you know this list is not a HOTBED OF
PSEUDOSPOOFING. What, because no *honest* people would do such a thing?
because it would take too much time, patience, and money to insideously
manipuate other's trust? what policy can you point to on the list that
discourages pseudospoofing?

`wherever there is trust, there is betrayal.'
