If digicash were a reality, I'd send you some with the proviso that
you only spend it on clues.

Repeat this chant until you attain enlightenment:

	Pseudospoofing cannot be prevented
	Pseudospoofing is a reality of online existance
	No amount of fear and loathing will make it go away

If it weren't for fundamentally new concepts like the ability to
pseudospoof (that's a lousy term, by the way), the net would not be
the quantum change in human communication and human thought it is.
