well...
jim bidzos is not SOME nut
and this isnt a threat.. justa warning

the only problem i see with writing an apology note
would be if he didnt send you a letter in the first place
in my youth or if i were basically bored
i would have sent a letter looking like taht
from that account

i would assume its real cuz if someone were to fake it
they would act real mad adn say they are already suing

but i think the fact that you dont know if he really sent you the letter
(well i dont know if he really sent you the letter)
is proof of why we need pgp out in public
because that way we could verify who it was
