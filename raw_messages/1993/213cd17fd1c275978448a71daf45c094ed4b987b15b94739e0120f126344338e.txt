Duncan's posting about AT&T mail as a "poor man's anonymous mailbox" misses
one crucial fact.  The moment you dial an 800 number, you generate a record
of your phone number via ANI, which means AT&T gets that information in
realtime and can probably correlate it with your phone account and service
address and name.  If you want anonymity, never ever ever use any service
which requires you call in via an 800 number.
