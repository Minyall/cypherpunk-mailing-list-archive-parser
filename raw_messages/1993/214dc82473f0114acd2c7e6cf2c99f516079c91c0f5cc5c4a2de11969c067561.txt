I strongly agree with Ray Cromwell's suggestions that we consistently
refer to "the wiretap chip", and avoid "drug dealer" examples.
One that might be closer to home when you need an example is
	   "Suppose the IRS thinks you may have cheated on your income tax
	   and decides they want to wiretap your phone ..."

It's within the range of things people imagine could happen to them,
and it makes the point that it's *their* phone that's being trapped,
not some public enemy bogeyman.  Making it personal is important...
