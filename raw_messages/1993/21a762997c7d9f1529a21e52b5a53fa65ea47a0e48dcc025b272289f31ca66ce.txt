I think you are being dangerously naive if you think that such actions
would prevent someone (not necessarily the government, btw) from making
your life a living hell.

If you are a parent, for example, think what an accusation of child
abuse might do.

Do not be so quick to assume that these wonderful and interesting
techniques we discuss will solve long-standing problems.  Most likely,
they will merely solve new problems (ie: the increased ability of
third parties to intercept communications) that are created by the
very technologies that make the solutions possible.
