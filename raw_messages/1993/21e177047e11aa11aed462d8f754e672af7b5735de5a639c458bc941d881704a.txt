Consider that the cyphertext is a program for an abstract machine
called the cyphercracker which returns TRUE if a message is encoded
otherwise FALSE.  Such a system for determining message-ness could
take an arbitrary amount of cpu time and no amount of static 
analysis could determine the return value quicker.
