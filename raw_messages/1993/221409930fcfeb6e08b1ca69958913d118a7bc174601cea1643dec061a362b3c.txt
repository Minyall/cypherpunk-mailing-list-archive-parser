THE MOUSE THAT ROARED. A small company has received a big patent
covering financial transactions from home computers. While
industry giants have bickered over who's on first in home
banking, shopping, entertainment, etc., Online Resources &
Communications Corporation of Fairfax, Va., has received what
appears to be an enormously broad patent covering financial
transactions made from home computers. "The patented payment
process potentially applies to a wide range of nonbanking
services, from pay-per-view television to stock trading done from
home terminals." (New York Times 8/9/93 C2)
