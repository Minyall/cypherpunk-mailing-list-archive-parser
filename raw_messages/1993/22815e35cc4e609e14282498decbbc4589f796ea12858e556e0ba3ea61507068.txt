OSF's DCE is a "distributed systems toolkit" which provides tools and
infrastructure for building distributed systems.

The relevant point to cypherpunks is that it uses cryptographic
techniques to provide authentication and (optionally) data privacy
using DES and Kerberos V5.  Unfortunately, the data privacy features
must be disabled in the exportable versions.

Contact the OSF or any of the many vendors (HP, IBM, DEC, Transarc,
...) selling ports of the code for more details.
