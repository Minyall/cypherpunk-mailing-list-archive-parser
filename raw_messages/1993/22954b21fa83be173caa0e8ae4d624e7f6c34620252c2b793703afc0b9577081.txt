I am looking for suppliers of DES chips. I wanted to use an IDEA chip
in the phone I am designing, but the only one made is 177Mbps and costs
about 200SFR. So one possibility is IDEA in software, and the other is
DES (or tripple DES) in hardware. So, if you know name, address, phone,
or email for companies that produce or sell DES chips, please let me know.
