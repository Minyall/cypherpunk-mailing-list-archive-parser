IT should be trival to include date into GIFs (or most any other non-lossy
formats) using the ppmplus library.

    giftoppm Image.gif | ppmInsertData data.pgp | ppmtogif > Image2.gif

where ppmInsertData is a program that modifies the data stream using
the file data.pgp as the crypt data source 

to extract just a command simular to:

        ppmExtractData < Image2.gif > data.pgp

for sound file it would just as easy (in fact I am almost tempted to
write some demo code but I have more email to attend to :-)
