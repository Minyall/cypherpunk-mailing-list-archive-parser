Subject: PGPHELP: Digisigning that petition

	I was looking over PGP in order to figure out how digisigning a
petition could work, and I couldn't figure out how to get PGP to do it
properly. (It was frustrating, because I remembered doing it before.)

	What I *want* PGP to output is:

-- Begin PGP Signed Message --
We hate the clipper
-- End PGP Signed Message --

-- Begin PGP Sig ---
dsfDSCSA43523csdcsad235s
-- End PGP Sig ---

	In the same form as many post to this list. How about the format
which makes a seperate file out of the PGP -sig, and STILL brackets the
PGP signed message. (The PGP sig file would be in ascii armor following
a message saying: "This is a PGP-sig cert." I *do* remember doing this
before.. I can't figure out HOW I did it though.)
