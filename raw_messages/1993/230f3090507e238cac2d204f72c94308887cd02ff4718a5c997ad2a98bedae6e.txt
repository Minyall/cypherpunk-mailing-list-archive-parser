Development of the EXE encrypting package that s_duck@pinetree.org
and I were working on has effectivly stalled.  We were unable to wedge
DOS at the right level to virtualize an .exe file.  Sorry for getting
your hopes up.  If anyone wishes to continue the project, please
ask s_duck for the existing code.
