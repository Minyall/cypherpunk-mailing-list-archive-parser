Hi there.  This is Doug - I'm subscribed to the list as 
dsinclai@acs.ucalgary.ca.  Unfortuantely, though my account is in 
Calgary, I'm flesh in Ottawa.  I also just lost my telnet access as a 
local switch upped its security.  Is anyone out there in a position to 
lend a fellow cypherpunk a hand and get me a telnet account in Ottawa?  
It would be much appreciated.  Please reply to this account.  Thanks.
