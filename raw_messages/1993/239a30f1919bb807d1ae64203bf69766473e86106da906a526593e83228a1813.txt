Some kind U.S. cypherpunk sent me a copy of his public keyring
last week.  Unfortunately - mea culpa! - after having integrated
his keyring, I deleted his original message from my mailbase,
and thus lost his contact info.

I wish to thank this person for sending the keyring, whoever you
are... my memory is faulty: so much email to catch up on!

In the meantime, Mark Turner (mt@kram.org) is hard at work 1.)
porting PGP to 386BSD and 2.) developing a telnettable PGP Key
Server.  Details as they happen.
