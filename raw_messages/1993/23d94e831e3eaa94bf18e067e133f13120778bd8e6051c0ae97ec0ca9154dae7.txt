Let me add one vote of support to your proposal ... and another
reason you may not have considered.

I use PGP for personal communications.  I'm not a big enough
target for anyone to sue.  On the other hand I do *not* use
PGP for anything related to my employment.  My company (Bellcore)
is large enough to get sued, and everyone loves to hate the
telephone industry.  As a result, I would happily pay a resonable
license fee.
