Pardon my ignorance, but I'm new to all this...

Where do I find (and how do I use) e-mail "pools"?

As I understand it, they're supposed to help foil traffic analysis...
right?

(Incidentally, I received my copy of _Applied Cryptography_
 with amazing speed.  I only ordered the thing this week, and
 here it is!  Now I've only to find the time to read it...)
