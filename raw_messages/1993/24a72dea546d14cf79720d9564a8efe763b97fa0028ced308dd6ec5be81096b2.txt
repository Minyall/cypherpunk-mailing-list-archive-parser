I looked at the lines where those errors were:  It appears to be
a #define for SKIP_RETURN.  I'm not sure what its about, but I
would suggest doing one of two things:

        1) Test the heck out of your binary.  Make sure it works for all
cases that you find important.  In particular, see where those particular
places in the code are, and see if it is doing the right thing, or

        2) Get gcc 2.3.2 (or greater) and compile with that... I use that,
and I don't get the errors..

Its possible that unproto is doing something funky, or perhaps its something
the compiler is doing with code that says:
        do {
                [do somethine here
        } while(0);

I'm not sure, exactly.  Sun compiler bugs are not unheard of.  ;-)
