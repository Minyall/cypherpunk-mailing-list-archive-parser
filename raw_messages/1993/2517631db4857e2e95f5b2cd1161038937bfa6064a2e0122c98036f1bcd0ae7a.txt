Re public kiosks; recall that Community Memory started the idea of
coin-operated kiosks years ago; and presumably still has terminals located
around town.  The technology is quite simple apparently.  Could be
genralised pretty easily.  The terminals are connected to their servers via
off-premise extension circuits, which allow keeping the lines open fulltime
at no per-minute charge.  Then you drop coins in order to respond to stuff.
This of course requires a server in evrey local exchange area where you want
terminals, but that should be no problem in most places.
