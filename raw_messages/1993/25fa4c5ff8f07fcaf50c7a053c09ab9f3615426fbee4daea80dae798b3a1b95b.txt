I may show up for a day, for the Tuesday evening rump session, in
particular.  I won't be attending the whole conference.  There are a
few I do know are going: John Gilmore, Whit Diffie (who shows up for
every other monthly meeting, even though he doesn't participate much
on the list), Phil Zimmerman (who's not on the list, but ...).  Phil
called me yesterday to talk about what to do to promote PGP etc. at
the conference.  You might want to get in touch with him as well:
prz@acm.org.

As to your other question, about a cypherpunks meeting the weekend of
the 28, we won't be holding one.  As it is, our 2nd annual meeting
will be only two weeks later.  I'd not mind having an informal
cypherpunks party, but I don't know where we would hold such an event.

Eric
