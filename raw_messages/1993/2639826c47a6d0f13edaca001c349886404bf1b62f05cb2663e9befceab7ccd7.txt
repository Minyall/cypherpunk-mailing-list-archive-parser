The recent flood of rantmail between Perry Metzger, E. Carp, etc., started
as an interesting and relevant argument but has degenerated to the point of
annoyance.  The former suggested calming down and writing some code -
perhaps he could go off and do just that, rather than wasting his time (and
ours) trying to keep folx from encouraging others to engage in personal
investigation of an issue which concerns them.  If you think writing code's
the only thing to do - go do it.  If you think getting people riled up about
the situation is important - go do it.  Yammering at each other ain't gonna
make the world a safer and more private place.
