I'm doing something like this for my Thesis (i.e., wait a couple of
weeks.. ;-) It's based upon Kerberos, but it will securely get you a
TGT on a server machine that is on the Internet from a client terminal
that is dialled up to it...

Moreover, you can extract the session key from the protocol, which
would allow for DES encryption of the session.  While I haven't yet
implemented the encryption of the session, I have been able to obtain
kerberos tickets securely....

More info on request, or you can wait to read my thesis when it's
done...

Enjoy!
