        Hi Eric,
               I as well as many others on this list have either
        worked as security administrators/ and/or designers in the
         aspect of systems that you have brought up here.


         Are you aware of the firewalls mailing list, it could be a HUGE
         resource in terms of these questions. As to the Logs...
         well the logfile name could be linked to /dev/null :)
         that would eliminate the logging problem...



        Another annoying tracking log is the syslog daemon.
        Mail connects are logged in their syslog using
        Sun sendmail and the standard syslog.conf. 


        syslog.conf changes are needed to eliminate this misfeature...

           cheers
           kelly
         p.s. ignore that rather uninformed person who complained
         you were making yourself look illiterate... most
         of the folks on this list unless they actually
         do it for a living(such as moi) ARE quite illiterate
         about matters such as DNS/Mail logging and TCP/UDP/ICMP/IP
         logging and/or trusted systems etc. Thats part of what this
         forum is about for each of us to educate the rest of the list
         so that privacy issues get FULL spectrum coverage.
          Please do keep bringing these issues to the
          forefront... some of do appreciate it. I and others
          will be happy to discuss the technical details of various
          tracking and auditing.

	I have opened my mouth and removed all doubt.  I _am_ mostly
	illiterate in the details of Unix; this is one system administration
	detail I did not know.  I have known for a long time that these logs
	were in principle easy for administration to keep, but I did not know
	that they were an entirely standard feature.
	
	I raise this because it affects perceived remailer security and I have
	not once heard these specific logs brought up, on the list or in person.
	
	Eric
