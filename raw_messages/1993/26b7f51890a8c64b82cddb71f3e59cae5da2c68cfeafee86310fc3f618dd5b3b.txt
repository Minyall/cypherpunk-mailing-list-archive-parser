THE NET SHOULD TAKE OVER WITH THE USE OF PGP AND
REMAILER CHAINS... SECUREDRIVE AS WELL AS KFS MOST
LIKELY HAVE BEEN EXPORTED...UNDETECTIBLY THROUGH
A CRYPTO PIPE... BET IT IS ON THE STREETS OF MOSCOW ALREADY..
YOU PEOPLE REALLY AMAZE ME, YOU HAVE THE TOOLS FOR FREEDOM
IN YOUR HANDS ALREADY AND YOU TALK ABOUT ACTION INSTEAD
OF ACTION ITSELF...WHAT A BUNCH OF ARMCHAIR COMMANDOES
YOU ALL HAVE BECOME...WELL GET THIS
THE ARCH-ENEMY HAS JUST TAKEN OVER DOD... EVERYONE HAD BETTER
GET MOVING TOWARDS ACTION BY THE NET
