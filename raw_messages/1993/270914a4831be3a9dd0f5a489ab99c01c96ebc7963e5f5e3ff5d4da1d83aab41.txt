    In response to the request I ran a search on the UNL archie server
    to see how many locations had pgp. The count of all versions and
    devivatives like docs and shells is 556. There is quite a bit of
    obsolete stuff though.

    >grep pgp10 pgp.lst |wc
          40     265    2593
    >grep pgp20 pgp.lst |wc
          54     363    3440
    >grep pgp21 pgp.lst | wc
          74     518    4767
    >grep pgp22 pgp.lst | wc
         153     951    9042
    >grep pgp23 pgp.lst | wc
          36     252    2313
