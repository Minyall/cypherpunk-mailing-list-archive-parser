In re: > wars

	chill out.  I, too, think people overquote, but I also don't feel
	compelled to tell them how to post.  Let your conscience guide.

In re: my gripe

	overLONG posts.  Wilde once wrote a friend words to the effect that
	'..I do not have time to write you a short letter.'  Take the time
	to be concise.

In re: PGP/RIPEM PC/Unix

	Well, gee.  I prefer PGP for my encryption, but unix otherwise.  What
	am I, weird?  

In re: 2d amendment & encryption

	Love the idea.  I fear the 2d amendment is far too compromised.  If
	gun control coexists with ol' #2, so can encryption control.

concisely,
