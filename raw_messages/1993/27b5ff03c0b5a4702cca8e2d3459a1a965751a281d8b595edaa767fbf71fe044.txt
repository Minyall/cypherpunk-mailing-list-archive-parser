My knowledge of neural net software is limited to a cartoonish understanding 
of the theory behind them, but as I understand it they might be a useful 
tool for identifying the author of a given text stream. Comments? Anyone on 
the list familiar with neural net implementation, or in need of some sort of 
academic project? :)
