Foutune Magazine has a special issue (dated Autumn 1993) called Making 
High Tech Work for You on the stands now with much of interest to our 
activities.

Look particularly at the last non-ad page (162) "Your Wallet in the Year 
2000" filled with digital signatures, public key crypto, and digital cash. 
Likewise gambling, remailers, etc.

Sample quote:

"The global cash economy is growing so fast that President-elect Clinton 
says she's worried about the government's ability to regulate and tax 
commerce."

There's also an article on the movement of commerce and enterprise 
networks to Internet.

Be sure to catch the hot hot tub photo of JG and the profile of Cygnus 
Support on page 57.
