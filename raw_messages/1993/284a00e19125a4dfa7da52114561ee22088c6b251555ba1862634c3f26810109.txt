Mr. Szabo objects to my pseudopool fun. I don't understand. How is
misattribution of quotations different than than things like
pseudospoofing and pseudopools that top cypherpunks promote?

Medusa has finally gone totally insane.

Hey Medusa -- do you allow pseudospoofing on your secret mailing list?
or do you ban it? are you a hypocrite? are you a liar?
