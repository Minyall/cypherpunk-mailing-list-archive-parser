Lately, when I use pgp -ka, I get the following message:

warning: duplicate key in keyring '/usr/tmp/1730s/pubring.pgp'
warning: duplicate key in keyring '/usr/tmp/1730s/pubring.pgp'
warning: duplicate key in keyring '/usr/tmp/1730s/pubring.pgp'
warning: duplicate key in keyring '/usr/tmp/1730s/pubring.pgp'

I'm using the keyring from the key-server.  This really annoys me.  Is there 
any way to fix this?  Thanx in advance.
