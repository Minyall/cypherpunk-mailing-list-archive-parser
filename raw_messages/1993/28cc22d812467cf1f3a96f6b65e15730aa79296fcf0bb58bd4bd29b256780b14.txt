(If we had a newsgroup instead of a mailing list, I could send this to
ba.cypherpunks instead)
I got their last one about 5pm Sunday; when I went to the information
desk to ask if they had it, the clerk's response was along the lines of
"Cryptography - oh, the blue one?  It's been really selling hot -
we just got tehm in this morning and you're getting the last one."
