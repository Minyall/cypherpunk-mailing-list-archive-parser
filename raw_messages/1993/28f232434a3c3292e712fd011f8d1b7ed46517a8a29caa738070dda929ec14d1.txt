Sorry if this has been mentioned already, but the new issue of PC
Week contains a big special report entitled "Privacy in the Workplace."
It's got about five or six separate pieces on electronic eavesdropping
in the workplace, encryption, Clipper, etc., etc.  I've only had a chance
to scan it quickly (I mean with my eyes), but it seems that there's no
mention of PGP at all, even in the piece on public-key encryption.
Shocking.  And the piece on Clipper, while it of course mentions all the
opposition to the proposal, seemed just a bit wimpy to me.  Anyway, it's
the June 28 issue.  Worth checking out, I guess.
