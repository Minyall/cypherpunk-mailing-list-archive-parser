 We are indeed doing just this. Although the small minority of us
 compu-professionals are writing code, flailing congressmen, etc., it
 takes more than what is currently being acknowledged to get things
 changed. I will not, however, discontinue my diatribe with my elected
 representatives on the topic of our electronic rights to privacy
 under the first and fourth amendments. (I'm having too much fun doing
 something that I seriously, and perhaps foolishly,  believe in.) Is
 there something going on with the EFF that we should know about?

We are working on it. A vote of confidence towards crypto-freedom.
Are we east-coast-niks welcome in this process? Is policy being drawn
by a few EFF persona without consultation of the masses?
 
Eric, before you say "Now,", you'd best detail us. I know what you
mean, however, many of the crypto-warriors which may follow do not. It
may be a good idea to _now_ place a broad policy statement.
 
Cheers.
