I don't see why some of the keys need to be public key pairs.
The intermediate encryptions done by the remailers are only to be
undone by the anonymous recipient correct?

So why would one part of the keys need to be published?
(the anonymous address block would have these keys sealed in the various
nested encryption levels, as you said.)
