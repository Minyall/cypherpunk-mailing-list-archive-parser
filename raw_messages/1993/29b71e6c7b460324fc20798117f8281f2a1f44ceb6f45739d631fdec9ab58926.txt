       This is interesting.  Since most of the change-making machines in 
   laundromats seem to use the side with the dead white guy, I wonder if it
   would work to use this copy?

Nah, the changers just say "this side up" - the scanner may be looking at
the underside of the bill, or at both sides (more probable).
