There's a paper in the Feb. '93 _IEEE Transactions on Software 
Engineering_:

"Trust Requirements and Performance of a Fast Subtransport-Level
Protocol for Secure Communication" by P. Venkat Rangan

It's about a protocol called Authenticated Datagram Protocol,
and issues about using it in a "subtransport level."  He's
tried it on Suns.

The work was done at Berkeley in 1990, the guy's at UCSD now.
