   Vapor. Or else?

   In context it was obviously a joke, lighten up. I think LD/Sboxx
deserve what they get for coming onto a forum about cryptography
and accusing people of high treason, evil, poison, etc in an almost
religious fervor.

   I guess I will have to be kicked off the list then, or you will have
to unsubscribe because I have no intention of apologizing to you or Detweiler.
I don't apologize for the "evil, anti-social" joke I made either, but I
do apologize for wasting bandwidth on the list if that's any consolation.
I'm getting to the point where I can't keep put with the amount of mail
in my box anyway. The ball's in your court.

  That's the funniest thing I've heard all week. Comparing a joke, "I'm gonna
kill your family with a rusty razor", made over the net, with rape? Even
it they were equivalent, I'm not about to walk on eggshells because some
people on the internet can't differentiate between a virtual joke and a
real life threat. Perhaps that's the biggest problem in the world today, just
last week a bunch of jocks repeated a scene from _The Program_ and laid
down in the middle of the high way. 

  If you want to prevent net.abuse, I suggest you take a look at alt.flame
or alt.tasteless and issue a couple thousand of your "warnings."
