Public kiosks are OK as a simple and moderately effective technique for
assuring anonymity, and they're ideal for a security-naive person who
is unable to verify the security of a more complex system.  But for
my own use, I am much more confident in the security guarantee given by
encryption on a portable computer and anonymizing using Chaum-style
remailers...
