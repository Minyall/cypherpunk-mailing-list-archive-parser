For those of you not familiar with Community Memory, it is a Berkeley
only system intended to make community stronger in Berkeley.  Steven
Levy wrote about it in _Hackers_.

SFNET is an expanding commercial service; I want to use SFNET as an
example a springboard for much wider deployment of public access to
