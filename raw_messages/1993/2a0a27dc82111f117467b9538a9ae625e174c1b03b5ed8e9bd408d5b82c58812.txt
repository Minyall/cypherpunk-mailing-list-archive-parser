The hiding-data-in-bogus-text system that Phil referred to is
Peter Wayner's Mimic functions, which let you represent data using
a Huffman code or context-free-grammar set of productions that
matches innocuous text.  The examples in the paper used baseball game
radio narration (hiding a message "Paul is dead" :-) and political
speeches by Mr. Neil Kinnock, the raving Labour Party honcho whose
speeches were plagiarized by Joe Biden.  (Biden, btw, was a nice guy
when he was elected to the Senate at age just-under-30,
but he's apparently gone Big Brotherish as he's aged.
I'm not bothered by one politician borrowing another's speeches,
but stooping to Neil Kinnock's syrupy ranting is a bit much :-)

The papers on the mimic functions are in ftp.cs.cornell.ecu,
under /pub/wayner/Mimic.  There are also a couple of papers on
building a highly parallel des-cracker out of content-addressable memory,

Until encryption becomes widely used, if yuo want to hide encrypted 
data, mimic functions or low-bits-of-gifs are good ways to go.
