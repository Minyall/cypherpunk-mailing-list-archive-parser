I was disgusted and horrified to read that PGP had been removed
from soda, and gratified to find that it had been returned.

However, your experiences with CERT are not unique.  As could be
expected of any agency directly funded by Air Force Intelligence,
CERT is a genuinely ugly organization which needs to be stamped
out.  Frankly, it's a menace to society.  Examine their acronym.
Computer Emergency Response Team.  What a fucking joke!  Excepting
the Morris Worm, can you name a SINGLE Computer Emergency which
CERT has halted?  It is simply an organization to keep the 
crypto-fascists wired into the net.

I will assume, as you did not say otherwise, that you do not know
the name of the CERT person who reported you, for whatever 
ridiculous reason.  This is standard practice for CERT; it's
customary for them to hide behind a shield of anonymity
for the purpose of attacking people.

My life was severely disturbed three years ago due to similar
anonymous tips from CERT, and I have yet to discover the identity
of the CERT person who tipped off the authorities to me.  CERT
is yet another agency which is freed of Constitutional restraints
for a vague and undefined 'public good.'  

If distributing PGP, legal in the entire Free World except for the US, 
is a "Computer Emergency," then I'm a fucking Republican.  Combat
this so-called Computer Emergency Response Team wherever you see
the tendrils of its evil influence.
