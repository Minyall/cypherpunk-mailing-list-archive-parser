Finally, a voice of reason.  The justice system must be followed by all
sides, not just the defendant.  While this is an important case, it's
important to see it in perspective.  The EFF and others have set themselves
up to provide defense in just such situations.  If you want to help them by
gathering "evidence", good for you.  But you aren't doing ANY good by
ranting on a Internet mail list.  We can all read the non-hysterical
informational postings to see what's happening.  Mr. Detweiler, you
are just adding noise and confusion.
