Subject: New pgp key server open for testing...

Could any cypherpunks who regularly use pgp key servers try switching
to the new one at pgp-public-keys@io.com which has been set up courtesy
of Steve Jackson Games.  Don't announce this elsewhere yet please - it's
only open for alpha test - this is all new server code that *doesn't*
use pgp or any PKP-patent-claimed algorithms.

If it survives some live testing by cypherpunks then we'll make the
server code widely available, and get more servers online too.

Thanks
