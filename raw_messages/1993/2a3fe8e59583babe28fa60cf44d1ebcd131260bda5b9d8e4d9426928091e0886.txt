The mother lode of source code for MSDOS redirectors, drivers, 
and related code appears to be the BCPPDOS forum on CompuServe. 
Some of the authors state that their software has been placed in 
the public domain, although for some reason they usually left in 
their copyright notices. It's a very good idea to have the 
author's explicit permission on file before redistributing any 
of this software.

In the C programming library:

     CPHANT.ZIP   C source for MSDOS network redirector
     DRIVER.ZIP   C/Asm source for generic driver skeleton
     RDCF2.ZIP    C source for complete MSDOS file system

In the General library:

     CRAMDI.ZIP   C source to RAM disk driver
     FDCBIOS.ZIP  Asm source to floppy disk driver
