Now - there's a slight distinction between:
	a) write [from scratch] PGP-compatible program;
	b) write RSA engine for [existing] PGP program.

I suspect it's the second, that most people would prefer.

Incorrect. I asked for, and recieved, a permission to use
RSAREF internals for modified RIPEM program.    Actually,
nobody but time and efforts preclude me  from adding PGP
capabilities to it...

Of course, whether b) will be granted too, is an open
question.
