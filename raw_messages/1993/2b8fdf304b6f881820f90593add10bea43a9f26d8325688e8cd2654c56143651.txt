	1. What is your position on the Clintons adminstrations proposal
	    about the Clipper Chip (pro or against)? and Why?



	2. If you oppese it. the  proposal is a voulantary one why do
	      you oppose it? and if it's going to cut down on crime 
	      (as the government claims) why do you oppose it?

	

	3. If you agree with it.  what do you have to say about it being
	     a bottleneck for fast systems? and what about the potential
