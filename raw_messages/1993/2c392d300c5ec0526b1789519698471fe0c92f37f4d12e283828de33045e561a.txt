Some folks have asked that the network redirector, driver, and file 
system source files from CompuServe be made available via ftp. Two of 
them, cramdi.zip and rdcf2.zip may not be public domain. I've ftp'd the 
others to soda.berkeley.edu, as well as rdcf.zip, a public domain earlier 
version of rdcf2.zip. I'm sure Eric will have them visible soon.

I'll contact the authors of cramdi and rdcf2.
