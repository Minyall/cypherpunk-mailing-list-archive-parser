It's not PGP, but RSA, Inc. and others (Internet Policy Registration Authority)  
are already setting up a system for registering pubilc-keys that are "proven"  
to belong to actual humans.  You can read about it in RSA's newletter available  
at their ftp site (rsa.com).  The newsletter is called "Ciphertext - The RSA  
newsletter".

Of course, their system for "proving" the identity of a human is not perfect.   
If you can obtain some fake IDs, you can defeat their public-key registration  
system.  This is probably true for any non-biometric identification system.
