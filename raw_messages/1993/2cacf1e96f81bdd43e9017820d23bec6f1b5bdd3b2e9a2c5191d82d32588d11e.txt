	I was wondering if any cryptanalysis packages existed which
could help in decrypted information picked up with a scanner. It seems
that a bunch of people trying to defend their home from the feds were
listening in on the feds radio communications, but now they're
encrypting stuff. It's probably not very strong crypto, maybe just a
simple XOR.

	(So I hear.. a friend asked me to help him, 'cause he's the
one helping these folk in Nevada.)

Thanks.
