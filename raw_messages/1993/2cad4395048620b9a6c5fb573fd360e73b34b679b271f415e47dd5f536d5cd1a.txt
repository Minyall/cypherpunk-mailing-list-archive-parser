	Good luck.. 

	Didn't someone mention a while back a scheme by which a
message can be split up into a bunch of parts and only requires about
50% of them or so to be completely rebuilt? Something like that would
be very useful I think to deal with remailer reliability problems.
That would require a good deal more user work though.
