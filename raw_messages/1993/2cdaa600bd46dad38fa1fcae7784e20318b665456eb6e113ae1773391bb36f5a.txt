I recently bought a copy of oracom's "Programing Perl" (which btw has a
GREAT quickreference guide) and have been working on a remailer mod with
little succsess. My thought goes like this:
New remailer command...
::
Induce-Delay: X

Where X is any number between 0 and 9999, or the word 'Random'. This would
delay the remailing of the message by X minutes through a simple perl
sleep command. 

QUESTION: Would new mail be kept waiting by the old mail? Or would Unix
spawn a new incarnation of the remailer process to take care of each
subsequent message?

::
Mail-At-Time: X
Mail-On-Date: X

Again both of these would use a sleep command to avoid the cron and at
commands.

::
Request-Encryption-To: X

If user ID X is on the remailer's pubkey ring, the outgoing message is
encrypted to X. This could be usefull for anonymous return-address blocks.

I think these are all pretty good ideas, however I'm not very good at perl
(in fact, at this point I suck) and things keep on bombing.

Well, Happy Hunting to all, -Chris.
