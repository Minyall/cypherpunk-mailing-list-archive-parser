An interesting suggestion was passed to me from a FidoNet node, suggesting
a way that might get PGP accepted in BBS-based networks a little easier:

A new commandline switch that will cause PGP to produce it's clearsigning
info, digital signature, etc, as part of a FTSC kluge line, most of which
are "invisible" unless you really try to get at them (in much the same
way that elm will filter out most of the headers, and you have to hit "h"
to see them all).  This would assuage fears of Fidomail becoming
cluttered and unreadable with PGP output.

This reminds me strongly of another recent proposal to have PGP use the
headers, rather than the body of messages, for PG information in
Internet/Usenet messages.  Considering that these 2 similar ideas came
from totally independent sources, this may be a good idea for developers
to look at, since it seems to occur to a lot of people.
