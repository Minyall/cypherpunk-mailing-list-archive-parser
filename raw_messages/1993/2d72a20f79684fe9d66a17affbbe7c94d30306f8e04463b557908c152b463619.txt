well on mindvox the cover decision was announced a bit
before the magazine came out
and there was a huge guessing contest
over who was going to be on the cover
with some damn creative ideas

but anyhow...
although if i were to guess, i would say taht peter gabriel
is on the cover of my issue,
but on the inside it says 
cover: mitch kapor
so i got confused
dunno what mitch kapor looks like...

also to note la and sf have different covers
from what i ahve heard
