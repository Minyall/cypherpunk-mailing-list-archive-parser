pcpc (was PGPcompose) 2.1 is available for anonymous
ftp from 129.82.156.104 in /pub/pgpc

it's in your choice of regular UNIX compress or the
new gnuzip format...

Adds the ability to mail through anon.penet.fi
and then send the mail on through remailers galore.

Special thnaks to stig@netcom.com for pointing out
lots of problems, and for even re-writing some of
the code (specifically the remailer selection piece).

Uh, that's it.  Have fun, and mail me if you like it.
