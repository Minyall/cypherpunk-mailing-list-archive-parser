Jim says I shouldn't booby-trap my computer because:

 -1 Really, really piss off those investigating you.  Nothing like
    giving people who can make your life a living hell a reason to
    want to make your life hell...

Too late, Jim, if the situations has gotten as far as warrants
and seizures, they are already making my life a living hell.
Investigation my ass; this is war!

He further states:

 -2 Opening yourself up for destruction of evidence and obstruction
    of justice charges in addition to whatever else they may have
    had on you.

Well, I haven't done the relevant legal research lately, but
that's not the way I remember things.  Plus please remember the
subject of this note--POISON PILL.  I not only want my *data*
unavailable to the bastards, I want my *computer* unavailable to
them, too.  And if possible, I would love to have it fuck up
*their data* as well.  Eh...theoretically speaking, of course.
