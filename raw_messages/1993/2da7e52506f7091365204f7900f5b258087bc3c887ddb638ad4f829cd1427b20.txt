Another nice way is to remove the dev files for the disk at
shutdown time.  Then at reboot, you'd have to manually create dev
files (knowing the major and minor numbers) and manually mount the
file system.  There'd be no trace.  This would work real well with big
disks... Is that a 1.0, 1.1 or 1.2G filesystem?  How much swap is
allocated, anyway?  You could also use a litte steganography and spare
out a set of ``bad'' sectors.  Some controllers will do the sector sparing
for you (transparently to the OS)...  All sorts of opportunities ;-)
