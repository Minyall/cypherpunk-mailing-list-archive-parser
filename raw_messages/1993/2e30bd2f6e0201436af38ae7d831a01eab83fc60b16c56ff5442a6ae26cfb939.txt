Maybe I'm a little out-of-sorts today, but...

I've heard (via Tv reports, reading, etc) that PhiberOptik (paraphrasing
here) "...knows more about Phone Systems than most Bell engineers".  Why
on Earth would you respond the way you did, rather than:

   1. Ignoring it
   2. Providing pointers to technical sources
   3. Refuting it with information.

I flame about *lots* of stuff, though I am, after all, a Sensei. Lose 
sight of your ability to teach, and you are nothing more than another
Technocrat.
