Yeah, but remember, in the world we're heading to, presumption
of innocence is worth even less, than President's word!
Then it will be *your* responsibility to satisfy the
Inquisitor, or he might not let you out from his
building, where you were invited to explain
yourself and your messages. (:-) (:-(

And the response to this will be: "Sure, here it is, this
nice hardware implementation. You may have it, if you
wish!" (:-)  It's fool-proof, but  still the Big
Brother might dislike your desire to play with
those bad random generators, and decide,
that you better be kept in KZ-camp...

Probably creating a  GIF/TIFF/whatever  file yourself,
with normal consumer-grade equipment (noise-prone :-)
and substituting it's LSB (or whatever certainly lies
BELOW the noise floor) with bits of the message, does
sound like the best choice today.

Advantages:
	1) Doesn't look suspicious, no more, than
	   "traditional" sending photos of your
	   house, family, yourself...

	2) Has enough of bandwidth to communicate
	   reasonably large personal messages
	   (though a binary og PGP might
	   not fit into a "normal"
	   GIF file :-).

	3) Requires only widely available consumer
	   appliances (Camcoder, digitizer, .....).

	4) The image doesn't have to be known to your
	   correspondent in advance (a big one!).

Disadvantages:
	1) Somebody has to do it, to write code, to
	   buy a Camcoder (:-).

	2) May lead to outlawing of ALL the image and
	   sound transmission  via  electronic media,
	   if Big Brother gets really annoyed (:-).

	   [Don't laugh, you! Look at the latest
	    Scanner Bill! :-]
