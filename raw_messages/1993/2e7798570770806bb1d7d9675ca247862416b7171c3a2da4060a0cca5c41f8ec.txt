Well, to the best of my knowledge, "sliding attack" does NOT
care about the length of a key - because it deduces the
subkeys DIRECTLY. This means - one doesn't WEAKEN an
algorithm by increasing the key length, it just
doesn't help against "sliding attack"...

And in order to pull out this "sliding attack" one HAS to
have either enough of PLAINTEXT-CIPHERTEXT pairs, or even
better - to be able to run CHOSEN-PLAINTEXT attack.   How
much are you afraid of such an attack against your e-mail?
[Assuming you use one-time RSA-encrypted DES key, of
course :-]
