two points:

1.  An even more convienient way to distribute this filter would be
by having it available from the anonymizing server itself.  Mail to
filter-request@anon.foonet.bar to get a copy.  This is better for
sites that do not have ftp available.

1.5  A variant on this approach would be for the server itself to do
the blocking of mail.  Mail to block-my-mail@anon.foonet.bar.  Would
prevent that server from sending anonymous mail to you.  (the server
would, of course, send a receipt for the transaction to the user
who's mail is blocked...just in case of request forgery.)

2.  This would be a political win, but it would really be just a step
in the right direction since many people don't read their mail from
UNIX boxes....  PCs, Macs, Fidonet boards, VMS, etc.
