Yes!!   I would like to participate in this discussion,  as I am now
in position where I have ability to communicate with thousands of young
ravers and PGP wannabes and soon I'm going to want to communicate with
these folks on several issues:

   ** Getting LOTS of people to use PGP
   
   ** Voter registration and political actions such as letter writing
      to local representitives,  etc.
   
   ** Other actions where large masses of people can make SOME influence
      on our officials.
