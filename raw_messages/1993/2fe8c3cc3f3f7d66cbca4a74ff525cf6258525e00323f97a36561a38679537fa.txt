1) I don't favor piracy. I especially don't favor piracy by people who
   can't capitalize or spell, and who think that saying "rich fat fucks"
   is a suave conversational gambit.

2) I agree that piracy is not the proper subject of this list.

3) If Mr. Thug wants to discuss piracy, there are thousands of places
   for him to do so.
