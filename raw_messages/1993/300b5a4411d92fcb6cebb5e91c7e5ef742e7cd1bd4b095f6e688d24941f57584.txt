An encrypted cypherpunks list?  Why?  To try and hide the forum's messages
from the TLAs?  I'm sure they already have people readin this list who'd
be incorporated into the encrypted list too.  Or do you plan to verify
each reader before giving them the password or whatever?  I fail to see
the point.
