There are many other reasons not to buy or use Apple equipment.  I have
never purchased an Apple computer due to a profound distaste for their
policies.  The Free Software Foundation is boycotting Apple due to some
litigation concerning user interface design.

Companies like Apple don't like the idea of free software.  Consequently,
many people don't like Apple.
