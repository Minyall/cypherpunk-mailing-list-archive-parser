I dont know about all of them, but the second one is near me and I 
confirmed that there is no 244 prefix in the 510 area code, so either 
ther is an error in that data, or should I venture so far as to say that 
he's trying to make a point about hiding information in a seemingly 
harmless format.  I don't have the desire to actually try to find out 
what it is, but it wouldnt take much more research to find out if the 
list is primarily made of nonexistent numbers.  However, the only reason I
even looked that far is because of the nature of this group and the fact that
it was brought up as such, rather than "Local U.S. Department of Agriculture
offices" or some other title that would cause people to want to be as far
away from it as possible.
