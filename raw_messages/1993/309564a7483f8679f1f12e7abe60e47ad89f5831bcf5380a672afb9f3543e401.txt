Also an argument for using stegonography, to obscure the fact that one
has encrypted files. Companies or universities may have simplistic
policies banning encrypion as a matter of policy, for various and
sundry reasons, and may snoop through networked machines looking for
encrypted files (high entropy, characteristic file types, etc.).

Packing those sensitive resumes and job applications in an innocent
photo of the dean may be a good idea.
