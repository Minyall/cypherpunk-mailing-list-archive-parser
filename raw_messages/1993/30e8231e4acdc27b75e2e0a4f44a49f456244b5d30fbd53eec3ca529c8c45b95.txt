The programs running on the system will not be using INT13.  They will use
the higher level interrupts that they normally use.  The block driver
exists below all of that and merely controls what happens once the higher
level interrupts already call INT13.

I don't think that it will be any problem, certainly less of a problem
than if I tried to screw with higher level interrupts.
