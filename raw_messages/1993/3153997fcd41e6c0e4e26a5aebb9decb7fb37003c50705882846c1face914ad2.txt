A recent _Scientific American_ had a brief piece on inducing order in
chaotic systems; I don't have it handy, but apparently it's fairly
simple to induce order in some nonlinear systems.

I'm no chaotician, but it seems that if you want to synchronize two
chaos generators at different sites, you must a) use the same initial
values and b) use the same mechanism to induce order. Granted that
small changes in a) or b) can change the system greatly, this doesn't
seem all that different from conventional synchronized encryption
systems.

(I'm happy to note that much of this work is being done at Georgia
Tech, my alma mater. It's great to be a fuzzy bee!)
