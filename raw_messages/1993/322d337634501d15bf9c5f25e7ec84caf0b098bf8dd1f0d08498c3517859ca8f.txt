Read R. Key's _The Clam-Plate Orgy_ for information on how advertising
companies (cigarette ana alcohol companies especially) add little
airbrushed renditions of subliminally pleasing sex scenes, with intent to
stimulate purchase of the product.  Its been done for almost 50 years now,
and started with the tachistoscope used in movie theatres to get people to
consume popcorn and Coca-Cola(tm) in great quantities.  Sales went up by 60%.

If you tried to sell the idea that your random number generator is random,
then the government would come back and say that there is no way to
determine random numbers, and if there was, they'd ask you why you would
be able to run it through a processor and decrypt it.

But then again, laws on subliminal information are practically null, and
those that do exist are never enforced, thanks to Big Business
influence-peddling.
