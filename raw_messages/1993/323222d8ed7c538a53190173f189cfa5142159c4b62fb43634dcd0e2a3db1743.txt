>For soda, the mail went to someone@soda....

The first CERT letter was sent to a contact for the berkeley.edu
domain, not to soda.  This original recipient then forwarded the mail
to root@soda, which is aliased to a number of people.  The root who
turned off the directory is not the same one who finally forwarded me
the CERT letter.

In short, they went over Julf's head, and they went over mine.
