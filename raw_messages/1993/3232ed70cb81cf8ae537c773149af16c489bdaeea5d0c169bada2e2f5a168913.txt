Does anyone have anything on the speed of RSA encryption for
various key lengths on various machines?

In particular, I am interested in how long it takes to decrypt
mail headers on an IBM rt or RS6000, for various key lengths.
I'm sure this has been measured. Any help would be appreicated.
Thanks.
