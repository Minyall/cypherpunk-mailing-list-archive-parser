Hi Everbody,

I was watching Beyond 2000 today and they had a episode on Kid Scan.

This technology came from Europe where it is used to id dogs and such. The
premice is to have criminals and children fited w/ a micro-chip in their
fatty tissue. This transponder would allow persons to be monitored. This
seems like a prime candidate to infringement of civil liberties.
