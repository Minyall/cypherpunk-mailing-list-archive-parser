Howdy.

I was the "anonymous" poster of the Mykotronx information.

It is genuine, for samples I can fax you parts of it, or

snail mail or whatever.  Or, simply call me:

Gary Watson
Engineer

I am in the process of piecing together the Selectric ribbon
that the executive secretary of Mykotronx carelessly threw into
the routine office trash.  I'm cutting into 8" strips and taping
it to white paper, but this is a tedious process, and it may be
after my Atlanta Comdex trip before I post on it again.

See ya,
GW

(thanks for the confidentiality)
