Does anyone have crash space, or need some, at the Sofitel hotel on
Thursday night?  (I'm not sure if it's all booked up or what the
room rates are).

I live fairly close to Redwood City but figure that staying
at the conference hotel is the only way I'll have any chance
of getting up early enough for the 9:00 A.M. session on Friday.

I might also be interested in splitting up a room on Wednesday night
but the interesting sessions on Thurs. don't start til 10:45 a.m.
which is not quite as bad...

Please reply by direct email, as I'm not on the list any more.  Thanks.

	Paul
