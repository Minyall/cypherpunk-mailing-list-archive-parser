Erm, only that this apparently appears to pretty much _require_ switching
mailreaders to MH.  A more transparent solution can be achieved with the
'procmail' package, available from any comp.sources.misc archive.  This
package allows rule-based filtering on message content, size, and other
factors, and can be installed workably with most mailreaders to my
knowledge, without requiring much effort.
