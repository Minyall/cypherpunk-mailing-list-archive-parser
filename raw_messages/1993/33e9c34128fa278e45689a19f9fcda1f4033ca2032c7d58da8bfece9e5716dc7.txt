It is even easier than that.  They can go down to the local library and
check out a book that will tell them how to make something better than an
ammonium nitrate fuel oil composition (it is hard to ignite such beasts,
but as someone who was always intrigued with pyrotechnics as a youth I know
there is a lot of info out there...)  Besides, they could just order a book
from loompanics that tells them how do make a whole lot more.

A good lawyer should be able to tear this one to bits...
