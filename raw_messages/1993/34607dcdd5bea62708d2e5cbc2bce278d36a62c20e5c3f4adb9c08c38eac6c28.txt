:)   The proposal specifically is to extend PGP beyond file encryption
:)   to generalized stream handling.  Such streams can be consoles &
:)   keyboards, real-time file transfers, and digitized voice; indeed,
:)   anything that will pass over a modem or other serial transfer medium.

This is already being attempted: Ytalk version 2.1 has both a single key
stream encryption feature and a PGP encryption feature ( I haven't been able
to get the PGP encryption feature to work, however.). It is still in beta
testing, but it looks like it will be out soon...
