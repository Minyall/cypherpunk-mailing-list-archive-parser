A further issue relates to stripping signatures.  Let's be clear here.

	==> IF YOU ARE PRESENTING YOURSELF AS MULTIPLE IDENTITIES,
	    AND EXPECT THEM NOT TO BE LINKED, AVOIDING AUTOMATIC .SIGNATURE
	    FILES IS THE LEAST OF YOUR WORRIES! <==

Remove the file ".signature" from your home directory and you'll be done
with *that* hassle.

PS: An extra credit note for the differently clued among us:  Suppose
you wanted to have a *different* signature for each of your multiple
identities?  I guess the remailers had better not strip off signatures, eh?
