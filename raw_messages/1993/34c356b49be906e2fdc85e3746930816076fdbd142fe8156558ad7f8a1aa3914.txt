'scuse me if i'm failing to recognize sarcasm ...

you can think what you like, but the fact remains that
the cypherpunks list was created with a specific set
of topics in mind.  people subscribe to the list to 
discuss those specific topics.  

there is plenty of room in cyberspace for discussions 
of any sort you like, including the merits of advertising.  
but not here.  ok?
