This is a good point, but I believe that eventually, people will want to sign
legal documents via pgp and such.  So being able to tie a pseudonym to a 
reputation to a public key to a REAL LIVE PERSON is very important.  I think 
that for many people, your attitude is one they can live with.  This is what I
was debating when I posted the original question.  But for others, your policy
may not be secure enough.  I'm working on a key-signing policy for myself which
I will make available via finger or request.  Laters.
