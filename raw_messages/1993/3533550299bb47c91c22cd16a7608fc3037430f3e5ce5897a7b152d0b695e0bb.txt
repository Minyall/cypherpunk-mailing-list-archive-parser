It is very easy to write up a rule for various filtering programs that will
nuke his messages when they arrive and save you the trouble of doing it
yourself.  In case no one noticed, this is his first posting in a little
over a week and in that time the signal to noise ratio on the list has
significantly increased.  Why don't we continue this trend and just ignore
him, okay?
