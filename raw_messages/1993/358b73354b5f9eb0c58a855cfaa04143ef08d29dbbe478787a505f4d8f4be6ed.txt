A few months ago, someone posted an article on cypherpunks@toad.com, a satire
on the government's efforts to ban strong crypto.  I had saved it, but
unfortunately, I no longer know where it is.  I would appreciate it if someone
who has it could mail it to me, tell me where to ftp it, or post it (newbies
and non-cypherpunks might be interested.).  Thanks.
