As the Internet becomes more diverse and less the domain of programmers
and scientists, it is natural that other means of selection are needed
for membership in a group.  The traditional academic atmosphere of
mailing lists will evolve away from total openenss.  Here are some 
possibilities:

	1. By invitation only--members sponsor new members.
	2. By trial period--new members are lurkers on the main list
		and a subset of the members can see their postings
		or they must first be moderated.
	3. Qualifications--could range widely.
	4. Tests.
	5. All of the above.

The Extropians list already does this--not totally secure, to be sure, 
but you must let the list administrators know all your posting nodes.
