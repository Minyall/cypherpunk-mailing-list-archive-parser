Why not have the device driver create a file (possibly of varying sizes) on 
the hard drive which the encryption device driver then makes look like another
drive?!?  This is how the compression programs work, seems to me a pretty
viable way to solve the encrypted drive problem as well.  A good place to start
on this would be something like DOS's VDISK device driver, it maps a portion
of RAM into a RAM-disk... a good way to understand how a DOS device driver 
should map something that has no disk-like characteristics into disk-like
characteristics.
