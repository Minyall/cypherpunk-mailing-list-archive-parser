Yes yes, very droll.  What's not so funny is that the moderator
of comp.dcom.telecom appears to have taken the BlackNet joke idea
for his very own, and *is* selling dossiers on people for the purposes
of doing nasty things to them (as he says himself in a footnote some
way down this post)

Of course, I'd like to discuss this in comp.dcom.telecom, but I'm
persona non grata there nowadays...
