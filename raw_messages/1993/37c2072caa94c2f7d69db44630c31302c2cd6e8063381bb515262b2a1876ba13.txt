				Enough rambling--I'm sorry to see a remailer demise and hope
	 that mine will not fall under the unethical clause here.  If I find
	 a solution, you will be the first to know.

This is not intended as pressure.   Coudln't you argue with their
conclusion that it is unethical?  If they were to make such a claim,
it would certainly be a good opportunity to push them on the issue of
free speech.
