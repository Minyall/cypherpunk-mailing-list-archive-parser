     Why not create a new key on one's multiuser public unix box specifically
for cypherpunks? Then you can sign as many messages on your box as you want
and not care if anyone gets the secret key since the key will not be trusted
by anyone else. Messages posted by you will be understood to be signed
by you with the possibility that someone snooped your private key
and is pseudospoofing. Is the security of this any less than we currently
have? Not really, pseudospoofing can be done by a unix novice user.
