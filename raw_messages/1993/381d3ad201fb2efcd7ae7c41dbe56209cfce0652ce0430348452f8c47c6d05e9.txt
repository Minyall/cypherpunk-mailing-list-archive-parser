With all the talk of timestamps, I decided to implement a simple
timestamp on the remailer at elee9sf@menudo.uh.edu.  It is by no means
a cryptographically secure timestamp.

The remailer adds a timestamp header field to outgoing messages.  It
looks like this:

X-Timestamp: hour:min:sec on day:month:year

For instance, this message should have one.

This nice thing about this is that in the process of stripping mail
headers, the remailers will automatically filter the X-Timestamp as
well.  Thus, if a message is chained through several remailers, only
the last remailer's timestamp (if any) will appear in the final
message.
