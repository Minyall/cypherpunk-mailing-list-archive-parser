You have made some contributions to the net in the past. I
will try to proceed without calling names or poking fun.

The fact that PGP doesn't bind True Names and keys is not important to
me, nor to many others like me. 

I go by the code of the Old West: a man's reputation is established by what
he does. Period. In our case, that equates to "an entity's reputation
is established by the content of its posts." Real identity just isn't
important. 

For example, Wonderer has established itself as a smart, literate,
eager-to-learn entity. I look forward to its posts, and I don't care
who owns that pseudonym. 

The content is important, not the source.
