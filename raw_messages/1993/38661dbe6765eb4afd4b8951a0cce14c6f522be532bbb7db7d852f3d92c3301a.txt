The _ONLY_ place that I have been able to find PGP 2.2 is on
soda.berkeley.edu, thanks to Eric.  Ever other place that has been
advertised seems to be empty for whatever reasons.  Apparently it was at
some of these locations previously, as others say that this is where their
copy came from, but it is only on Soda as of this morning (Monday).
