what, pray tell, do you define as *intersection*? the very existence of
the two pseudonyms on the same Cyberspace can be considered an `intersection'.

the scenario is chillingly *true*. And I do not support it. I condemn it.

again, more Medusa-cypherpunk brainwashing. `don't worry about this.
it's not a big deal. no one would be evil enough to do this. heaven
forbid, don't do anything rash like invent robust identity mechanisms
that would *prevent* me from continuing to exploit this weakness in the
system and inherent trust of others.'

hah, hah! society has already evolved many other mechanisms that have
worked for centuries, and `you' promote obscure black magic. the
problem is, all that stuff is just to damn mundane and oppressive. it's
equivalent to Retinal Scans and a Camera on Every Corner.

cypherpunks, you have no idea how much you are being brainwashed. a
true Thought Crime if there ever was one. wipe wipe, slosh slosh, scrub
scrub. look! sparkling white! now, to pour in the blackness...
