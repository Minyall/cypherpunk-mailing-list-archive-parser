Really?  That's odd, especially for a unix box, which access.digex.com
seems to be.  And, as a matter of fact, it does seem to show "Robert
Stratton" for the username of "strat".  So, it seems they do maintain
username to "real name" mappings (even if they allow the user to change
the "real name" listed.

As a side note, this sounds like a bad design.. keeping things on paper
for a computer system.  Perhaps, a disconnected computer system.. but,
when you start talking a few thousand users, the paper begins to really
become troublesome for maintaining information on accounts. ;-)
