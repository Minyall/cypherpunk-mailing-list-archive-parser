I have just uploaded version 1.0 of my pgp menu system for 4dos/Ndos.  It 
presents a menu interface to all of the major pgp functions and I'm quite 
proud of it.  It does, however, require 4dos or Norton's Ndos to run.  But
hey, once you use 4dos, you will never go back to regular dos.

If there is positive response to this version, I will try to port it into
portable C so that it can run on (anything?).

Hope you enjoy it.
