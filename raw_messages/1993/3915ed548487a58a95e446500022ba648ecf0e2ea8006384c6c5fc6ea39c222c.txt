I don't know how many of you are at sites on the MBONE, or multicast 
backbone. There are already a few pieces of code out there for 
experimentation with transmission of audio and video information, in a 
variety of forms/encoding, and probably the most widely used tool, "vat - the 
Visual Audio Tool", already has provisions for carrying on encrypted audio 
teleconferences via IP. In fact, it's as simple as typing a key into a field, 
and the tool will DES en/decrypt the conference.
