Don't mail those case studies to genghis@blue.engin.umich.edu
It was a dormant account my brother used to keep in touch with
friends from work (when he worked there).

He said he could forward mail to me from there... well, it looks like
they've closed down that account.

Sorry, send mail to goebelc1@studentg.msu.edu

Thanks,

Garrett
