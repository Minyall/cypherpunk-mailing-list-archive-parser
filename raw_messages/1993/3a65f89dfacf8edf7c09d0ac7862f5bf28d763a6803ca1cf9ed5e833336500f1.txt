Here's a chance to help spread the word to something a bit closer to "mom &
pop" than the cypherpunks.  

kenwardb@aol.com has asked for info on digital cash, and wants to post info
on it to an EFF conference on AOL.

You might send some not-too-long info to him.  Please don't EVERYONE do it,
it might cost him a bit.  Just one or 2 people do so, and announce that
your're taking care of it.  I'd do it myself, but I think there are quite a
few other people here that know more about it than me, and may know of a
short concise intro on the matter for the layperson.  Please indicate that
the material you send is intended to be reposted to the AOL sig.
