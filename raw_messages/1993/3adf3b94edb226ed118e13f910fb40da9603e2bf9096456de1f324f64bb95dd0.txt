It might be helpful for those involved in the penet flamewar to
refer to the service it provides as "pseudonymity" rather than
"anonymity".  This suggests some level of continuity,
responsibility, moral fiber... well, maybe not *that*.  But it's
worth pointing out that getting a penet pseudonym is no different,
really, than getting an account called "u7364250@csvax.uza.za".
