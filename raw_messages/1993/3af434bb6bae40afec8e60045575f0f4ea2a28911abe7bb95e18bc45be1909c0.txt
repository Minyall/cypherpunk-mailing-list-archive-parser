Carl,
     I have not published for several reasons. The main one is that
I have no academic creditials. My masters is in Rehab Counseling. I
haven't had a math course since high school in 1964. I am mainly
self taught in the area of math and crypto, but have had a lot of
assistance from Charlie Merritt and Joel Benston. They were two of
the 3 authors of Dedicate 32, the first public key crypto program
for the PC, which was released in the early 80's. 
     As I have noted, the paper was sent to sci.crypt by PKZ.
