Re Phil's criticism of warrants and the Oh My god proposal on wiretaps.  It
would seem that an additional safeguard can be put in place which would
create some kind of liability for deliberately exaggerated warrants.  One
could also require the services of an investigator serving in the capacity
of a public defender, who would act as devil's advocate against warrants by
bringing countervailing information to bear.
