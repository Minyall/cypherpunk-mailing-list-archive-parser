	Hal recently posted instructions on how to post to usenet using the
	anonymous remailers.  Here's a collection of email to usenet gateways
	I have, no doubt far from complete.

	group-name@ucbvax.berkeley.edu *
	group-name@cs.utexas.edu
	group-name@pws.bull.com
	group.name@news.demon.co.uk

Actually, the latter is group-name@demon.co.uk, and it's intended for
demon customers.  I believe they don't police this too heavily (ie they
could chop connections from non-demon sites) but if it's heavily overused
or abused there's a chance it might disappear.  These sites are *not*
anonymous remailers, in case anyone thought that.  They post under the
name presented in your mail to it, and if you forge mail the demon one
at least attaches an 'Originator:' line with the real site, and sends
a copy to the postmaster.

Generally, a service not to be abused.

The only open NNTP server I know of at the moment is sol.ctr.columbia.edu,
and it has user limits and time restrictions.  Still, it's better than none.
