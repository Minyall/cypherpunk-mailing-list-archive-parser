Cypherdroids,

Earlier today I commented on the advisability of posting new ciphers
to this group, or to sci.crypt. (I haven't gotten my message yet, so I
don't know if it went through.)

By coincidence, a very long posting on sci.crypt has appeared,
announcing a new matrix-based crypto system, called "WARLOCK" by its
inventors.

They provide an extensive introduction to the mathematics used and
offer various analyses. This is a first step toward making their
system worth analyzing.

I suggest following the debate on this system will be educational. And
perhaps their system will even survive to become a reasonable
alternative.
