THUS SPAKE peter honeyman <honey@citi.umich.edu>:
# it is odd that you quote gene spafford in a group that is anathema
# to his avowed goals.

Whether I speak to the 'punks, the spooks, or the 700 Club,
if I repeat something that you said first or said best,
I'll credit you, peter.

Spaf does have some experience with netnews, 
so I don't think it's that odd.
