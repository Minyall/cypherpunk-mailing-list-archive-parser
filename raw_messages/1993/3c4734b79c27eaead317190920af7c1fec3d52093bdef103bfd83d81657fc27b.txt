American Public Radio reported yesterday that some company was granted
a broad patent on remote cash transactions--they mentioned an article
in the NYTimes recently (NYT does patent reporting on Saturday typically, but
sometimes they do it in the business section on other days; I don't get
NYT anymore...); anyone here more about this?  Is this yet another 
example of bozo software patents?  If anyone finds out more, please post.
