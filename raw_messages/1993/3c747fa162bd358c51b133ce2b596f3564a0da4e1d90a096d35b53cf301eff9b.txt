Well, golly gee, you're absolutely right.  
It looks like this "pseudo-spoofing" game is harder than it looks,
isn't it?  After all, ignorant ol' me recognized the author from the
text, without even THINKING to check the anon id.

I'll bet that only people who have MPD master multiple styles of discourse
which are much more distinct than those of L.D, S.B. and Z.M (oh, maybe
a professional writer can manage, occasionally).  I'll also bet that
it's a rare MPD sufferer whose various personalities share any
significant accord.
