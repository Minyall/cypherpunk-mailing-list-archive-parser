I spent the time posting a considerable message about this subject last night,
and I've yet to see it echoed back to me on the list.  Did ANYONE get it?
Topics were Shannon's capacity formula, Shannon limit, Nyquist 2-bit rule, etc.
I'd be very annoyed if it just 'disappeared' into the bit-bucket.
