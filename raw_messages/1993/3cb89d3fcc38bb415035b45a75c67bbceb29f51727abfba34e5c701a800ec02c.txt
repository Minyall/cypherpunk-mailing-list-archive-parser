   Thats what people have *always wanted* to do.  RSA won't let them.  That's
   why any talk of a newer friendlier Bizdos is bullshit.

Have you actually tried?

Several people from RSA, including Bidzos at the last Cypherpunks
meeting at Mountain View (I wasn't there, but take a look at the meeting
"minutes"), have stated repeatedly that if someone were to ask for
permission to use the internal interfaces of RSAREF in order to write a
PGP-compatible program, they would grant permission.

However, as of two weeks ago, *NOT* *A* *SINGLE* *PERSON* *HAS* *ASKED*.

To those of you who have repeatedly said "Cypherpunks write code" (and I
applaud that attitude), consider this a challenge.  :-)
