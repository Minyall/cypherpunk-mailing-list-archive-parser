Hi,

Getting back to the cypherpunks-write-code theme, I'm
currently attempting to put DES on a u-ctlr that has 
a whole 1k of memory for things like 'stack'.  All
the DES implimentations I've found thusfar have 
traded memory for speed.   

I can afford a lot of text space, and initialized data
can go in the text segment, of course (think eeprom, ok?),
but I have to live within a 1k space for all my dynamic
memory needs.

Has anyone ever done anything like this?  Care to share?

Jim
