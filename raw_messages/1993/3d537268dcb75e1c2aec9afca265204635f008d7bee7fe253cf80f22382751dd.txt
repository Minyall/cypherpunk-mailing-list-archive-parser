Sorry for my poor English. I want to saw, that DES is`t group. We can`t say,
that:
A k1, k2: E k0, that des(k2, des(k1, text))=des(k0, text)
        (A mean "for all", E mean "exist");

or: E k1, k2: A k0, that des(k2, des(k1, text))!=des(k0, text)

I saw, that:
E f(k, text): A k1, k2: E k0, len(k0)=len(k1)=len(k2), that
des(k2, des(k1, test))=f(k0, text)

f() like des(), but f() is not des()!!!
My friend saw, that introder must try only 2^56 keys for des(des()).
Once more, sorry for my poor English.

PS I am sorry for my stupid letter about PGP randomizer.
