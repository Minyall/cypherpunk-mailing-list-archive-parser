  No, I wasn't complaining about his personal attacks per se but his long term 
behavior on this list and Extropians which is mainly "hit-and-run"
attack posts about once a month which usually generate massive flame wars.
(the last of which ended up with Tim May leaving the extropians list)

  Perhaps you don't like me, but I can atleast lay claim to have participated
in non-flamefest threads and contributed help and software when I was asked.
Many people have simply sent me private e-mail politely requesting that I stop
the Detweiler flame. All Lefty's message did was add fuel to the fire and
was just as unproductive as my original joke-threat against Lance. I
would like to end this thread and get back to rationally discussing
pseudonyms, but its not going to happen if I keep getting messages like
yours in my mailbox.
