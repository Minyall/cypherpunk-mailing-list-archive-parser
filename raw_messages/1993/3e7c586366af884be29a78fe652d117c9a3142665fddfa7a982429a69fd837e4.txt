Phil & Cypherpunks:

Here's a little program that demostrates a fairly simple way to immprove pgp
security on multi-user systems....

	main (int argn, char **argv, char **envv)
	{
	    for ( ; *envv ; ++envv) {
	        if (!strncmp(*envv,"PGP",3)) {
	            char *c=*envv;
	            while (*c) *c++=' ';
	        } /* end of if */
	    } /* end of for */
	    system("printenv");
	    sleep(10);
	}

It deletes from it's own environment any environment variable that
begins with the string "PGP".  It ain't bullet-proof but just by
grepping the environment of netcom, I've identified several PGP users:

	yonder
	nickt
	centaur
	henderso

This hack would prevent that...  'Course for UNIX, PGPPATH should
default to $HOME/.pgp anyway.

	Not doin' the work I oughta be doing,
	Stig...
