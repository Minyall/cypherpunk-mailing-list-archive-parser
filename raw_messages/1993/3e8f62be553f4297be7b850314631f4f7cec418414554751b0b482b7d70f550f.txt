     Hi guys.  I've been using the pgp key server for some time now, but
lately I've been having problems with it.  I send it commands (last 30 for
example) and never get a reply.  I believe I'm using the one on toxicwaste,
but can't be sure since I have an alias for it and I'm not at my email
account at the moment.  Is this site down or am I just impatient?  Thanx in
advance.
