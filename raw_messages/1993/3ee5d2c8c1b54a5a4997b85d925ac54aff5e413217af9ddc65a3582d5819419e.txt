                      New PGP Version?
Here goes with ANOTHER stupid newbie question:
What's the latest PGP version? I have DOS and Mac copies of
version 2.2. 

Is there an e-mail accessible group like this for PGP or crypto
in general? I see references to sci.crypt on occasion. Is that 
easy to get, or do I have to do fancy-smancy things with archie,
ftp, usenet, and other Greek words? (I have docs for archie, and
will soon have UUCP decode software, but I haven't figured out 
all this complicated, user-hostile stuff quite yet).

I DO know IBM MVS/JES2 JCL, and because there is nothing more 
difficult to use, I am confident that this Internet jive will
seem trivial someday.
