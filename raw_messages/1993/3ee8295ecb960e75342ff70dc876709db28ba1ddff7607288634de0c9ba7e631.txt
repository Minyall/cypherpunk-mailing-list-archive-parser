In the Sept 28 issue of Communication Week, Pg 35-36.

_Who will hold the Clipper Keys?_

*Last Paragraph*

The administration will choose the escrow agents based on experience
in handling sensitive information, according to the EFF report.  It
will avoid choosing low enforcement agencies to avoid conflicts of
interest and it will not choose private companies because of concerns
about the companies' longevity, the report said.

Well hmm...  what about the longevity of governmental agencies, or
even the government itself?
