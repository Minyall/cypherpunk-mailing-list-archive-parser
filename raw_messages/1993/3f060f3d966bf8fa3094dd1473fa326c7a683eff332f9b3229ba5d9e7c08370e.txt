I see statements like this over and over again and I can't help but believe
it is due to extremely widespread ignorance about PGP keys.

There is no need for widespread key distribution, folks. If you want
to communicate with someone, provided their key has been signed by
someone who's signature you trust, you can just ask them, in the clear,
to email you their key, and all should be just fine. Some people seem
to obsessively keep hundreds and thousands of keys around. Why? Whats
the point? You can always just get keys from people any time you like.
There is no problem.
