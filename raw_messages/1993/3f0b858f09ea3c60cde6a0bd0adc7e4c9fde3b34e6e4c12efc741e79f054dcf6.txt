Yeah. I am amazed that people don't get it right. My server sends out
messages looking like this:

	From: anXXXXX@anon.penet.fi
	Reply-To: anXXXXX@anon.penet.fi
	Sender: anon@anon.penet.fi

And there are _lots_ of systems out there that send te reply to
"anon@anon.penet.fi"! Elm and VMSMail are the most obvious ones.
