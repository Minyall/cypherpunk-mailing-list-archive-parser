hal finney quotes:

"Public domain" is defined in 120.18:  "Public domain means information
which is published and which is generally accessible to the public:
(a) Through sales at newsstands and bookstores; (b) Through subscriptions
which are available without restriction to any individual who desires
to obtain or purchase the published information; (c) Through second class
mailing privileges granted by the U.S. Government; or, (d) At libraries
open to the public."

I'm way out of my depth here, but can it be argued that what constitutes

ublic domain" is not being exhaustively defined here?  That is, does the
legalese here mean that ONLY a,b,c, and d publishing modes are PD, or can you
argue that a,b,c, and d are just *examples* of PD publishing, and that there
are other modes that just weren't mentioned.  If making something available
for anonymous FTP is not putting it in the public domain, then what the hech
is it?
