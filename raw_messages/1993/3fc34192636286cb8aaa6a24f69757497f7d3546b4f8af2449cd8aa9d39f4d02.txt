On the contrary, let's hear the details.

If what we are considering here is how to fight abuse while encouraging
(what we think is) positive use of anonymous systems, then we need to
know the details. If you are not comfortable posting that here, I'd
welcome a private email (as well as the people at io.com would, I
expect). Still, I don't think cypherpunks is anywhere close to the stage
where we should withold that kind of detail (except for OS bugs that go
to CERT first)...

ok, and anonymous remailers don't change that possibility one way or the
other. I'll go hang out there for a while anyway...

Sure, but consider that extremist systems will exist nonetheless.

Who qualifies whom, based on what info, and to eliminate whom?
