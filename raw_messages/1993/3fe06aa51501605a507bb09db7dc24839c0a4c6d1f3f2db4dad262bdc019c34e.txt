Please do not answer Mr. Detweiler. There is very little to be gained
in trying to explain things to a paranoid psychotic. Mr. Detweiler
needs sympathy and psychiatric treatment, not information on how key
servers work. It is both useless and cruel to answer his rants --
useless because he cannot understand reason because of his mental
problems, and cruel because this only enhances his paranoid delusion
that there is a global conspiracy in progress to attack and destroy
him.

The best and most rational way to cope with him is not to interact
with him.
