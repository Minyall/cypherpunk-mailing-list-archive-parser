Encryption is a social a political issue.  This list however is a
collection of people interested in the technical aspects of using
encryption to increase privacy (crypto-privacy).  Some of the people
on this list may be interested in discussing the social and political issues,
some of the people on this list may not be interested in discussing the
political and social issues.  The *one* thing that all subscribers
to this list have in common is an interest in the technical aspects
of crypto-privacy.  Lets keep on topic.  Like someone has said to
the list before we are a collection of people with different goals
and views, lets work together as long as we have to and no longer.
