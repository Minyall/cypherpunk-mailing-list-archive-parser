I also agree that any sort of mailers should pass a message body
UNTOUCHED.  Next thing you know, people will be advocating that
remailers have AI capabilities for stripping out incriminating
statements made inside the body.

If your mail system is broken enough that it inserts signatures without
your permission, and you have no way to controlling it, it's broken.
End of statement.  Fix it or ditch it.
