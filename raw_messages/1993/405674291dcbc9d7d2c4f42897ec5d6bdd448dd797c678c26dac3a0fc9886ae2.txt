Send your post to <newsgroup-name>@cs.utexas.edu

i.e., to post to alt.privacy: alt-privacy@cs.utexas.edu

Note that dots in the newsgroup name get replaced by hyphens in the email 
address.

If anyone knows of additional email-to-newsgroup gateways, I'd appreciate 
receiving these by direct email. Thanks.
