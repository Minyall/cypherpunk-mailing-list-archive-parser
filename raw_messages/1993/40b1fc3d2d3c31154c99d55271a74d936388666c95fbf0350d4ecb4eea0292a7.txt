Those of you following L. Detweiler's rants might wish to take a look at
the latest CuD.  Pretty amazing stuff.  He manages to slam Bruce
Sterling, the English language, Eric Hughes, Tim May, and even an EFF
board member (John Gilmore), all in ~200 lines which is short for L.D.

The most amazing part is the absence of ALL CAPS, though excruciatingly
manifested longwinded, pedantic, and redundant cypherwonkian adjectives
(like these) are present throughout.   

Quite a sight, I tell ya.
