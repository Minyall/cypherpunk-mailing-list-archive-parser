yeah, and maybe we need mike's opinion as to whether
mail forgery is the same as high treason.  mutter.
this saga has moved me from sympathy to amusement to
boredom.  irritation follows close on boredom's
heels.  i wish lance would just go get some prozac
or whatever modern drug cures whatever he's got.
barring that, i wish he would just go away.
