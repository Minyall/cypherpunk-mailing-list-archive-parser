I have been told that there is a new improved version of
DH key exchange, which is authenticated. Could
someone give me the reference, and/or tell me what it is
all about?........ Diffie??

I was not clear on what it is that I am working on.
We are trying to build a cheep secure phone
for the masses (read brainless). We are looking for
black box brainless operation. I will provide more
info about the project on request.
