Well, the output of an additive knapsack encryption has a normal
distribution.  More precisely, if you encrypt many input values
with the same public key, the resulting output values will follow
a normal distribution.  This is because you're adding up a set
of large numbers with an apparent uniform-random distribution.

Not quite you what you asked, I realize.
