A good idea, but it appears from the announcement that they are just going
to create a database of return addresses and subject lines and sit around
and read that instead of reading the actual messages.

In that case I would suggest a well written form letter that we could
encourage people to forward to the address with their names on it.  That
way after they see the same subject line 12,000 times they might get the
slight urge to read the message going along with it.  That would be kind
of equivalent to a petition.

Somebody good at slicking politicos like to draft a nice letter?
