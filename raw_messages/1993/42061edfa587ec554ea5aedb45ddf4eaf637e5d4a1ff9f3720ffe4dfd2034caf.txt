Is there any published work on hiding subliminal messages
in pictures? It seems like that would be really easy.

The warden, so to speak, sees an innocent illustration
of a house and a garden, but the prisoners hide information
in the arrangement of the bricks and the flowers. In
video images, wouldn't it be very difficult to detect
that there was some encrypted data in the image? This
would be good for deniability.

Big brother comes and tells you that you are not allowed
to encrypt anything, and you say that you used a random
number generator for this new form of art that appears
to be total oblivion, but really represents a new way of
looking at the meaning of life. Meanwhile, your pal on
the other hand runs it through a processor and decrypts
the message.
