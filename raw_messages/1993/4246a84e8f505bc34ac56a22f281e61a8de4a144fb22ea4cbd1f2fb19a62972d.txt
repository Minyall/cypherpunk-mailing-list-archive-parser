Has anyone here had any experience with the "charcoal remailer," a
Penet-ish looking system that I saw in another newgroup footer?

The footer says to contact "anonymus+info@charcoal.com" for information,
but this isn't a good address.  The misspelling of anonymous is
suggestive, but that's how it read...
