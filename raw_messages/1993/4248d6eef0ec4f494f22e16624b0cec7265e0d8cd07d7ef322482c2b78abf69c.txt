I am new to this group and apologize if my request is covered in a FAQ. 
Would someone kindly point me to an FTP site or the location of a binary 
application that can be used to encrypt/decrypt text in an MS-DOS 
environment? I understand that PGP is UNIX-based, unless there is a DOS 
version of which I am unaware, but that's why I'm reading this group.

Thank you in advance for your help.
