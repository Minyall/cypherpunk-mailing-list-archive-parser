I'm preparing to write out a check for the Phil Zimmermann defense
fund (lawyers, fees, even in advance of an indictment, and hopefully
to head one off), but I seem to have lost the address of the
lawyers--this was in a posting in the last couple of days here.

(I also looked in various threads in sci.crypt, talk.politics.crypto,
etc., but I can't seem to find it.)

So, I'd appreciate it if someone could send it to me, or, even better,
post it again on the List....sort of a reminder that this case means a
lot to our future. 

If Phil--who appears to be the main target, never
mind that the _document subpoena_ was not directed at him this time
around--is successfully indicted, sent to trial, etc., then this will
have a chilling effect on others.

I'll have more to say about this after I've actually put my check in
the mail.
