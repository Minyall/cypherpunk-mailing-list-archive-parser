Is it possible to get Elm's filter to pick out messages that are cc'd to 
the cypherpunks list?  I would like to keep all the cypherpunk mail in 
one place and have no trouble getting it properly copied when the message 
is "to" the cypherpunks list.  I'm just not sure how to work on the CC part.

Thanks!

Mike
