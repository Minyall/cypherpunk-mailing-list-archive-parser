I like this method you mentioned of
using two keys, on one on the public machine, and one more secure at home
or whatever.

I meant to comment on this before...I'm not sure about the "detached"
signature, though.  What if someone created a detached signature, adds it
to their header, and the last thing that happens is that their mailer
appends their .signature to the end of the message.  The only way seems to
be to say, "Encorporate the detached signature mechanism into whatever
program you're using so that it's the last thing that happens.  This
includes things like mailx, elm, and inews."  Not everyone could probably
comply with this (especially some who work for corporations that add a
corporate signature to messages after it's left the user's hands).
