Yea right!  have you ever noticed the about of physical abuse the phone take
in "*some areas.*".  I so not blame NY tel for cutting off payphone service
especialy when they have to repair/replace the phones every other week.
(note at we all know these phone are bulletproof, they are not broken/smashed
trivaly).  

the  NY tel Co. is loosing money in these "areas".   A valid debate would be 
if the NY tel Co. should maintain these phone at a loss.
