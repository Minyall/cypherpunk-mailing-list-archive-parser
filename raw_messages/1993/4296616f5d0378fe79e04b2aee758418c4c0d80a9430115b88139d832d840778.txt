The one and only thing we need from the government is one that you
forgot to mention.  All we need the government to do is to allow all
interested parties equal access to the utility easements that the
gummint has already set up.  (Make the gov't follow the constitutional
requirement of equal protections under the law.)  This will allow free
market competition of ALL communications services (well, I guess you
sort of said that in (a) and (e).)  b) is irrelevent (or could be)
because of free broadcast media.  In d), what kind of regulations do you
want?  And c), I don't see the distinction between "data", and
telco...the government should recognize it as all the same, right?  Kind
of sounds like that crazy "modem tax" the FCC tried a few years ago.

Oh, and of course, let the rich pay for it. :)
