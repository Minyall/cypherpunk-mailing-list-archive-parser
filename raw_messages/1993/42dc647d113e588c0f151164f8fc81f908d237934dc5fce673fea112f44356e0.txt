I've heared the ECPA described as a "bundle of loopholes", and it is illegal
to watch your TV, if it receives cellular conversation, unless you are 
actively debugging the problem.

Does anyone know the history of the decline and fall of the Third Party Rule?

I used to be of the understanding that it was legal for you to listen
to anything you could detect in your own airspace, you just couldn't tell
(or sell) the reception to a third party.

Is this an accurate statement of what the FCC policy used to be?
Was it EPCA (86?) that destroyed it, or was it chipped away previously?
