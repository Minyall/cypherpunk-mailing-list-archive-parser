The rest of your posting is therefore 100% irrelevant.

Lets say that you operate a magazine, and decide what can and can't be
placed in it. You are then liable for the contents.

Lets say that instead you operate a courier service, and censor
nothing. You are then not responsible for what your clients.

Forget the common carrier question. If you actively decide what can
and cannot go through, then any time you fail to stop something you
are liable. If, on the other hand, you exercise no control, you have
no legal liability.

Mike Godwin, council to the EFF, has never heard of such a case. If
you believe one has occured, why don't you tell us precisely where and
when it occured?
