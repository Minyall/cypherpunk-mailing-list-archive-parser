Most of the unsubscribe message that have gone out over the list in
the last month are the _first_ messages sent out by people.
Therefore, let me repeat this.

To unsubscribe from the list, send mail to

	cypherpunks-request@toad.com

A human, namely me, Eric Hughes, will read your mail and take
appropriate response.  Do not expect immediate answers; I am not a
program.

If you send to the whole list asking to be removed, I will send you a
piece of junk mail (with the above info in it) and ignore your
request.  I don't do maintenance for the list on the same account as I
read mail.

Thanks you all.

Eric
