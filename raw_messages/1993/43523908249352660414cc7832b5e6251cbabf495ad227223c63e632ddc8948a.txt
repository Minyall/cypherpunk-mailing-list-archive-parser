Since you asked...  I don't know what the average uptime of a 3090 is,
but from several years of experience as a Unix sysadmin, most of the
Sun systems I've been involved with easily had uptimes ranging months
at a time.  Powering down a system for maintenance or adding equipment
was more common than crashes.  If you insist on promoting the reliability
of the 3090, perhaps you'd be so kind as to cite some figures.  I'd
hazard to guess though that a 3090 could be sufficiently mismanaged to
produce dismal uptimes as well as a workstation can.

In any case, your rather condescending attitude about workstations only
seems to reinforce what I percieve as a condescending attitude towards
the people inteding to start the digital credit union.  And since some
of the more high-profile cypherpunks are not just workstation users but
inventors of the technology, I would think that your comments have
probably similiarly affected other members of this group.

Aside: welcome to Robert Woodhead who is in the best position to know
what my username means.
