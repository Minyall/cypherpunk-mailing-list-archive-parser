------BEGIN PGP SIGNED MASSAGE------

Cpunx--

Sorry for the premature post on signatures in Mush.
I looked at the sources to figure out how to use it.
If you want to append a multiline signature to your
messages without adding the gratuitous "\n--\n", do 
something like this in your .mushrc:

set autosign='\-fnerd\n\
quote me'

I'll pass on any other relevant tidbits I receive
by email.

And thanks to Eric Hughes for getting me off my 
butt for a bit.
