Yes. Thinking about something like this. But what is teh best syntax?

Well, it could be somebody who doesn't care about his/her own anonymity,
but wants to make it as easy as possible to send anon mail to him/her.
It's so much easier to mail to anXXXX@anon.penet.fi than to use stuff
like user%host.domain@anon.penet.fi or hack around with strange extra
X-Anon-* headers (especially with anally-retentive mailers etc.).
