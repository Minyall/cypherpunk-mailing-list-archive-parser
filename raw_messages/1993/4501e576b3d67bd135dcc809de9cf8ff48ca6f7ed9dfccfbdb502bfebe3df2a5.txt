  Stupidity is it's own virtue.

  If people, who are afraid of fat electrons crowding their email-box,
don't bother to _read_the_manual_ that's their fault.  There's a
wonderful tool called the "filter", that can protect these virtual
innocents from themselves.  Unfortunately, no such device exists
for _real_mail_.  If they don't want email from certain individuals,
then they can put those people into the filter and ignore them 
as blissfully as they ignore reality itself.

  Just my $0.02 worth.
