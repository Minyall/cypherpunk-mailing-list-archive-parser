  Opps, that was me. When I was debugging/testing my anonymous
forwarding/anonymous list software I sent multiple messages before
looking for the reply. (because the software randomly chooses a chain, and
I wasn't sure which remailers introduce a delay)  The problem was that
Encrypted: PGP was only being added for the first remailer in the chain
but the body was being re-encrypted for each remailer.
