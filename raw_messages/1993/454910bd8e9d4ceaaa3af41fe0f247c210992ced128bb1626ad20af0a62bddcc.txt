To me at least this seems unimportant for the application.  If all you're
doing is exchanging session keys over the phone, it doesn't really matter if
you are sure that the public key actually belongs to who it claims it does,
only that the person you're talking to (who you presumably already know)
actually possesses the corresponding private key.  This can be verified with
a simple challenge-response system.  The identity problem is removed if you
use a different key pair for phone conversations than you do for signature
purposes... there doesn't need to be any information actually connecting the
key with you.
