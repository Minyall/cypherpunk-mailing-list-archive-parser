Seems like a very good idea, at least for the short term, to generate
traffic.  Just make sure that you do not accept a value for X-Discard that
is too large, or else you'll find the same message floating around
(Internet Worm sytle) when you *don't* need any extra traffic!  If you
wanted to really have fun, you could also add X-Discarded-By to keep a
list of all sites the message has visitied, and make sure the same message
doesn't cycle through the same site too many times.
