      The actual server entry point could be through a cypherpunks
encrypted anonymous remailer block. that could totally conceal the entry oiint
given the proper type of remailer... as to the service posting machine...
one could maintain a net of open nntp servers by ones confederates,
one could then "forge" the posting and give an anonymous remailer block 
corresponding to the anon id... concealment and high security?
given message encryption remailers and a public key for the forging
NNTP posting mechanism I dont see many issues coming from that

    what do the rest of you thinK
... course this scheme depends on a common set of features on anon remailers...
i.e. message encryption...
    cheers
