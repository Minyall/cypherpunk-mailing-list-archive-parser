Could anyone who has purchased ViaCrypt PGP answer my question?
What is the executable filename?  Is it still PGP.EXE or did they throw
their own little proprietary in there with a VIAPGP.EXE or some such?

I appreciate your response!  (I'm about to put out another version of
a shell program and thought about extending support to ViaCrypt's
if it is a different exec...)
