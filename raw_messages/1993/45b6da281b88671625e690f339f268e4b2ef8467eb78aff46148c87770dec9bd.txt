Subject: ADMIN: Are we gatewayed to Usenet?

Gateways to local usenet groups are fairly common for the list.  CMU
is behind one, and there are several others.  The most frequent reason
given is that it is easier to read a large list with news software
rather than mail software.  (I am just passing this own; don't quibble
with me over it.)

What I find most interesting is that I cannot identify where netcom is
getting their feed from.  None of the netcom addresses on the
distribution list appear to be gateway addresses, nor have I heard
from any netcom administrator about making such a gateway.

There are 34 netcom accounts on the list.  Perhaps if enough of you
asked where this distribution came from the answer would appear.
