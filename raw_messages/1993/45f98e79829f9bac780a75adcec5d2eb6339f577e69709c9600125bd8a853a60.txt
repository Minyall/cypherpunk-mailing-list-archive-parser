RE this topic, there are methods (Merkle's for example) where you can get
multiple megabytes per second through a good encryption algorithm in a 
CPU.  DES is kind of optimised for doing it in hardware, so don't take
how slow it is in software as the limit for good encryption.  Keith
(Gnu posted the paper a long time ago in sci.crypt, but I don't know if
I can find it on my newer system.)
