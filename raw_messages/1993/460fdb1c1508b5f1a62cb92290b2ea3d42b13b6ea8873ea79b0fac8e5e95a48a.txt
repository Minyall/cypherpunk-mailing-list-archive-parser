Reuters doesn't mention, for some reason, that these defendants,
and Mark Abene in particular, were primarily motivated by the desire to
learn about the systems they were using.

No MOD defendant has admitted to doing this. In fact, it seems certain
that this particular act was committed by a rival who wanted to frame the
MOD members.
