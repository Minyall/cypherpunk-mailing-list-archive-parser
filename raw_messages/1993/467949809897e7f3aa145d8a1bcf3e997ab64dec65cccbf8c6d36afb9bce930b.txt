You might want to work in perl, which would make the scripts work under
Unix and DOS, at least.  Is there a Mac perl?

Oh, you might want to add the remailer on this account to your
circumnavigation.  It could use some more traffic -- I've seen about
5K through here in the past couple of months.  Still no PGP; has
anyone gotten it to work (generate keys, specifically) on a Symmetry?
