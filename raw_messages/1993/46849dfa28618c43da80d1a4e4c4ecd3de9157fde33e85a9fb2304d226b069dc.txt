When I sent the invite to the list I knew that there were many that do not
live within traveling distance.   But since there are there are a few
in the area I thought it would be a good opportunity to meet a few
of the locals (and trade keys).

PS: ther party went very well and I did get a chance to meet a few more
people from this list.
