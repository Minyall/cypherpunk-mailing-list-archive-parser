	At the recent cypherpunks meeting, Tim, as he posted to the
list, mentioned during his presentation conflicting political views,
and how we don't plan on making that a big issue-- we will set aside
the politics until *later*, when we have full privacy & high bandwidth
people can decide what to do, splinter into their own groups, etc.,
but until then, as we have a common goal of personal privacy, we
should work together to reach that goal.
	It makes a great deal of sense.

	It strikes me, however, that Tim only took into account the
differences between the anarcho-capitalists and the
anarcho-syndicalists (A new term-- I've always used
anarcho-communist.. are they similar?) while not taking into account
the people who don't seem to want an anarchic future.

	Remember, though, that the cypherpunks is *not* a group with a
"party-line". Whether your vision of the future with crypto, I think
that having an internal squabble is pointless and futile. Let's work
for full privacy. Maybe for those who feel like debating the finer
points of anarchy with crypto (on an "intellectual" level) can use a
separate list?

Peace,
