Hal recently posted instructions on how to post to usenet using the
anonymous remailers.  Here's a collection of email to usenet gateways
I have, no doubt far from complete.

group-name@ucbvax.berkeley.edu *
group-name@cs.utexas.edu
group-name@pws.bull.com
group.name@news.demon.co.uk

* I understand that the admin of ucbvax.berkeley.edu block posts from
non berkeley sites, but I'm not positive about that!

I seem to have lost (okay, I must have deleted it :-) a list of nntp
servers; places you can telnet to port 119 and POST your message to
usenet.  Anybody have info about these?
