Yes. I had a major system failure due to the temperature in the machine
room getting close to 90F. The main disk and the CPU board failed. To
recover, I have now changed to a new, more powerful machine (again),
and while doing that I also changed the OS from Interactive's crap to
BSDI.

So anon.penet.fi is back again. There might be minor problems due to the
new OS.
