I don't believe the analogy holds up.  In dealing with it manually,
police would expect that there's  a chance that they could haul you
into court and ask you for names and dates.  In the manual
situation, you are responsible as editor, a responsibility you're
looking to get away from.  The law would prefer that someone is
responsible, so they may try to find a way to hold someone
responsible.
