Nonsense.  I can already see a market, either black, gray, or otherwise,
for non-Clipper/Skipjack devices.  In fact, I'd REALLY be surprised if
people haven't already come up with them on their own.  How hard could it
be to throw together an 80386-based embedded system, put PGP in ROM, add
a couple of A/D converters, and *presto* - instant privacy.  Add table
lookup (programmable from the phone pad, of course, based on the number
dialed) and you've got a pretty decent PEP (privacy-enhanced phone) :)
