          The Clinton administration's effort to establish a new
          encryption standard for the coming data superhighway has
          drawn a firestorm of criticism - with Novell the lead
          flamethrower.
          Joined by AT&T, Computer Associates, Citicorp, Hughes
          Aircraft, Motorola, and other major corporations, Novell
          argues that Clipper - intended to protect both government
          and private-sector data communications - was designed from
          the start as an easy nut to crack.
          Specifically, these companies suspect that Clipper's
          creators (the National Security Agency and the National
          Institute of Standards and Technology) made the encryption
          system child's play for government agencies to decrypt. True
          or not, Novell and its allies are adamently opposed to
          Clipper's adoption by corporate America.
          [3 paragraphs concerning Novell's NetWare ellided]
          What is clear, though, is that Clipper will be hardpressed
          to succeed in the private sector with such influential
          opponents.

If this article truly represents opposition to Clipper, and not just
jockeying for position to be included on the "inside", then Clipper is
in far bigger trouble than the Cypherpunks can make for it: MONEY
TALKS.
