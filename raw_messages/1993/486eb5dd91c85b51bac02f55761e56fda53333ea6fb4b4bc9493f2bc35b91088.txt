You want David Chaum's company, Digicash. They are in Holland. I have
tried and failed to find telephone, address, or e-mail info for them.
If you do find out, could you let me know? Thanks.
 
One of the seminal papers on DC-nets and some of the protocols behind
digital cash is available by anonymous ftp from pub/cypherpunks at
soda.berkeley.edu. It's a paper by Chaum. Also, Hal Finney wrote an
excellent article on the basics of digicash that appeared in Extropy
#10.
