First:  

Is there an FTP site with the excellent cypherpunk article from Whole Earth
Review online?  If there isn't, would someone be willing to email me a 
copy?

Second:

I couldn't find a clear answer from the pgp docs, is there any reason to
upgrade your public key with newer versions of pgp?  I generated my
keys with 2.2 and am now using 2.3a, does this matter at all? 

I'm sorry if these questions have been addressed recently, I'm a little out 
of touch (I've got 700+ unread cypherpunks messages in my folder 8(

Thanks,
