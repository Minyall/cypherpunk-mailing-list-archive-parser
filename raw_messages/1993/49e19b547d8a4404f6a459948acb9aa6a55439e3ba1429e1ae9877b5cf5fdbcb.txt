Help with encryption needed

        Can someone point me towards a set of C functions along the lines of:

char *encrypt (cleartext_string, key);
char *decrypt (encrypted_string, key);

Where encrypt would return the encrypted string and decrypt would return the
decrypted string.  The stronger the encryption the better.  Thanks.
