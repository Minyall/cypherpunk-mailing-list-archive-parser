Most of the interpretation that I have heard, including an
interpretation from Jim Bidzos, say that crypto imports _INTO_ the US
are LEGAL, unless that piece of crypto was *illegally* exported from
the US first.

So, if A was illegally exported, you cannot import it and expect it to
be legal.  However, if it was developed outside the US, you can
legally bring it into the US, according to this interpretation.

David Sternlight has a different opinion.  (Which I'm sure he'd gladly
fill you mailbox explaining :-).
