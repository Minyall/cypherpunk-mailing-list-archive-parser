If A can transfer to B offline, and B can transfer to C without
calling into the bank first, this has to be either security-
through-obscurity or non-anonymous at some level. You could stack
digital signatures to represent a transfer chain. But you can't pass
anonymous digicash from one person to the other without the possibility
of double spending. Unless of course the recipient is required to dial
in before using the received cash, in which case it isn't offline. 

If this system is truly offline (i.e. not cryptographicall secured),
somebody is going to figure out how to rip it off.

At least you don't have to worry about a brute-force search ;-)
