A digital currency can be backed by gold held in some secure location
like the Zurich Free Transit Warehouse. U.S. Dollars are backed by
absolutely nothing other than blind faith in the U.S. Governement.

In any case, Gresham's Law applies to situations in which two coins of
differing metalic content are both made legal tender -- it doesn't
really apply in a general case.
