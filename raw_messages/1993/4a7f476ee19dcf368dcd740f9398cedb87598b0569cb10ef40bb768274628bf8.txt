Just in case I was unclear: my point was that it makes sense to have
digital currency that is backed by gold, not just the other forms which
are not thereby backed.

I expect that lots of folks will support their own idiosyncratic forms
of digital currency in the future, somewhat similarly to the way that
banks used to issue their own paper currency, and that therefore there
will not be just a single kind of digital currency.
