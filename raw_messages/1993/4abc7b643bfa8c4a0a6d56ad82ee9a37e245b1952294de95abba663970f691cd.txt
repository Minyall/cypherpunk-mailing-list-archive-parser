Sorry about the delay getting this out but I was waiting for my new
account.  Script updates will be made soon...

The only change is the shut down of phantom, unless it became a secondary
remailer and I missed it.

Q2: What help is available?

A2:

Check out the pub/cypherpunks directory at soda.berkeley.edu
(128.32.149.19).  Instructions on how to use the remailers are in the
remailer directory, along with some unix scripts and dos batch files.

The public keys for the remailers which support encrypted remailing
requests is also available in the same directory.

Mail to me (klbarrus@owlnet.rice.edu) for further help and/or questions.
