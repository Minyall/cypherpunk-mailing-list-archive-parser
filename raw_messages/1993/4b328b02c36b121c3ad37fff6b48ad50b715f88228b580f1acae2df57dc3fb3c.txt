I obviously need to read up on the digital cash idea.  The messages
that I've read make the concept sound like play money...  I mean, does
the coin of the realm in my pocket become the ethereal coin in a
digital bank?  What protections are there from digital embezzlers?
Whither the FDIC?  (Why is the sky blue?  :-)  et cetera.)

If the whole subject is just a classroom exercise in economics and
authentication theory, then I'll be a little disappointed.
