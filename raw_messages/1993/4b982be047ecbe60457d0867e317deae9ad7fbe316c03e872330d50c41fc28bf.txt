the system soda.berkeley.edu had suffered a disk crash thus loosing 
alot of configuration infomation (like how to me a MX for *.dis.org)
I hope to get around to having the sendmail.cf fixed this weekend.

the system merde.dis.org/utter.dis.org can also be reached as
merde.tfs.com (but it should be noted that the tfs.com mailer gateway
munges email headers).

        shipley@soda.berkeley.edu	(a sometimes useful account)
