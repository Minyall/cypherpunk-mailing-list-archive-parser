For what it's worth, at H0H0 Con in December John Draper
related a story about a run-in with the BART police, and the
confiscation of "hundreds" of floppy disks.  John indicated
that information was stored in encrypted form, and that
the authorities were unable to read it.

Since John is on this list, perhaps he can elaborate.
