I don't think it's lame to bring up stuff like inadvertent disclosures
of information via mail headers. My first suspicion was (and still is)
that someone BCCed the people in the Apparently-To: headers, or CCed
them, and the list exploder tried to do the right thing. Then again, I
was in that list in the copy I received, but I haven't gotten two
copies yet, so I may be all wet.
