Putting anonymity indications in message headers is a useful courtesy;
it's not foolproof, since somebody can always go run their own remailer,
but standardization would make it easier for most people to use them
consistently from their mail/news readers.  There are times when people
really need to get rid of lots of anonymous messages, such as harassment
or mailbombs or freaked-out gateways, basically for self-defense,
and this will make it more convenient.
