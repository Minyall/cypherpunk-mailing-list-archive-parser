We don't. We need private providers for this.

I agree about the potential for it to be free, but, I gotta tell you, the
monopolists running the cable systems in this country have no inclination
to share that nearly free bandwidth with you, even if you're willing to
pay for access to it.

In order to get to a world in which free markets can meet our demand for
high-bandwidth connectivity, we have to dig ourselves out from the 
market-failure position we're in now. And because government is part of
the problem, changing government policy is part of the solution. So,
that's one of the major thrusts of EFF's NII policy.
