I'd rather see this done as a tcl (not tk, tcl) toolkit, rather than
as a bunch of separate shell programs.  This will allow users to do
real programming, not just play around.  This solves the key problem
by keeping it in core in one process, or at worst, in a pipe.  And you
could always use it as a standalone program by putting the command you
wanted to use on the command line.
