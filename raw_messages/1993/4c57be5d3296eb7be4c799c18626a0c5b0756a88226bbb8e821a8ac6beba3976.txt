     Taking Hugh's advice, I made the remailer strip subject lines from
the original header.  By the way, I could use a few more messages sent
through here for testing.  Please remember, it only gets remailed if:

X-Anon-To: user@host
X-Anonymously-To: user@host
Request-Remailing-To: user@host
Subject: Request Remailing

     One of the above lines *MUST* be in the header or else it won't
get remailed.  (it goes to my in box)

Thanks.
