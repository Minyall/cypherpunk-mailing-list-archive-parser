I think that we are too casual about this -- Rich Little or someone
similar could easily impersonate your voice over a vocoder well enough
that unless I decided to do a "so, tell me about what we had for lunch
last week" routine you couldn't tell the difference. I think that even
if you DO know the other person verification is valuable -- especially
given the distortionary effects of vocoders.
