     Yes, that's a definite possibility.  Most of the popular offline
readers require that you first send them a packet (usually empty) so that
they will put you in the database.  The reader could just accept a certain
file (pubkey.asc for example) that contains the key you want to be used.
Then all sessions with you will be so encrypted.  Your mail to the BBS could
also be encrypted with the BBS's public key.  Unfortunately, one problem
still exists:  I don't know of too many BBS's where the e-mail messages are
actually encrypted on the disk.  As a matter of fact, the SYSOP can usually
read all mail.

     Some of those programs (MegaMail, TomCat, etc) run PKUNZIP to unzip the
file(s) then take care of the files themselves.  There isn't an easy way to
throw in encryption.  I would be willing to add an encryption option to my
offline mail software, though.  I have written a UTI (Universal Text
Interface) for ChaelBoard that lets it interface with RelayNet(tm) and
offline mail readers that use UTI's.  I also write a QWK/REP interface that
allows  ChaelBoard to be a node (the hub software isn't quite done yet) on
WildNet and for offline mail reading/replying.  I could implement encryption
in the ZIP/UNZIP step (for the users who have PGP keys registered with the
BBS).

     Do you think it's worth my time?
