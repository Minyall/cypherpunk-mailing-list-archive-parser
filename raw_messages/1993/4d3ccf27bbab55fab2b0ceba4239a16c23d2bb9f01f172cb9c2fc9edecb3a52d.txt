Regarding "test cases" for digital signatures, not sure if this is 100%
relevant but what the hell...

In this area at least, when the UPS folk bring you a package that you
must sign for, you no longer sign on paper, but on this funky electronic
tablet.  Now granted this thing is recording your "real" signature, and
thus differs greatly, but still there may be something to this.  Not sure
where one would look for material having to do with such devices, and
their relevance to a court case, but then again no one pays me legal
consulting fees either.  >:)
