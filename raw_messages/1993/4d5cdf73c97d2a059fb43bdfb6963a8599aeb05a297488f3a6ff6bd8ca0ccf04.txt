I'm researching fractals here at glorious Stetson University and it crossed my
mind that there are possibilities in the combination of fractals with current
encryption standards...  for instance, using a piece of the mandelbrot set as a
key or a Julia set with a standard center and radius, thereby reducing a key to
a sort of x,y,z,F() coordinate...
And if you and a friend established a standard equation... that would make it a
sort of three-key system.

On a simpler level, couldn't the RSA method be converted to use the Complex
number system... (which is the base of fractal mathematics)

Anyone follow?
