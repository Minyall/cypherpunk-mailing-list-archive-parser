This is an excellent idea.  A modest suggestion: build a email-based
digital cash system; allot each reader a certain amount of cash
per month; charge a fee for posting.  We'd have to figure out a way
to give extra income to posters that other posters agree with, or
vice-versa, in a non-onerous way...

On a totally different topic, has anyone investigated using the
LSbit of CD sound tracks as the source of a 1-time pad?
