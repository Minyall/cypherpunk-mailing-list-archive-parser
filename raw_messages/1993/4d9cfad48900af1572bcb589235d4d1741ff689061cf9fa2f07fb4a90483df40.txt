Along the same lines, I am left scratching my head about the 
"baroque activities in the vault." Surely this is going to 
add substantially to the cost of these chips over a system
that uses a known algorithm and non-escrowed keys.

Given that such a system would be cheaper to produce and would 
offer stronger security, I think it is not especially
inflamatory to suggest that the government is contemplating
either an outright ban or the strong discouragement of 
alternative systems.
