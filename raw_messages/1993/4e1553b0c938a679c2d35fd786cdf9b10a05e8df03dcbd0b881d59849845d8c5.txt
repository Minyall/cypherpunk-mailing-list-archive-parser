I don't think I dreamed this, but...

I remember hearing that one of the people hit by the bamse sting had
encrypted a bunch of stuff on their system.  I also remember some
discussion of whether or not the person in question could be ordered
to reveal their keys.  (Maybe I *inferred* that the person had been
ordered to reveal their keys since there was a discussion of whether
or not it was legal.)
