Dave Banisar sent us the November 12 CPSR alert [thanks, by the way!]
which contained, among other things:

> The CPSR Internet Library is available via FTP/WAIS/Gopher from
> cpsr.org /cpsr. Materials from Privacy International, the Taxpayers
> Assets Project and the Cypherpunks are also archived. For more
                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
This caught my eye, especially in light of the recent postings about
whether or not the cypherpunks postings should/should not be provided
to Usenet.
