Check out a new book by Peter Schweitzer entitled _Friendly Spies_.
(Atlantic Monthly Press). It tells plenty of stories about how
many US companies are the targets for foreign economic intelligence.
To me, it is the best argument for the government to _encourage_
the widespread use of strong cryptography.
