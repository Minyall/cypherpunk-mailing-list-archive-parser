Actually, if you've got an audio input on your computer, one way to generate 
"true" randomness for use in keys or whatever would be to turn on the microphone
and _speak_ about any topic for a few seconds, and take the MD-5 of the sound
file; the differences in voice, timing background noise, microphone quality, etc.,
ought to add a lot to the randomness.  (Or else, turn on the mike and type
N random characters and record them :-)
