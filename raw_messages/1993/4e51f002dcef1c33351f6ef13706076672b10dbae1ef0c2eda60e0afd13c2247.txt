I was a beta tester of the latest version of MacPGP, and it looks *very* nice.
Some annoying minor bugs have been fixed and a few new features added, including
a hook for BBEdit (a godsend).  I assume it'll be released any week now, if not
sooner.

If it's true that the freeware version of PGP will be allowed to exist alongside
the new (sourceless) commercial version, I don't think the cypherpunk in the know
will have much trouble choosing...
