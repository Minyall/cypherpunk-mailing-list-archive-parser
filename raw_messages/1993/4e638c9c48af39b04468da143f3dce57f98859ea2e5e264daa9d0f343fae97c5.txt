Of course there are ways -- and they need not be so drastic. You could,
for instance, simply prevent non-subscribers from posting to your list,
and use public key to verify identities. This would allow you to swiftly
stop abuse. I've already noted this twice. You've claimed this is impractical,
but the tools to do this, AND WITHOUT PATENT PROBLEMS, already exist and
would be cheap to implement.
