I changed my telco service to MCI yesterday.
 
"We want you back."
 
AT&T won't get my business until they  discontinue using Clipper.
Somehow, I get the feeling that may be when hell freezes over.
 
It leaves a bit to the imagination what the "i" in the "i" plan
really stands for. Intelligence? Integrity-busters? Insecurity?
 
I urge anyone who is seriously concerned over Clipper to put their
money where their mouth is - boycott AT&T.
 
Cheers.
