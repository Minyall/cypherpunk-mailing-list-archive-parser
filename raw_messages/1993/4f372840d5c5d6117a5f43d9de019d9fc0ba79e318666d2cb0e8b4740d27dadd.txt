Greetings fellow crypto warriors,
     I am attempting to locate several publications to see if they are still
in existence and where I might them or archives of previous issues. The
publications I am interested in are TAP, NIA, AOTD, NARC, etc. If anyone
knows where I might be able to obtain these or similar publications, please
let me know. Also, does anyone know where any "interesting" ftp sites which
carry files or other data related to these type publications?

Thanks,
