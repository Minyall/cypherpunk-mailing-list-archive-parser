Look, everyone --

Detweiler is a seriously disturbed individual. Sending him mail saying
"what the hell are you doing -- you're nuts" isn't going to do any
good. Crazy people don't think they are crazy. Ignoring is rantings
works a whole lot better than any other strategy.

I only mailbombed him because he was sending me unsolicited personal
mail and wouldn't stop. Otherwise I ignore him, and I advise others to
do the same.
