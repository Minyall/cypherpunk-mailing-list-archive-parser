I stumbled on a quote that succinctly expresses what I was saying about
the lack of corporate morality.  This is the head quote from Chapter
XIX of Niven and Pournelle's ``Oath of Fealty'':

	They [corporations] cannot commit treason, nor be outlawed nor
	excommunicated, for they have no souls.

			--Sir Edward Coke, Lord Chief Justice of England
			Sutton's Hospital Case, 10 Report 32, 1628
