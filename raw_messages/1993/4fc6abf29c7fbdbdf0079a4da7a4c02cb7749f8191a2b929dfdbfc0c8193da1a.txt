I assume you're asking about civil versus criminal contempt. My tentative
answer (I can't look this up because my reference books are still packed)
is both. Civil contempt, strictly speaking, is not a separate legal
action--a federal judge has broad authority to impose civil-contempt
sanctions on people who are noncompliant with subpoenas, who disrupt court
proceedings, and so on. Criminal contempt *is* a separate legal action,
and I think you can be prosecuted for intentional noncompliance with 
court orders, but I'd have to look up the criminal-contempt statute to 
be sure.
