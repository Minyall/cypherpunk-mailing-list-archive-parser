Gold on Black sounds very stylish, but if it costs no more, why not go for
some sort of symbolic coat or arms or logo, along with the words? I like the
sword-and-pen idea, myself, although a big-brotherish eye/telescreen with a
red slash through it grabs me, too.

I'm definitely interested in the idea of t-shirts, in general. There is no
unity without a t-shirt and/or a coffee mug, IMHO.
