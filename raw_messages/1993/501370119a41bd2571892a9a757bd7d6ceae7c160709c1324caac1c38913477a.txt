NitV is still hoarding all sorts of PGP utils for any and all platforms,
mail systems, and potential uses.  If you make anything new, please send
it along (uu it, or upload it to the board, or whatever).  I get QUITE a
few calls for such material (suprisingly much of the Unix stuff is
downloaded, and long distance at that, so I guess there is a lot of value
in having a BBS-based, multi-platform crypto-tools site.)  I MUCH prefer
to get the new material direct from the author, so please do send it!!
Help spread crypto to the OtherNets!
