It's not easy to break.  It is possible to break it with about $1
million worth of specialized computing hardware.  Many programs, such as
PGP, do use larger keys.

If all combinations had to be tried, it would take 2^112 times longer to
break a triple DES (168 bit) code than to break the standard 56 bit code.
