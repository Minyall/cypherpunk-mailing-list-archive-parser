William Oldacre persists in believing that personal use of a patent is
permissible.  It's not legal, but if they don't know, they don't sue.
The differences between legality, the cost-effectiveness of a lawsuit,
and finding out in the first place are significant here.  We want the
protecting of legality, if we can get it.

I'm really glad for this observation.  One, however, must derate our
person-hours some because we aren't lawyers.  The basic idea, though,
is entirely accurate.

It has been rectified.  RSA is not a mathematical patent.  It is the
embodiment of some mathematical routines into a machine which is used
for a particular purpose and has certain security properties.

I got that one wrong.  It's the Hellman-Merkle patent.  I just posted
the actual numbers.
