S.O.P. would be
	c. The government mandates that citizens use only Approved
Privacy Techniques, while government employees, "for national
security reasons", can use whatever they want.  

The government has a long and lurid history of placing less
restrictions upon itself than upon the rest of us.  I can imagine
general restrictions on crypto, but I can't picture the CIA using a
known-broken system.
