No, I think that julf's remailer is the only *anonymous* posting
facility (heck there might be more *now*.) But there are several (last
I checked) non-anonymous mail->news gateways on the net, and if used
from a remailer, the only address the mail->news gateway would have is
the remailer's.
	Of course, the remailers could be rewritten to allow posting
capability also. (probably not a good idea, as I doubt many of the
remailer admins would want to suffer throught the controversy that
Julf has had to) but it's up to them.
