count me on the side of those folks who feel that remailers (and
mailers, for that matter) should keep their hands off the body of
the message.

furthermore, any editor that changes a file without being told to
(e.g., by stripping blanks) is (imho) broken.

that is probably not the sort of system you want to use if you are
interested in the privacy and integrity of your work.
