How does everyone else feel about the idea of maintaining multiple 
accounts as a method of maintaining pseudo-anonymity?  I commonly use two 
accounts on each of my systems, one by my real name, one by my alias, 
which is the same everywhere.  The purpose of this is to allow me to send 
or recieve mail to/from people who I know from other bbs's and such and 
relay information in that way without giving them my real name.  as greg 
pointed out, it's very easy to have multiple accounts; some of us run 
sites that give us the ability to create pseudo-users, and pseudo-sites 
for that matter, and others can make use of public bbs's with net access. 
I know of a few bbs's in my area (silicon valley) that offer net access 
and don't do any sort of validation, making it very simple to set up and 
maintain multiple accounts.  How do people feel about doing something 
like this rather than using remailers since it seems that a lot of 
problems come up when people run remailers and start getting complaints?
