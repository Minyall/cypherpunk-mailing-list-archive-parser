   If Bidzos is using the term "technical data" as it's defined in $120.21
   of the ITAR, I think it's debatable. Can we come up with data to support
   that IDEA and RSA are "commonly taught .. in academia"? 

The RSA public key algorithm is taught at MIT in the math course
18.063, which is required for an undergraduate computer science
degree.

That's one data point...
