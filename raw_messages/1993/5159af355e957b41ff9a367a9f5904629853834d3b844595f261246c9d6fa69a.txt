Dear Mr. Prisident:
	I do not like the "Big Brother Inside" Clipper chip.
	Wire Taps need to be hard to do.
	I know you and Al are nice guys, but Richard Nixon
	and his plumbers could come back!
	A crypto chip with a government trapdoor (key escrow) is
	an idea fit for a J. Edgar Hoover, not nice people.

	Please dont make a techno-fool of your administration.
