Nice editorial on the back page of the June Dr. Dobb's:

"Pay No Attention to the Man Behind the Curtain, Dorothy"

I won't quote the whole thing, but the first paragraph reads:

"The debate on digital-telephony legislation in the March 1993 issue
of *Communications of the ACM* was a fraud and a dissappointment."

It's by Michael Swaine.  More serious than "Swaine's Flames" 
sometimes are.

Cypherpunks reminds me of the very first issues of "Dr. Dobb's
Journal of TINY BASIC Calisthenics and Orthodontia: Running
Light without Overbyte."  Those days, when it seemed we all
had a chance to steer the future, were over fast.
