E.Hughes, on Pseudospoofing software
>No the software isn't mine, but I consider myself it's God Father.

Nick Szabo:
>As an example, look at Ender's Game, where Ender's brother and sister

>anything like that.  Maybe you are blind, I don't know.  I've never

Arthur Chandler:
>And, as I said, it is not the job of the Keyserver to provide any sort

Jamie Dinkelacker:
>I oppose using it in a bogus fashion because the software is not
>designed for such a use, there is absolutely no protection for it (any
>key can be added), because I, and all the other Keyserver admins,
>believe that all the keyservers should be interconnected, and because
>I feel the job for determining a True Name on a key is a job for
>Digital Signatures, not for the Keyserver.  

Perry Metzger:
>I am a cypherpunk.  I don't believe in trusting something on faith
>alone, but you seem to be asking for that.  There is no way to protect
>such a reckless use of the Keyserver.  The only way to provide a
>secure way for True Names is to Cryptographically identify them.

Hal Finney:
>So, Mr. Detweiler, why do you oppose using Digital Signatures to
>verify True Names?  I mean, besides that you consider yourself a
>Cypherpunk? ;-)
