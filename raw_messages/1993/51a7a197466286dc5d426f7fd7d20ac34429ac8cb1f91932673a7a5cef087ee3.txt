that's precisely correct. but we can build mechanisms that encourage
human trust, rather than encourage a criminal `free for all'. I seek to
find such mechanisms. Psychopunks seek to subvert, sabotage, and destroy them.

For example, I proposed an arrangement on this list whereby subscribers
promise not to pseudospoof. Obviously, no one here gives a damn. 

I proposed that key servers be implemented that signify the authors
commitment to a code of honest cyberspatial interactions by their key
submissions. Obviously, no one here gives a damn.

I described a *real* and *active* conspiracy in RISKS. Obviously, only
the conspiracists here give a damn.

Hey, braindead cypherpunks -- do you want to know why there has always
been so much NOISE in this list's SIGNAL? do you want to know why
people are so GROUCHY and TYRANNICAL and incapable of any substantial
AGREEMENT or PROGRESS? because it is a HOTBED OF PSEUDOSPOOFING and all
this hideous cacophony is your KARMA FOR ENGAGING IN OR PASSIVELY SUBMITTING TO IT.

You're talking about Extropians? what list? name it, weasel. I still
consider this pseudospoofing -- twisting identity in maliciously
deceptive ways. Using identity to betray people.

If there is any general identity conspiracy, I'll give you 100-1 odds
the psychopunk bastards are behind it. I wouldn't be surprised if it
was a psychopunk bastard behind the Gibson forgery/impersonation on
that other mailing list. You guys have WET DREAMS over ALL OF THIS. perverts.

Just another repulsive variation on psychopunk depravity and
perversions. Honest people would be repulsed by it.
