CPs,

I did not want to poin-blankly address some of the comments that LD made
about me in his last post, but I feel it necessary.  I won't say he's 
insane or deranged, since i know it does no good.  I won't say that he is
raving or frothing at the mouth, since it does no good either.

I will say that I am doing my best to uphold what I believe in, and that
I will not stand for the public slander of my name and reputation all
across the net.  If you want to slam me, L.Detweiler, please slam me in
private email, since very few people put great weight on your post, at
least not lately.
