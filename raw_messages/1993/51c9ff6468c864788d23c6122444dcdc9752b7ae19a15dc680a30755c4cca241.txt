There should be a way to do this already.  Just as :: does header
pasting when a mailer receives a message, so should ## paste headers
when a mailer sends a message.  Then you just paste in a Reply-To:
header field when the message leaves the last remailer.

This technique is also useful for Usenet posting, for things like
Organization:, etc.
