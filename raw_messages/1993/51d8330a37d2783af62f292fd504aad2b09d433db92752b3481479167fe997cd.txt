W.R.T. using "fake" inventors.  It's illegal to file a patent application
without the true original inventor's name on it.  If it can be proven that a
company did this, it is liable for treble damages and the lawyer who filed
the application can be disbarred.

It's possible that companies might shuffle the order of names on an
application so that someone's name doesn't keep showing up as primary
applicant, but the inventor's name has to appear on the application
somewhere.
