Cypherpunks is dedicated to digital privacy.  One cannot practice digital 
privacy without an understanding of physical privacy techniques (and 
vice-versa these days).

"Privacy is a type of information that has its polarity reversed; I 
imagine it as anti-information.  In a world where everything is connected 
to everything -- where connection and information and knowledge are dirt 
cheap -- then disconnection and anti-information and no-knowledge become 
expensive."  -- Kevin Kelly

But not *too* expensive.  Frissell & Associates, custom crafted legal
