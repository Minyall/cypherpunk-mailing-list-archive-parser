FidoNet policy has a statement allowing monitoring of all intransit
mail.  I guess I'm going to have to dig my copy of Policy out of the
archives to post the relevant paragraphs.

This is a very shortsighted policy.

Although financial restraints have curtailed my operations here making
a lot of this moot, my own policy allows all users and passthru mail to be
encrypted.  I neither monitor nor censor.
