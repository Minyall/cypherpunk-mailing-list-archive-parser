	Since the topic of backing seems to go towards gold, what about
the purity of the bullion and who (which government) presses it?  Gold
pressed by the Canadian government at .999 troy oz might not be worth a
whole lot as backing if that government collapses tommorow. 
What's to say it isn't iron pyrite or any similar looking
material if the government isn't there to back it?  Anything to say on this,
Perry?
