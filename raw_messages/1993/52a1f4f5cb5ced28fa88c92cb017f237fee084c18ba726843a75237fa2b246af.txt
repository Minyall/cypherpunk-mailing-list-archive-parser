In/Cyberspace Literacy event ...

Jacking In: A Series on Cyberspace Literacy presents
ONLINE COMMUNITIES AROUND THE BAY: THE INNS AND THEIR KEEPERS

Every computer-based conferencing system lets its subscribers access 
relevant community information and discuss topics ranging from Apple 
Computers to zymurgy.  While these systems are all based on the same 
conceptual model, each one evolves its own personality and community 
standards based on underlying software, management policies, and, 
ultimately, the subscribers it attracts.

This installment of Jacking In will feature a talk about building and 
nourishment of online community, followed by community-conscious 
demonstrations of several San Francisco-based conferencing systems.

In cyberspace, community is not geography.
