You just have to learn to read mail headers to get the gist of what
they are saying.

Read from the bottom up, it's to charliemerrit@bix.com.

It *says* from president@whitehose.gov.

toad got it from good old telgate.adp.wisc.edu It looks like it tried
to deliver it a couple of times before succeeding.

then it went thru uunet, to delphi.com and then to bix.com...
obviously bix gets it's mailfeed via delphi. (they provide commercial
ip and usenet/mail feeds)

It was faked basically. A big clue is when it has "Apparently-To:" in
the header...
