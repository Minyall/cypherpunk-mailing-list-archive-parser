No, forging e-mail is not a taboo topic, but then again it doesn't buy
you anything if you're up against a smart person.  If you just forge
mail to me, most likely I can track you down to at LEAST the machine
you forged it from!

If you go through a remailer, then it strips the headers off, so its
not a problem.  But there is no reason to need to forge a message to a
remailer since it hides your identity in the first place.  That's its
job.
