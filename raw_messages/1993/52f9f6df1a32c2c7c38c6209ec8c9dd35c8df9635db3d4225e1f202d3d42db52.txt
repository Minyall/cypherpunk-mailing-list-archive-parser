I keep hearing about voice scrambling technology in conjunction
with high speed modems and soundblaster cards....

Anyone care to comment on the availability of said devices?

The Supra people mentioned something, I'll check into it.

how about the potential for RAW cyphertext from PGP?
Hiding cyphertext in other mediums...?

Is any of this available today?
