I would/will add to your list of things to cite:

1.	the gov't has never had a right to citizens' keys and citizens
	have always had strong cryptography -- so this sets a terrible
	precedent, even if it's voluntary;

2.	cyberspace should benefit from the same rights as physical space
	-- i.e., the right to assemble and converse in private;

3.	secrecy around the key generation procedure is totally unnecessary.
	Keys should be generated as totally random numbers.  The secrecy
	strongly suggests that the NSA intends to bypass the escrow mechanism,
	for example by having a secret function map from chip serial number to
	its secret key;

4.	the justification for this effort was citizens' need for security
	in cellular and wireless calls while retaining the FBI's ability to
	wiretap.  A superior engineering solution exists and doesn't carry
	the civil liberties infringements:  to encrypt normally (e.g., with
	double DES) the broadcast portion of a cellular or wireless call,
	but leave the call in the clear over phone lines.  Why did the
	government not encourage this solution?
