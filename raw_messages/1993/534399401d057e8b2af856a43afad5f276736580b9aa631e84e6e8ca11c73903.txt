This is correct. Before Caller ID came along, about the only group
backward enough to still be using Bell 202 are the amateur packet
radio folks. So if you happen to be a ham with a packet TNC and a lot
of spare time, you could consider reprogramming one to decode caller
ID. Of course, you still have to sign up for the service before the CO
will send you the data.

And if your time is worth anything to you, it'd be better to just buy one
of the modems that already has caller-ID built in.
