But modern high speed modems already do quite a bit of FEC. I really
don't think more is really necessary. As long as the decryptor and voice
decoder automatically resynchronize after an error, there's no real
problem with letting a few through. It's certainly preferable to adding
long (or variable) delay.

The sychronization problem seems to occur in "real" (government) secure
phones too. They take a second or two to unmute following loss of clock
synchronization. But not every bit error causes loss of clock synch;
only a really bad line will do that.
