Please explain to me, lefty, why you insist on flaming someone who simply 
wants to unsubscribe from the list. This is truly beyond comprehension. I had
thought for a moment that the cypherpunks were rising above petty, arrogant
slanders, but evidently I was wrong. Clearly uri and lefty wish to drag this
whole affair down to new depths. And why? Just to prove to everyone that you
can insert your head up your ass further than anyone can imagine?

You are truly pathetic.
