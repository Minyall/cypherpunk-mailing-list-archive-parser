IMHO, this is part of the answer to Perry's concerns regarding the
difficulty of getting it right.  Multiple digital CU's and other
similar projects will try different approaches; eventually creativity
and natural selection will evolve a usable system through market forces.
Although I have not had Perry's experience with this sort of thing,
I tend to agree with him that the magic will be in the details, and
mostly in the NON-technical details, making this an EXTREMELY difficult
project.  But lay on! I applaud your daring, and wish you success, and
recognize that even if you fail, you will have
contributed much in the process.
