  The list mailhost, toad.com, had massive problems today with
sendmail queues, resulting in load averages over 90 (on a machine
where 6 is high) and other unfun problems for me to chase.
  To my knowledge no mail was droped on the floor, but some mail did
come out of the machine with headders missing.  I have no idea what
the mail software thought it was doing by droping headers, but I think
we will live even so.
  I am looking at installing some newer software to deal with the
problems of today, though the root causes are solved for now, better
software (sendmail) is called for.
  On the other hand better software is ALLWAYS called for... Guess I
had better get back to doing that sort of work...
