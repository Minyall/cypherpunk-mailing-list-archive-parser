> A 1-900 number to ensure non-tracibility. Does anyone have this number?

I would not trust this for hiding from law enforcement.
You can get the 900 service's fone records with a warrant.
If not law enforcement, then who do you need this to hide from?
You can use a pay fone to fool caller-id boxes.  Well, I guess
they dont hide the city.
