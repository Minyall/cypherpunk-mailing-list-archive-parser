    I talked to Rob about this. What he's really looking for is not
really so much a spokesman for the PGP vs "Big Brother" type of
discussion, but rather someone who can discuss PGP key management
issues from a technical standpoint. He'd really like to find someone
who has dealt with managing a PGP key-server, thoroughly understands
the "web of trust" model used in PGP (contrasting it to the
certification authority hierarchy used in PEM) and is a good and
articulate public speaker. Being partisan for PGP is fine, but you'd
better be able to argue from a technical standpoint, not just an
ideological one.
