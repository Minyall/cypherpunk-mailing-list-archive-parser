Gosh, weren't we just talking about the suspension of requirement for
warrants in cases of `national security'? Below the FBI is posturing to
get access to credit records of `spies and terrorists' by writing only
a letter instead of the currently required warrant.

The FBI really scares me with the nonchalance and finesse with which
they keep introducing these unpleasant bills into Congress.

On page 7 of today's New York Times (_Saturday_, July 17) there is
a short article about the nation's inflated intelligence budget.

Buried in the article are two paragraphs describing another section of
the intelligence funding bill.  Tacked onto the bill is a provision to
allow the FBI to access the credit records of suspected "spies and
terrorists" by writing a letter rather than getting a search warrant
or other court order.

Your credit card bills and mortgage payments are rapidly becoming
police information.
