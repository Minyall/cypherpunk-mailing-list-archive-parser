Tony Robinson (who some of you might know already) - the author of the
lossless 'shorten' sound compression program - is working on an ADPCM
version.  Currently compresses at 3 bits per (8 bit) sample.  This plus
a sampling rate of 4000hz instead of 8000hz (keeping it easy, on a sun)
just squeezes in under the bandwidth limitation of v32bis, with a little
left over for protocol overhead.

PS Has the 'netphone' list died or did I just drop off when I moved house
like I lost my cypherpunks subscription?  I remember there was talk of
letting it drop because the situation seemed to be in control, but I haven't
seen much progress since on vat et al, and the underground effort to do
something on soundblasters that everyone said 'shut up about' has had more
than enough time to come up with the goods...
