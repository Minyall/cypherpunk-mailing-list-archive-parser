	I too have noticed a growing trend in the use of electronic money
for a wide range of transactions.  For example. I have an ATM card that
was issued on my checking account.  With it, I can make purchases at any
place displaying the Interlink symbol.  This includes gas stations, fast
food places, and a lot of common stores such as the Good Guys, Circuit
City, etc.
	Personally, I find this way of doing business a lot more
conveinent than carrying cash money.  No large demoninations to worry
about, and if you are robbed, they have to crack your PIN to use the card.
If they use a portabel reader, you could be screwed.  But, in most cases
you would have time to call customer service and cancel the card.
	I love progress.
