Subject: header field indicating an anonymous address

Marc R. suggests that we standardize on a header field to indicate
that a message was anonymous.

I suggest "Anon-Sender:".  There's already a "Sender:" field in
RFC-822, indicating who sent the message, as separate from who wrote
the message.  The "Anon-Sender:" field should contain an email address
for the maintainer of the remailer. 

Why? To facilitate complaints. :-)
