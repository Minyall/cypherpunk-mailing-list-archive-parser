The experiment I was proposing would possibly answer 'yes' to the
question "Is the number generation weak?"  It would not say how strong
it was, or even if it was strong.  it would, however, give some lower
bound on its strength or else show that it was in fact not very strong
at all.

Since we are talking about a device in which a sequence is duplicated
on two ends, I did not feel the need to belabor the difference between
pseudorandom and random.  The context makes it clear that this can't
be a random device based on a physically random process.

That bit of information may mean that a 10^4 sample test is not worth
doing.

That changes our trust from no trust at all into trust in your friend's
ability and your assessment of it. :-)

Granted.  Their keeping the keys is worth, say, using a linear
congruential generator (or worse) in terms of overall security.

I was merely curious as to whether they were fools on all fronts, as
opposed just to the secrecy front.
