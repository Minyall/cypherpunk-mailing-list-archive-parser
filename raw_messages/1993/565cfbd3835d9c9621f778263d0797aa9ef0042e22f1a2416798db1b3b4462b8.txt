Doesn't Fidonet have a long tradition of feuding and splitting
into "subnets", which is facilitated by the way they maintain their 
nodelist files? An excited Fido'er expalined it to me one night at usenix
several years ago, but I had little interest in pc networking then.
Perhaps a encryption ok subset of fidonet could form? Anyone who knows
more about this care to comment?
