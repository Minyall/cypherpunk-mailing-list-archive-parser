I have never forgotten this. But their commitment and efforts do not
amount to an amendment to federal law.

Under what legal theory do they get an ECPA exemption as a "completely

What they don't realize is that, rather than reducing the risk of legal

Any monitoring that results *directly* as a function of system maintenance
is okay--it's sanctioned by ECPA.

If they were really cautious, they'd talk to a lawyer before setting
policy based on some guess as to what their legal liabilities may be.
