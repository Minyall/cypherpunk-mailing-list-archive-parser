     Is this a problem on CypherPunks?  I havn't seen a single message here
that made me jump out of my seat and scream "I don't need to see this on
CypherPunks!"  It's not like we're getting continual junk posts advertising
trucks or something!  I say, "Don't let it bug ya until we start seeing a
junk trend on the list."  What do you guyz say?  TTFN!

Oh.. and I'm an AnArChIsT if anybody [including NSAs database] was
wondering.
