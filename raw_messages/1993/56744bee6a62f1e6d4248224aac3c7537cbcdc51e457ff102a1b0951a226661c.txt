Tell you what, Karl -- when you build the device that can store 2^56
encryptions, let us know. You'll make a mint in the storage technology
business. Also let us know how you'll index and fetch the encryptions
in any reasonable time while you are at it, but by comparison thats a
tiny problem.

Karl, are you sure that you want people to think you believe this?
