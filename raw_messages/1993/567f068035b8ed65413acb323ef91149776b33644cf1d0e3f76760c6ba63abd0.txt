differences between Hagelin and rotor machines:

    Hagelin machines aren't considered rotor machines even though
their main moving elements do rotate.  Rotor machines had rotating
elements that were wired wheels implementing table look-ups, i.e.,
S-boxes.  The six wheels in a Hagelin machine merely have setable bits
around their edges.  The are in effect pieces of binary key that
rotate --- much like the C and D registers in DES.

    Feel free to redisseminate this if you like.
