Due to threats of legal action from RSA, I have had to remove PGP from my
system.  Some time when I get the mess sorted out, non-patent-infringing
PGP/RSA/[your-fave-crypto-here] utilities, such as mail scripts, will still
be available, and I will post a message with the detail.  

I repeat, PGP *IS NOT* available from NitV-BBS any longer.  Do not call for
it you will be wasting your money and time.  Sorry, but the law is the law.
