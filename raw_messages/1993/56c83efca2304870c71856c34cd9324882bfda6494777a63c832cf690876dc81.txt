How does this make TA trivial?
I am assuming that batch mailings or staggered mailings are occuring.

The remailers are known locations so any traffic between mailers is
assumed to be observed.  The key is making it impossible to correlate
arrival and departure time of any particular message.  Am I missing
something?
