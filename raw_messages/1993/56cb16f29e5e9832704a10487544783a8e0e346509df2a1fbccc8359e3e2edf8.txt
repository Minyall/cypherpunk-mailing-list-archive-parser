How is it that Cert (which to my knowledge is an organization run by
Carnegie-Mellon in Pittsburg,PA (USA)) should come to have any influence
on a domain in finland? They are not to my knowledge a gov't organization
although they may be funded by some.. hmm. Doesn't their name stand for
computer EMERGENCY response taskforce or something like that? They should have
no business bothering you unless you requested some kind of assistance from
them, IMHO. The same goes for the berkeley site... I'd definitely be 
interested in hearing who they think they are working for and under whose
authority they are becoming netpolice.
