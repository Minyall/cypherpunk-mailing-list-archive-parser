Partly because there was no pre-existing railroad monopoly that was
blocking them from the market.

Of course, railroad interoperability is trivial, and can't easily be
altered to block entry. But it should be noted that "using the same rail
gauge" is only part of interoperability. I leave it to you to guess what
the other part is, and how a railroad monopoly can prevent entry of new
competition.

Please explain, specifically, how it's in a local telco's interest to
cooperate with an upstart Electric Company telco provider.

That's nice. But don't assume I'm not knowledgeable on these subjects.
