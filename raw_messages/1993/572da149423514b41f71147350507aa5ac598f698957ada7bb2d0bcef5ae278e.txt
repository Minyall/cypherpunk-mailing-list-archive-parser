L. Detweiler is an individual concerned with issues of identity on the 
Internet and various ways people use multiple identities to influence
others. He has coined a term, "pseudospoofing," that may be loosely 
defined as "Creating and using multiple fake identities for the purpose 
of misleading others, creating a false sense of 'consensus', and/or 
harassing one's enemies." Detweiler is quite passionate when espousing
his theories, and has precipitated a major uproar on this list in recent
weeks - what you're seeing on the list now is a lot of fallout from his
latest postings. He is also the author of a FAQ on privacy and anonymity,
a document held in high esteem by many. Several list members are convinced
that Detweiler also posts through an anonymous remailer as 'an12070'.
