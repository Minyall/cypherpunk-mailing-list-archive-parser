	I HIGHLY suggest that publishing-inclined cypherpunks start
publishing cypherpunk-oriented PAPER newsletters to:
	A) Get out the word about how Clipper sucks
	B) Educate people about strong crypto, in layman's terms (tough one)
	C) Raise public support for strong crypto.

	There are probably other reasons why we want to do this as well.
(When the discussion here was about technical details, I was greatly
interested, but I had nothing to say-- now that the time has come for
activism.. I feel that I can help..)
	The idea for full-page ads is nice. I'd advertise for raising funds
for such a venture in my libertarian-leaning newsletter.
