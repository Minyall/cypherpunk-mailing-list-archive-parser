Yes, and Germany.  There may be others.

They (the big 'they') tried this in Nevada several years ago, but stopped
after about 6 months.  It seems that the last picture a number of these
units took was of a pickup truck, license plate masked off, both driver
and passenger wearing ski masks, with the passenger weilding a baseball bat.

I guess it was pretty expensive.  ;-)

The ACLU was, at some point, challenging the practice of un-manned
units beaming radar at every car on the road, taking pictures of those
that were 'speeding'.
