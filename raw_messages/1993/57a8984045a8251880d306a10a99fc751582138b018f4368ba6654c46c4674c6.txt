No, I did not mean I can find the spares of a well constructed key.
And yes, the best key has at least one spare.
What I meant was, if I were the NSA and wrote the keygen for
a crypto system I could guarantee that each key would have
a huge number of spares.  Enough, that if I were the NSA I
could find them.

How to generate a weak RSA key:

	Start with a prime R
	S=R*2

L1	If S+1 is prime then P=S+1
	If S+1 Not prime S=S* next_odd_number   (3,5,7,9,11...)
		Loop to L1
   else

L2	If S+1 is prime then Q=S+1
	If S+1 Not prime S=S* next_odd_number
		Loop to L2
   else

	N=P*Q   #spare keys => 2*R					

In the example I gave R was 101  p=1+(101*2*3)  q=1+(101*2*2*3)
                      spare keys=606

There are many BETTER ways to make a keygen that will produce keys
the author can break.  RSA has no government trap door, but
I, and certainly the NSA can write a keygen that makes trap-doored
keys.  Ones YOU can't break, but I can, knowing my secret.

My example was a put-down of Denning's assurance that skipjack
is good.  RSA is good, skipjack MAY be good.  Look out for
booby trapped keys.
