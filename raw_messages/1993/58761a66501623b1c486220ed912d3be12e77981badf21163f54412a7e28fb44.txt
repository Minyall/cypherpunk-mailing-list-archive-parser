Eric, most of us know this stuff you are making yourself look very
unix  illiterate.  I know one person at berkeley who wrote a sh script
5 years ago that would track remote mail aliases by analising who (on
campus) who recived with close time stamps.  with this info he was able
to reverse engineer the containce of a lesbian emailing list.


I have a scipt I use the just reads the syslog file and prints out a list of
who is emailing who and what their total volume of mail is.
