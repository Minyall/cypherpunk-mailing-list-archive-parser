    "Having said all that, I do not shrink from personal responsibility for
what I have done in writing this book.  We stand at the brink of a new age,
an age made possible by the revolution that is embodied in the computer.
Standing on the brink, we could totter either way--to a golden age of
liberty or a dark age of tyranny, either of which would surpass anything
the world has ever known.  Perhaps no individual's efforts will make any
difference in the result, but we must never cease trying, for then the
result is sure to be tyranny.  This book is my effort against the tyranny,
the enslavement of men by other men and by their own ignorance.  Would
that it not be adopted by the forces of tyranny themselves, as no doubt
it will be.  Lacking that hope, I can only hope that its use to the other
forces will, in the balance, be greater."
