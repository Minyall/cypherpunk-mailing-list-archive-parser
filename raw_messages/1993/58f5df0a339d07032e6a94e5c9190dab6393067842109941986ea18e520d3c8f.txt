OK, so you ass*** tell me what I'm doing. And don't
forget to explain, why am I subjected to all this
crap about some ass***ish subscription, and why
my mailbox should receive junk mail from some
irresponsible participants? [Don't tell me,
that I've joined the club - since I have
a grievance with your silly rambling
here, by your logic I'm not liable
for this, you are...]
