AAAHHH!!!!  EXCELENT IDEA!!!

  Think about it.  It's a beautiful extension to PGP, the "I'm-being-coerced"
password.  Seems to work, but deletes everything irreparably(sp?).

  I don't think the PGP coders will put something like this in,
but the people in my RoD-cell will definately have it as soon as
I'm done. =)
