I think the T-shirt thing is a nice idea, and I think that the "Big Brother 
Inside" thing is also a nice idea, but I liked them better when they were 
separate. Wearing a shirt that suggests "big brother inside" seems like it 
might send the wrong message.

Dunno if there are enough of us in the world for it to be worth worrying 
about, but some of us Cypherpunks just laugh at L and XL T-shirt sizes; best 
fit for me is a XXXL-Tall. I might order an XL shirt to hang on my wall, but 
it's unlikely it'll ever hang on me. :)

The "celebrating 400 years .." thing sounds wonderful. Would make a neat 
poster/flyer, too.
