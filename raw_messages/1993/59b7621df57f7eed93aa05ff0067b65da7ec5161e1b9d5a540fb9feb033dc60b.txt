Most states have laws that specifically assign liability to bartenders
for serving intoxicated patrons. That is why they are liable in this
instance. The rule does not generalize, however. A supermarket is not
liable for the heart attack that an overweight patron gets from eating
too much ice cream, for instance, since there is no law specifically
altering the default legal rules to assign liability in such an instance.

Thats true, but in this instance they are not unreasonable.
