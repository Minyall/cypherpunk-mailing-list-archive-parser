People interested in fingerprinting anonymous posters might be interested in a
Markov tuple analysis program that was posted to the net eons ago.  It should
be in the '85 or '86 comp.sources under the name markov3.  I recall that this
was a program that fed enough posts from a given poster would create another
post in their "style"; it was kinda fun.
