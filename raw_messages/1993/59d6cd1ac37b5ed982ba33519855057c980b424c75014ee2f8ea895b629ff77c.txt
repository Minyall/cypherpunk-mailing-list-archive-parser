>>>Note that a court could cite you for contempt for not complying

>>>or documents) if you fail to turn over subpoenaed backups.

Assume that your application is running (mirrored) on five machines in 
five different jurisdictions and the machines will lock out one or more 
of their number if they receive a panic code, or one goes offline 
unexpectedly, or is not accessed in exactly the right way, you could 
easily respond to a subpoena duces tecum by stating truthfully that the 
requested records are not (or are no longer) under your control.

The machines themselves can also be protected by careful choice of 
location and judicious use of remailers and requirements that they only 
be accessed by telenetting, etc.

Besides what's the big deal about contempt of court.  If you are worried 
about doing 2 years or less, locate yourself in another jurisdiction.  
No need to expose your body to high risk legal regimes.
