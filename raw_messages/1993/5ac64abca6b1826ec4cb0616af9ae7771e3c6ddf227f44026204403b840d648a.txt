As a Second Amendment activist, I am particularly aware of the dangers
of an instant-input viewer poll bearing the weight of law following a
particularly disgusting piece of BooHoo/Advocacy Broadcast Journalism.
.   Though I don't see how this is directly relevant to the cypherpunks
thang, I do know that I am horrified at the potential for abuse inherent
in the "electronic Town Hall" concept. I also find that most computer
folk have wild enthusiasm for this idea while bearing no inkling of the
ease with which the process could be subverted.
