It looks like I'll be making a set of Big Brother inside T-shirts,
and I would like to ask for slogan ideas....

The ones that I like so far are:

"They can have my private key when they pry it from my cold, dead hands."

"When privacy is outlawed, only outlaws will have privacy."

thanks,
