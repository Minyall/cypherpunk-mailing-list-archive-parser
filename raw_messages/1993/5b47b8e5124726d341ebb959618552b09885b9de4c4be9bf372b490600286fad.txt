This is true.  We are not trying to do this alone.  We are working with a
major local credit union to be able to handle these sorts of things.  We
also have people involved who have some real experience in this area.  I
guess I will say that we are trying to cover all of the bases as best we
can (if you want a real fun mind-warp examine commercial paper and
electronic wire transfer law...) and that we are going to do something.
Enough has been bounced around in conversation here, we are going to try to
get something done now...
