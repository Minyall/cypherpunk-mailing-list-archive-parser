     True, it will make tracing the mail extremely simple if nothing is
done to strip the signature out.  Where I disagree is where Hal appears to
disagree--it is too simple to accidentally cut off the rest of your message
by putting a line starting with "--" in your message.  I think a "kill line"
would be best.  Anything after that line is ignored.
