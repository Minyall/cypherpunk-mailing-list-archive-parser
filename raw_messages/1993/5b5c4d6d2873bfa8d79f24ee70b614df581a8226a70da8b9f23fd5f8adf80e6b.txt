All this talk of booby-traps reminds me of this booby-trap expert who
had written books and had his house set up completely.  He was found 
dead one day when one of the traps got him...

[This anecdote is vaguely remembered from a short note in Whole Earth Review.
I remember seeing a review in the '70s on the book itself when it was 
originally reviewed.]
