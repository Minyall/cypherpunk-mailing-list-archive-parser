I really, *REALLY* hope that this argument doesn't catch on.
Regardless of your opinions on gun control, you have to admit that
linking crypto to weapons saddles it with an enormous amount of
political baggage that we simply doesn't need. And it plays right into
the hands of those in the government who consider it as a "munition"
for export control purposes.

I think we already have plenty of strong arguments in defense of the
right to encrypt without opening up this can of worms. It can only
turn off a lot of people who would otherwise support us.
