I understand the predictament and security that it entails. However, I am
not sure as I understand you, that this is a good solution. Let's say if
everyone jumps on the cryptographic bandwagon, how does the web of trust
help out the end user who's feelings have been hurt? Or if the user is not
in the web of trust does that eliminate their information from the field?

Sorry, its late and I probably should'nt post but what the hell.
Probably get flamed in the morning.

>Does this make any sense?

I decided for about 2 weeks to accept only PGP messages as authenticated, so
to speak -- and it sucked even friends that have PGP and such would not
go in for the idea of a total security blanket.

Just my .02, probably give another .02 in the next 12 hours.
