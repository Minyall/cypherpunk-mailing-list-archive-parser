Local boy makes good at home.  The Federal Grand Jury's PGP/RSA test
case, as reported in the NYT has hit full circle here in Boulder.
Boulder's own Paul Danish (former editor and writer for Soldier of
Fortune magazine, based in Boulder) has come out in support of PGP/privacy
issues with an excellent op-ed piece in today's Colorado Daily.

The Colorado Daily is read by over 50,000 students, fac/staff and
residents of Boulder and the Univ. of Colorado.  Danish's piece
does an amazing job of backgrounding the issues, presenting them
in layman's terms, and he even goes into the Clipper chip proposal.

Could it be that the NSA/U.S. Customs investigation is causing a
huge backlash of public support in favor of PGP?
