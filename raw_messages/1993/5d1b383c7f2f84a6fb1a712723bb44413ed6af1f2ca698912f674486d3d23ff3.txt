Today's NY Times says that Novell and a bunch of other companies (including
AT&T, but I haven't been able to track down any details yet) *and*
the British Ministry of Defense are going to announce a new crypto
standard.  The article indicated that RSA and DES were going to be
used, and portrayed the announcement as a rebuff to Clipper.
