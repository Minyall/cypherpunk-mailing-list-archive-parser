        "Proof Positive"? I didn't see any proof of anything except the fact 
that "S. Boxx" has enough time on his hands to repost messages that the list 
members have already read. Did anyone see any proof of anything (or even any 
hint of what he was getting at)? Please let me know if I'm missing something 
here.
