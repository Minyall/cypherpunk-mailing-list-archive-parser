  Balderdash. Key is just another Freudian conspiracy theorist. I found some
of the descriptions in his book laughable to absurd. His theories don't
pan out if you talk to anyone in the advertising business. Hidden messages
are noise compared to other dominate factors like humor and flashy
graphics. _Clam-Plate Orgy_ is an example of Key's imaginative and vulgar
mind, not science. (was anyone aroused by this image? Even after
he drew in the little outlines, I still had trouble seeing anything
worth a hormonal response. I also hate clams.)

  The subliminal movie images story is bunk, urban legend.

  I hope you didn't buy any of those $39.95 subliminal tapes from
infomercials.

  Could it be that subliminal information effects have been found to be
practically null also? I guess Key's asburd claims fit right into the
psychology of a leftist conspiracy theorist. I wonder if the Bilderburgers
are involved?

HELP, I'm being put into a _psychological vice_ by pseudospoofers! My
urine is being sapped out of my bladder by viscious anonymous abusers!
And now, I am being controlled by advertisements containing assorted 
penile and vaginal shapes!
