This is even more dangerous than storing it on the disks of a multi-user
machine.  Unless you are running in a kerberos environment it is trivial to
snoop your upload off the network, and even without that weakness you are
exposing yourself to the same problem that the docs mention (it is really
pretty easy to scan someone's terminal input) only you are giving them the
key outright instead of only giving them the passphrase to your key.

Bad idea.
