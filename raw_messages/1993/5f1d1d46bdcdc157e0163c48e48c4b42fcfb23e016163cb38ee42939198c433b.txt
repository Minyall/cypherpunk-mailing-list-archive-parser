The one comment I'd make on the wolves vs sheep analogy is this.  In the
real world, there *are* wolves and sheep.  Violence and coercion are part
of life.  Democracy, in a sense, recognizes the power implicit in large
numbers of people.  If they can't vote, they may revolt.  No libertarian
government will survive without the acceptance of the masses.

A populace willing to countenance a Libertarian society would perhaps be
wise enough to be entrusted with democracy, anyway.
