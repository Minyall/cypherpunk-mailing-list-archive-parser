As I recall, "writable" CD rom's not erasable.  When you "write
over" a file, the file system simply makes a note to the affect
that that old file should be ignored, but doesn't actually erase
and reclaim the space used by it.

Of course I may be confusing writable CD rom with a WORM type file
system.
