        I'd just like to add a comment on the question of NPR's biases. Yes, 
they do get most of their funding from the govt, which leads them to take a 
stance on some issues which agrees with the govt position. On the other hand, 
virtually the entire mainstream media would be considered biased in favor of 
the govt by this standard.
        In fact, NPR has a very good journalistic record, and many of its 
reporters have proven themselves willing to take on the government when they 
feel the government is wrong.
        Another factor in this equation is the fact that this list does not 
exactly reach a wide audience, politically or population-wise. We are (as TC 
May eloquently put it when responding to one of my posts) preaching to the 
choir here (and a relatively small choir at that). The rest of the world does 
not necessarily see things the way we do, and we aren't likely to get much 
sympathy from the owners of commercial media outlets.
        Basically, I think that NPR is the best we're going to get, as far as 
good exposure is concerned. Yes, they have their faults, but I challenge anyone 
to show me a single major national media outlet that doesn't.
