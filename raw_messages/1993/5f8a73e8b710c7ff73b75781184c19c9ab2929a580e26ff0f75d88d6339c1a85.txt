two short comments about the macworld privacy issue

we have a long lead time and the column about digital telephone
(oops, telephony) was in before the clipper stuff broke

and eric, while correct about Mitch Ratcliffe being a fine
reporter who is totally on top of privacy stuff, has the
publication wrong - Mitch is with MacWeek, not Macworld.
Easy to confuse.
