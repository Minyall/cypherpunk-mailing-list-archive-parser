Remote control via pagers is subject to false-positives, i.e. you'd need a
passcode to activate it or otherwise the first wrong number which dialed
your pager would wipe you out... and also, you're not in any position to
dial your pager if some hypothetical robber was holding you hostage while
trying to get at your data.
