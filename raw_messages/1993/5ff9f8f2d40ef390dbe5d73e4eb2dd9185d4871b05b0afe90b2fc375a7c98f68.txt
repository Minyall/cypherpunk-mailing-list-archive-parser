In general, I agree that petitions are a major waste of time and energy;
I'm also pretty convinced that this White House email link is a big scam.
Why are they any more likely to take your mail seriously just because it
comes over the phone lines and not in an envelope?  Seems like a pretty
transparent PR ploy (also an attempt to make it seem like the White House
isn't a bunch of dinosaurs now that everybody and her nephew has an email
address).

But since it won't take much more than a couple of minutes of any of our
time, I can't see an electronic petition hurting our cause any--especially
because it'll certainly include the names of many esteemed professionals
and braniacs with fancy scientific, corporate, and academic credentials.
I think this could be a nice propaganda coup if it got publicised.

It could at the very least give a big black eye to the forces of evil.
