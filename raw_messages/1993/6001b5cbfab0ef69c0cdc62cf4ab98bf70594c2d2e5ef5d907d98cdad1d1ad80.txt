X/Open is based in Reading, Berkshire (a short walk from my office). Urban
sprawl hasn't quite connected Reading and London yet.

X/Open doesn't integrate UNIX implementations; it publishes specifications
for a Common Application Environment and defines branding schemes which
permit users to use an independent yardstick to measure the openness of
vendors' systems.

Apart from hinting that material considered to be munitions by US law may
actuallly be available and in use outside the US (through the presence of
interfaces such as crypt(), setkey(), and encrypt() in XPG4), I can't think
of any relevance of X/Open's work to the burdens which cryptographic export
controls may impose on US companies.

Note that similar export constraints as are enjoyed in the US are applied
by the national authorities of the UK, and other countries .
