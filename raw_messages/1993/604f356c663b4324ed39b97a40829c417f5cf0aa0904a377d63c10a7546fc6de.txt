For those awaiting my promised comments regarding this chip, I
have the disappointing report that the individual I
anticipated talking to was out of his town, and so not
available today.

If you have the data sheets for this chip, and have read them,
I would be very interested to see your comments. Please
respond to me directly, rather than the list at large, since
my intent in this exercise it to replace deduction with
disclosure, and avoid spreading any mis- or partial
information.

-a2.
