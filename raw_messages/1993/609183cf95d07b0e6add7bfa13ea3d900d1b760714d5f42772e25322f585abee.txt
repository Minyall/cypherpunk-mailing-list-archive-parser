Anon.penet.fi has supported the Sender: field from the start. This has
forced me to use an automatic script that send a message like this:
(it gets to handle 20-30 messages/day)

I don't think this was intended for me (anon@penet.fi, the anon server
administrator, also working under names "daemon" and "julf"). I suppose you
wanted to send it to an<something>@anon.penet.fi, but accidentally replied to
the envelope "Sender:" address instead of the "From:" orginator address...
