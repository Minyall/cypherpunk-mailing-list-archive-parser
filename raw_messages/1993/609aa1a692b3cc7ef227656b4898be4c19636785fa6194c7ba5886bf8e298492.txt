Nothing.  Just like the First National City Bank of New York or Bank Leu,
Zurich.  You should deal with someone with a rep and perhaps a history.
Obviously the risk of fraud would be greater with a digital cash issuer 
completely unconnected to an existing financial institution. 

>>>OECD?

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.  AKA the rich 
countries (plus Turkey).  The 12 EEC Countries (we can all name them, 
can't we? %{) + Canada, US, Japan, AU, NZ, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, 
Finland, Austria, Switzerland, and Turkey.

That's not a bug that's a *feature*.  Those are the main arguements in 
*favor* of DC.  The main argument that DC can use against D.C. is that 
conventional regulatory techniques have been obsoleted by the nets, 
downsizing effects *all* sorts of institutions not just corporations, and 
the denizens of the District had better start figuring out what they will 
do when they are forced to get honest work.
