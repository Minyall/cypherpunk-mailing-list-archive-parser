With a key K of size j (goddamn fortran anyway), i parties can share
the secret with a threshold of i (requiring all i parties key part)
by generating i parts P such that K = Pi XOR Pi-1 XOR ... P1.  All
the parts P are the same size as K, which keeps the effort of guessing
a missing part equal to j, or the size of the key k itself. 

Such a scheme is not ideal for keys K that have a deterministic
characteristic.
