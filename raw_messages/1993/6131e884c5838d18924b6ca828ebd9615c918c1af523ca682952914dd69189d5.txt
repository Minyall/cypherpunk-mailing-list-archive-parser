Cypherpunks,

I'd like to announce the Cypherpunks Gopher Site - dedicated to
putting up information for access, and meant to be a list resource.

I'm running the gopher site at chaos.bsu.edu, thanks to Chael Hall,
who graciously donated an account to me to be used for any and all
projects.  This is something I've been wanting to do for quite some
time but have been unable to.  But now I have an account and a
sympathetic system administrator...!

Chaos.bsu.edu is 147.226.53.28, and the port is 2000.  That is port
2000 and not the usual port 70 - when Chael and I have some more time
I will ask him to perform the various and necessary incantations
(chown) and I'll move it to the usual place.

So: try 'gopher 147.226.53.28 2000' and browse around.

The site doesn't have much stuff yet...  I plan to add more
information sometime in the future.  Currently the site consists of
some old back articles from the list, some faq's, etc.  I plan to sift
for more stuff, especially Clipper related, and add it in.

In posting back articles, I have attempted to give proper credit at
the BOTTOM of the article, unless a signature already appears.  I
figure that posts sent to the list are meant to be seen, but if the
original author of something wants is taken off, mail me.  If lots of
people want stuff removed, I'll probably just solve the whole problem
with 'rm -rf ~/gopher-data'

I will sift through my archives of the list, incomplete as they are,
and add files when I have time.

Direct questions to: klbarrus@owlnet.rice.edu
