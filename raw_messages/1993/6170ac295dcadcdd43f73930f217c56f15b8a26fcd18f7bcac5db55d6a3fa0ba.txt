Hm.  We seem to have a duplication of effort here.  I am currently working
with s_duck@pinetree.org on the same sort of thing that you describe.
Right now we're having problems fooling DOS with the virtual EXE.  However,
the encryption algorithm used is IDEA -- the same one as PGP uses.

I suggest we pool our efforts and swap ideas/source code.
