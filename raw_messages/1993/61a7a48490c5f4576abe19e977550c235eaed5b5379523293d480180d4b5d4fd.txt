  I just uploaded  
    ami-link1.0lha
    ami-link1.0-src.lha
    link1.0.tar.Z
    link.readme

to the soda.berkeley.edu cypherpunks/incoming directory.

link.readme says:
----------------------

Link1.0
--------
  Link is a protocol designed to provide a secure link over a serial
channel.  At this time there are ends only for Amiga and Unix.  The
protocol grabs input bytes,  encrypts them with DES and frames them
in packets for transfer over a serial channel.  The protocol also
allows transfers of random DES keys over the channel encrypted
with the RSA algorithm.  Key exchange happens automatically at
startup (in the future there will be options to change keys
mid-session).  The client end written for Amiga is a vt100 terminal
emulator.  The server end written for Unix opens a pty and executes
a shell.

link1.0.tar.Z       :
  This file contains the protocol engine and server to be run on
the Unix end.  Also contains docs on the protocol engine.
Tested on HPUX and SunOS (compiled and tested minimally on an
Ultrix at one point in time)

ami-link1.0.lha     :
  This file contains the protocol engine and client to be run on
the Amiga end.  Contains minimal docs pertaining to setup.
  
ami-link1.0-src.lha :
  Contains the source for the amiga end.
