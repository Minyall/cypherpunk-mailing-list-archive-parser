Virago is a "feminist" publisher in the UK.  A few years ago, they brought 
out (to wide critical praise) a collection of short stories about 
immigrant life in the UK by a new Asian (means from the Indian 
subcontinent in the UK) woman.  They had never met her and were very 
embarrassed when "she" turned out to be a retired, male vicar.  Seems like 
a good idea to use a pseudonym in this case.  I guess that is the use you 
meant about "putting out opinions not my own."

Whenever I want to do that I just switch to lawyer mode.
