Frankly, I'm surprised no one has pointed out the obvious solution, so
I guess I'll have to.

Spielberg and Company clearly needed to protect their transmissions
using the "Stego" program of Romana Machado. By packing the real
content of the "Jurassic Park" communications into MPEG transmissions
of "Barney," the circle would be completed.

Just my least significant bit.
