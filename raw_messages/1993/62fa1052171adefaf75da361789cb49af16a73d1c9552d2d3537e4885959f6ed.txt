Subject: Articulation of PGP point of view?

Is there anyone who has, or is able to, articulate
the PGP point of view for public key management and
compentently contrast it to the PEM point of view?

Is there, perhaps, someone who has written on this
subject or spoken publicly in an organized fashion?

I am seeking such a person for a presentation and
panel discussion at an international conference.

I need names ASAP!

Please feel free to forward this message to
appropriate newsgroups.
