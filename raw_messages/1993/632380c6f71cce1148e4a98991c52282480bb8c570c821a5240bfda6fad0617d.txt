Of course, this doesn't make the UNIX versions of PGP useless. There
is absolutely no reason why you can't run your own personal Unix
box. Really all you need is a 386 machine with Linux or 386BSD.

The nice thing about the UNIX/Linux setup, is that you can still use
all the UNIX tools to send/receive encrypted mail (your favourite
mail user agent+pgp/ripem+UUCP+sendmail/smail) in a convenient way
without messing with MSDOS.
