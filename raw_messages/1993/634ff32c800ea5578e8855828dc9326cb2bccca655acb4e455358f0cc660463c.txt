For a broad introduction to information theory, coding, and their
applications in cryptography, I reccommend _Codes_and_Cryptgraphy_
by Dominic Welsh (Oxford Science Publications, ISBN 0-19-853288-1
and ISBN 0-19-853287-3 Pbk).  Some topics: information theory,
noiseless coding theory, noisy channels, error-correcting codes,
source theory, natural language structure, one-time pads,
computational complexity, public key systems (RSA, Knapsacks,
Rabin, Elgamal), authentication and digital signatures
(Diffie-Lamport, Rabin), Diffie-Helman key exchange, and
random numbers and random cryptsstems.
