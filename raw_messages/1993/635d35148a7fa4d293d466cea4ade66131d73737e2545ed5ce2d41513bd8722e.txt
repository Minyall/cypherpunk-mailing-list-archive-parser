My answer is simple: the alternative is worse.  Anarchy is
usually very uncomfortable, unless you have more guns and
money than anyone else.  Also, the current US government is,
at it's core, based on sound principles.  If it crashes and
burns, what is it more likely to be replaced by?

Whether you like it or not, you live in and are supported by
a society, in a myriad of ways.  The maintenance and improve-
ment of that society, and the betterment of your fellow human
beings, ought to be a primary goal.  It is for me.

And finally, Sameer Parekh opines:

A good suggestion.  I've made my point, and perhaps infected
a few people with a meme or two.  Time to shut up.

Best,
