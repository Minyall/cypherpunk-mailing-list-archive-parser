Intellectual Marvels and Omniscient Beings,
     I am looking for some books on advanced bit manipulation techniques,
matrix manipulation algorithms, and variant functions. Does anyone have a
good bibliography?
     Also, if you have the source code for any of these things, I would be
interested in seeing it.

Thank you very much!
