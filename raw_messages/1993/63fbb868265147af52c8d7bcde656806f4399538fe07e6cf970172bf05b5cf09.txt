	What about reverse 'stealthography' where instead of first creating
your message, then attempting to create some larger ody of text in which to
hide the message, one would first generate the message to be hidden, then 
take an existing body of text (something large enough, like Shakespear's
MacBeth) and then attempt to find some concise algorithm by which the
recieving end would extract the message?
