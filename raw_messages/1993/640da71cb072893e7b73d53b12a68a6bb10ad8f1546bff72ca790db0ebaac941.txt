As I've gotten several requests and inquiries about such a t-shirt, I may
actually look into making it (the "CYPHERPUNK CRIMINAL" shirts, in case
you missed it).  Send me mail if interested, I'm just stuffing queries
into a folder and saving them until I see if it's feasible or not.

Who was it that was also working on a t-shirt idea some while back?  Drop
me a line - what did you find out as far as costs, etc. go?   

Needless to say, this is NOT an EFF project.
