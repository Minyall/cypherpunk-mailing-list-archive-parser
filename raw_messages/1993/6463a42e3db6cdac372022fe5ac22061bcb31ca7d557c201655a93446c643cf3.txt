In fact, if the bank signs a committment to give you a particular
coin, the bank can't claim to have never received your request.  For
high value transactions where timeliness is a concern, this prevents
the bank from claiming that they didn't get the original request and
thus making a "delay of service" attack against you.  Delay of service
is the denial of the service of timeliness.
