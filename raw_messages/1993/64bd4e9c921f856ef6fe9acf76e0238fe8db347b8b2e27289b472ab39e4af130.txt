They thought of this. The Skipjack algorithm is programmed into the
chip at the same time the escrowed keys are. If you steal the unprogrammed
chips you may learn the list of basic operations that are part of
Skipjack. However there are also basic operations implemented on the
chip which are *not* part of Skipjack but are there just to confuse
someone who would disassemble a chip.

Btw. This also means that the actual chip assembly line does not require
cleared workers.
