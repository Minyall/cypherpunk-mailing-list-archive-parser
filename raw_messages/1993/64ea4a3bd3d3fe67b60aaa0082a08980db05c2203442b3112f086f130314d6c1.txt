>the keys...In plain English...And keys' fingerprints...

I can automatically transmit all the data in Japanese
or several foreign languages if you'd like, thanks
to Macintalk and foreign language CD training discs...

Hmmm.. that's an idea.. I could legally start QSTing
the entire public key database worldwide in your
choice of languages... I bet THAT would drive the NSA/FBI
absolutely nuts...  I guess I will attempt a test of that
tomorrow during the cypherpunks radio net.

For you code freaks, I can just as easily set up
"code practice" by piping it all through supermorse
at 13wpm -- sure beats those guy who send 20hrs
of Biblical scripture through.
