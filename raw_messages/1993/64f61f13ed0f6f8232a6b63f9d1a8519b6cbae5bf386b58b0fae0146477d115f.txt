The FCC can already regulate what is on any broadcast medium that
is FCC regulated, (Tobacco Ads, for example).

The ONLY way, IMHO, to have a national data highway (not regulated
and thus censored by the FCC) is to have it operated by the post office.

Since I don't want the government opperating any data network I feel
the result will be freedom of "broadcast" IS DEAD.

E.g., I can send Tim live porno from my home, but as soon as I make it
available on a point to multi-point basis, the FCC steps in....
