THUS SPAKE Timothy Newsham <newsham@wiliki.eng.hawaii.edu>:
# The audience would probably be bigger as as well.

and quality would degrade.    News and mail may look the
same, but the social effects are quite different.

# Any counter arguments?

Yeah.  Gene Spafford often says that newsgroups are no way to get
things done.  However I think that mailing lists can be rather
effective.

I think you're saying that your problem is that your newsreader is a
lot better than your mailreader.  Perhaps you can fix the problem...
