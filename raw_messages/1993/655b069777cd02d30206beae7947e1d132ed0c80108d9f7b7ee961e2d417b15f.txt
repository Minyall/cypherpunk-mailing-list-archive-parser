Some axed about MacPGP2.3: it's already on the soda site, as are the 2.3a
versions for DOS and Unix.  I have no clue if this is in anyway related
to the "PGP 2.3a" OS/2 port; I tend to doubt it; I think the porter just
named it that.  Anyone seen new ports for other OSs?  Like Archimedes,
VMS, etc.?  Windows even? Amiga?
