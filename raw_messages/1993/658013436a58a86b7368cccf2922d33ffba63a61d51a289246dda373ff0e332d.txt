Actually, I do not disagree with your fundamental points. Jim Bidzos
is not, fundamentally, an enemy of privacy. He's just in a difficult
position because his livelyhood comes from selling patent licenses.

If a program existed that was legal and freely distributed like RIPEM
but ran as fast as PGP and offered the "web of trust" model of PGP,
I'd use it immediately.
