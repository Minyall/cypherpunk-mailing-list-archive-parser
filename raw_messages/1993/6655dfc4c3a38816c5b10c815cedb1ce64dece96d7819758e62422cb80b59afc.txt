Geez, I can't beleive I forgot to consider that responding to me will
result in a steady stream of anonymous id allocations.

Guess I was caught sleeping on that one!

Back to the better cryptographically protected cypherpunk remailers
and Hal's "constructed" anonymous addresses...and I better ask the
administrators at pax and penet to wipe out some allocated id's :-)
