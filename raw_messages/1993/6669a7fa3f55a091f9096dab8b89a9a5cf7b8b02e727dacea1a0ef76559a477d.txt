Why don't you just do the following, which would serve everyone's 
interests, and would be well within the spirit of the movement:

1) Encourage the existing plan to have *all* PGP keys served.

2) Provide a service (possibly for a small fee) wherein people could 
   send you copies of their PGP key along with a notarized statement.

3) Sign those keys with your key, or a key you generate for this
   purpose. 

4) (optionally) provide a service mapping from keys -> Real Names,
   for the ultra-paranoid.

People who share your concerns about pseudospoofing would make you
their most trusted (or only trusted) signer of keys. Presto. Those
who care, can believe only those keys signed by you are real. Those
who don't give a damn, believe what they want.
