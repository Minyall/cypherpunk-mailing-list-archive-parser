Unfortunately, last time I checked, they used a fairly short internal
PRNG to generate the "noise" (which means it's not noise at all, it's 
completely correllated and repeating, it just _sounds_ like noise to
a human ear.

To get real random noise, try using a transistor "backwards", as a 
zener diode.  Then look at the voltage- it's quite "noisy", esp. if you
use a decent-sized series resistor (try 100Kohms).
