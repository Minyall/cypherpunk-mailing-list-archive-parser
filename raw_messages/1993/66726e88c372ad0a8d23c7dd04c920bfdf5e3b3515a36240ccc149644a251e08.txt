   Simple. Privatize those parts of government so they can chose
the services they want to buy. Rather than confiscate their money
for whatever subjective "share" is in vogue. (I've never seen this
share defined objectively. Just rants "they must pay more!!!  wah!!" Even in
other countries with much higher rates than our 36%, people are still demanding
more. )
