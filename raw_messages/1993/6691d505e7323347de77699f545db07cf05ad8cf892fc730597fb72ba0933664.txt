The problem may be the Fidonet addressing.  Many times I have tried to
send mail to people with mailing addresses like M's, and not had the
mail get through.  I don't know what the rules are but perhaps some systems
can get it and some can't.

I'd suggest to M. that he take one of the systems that does respond to his
remailing requests, and have that be the LAST one in a chain of two.  So,
he could send to, say, hh@cicada.berkeley.edu, and follow that with 
elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu.  Perhaps this would get through:

To: hh@cicada.berkeley.edu

::
Request-Remailing-To: elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu

::
Request-Remailing-To: M..Stirner@f28.n125.z1.FIDONET.ORG

Even if cicada can't mail to him, perhaps it can mail to rosebud which can
then mail to Fido.
