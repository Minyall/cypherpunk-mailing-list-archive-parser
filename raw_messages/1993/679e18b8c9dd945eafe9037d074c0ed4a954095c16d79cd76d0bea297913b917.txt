I forgot to mention I will take suggestions for what to place at the
gopher site - for example, what 10 or so Clipper articles from the
archives at soda.berkeley.edu MUST be available?  I haven't read them
all and won't have the time for the forseeable future to do so.

Pointers and suggestions to other docs and files are welcome.  Should
I put stuff like appropriate rfc's and documentation (pgp and ripem,
etc.) or not?  All of this is subject to disk space and it may be I'll
give preference to shorter items.

I am leaning towards including the rfc's for PEM and the two for
Rivest's MD4/MD5 hash algorithms.
