There is an even simpler solution.  Encrypt your message as you
normally would, and what do you end up with?  A bunch of seemingly
random bits.  Wrap a little header around it claiming it is data from
a Johnson-Noise measurement experiment, or some such thing.  To
increase plausibility, you can build yourself a Johnson Noise
measurement aparatus (all you need is a high-sensativity voltmeter and
a resistor).
