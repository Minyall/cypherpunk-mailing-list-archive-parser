I have half a mind to get a FIDO account, try to send a message the
sysop doesn't understand so he'll stop it, and then call the U.S.
Attorney's office.

Actually, I wouldn't ever do that -- my libertarian ethics stop me,
since there is no real contract to get private mail between me and the
operator, never mind how stupid what is is doing is. However, the law
is the law. Disagreeing with it or consciously deciding to violate it
is one thing, but smug amateur lawyering in which you pretend that it
isn't supposed to apply to you is another.
