paul, my thoughts in (extremely) brief:

i applaud your resolve to correct what you saw to be wrongdoing.

i totally disagree with you on the merits of the case; i think the
civil servant runing the bbs (i forget her name) provides a valuable
service, and serves the common good.

as usual, anonymity is a lightning rod here, although it is largely
peripheral to the real issues.
