Re "NY Tel cutting off payphone service in *some areas.*" 

You can bet those areas are black.  You can bet that high up in some
corporate office tower, the opinion was voiced, "what the hell do those
pickaninnies need phones for anyway?!"  Call it Information-Age Apartheid if
you wish, you won't be off the mark by much.
