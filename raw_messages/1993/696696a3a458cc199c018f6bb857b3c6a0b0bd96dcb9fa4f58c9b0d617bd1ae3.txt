I know of several anonymous remailers: would it not be a good idea to "link up"
several of these hosts so that one mails the first remailer, which mails another
and so on and so on.... This would be a real pain in the butt to retrace, as
surely the owner info wont be rubber hosed out of all of the host bosses....
