I may have already answered your letter about telix scripts, etc., so
pardon me if this is a duplicate.

The pgp developers maintain a collection of utilities that integrate
pgp into various other pieces of software.  You should send your stuff
to Phil Z. and he'll forward it to the right people.  It may be added
to the contrib directory of the next release.
