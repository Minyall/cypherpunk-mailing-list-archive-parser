	Hmmm..... actually I must disagree with this.  The NSA may oppose strong
	crypto, but a few facts should be brought up:
	
		1)  The NSA is not chartered for domestic surveillance work.  If
		    you discover the NSA watching you within the US you can have
		    them arrested.  They are probably more interested in the
		    systems being put in use around the world and less about
		    systems internal to the U.S.

According to the Bill of Rights Foundation Booklet "CIA OFF CAMPUS"
Ex-President Reagan signed in 1981 Executive order # 12333 Which
permits the CIA to operate domestically against US citizens if
it is believed that said citizen is either an agent of a foreign power
or acting on behalf of same. Since this definition has been used during
COINTELPRO to allow one to have associates /friends that are foreign born
to cause one to be subject to a whole range of unconstitutional activities
performed by said agencies. BTW ANY federal intelligence agencie will
act as a "cutout" for situations where the prime agency cannot operate legally
but another can. 

 I believe a FOIA is in order to find out if E.O. #12333 allows the entire
national security apparatus to operate or only the CIA...
