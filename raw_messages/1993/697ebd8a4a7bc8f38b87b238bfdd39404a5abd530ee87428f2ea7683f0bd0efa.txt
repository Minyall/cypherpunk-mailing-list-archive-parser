	 For those of you looking around for a good cypherpunk-style project, a
	 rewrite of RSAREF with an identical interface (external and some of
	 the internal) would be a good idea.  Such a body of code would prevent
	 RSADSI from using copyright as leverage against a non-US company or
	 person.

It would be even nicer if this was done by someone outside the US.
This avoids the export problem.
