Wow,
 
  When the cypherpunks have a physical meeting cyberspace fills with an erie
silence...
 
  Please for those of us who could neither attend the various meetings nor
hook up with other transmissions, could ONE person post a good summary.
 
My Mailbox was actually empty thisafternoon!!!
 
Matt
