Ummm...
 
Thats not a PGP message ya got thare, but rather someone who likes
to type gibberish and send it as a message.  Look at your keyboard
and then look at the message.  Now keep your hands in the normal position
and type random (pseudo) keys.  Hmm...I tend to hit 'sadf' an awful lot too.
