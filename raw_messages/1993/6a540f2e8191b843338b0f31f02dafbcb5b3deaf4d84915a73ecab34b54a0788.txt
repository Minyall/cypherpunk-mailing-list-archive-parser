Absent waiver by users, this may still be an ECPA violation.

Item (1) is the relevant item--if users agree to waive their ECPA rights,
there's no legal problem, although there may be ethical ones.

As for (2), well, there's no legal theory that says that a sysop is liable
for for any illegal activity on his BBS. The criminal law, in general,
does not make people liable for the conduct of others in the absence of
knowledge of that conduct.

Please, please don't make assertions about criminal liability based on
FIDO mythology.

When you refer to the risk they're taking, could you be precise? What
statistics do you have that support the statement that FIDO sysops are at
risk if they allow encrypted communications? To my knowledge as a lawyer
who works in this area, no sysop has been held liable for allowing
encrypted communications on his or system.
