A number of people on cypherpunks and extropians will be in Atlanta
at Comdex next week, so we have an opportunity to get together.

One great location would be in the Omni food court (Now the CNN Center),
which is right by the World Congress Center where Comdex will be held.

There are a lot of fast food places and a very large commons dining area.
I'd suggest meeting, say, at 1:00 Wednesday afternoon or so, not for any
formal meeting, but just to get together for a while at lunch to talk,
trade keys, and so forth.

(You'll have probably been there before Wednesday, as it's a convenient
place to go for lunch at the convention.  If you don't know which
building it is by Wednesday, ask anyone anywhere around you to point you
towards "The Omni" or "CNN Center" or "where CNN is", go in the building,
and you can't miss the food court.)

Don't forget to bring copies of your public keys, or some pieces of paper
or business cards with your PGP fingerprint hash written on them.
