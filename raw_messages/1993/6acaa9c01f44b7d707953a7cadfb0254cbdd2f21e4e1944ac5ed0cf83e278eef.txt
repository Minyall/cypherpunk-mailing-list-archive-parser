Oh yeah, this reminds me of a scheme by my friend Fuzzy.  Create
an encryption system which compresses and encrypts two files in
the space of one (more or less) using two different keys, the "real"
one and the "innocent" one.  When you encrypt something, you also 
encrypt a similar-sized hunk of innocuous text.  When they ask for
the key, you give them the one that spits out the fake stuff.

True, it's security by obscurity.  But I thought you might be interested.
