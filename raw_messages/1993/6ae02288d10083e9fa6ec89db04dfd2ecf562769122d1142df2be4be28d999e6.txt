What about triple layer metal interconnect? If they're serious about
making it reverse-engineering-resistant, they'd do that even if it
weren't functionally needed, simply to make it STM-opaque. I think (but
am not sure) that VLSI has that technology in their current fab lines.

I suppose that it's not quite "exotic" by now; maybe that's just assumed
as obvious?
