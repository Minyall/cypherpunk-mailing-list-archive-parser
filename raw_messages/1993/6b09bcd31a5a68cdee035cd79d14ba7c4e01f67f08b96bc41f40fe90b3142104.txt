Is there any publically-available software which allows utilization
of one-time pads?  I know it's just a matter of XOR'ing digits, but
something which would allow use by modem and transmit the pad itself
by PGP or another secure encryption standard, or the delivery by 
mail or courier of the pad itself to allow the future exchange of
information by a less-secure medium would seem to be something that
SOMEONE must have thought of doing; and while it's by no means
trivial, it would take a bit of work to program it with a snazzy
front-end, idiot-proofing and other bells and whistles.

Just wondering.  

Oh, yes, I've posted an amusing little bit of propaganda to sci.crypt
and alt.privacy.clipper, a sensationalistic little hypothetical
proposition which I'd be happy to email anyone who is interested
and doesn't have UseNET access (is there such a person?).
