Does anybody have a good idea what applications this is useful for?

My first thought is that it's a very quick way to do linear error
detection codes, since this instruction directly computes the Hamming
weight of a code word.

I can also see it being useful to detect correlations between
sequences, such as a trial random stream and a known pseudorandom
number generator.  One would XOR the streams together and then count
bits to calculate a correlation frequency.

Other ideas?

Eric
