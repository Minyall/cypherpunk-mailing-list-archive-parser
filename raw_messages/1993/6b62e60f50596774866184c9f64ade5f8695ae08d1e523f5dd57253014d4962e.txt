Well, this all sounds fine and dandy, but...

1)  They are not passing out the algorithym, and I dont trust ANYONE to tell
me its secure.  I am not a cryptographer, so it wouldn't help any if they gave
the code to me, but it just being out there for public perusal helps me to
think it IS secure.  I trust no payola.

2)  It is very possible that the 'criminal' effort may be able to modify
these devices so that there is no possiblility for the agencies to decrypt
their trasmissions (If it IS truly secure with no backdoors or decyphering
possibilities) in which case, it can only harm the law abiding.

3)  It allows the government the ability to determine WHAT encryption
method industry uses, and they should be able to have a choice.  Those who
understand this very misleading comment will understand, those who do not, will
prolly never be able to.

4) No explanation of what the 'key' contents are composed of (numbers, letters,
alphanum, characters, some odd cyphercode???) is even implied.

5)  No explanation of how the key is propegated or if it will even be needed
for the remote site is mentioned.  How are the remote sites going to
decypher your cyphersounds(text)?

There was no mention of further releases in information...is this all we get?
