	If it turns out that pressure to shut down really did come from
	the official net hierarchy ...

There is no question: those who were paying for the (quite expensive,
relatively low bandwidth) connection between the US & Australia found
themselves with a saturated link and looked for a "good candidate" to
shut off.  It turns out that lots of the packets are mail, and a good
number of the mail messages were going to/from the anonymous service.
This was not a move against anonymous e-mail or the research into it.
This was just an abuse of "someone elses money" that was easy to
target.

Next topic please ... this is getting tired.
