Well, it was interesting to see Philippe Nave's posting about an AT&T 
encryption software product (using the government's digital signature
and secure hash standards instead of RSA and MD-5, so it won't be PGP-
or PEM-compatible).  Prices seemed a bit high, though not bad for AT&T,
who are cutting some new market turf as well as typically pricey,
and the encrypted Zmodem software may be useful.  Does anybody know
if there are any other SHA / government-signature products out?
(I'm assuming there won't be much freeware because of the patent
issue; people who don't mind violating RSA's patent generally use PGP.)
