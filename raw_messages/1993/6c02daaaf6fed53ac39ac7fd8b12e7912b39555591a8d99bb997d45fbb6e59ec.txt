Harry (Hawk) Shapiro asked me to mention:

   I appreciate your concern about the conflict but it is not an
   open party as my room can only hold a couple doz. people at best...

   I would appreciated it if you noted to the cypherpunks that it
   is a party for the Extropians mailing list only.
