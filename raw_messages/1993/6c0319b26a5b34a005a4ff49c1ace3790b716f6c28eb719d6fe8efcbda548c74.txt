Sorry to waste yet more list bandwidth... but I have seen many meeting
announcements posted on cypherpunks.  I would love to attend a cypherpunks
meeting, but unfortunately, I have seen none within a thousand miles.

So, Albuquerque cypherpunks, such as Mike Diehl, the Mystic Homeboy, and any
others whom I don't know, please email me at this address.  I don't know if
there are enough of us to have an actual meeting, but it would be nice to get
together and talk even if not.
