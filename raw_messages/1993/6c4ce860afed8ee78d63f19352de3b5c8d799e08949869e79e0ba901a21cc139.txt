This is silly. Its like saying "I'm not in favor of banning guns --
but I want victims to be able to sue the gun manufacturers for
negligence". Dworkin is a fascist in feminist clothing -- for all
intents and purposes she believes that any act of heterosexual sex is
on some level rape. She's nuts.

This white male het computer geek marches in the Gay Pride Parade
every year. (Well, not this year -- I was sick. Mea culpa.) He also
thinks that Andrea Dworkin is about as anti-censorship as Rev.
Wildmon. I don't give a shit about the power structure -- I just think
that anyone telling me what I can and cannot see, what I can and
cannot write, and what I can and cannot sell, is my enemy.
