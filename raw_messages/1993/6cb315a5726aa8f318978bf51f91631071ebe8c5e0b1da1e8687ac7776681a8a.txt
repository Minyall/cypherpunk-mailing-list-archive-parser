I am working on an interesting application using PGP.. and I have come
upon a snag.  I want to have a message with more that one "pgp block" ie
more than one file encrypted and then all the encrypted files concatenated
as one new file.  If you just use "pgp file" it tries to overwrite the same
file each time.  If you give it multiple -o specifications, it only takes
the last one, and tries to keep overwriting it.  If you use -p, it names
each file based on what the original encryptor called it, but in this
application that would allow for the files to still overwrite each other. 
What I really need is a way to specify a "base" that is modified for each
output.
(eg  base="file" and output files become "file.1" "file.2" "file.3" etc)

Is this possible...  can anyone give me *any* suggestions to improve the
situation...  This has to be an unattended operation.
