 "According to sources at the National Security Agency, on the
morning of July 13, 1982, the NSA had intercepted commercial
communications from the Washington office of Mitsubishi to the
Japanese Foreign Ministry in Tokyo. The NSA monitors fifty-three
thousand communication signals in the United States every day. They
usually aren't reviewed by analysts, however, unless the signal
carries a message with a signature-a key word or phrase that
triggers a computer to transcribe the communication. Any word that
might signal confidential or classified government information
triggers the transcribing system."
