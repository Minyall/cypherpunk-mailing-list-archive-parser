Eric shows a complicated regular expression, but I don't think it
will match just --, because this line provides nothing to match the
"." and "[^B]", etc.
 
I think the real point is that Eric's idea allows the user to customize the
regular expression to match the particular signature line used by his
system.  If the line is just --, he can use Eric's simple example.  If it's
something else, another line can be used to look for the match.  Since it's
not hard for users to find out how their signatures look it should not be
hard to set up a pattern that will strip them.
