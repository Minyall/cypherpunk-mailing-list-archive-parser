		Washington, DC area ad hoc Cypherpunks meeting.
			Saturday, April 24, 1993
			2:00 PM EDT -> not later than 8:00 PM EDT

LOCATION:
	Unless I hear resounding acclaim for the Monday night meeting, I'm 
going to hold out our original offer of a Saturday meeting, April 24th, from 
2:00PM until sometime not later than 8:00PM, at the offices of:

InterCon Systems Corporation
950 Herndon Parkway
Suite 420
Herndon, Virginia 22070


DIRECTIONS:
	InterCon is two blocks north of exit 2 on the Dulles Toll Road (Route 
267). From the Beltway, take 267 West to exit 2 (Herndon), and make a right 
onto Eldon Street. Go through the traffic light at Herndon Parkway (there'll 
be a shopping center with a big Giant Food on your left), and make an 
immediate right into the office building on the corner of Eldon and Herndon 
Parkway labelled "Ford Center".

	Meet at the front entrance of the building where the Riggs Bank ATM 
is, and I'll come down and let you in. If you find a way, in, take the 
elevator to the 4th floor, and walk straight out of it to our office door, 
which you'll be looking at when the elevator doors open.

	NOTE: The building locks at 1PM. There is a security phone at the 
rear entrance, but you'll have to get them to find me, and I don't know what 
extension we'll be at, so the operative word is "punctuality". I'll make 
periodic sweeps to the FRONT entrance to look for people, but I can't canvass 
every door looking for people coming by later. If you come by, and don't see 
an easy way in, wait by the Riggs Bank ATM entrance, and someone will let you 
in.  (I'll need volunteers to occasionally do that, BTW)

	Office phone:	+1 703 709 5525
