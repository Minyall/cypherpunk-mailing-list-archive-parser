This is another thread only slightly related to cypherpunks.

I find the paranoid reaction to the "Religious Right" strange.  Perhaps
it is based on relying on the establishment media for a picture of it.

The media picture of the Religious Right is just as distorted.

The right to encryption and the "right" to abortion don't have the same
