Well, my server program logged several requests for my procmail recipes for 
pgp.  Unfortuanately, I haven't heard any comments about the recipes.  Is any-
one using them?  BTW, did anyone have any difficulties with the server software?
I hacked it together in a few hours and want to make sure that it works 
completely.  Thanx in advance.
