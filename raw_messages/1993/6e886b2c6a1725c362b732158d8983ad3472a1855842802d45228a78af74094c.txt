My mini-essay for the cake-paper:

  The most important right is that of free speech.  The area in which
free speech is most important is political speech, and the most
important kind of political speech is political dissent.
  If all speech is subject to government scrutiny the right to
dissenting political speech is greatly reduced or eliminated.  The
chill of big brother's gaze silences many dissenters.  Key escrow is a
way for the government to gain the ability to scrutinize all of your
speech; it is an attempt to take away your most important right.
Fight it.
