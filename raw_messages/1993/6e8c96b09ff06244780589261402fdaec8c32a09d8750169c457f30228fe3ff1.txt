that's vulnerable...it's the secret key problem.  The ELEGANT way to do
this with encription is to just make a normal ZIP file, but then build
diffie-hellman into your file downloader (zmodem).  This is also the least
work solution.

SO, since we're talking about offline mail readers...  Whats the best one
for the PC that works (or can easily be made to work) with rfc822 mail
files?  There's pcelm, which sucks...and there's mush, which is slooooow
as hell because of all the overlays.  I was writing my own, but I got
side-tracked...somebody want to save me some programming?
