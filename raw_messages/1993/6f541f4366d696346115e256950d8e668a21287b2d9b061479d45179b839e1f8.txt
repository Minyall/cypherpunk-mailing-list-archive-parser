i realize that caller ID box owners are not paying for your call but 
this system was talking about 800 numbers

two things i will grant
1) most 800 numbers are pro-watts or whatever it is and pay
just one huge charge a month and dont deal with each bill
seperately so they dont get charged for your specific call
BUT it is a great way to get marketting stuff
ive wroked for companies that do that

2) most peopel dont know that an 800 number isnt anonymous
but that goes to educating the public
and i really dont think the public cares enough to want to know
