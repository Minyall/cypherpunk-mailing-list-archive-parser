Re: security dynamics 

One could perform an interesting test with one of these Security
Dynamics card.

Aim a video camera at the LCD display so that the display takes up the
full width of the image.  Hook the video signal up to a digitizer
board, and recognize the numbers that appear on the face.  Spit them
out as often as they appear.  For someone with all the equipment, this
should be a one or two evening hack.

Now, if the number changes every minute, that's a little over 10,000
samples in a week, certainly enough to determine if they are using
weak random number generation.

I'll put the data on the ftp site, should anyone actually do this.

Eric
