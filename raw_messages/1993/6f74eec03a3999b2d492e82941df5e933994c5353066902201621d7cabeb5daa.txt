I wrote a quick little version to stick bits in the LSB of
a file. It runs in the Macintosh as an added feature to a popular
program, NIH Image. (The source code and frequent revision are
published at the major ftp sites.) It is very easy to add 
a function to handle this process because all of the file i/o
and format decoding are already present. 

If anyone would like a copy, they're welcome to write to me.
I'll send them instructions and a short file. Alas, it only
handles 8 bit images. 

Also, you can also request Mimic function code for hiding 
messages in text with a grammar.
