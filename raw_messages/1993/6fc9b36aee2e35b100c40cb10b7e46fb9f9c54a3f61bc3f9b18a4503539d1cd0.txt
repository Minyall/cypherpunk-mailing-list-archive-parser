Use of buzzwords can often be an inpediment to understanding.  When
the first-digit distribition thing came up in Martin Gardner's
column in Scientific American, "chaos" and "fractals" hadn't become
popularized yet, so he was reduced to actually figuring out what
was going on instead of giving it a mysterious and sexy-sounding label.
