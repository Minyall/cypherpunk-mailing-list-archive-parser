This is absolutely true; I personally performed technically illegal
domestic intelligence-gathering services [relatively benign] under an
identical arrangement for several years.

Based on some eighteen years of personal experience, I will attest to
the fact that _any_ legal or constitutional safeguard against the
invasion of privacy will be routinely ignored by virtually any law
enforcement or intelligence agency if it suits their purposes & is
within their abilities.
