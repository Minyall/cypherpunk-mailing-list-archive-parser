     The reason cells are encrypting is to protect against "unauthorized
persons" [i.e civilians who havn't joined the fedz and DON'T live off other
people's money [ours]].  I think this is another case that shows: letting
other people encrypt your data for your protection never works out to be
much good.  I agree with Thug in that we need to employ our OWN encryption
from one end to the other.  That CRYPTOCUP soundz pretty good right about
now.  TTFN!
