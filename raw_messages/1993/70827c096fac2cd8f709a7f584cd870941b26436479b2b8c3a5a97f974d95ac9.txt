One could apply the same sabotage to the generation of RSA public
keys making any keys generated with ViaCrypt easily crackable.

Of course you could use PGP to generate keys.  And now what is
ViaCrypt useful for?  It's original purpose:  Establishing plausable
deniability.

"Yes your honor, all these encrypted messages presented by the FBI
as Exibit A were generated by ViaCrypt which incidentally we have
a site licence for...  No sir, We've never used PGP."
