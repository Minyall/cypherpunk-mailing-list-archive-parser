In fact there used to be just such a number 206 945-2111 which
some kind soul in the state of Washington made available for
Canadians who wanted to call US numbers.  It gave a dial tone and
you dialed the 800 number...no charge.   You're right, *someone*
should do that again, it was sure handy.  (That number is now out
of service.)   A related question, is there some way to find the
identity of an 800 number holder, e.g. like a reverse phone directory?
