Snarfed PGP 2.2 and found it more successful on a Symmetry than 2.1,
which I couldn't get to stop dumping core on keygen.  So the
remailer on jarthur now supports encryption, I think.  Bang on it
and see if you agree.

The jarthur remailer's key: (512 bits only, it's on an insecure box)

The makefile paragraph:

	$(MAKE) all CC=gcc LD=gcc OBJS_EXT=_80386.o \
	CFLAGS="-O -I. -DNOTERMIO -D_BSD -DUNIX -DUSE_NBIO $(BYTEORDER) -Di386"

Logging is turned back on until the glitches are out.  Enjoy.
