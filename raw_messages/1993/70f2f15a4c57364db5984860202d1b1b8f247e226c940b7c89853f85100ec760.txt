      Legal Net News is now available via e-mail subscription.
 
 What it is -
 
   Legal Net Newsletter is dedicated to providing information on
   the legal issues of computing and networking in the 1990's and
   into the future. Legal Net News contains information which
   directly affects you and how you you compute.
 
 How to get it-
 
   To subscribe, send a message to <maiser@ins.tstc.edu>, with the
   following text in the body of the message:
 
           SUBSCRIBE LNN
 
   To unsubscribe send the message text:
 
           UNSUBSCRIBE LNN
 
   Or subsitute "UNSUB LNN" or "SIGNOFF LNN" instead of "UNSUBSCRIBE"
   if you like.
 
   The mail server has no facility for requesting help at this time,
   however, when you join the list you will be sent a "WELCOME"
   message describing Legal Net News in more detail, i.e. what Legal
   Net News is about, and how to handle unsubscribing from the list.
