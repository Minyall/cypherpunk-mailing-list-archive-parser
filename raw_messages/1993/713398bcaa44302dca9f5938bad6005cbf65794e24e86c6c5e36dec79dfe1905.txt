I can tell a fascinating tale about spoofed identities that happened
on a mailing list I was on a couple of years ago; but it's a *very*
long story and I haven't the time.  Maybe if I'm idle over the
christmas holidays I'll pull up a log, sit down, and tell the story
(if I'm bribed with enough drinks first :-) )

(For anyone else here who's on that list, it's the story of Mahalingam
et al...)
PS Also I'm aware of quite a culture of 'she-males' in certain groups
and IRC where men pose as women - usually lesbians - usually to get other
real lesbians to confide in them (for the purposes of their own arousal...)
