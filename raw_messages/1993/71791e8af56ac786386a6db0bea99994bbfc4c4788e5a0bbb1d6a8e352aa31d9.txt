A pool is used for *replying* to anon mail.  The problem is that it's hard  
to build a system that allows replies to anon email and still maintains  
absolute security.  One way is to broadcast the reply.  A pool does just  
that - it's basically a mailing list.  It could be a newsgroup.

Since any of the subscribers to the pool could be the intended recipient  
of any particular message, it would be very hard to use the pool to trace  
the anonymous recipient.
