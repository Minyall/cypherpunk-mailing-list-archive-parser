Well, keep in mind that the phone doesn't transmit nearly all of the
spectrum of hearing.  In fact it doesn't transmit anything above about
3.5KHz, so you don't have to have enough bandwidth for the human 20Khz
hearing range if all you're doing is emulating today's voice phone
technology.

This, btw, is why it's hard to identify speakers over the phone even in a
noise-free transmission -- the acoustical signal is just plain impoverished.
