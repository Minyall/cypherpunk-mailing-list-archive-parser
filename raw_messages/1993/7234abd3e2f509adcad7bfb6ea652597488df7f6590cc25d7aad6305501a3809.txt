That sounds doable. Tune a radio to a spot where there is static, plug it
into the audio in port of a SoundBlaster card, sample a few Kbytes, and
MD5 it to get your key. Nobody is going to reconstruct that.

P.S. Has anyone called Mykotronx lately? I called a while ago and asked for
any databooks and appnotes on Clipper. They said the databooks weren't
ready yet, and offered to put me on a mailing list for appnotes when they
were ready. I got the impression Mykotronx isn't too happy about the status
of the Clipper/Spooktap project.  :-)
