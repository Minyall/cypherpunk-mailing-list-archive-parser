I just fetched macpgp 2.3 from soda, and wound up with a file ending in
the suffix "gz". This is a new one on me, and I don't know how to decode
it. Can anybody inform me? Inside whatever it is is a binhexed compactor
file, and I can deal with those formats, but the outside wrapper defies
every decompressing utility I've got.
