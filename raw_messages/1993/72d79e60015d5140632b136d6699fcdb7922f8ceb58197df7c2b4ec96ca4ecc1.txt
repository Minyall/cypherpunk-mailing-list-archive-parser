This is true only for casual observers. If the FCC were after you, they
could most definitely triangulate on unusual noise sources as well as
they could a coherent signal. Power signals are a giveaway.

Good enough as far as it goes. But this implies a large drop in efficiency
of the transmitted signal. That's not a stopper...*if* you've got power
to spare. But that implies enough power for bad guys to triangulate your
noise source...ouch.

If they pin you down to within a building, you've lost.

There are other approaches...phase-sweeping...phase-conjugation...
