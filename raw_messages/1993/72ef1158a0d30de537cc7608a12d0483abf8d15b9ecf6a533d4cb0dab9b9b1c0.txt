# Whatever happened to CryptoStacker(s) research?

Ryan "CryptoStacker" Porter <rap@coconut.cis.ufl.edu> has been 
travelling in (supposedly) Belgium & Sweden for the last month, 
and I haven't heard from him since the beginning of July.

He did *not* meet me in Budapest two weeks ago.

# Please voluntarily comply with my request for a status report,

# your friends, and firebomb your compound.

Please!  Spare his friends!!!
 
# It is your choice.
 
If it were my choice, I'd choose the vacation.
