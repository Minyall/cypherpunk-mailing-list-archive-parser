As FCC regulations become tighter, the issue of Van Eyck Radiation
will go down some.  In 1974, when we had a Motorola Exorbus 6800
development system; the neighbors could tell what we were doing on it
by the RFI to their TV sets.  My 1993 Quadra doesn't even totally
wipe out a receiver sitting next to it.

More reason to use a LCD panel or EL display.  None of this messy
sync radiation.

If you can still receive the AM broadcast band inside your conductive
wallpapered room, I would not feel comfortable about attenuation
being provided. ;->
