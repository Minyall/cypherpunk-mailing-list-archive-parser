Does anyone have a phone number and/or address for these or any
other "hackers" publications?

I've pretty much had it with the "legit" computer security information
sources (CERT et al).  Between the censorship and the untimely
notification they are next to worthless for keeping abreast of
computer and network security issues.


thanx in advance,
