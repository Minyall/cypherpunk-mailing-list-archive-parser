I think this is a terrible idea. Yes, the list is not secret, and
I expect that half the nyms on it are TLA employees, but
converting the list to a feed on a commercial service such as netcom,
delphi, or digex, is not what I want to see. IMHO, of course, but a bad
idea.

Since I'm a netcom user too, i'll fire up rn from the east coast.
