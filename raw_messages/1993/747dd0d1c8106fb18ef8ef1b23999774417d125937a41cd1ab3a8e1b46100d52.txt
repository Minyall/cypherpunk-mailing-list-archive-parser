Isn't it okay to have the subject appear in the last hop,
according to a :: field in the second-to-last message?
::Remail-with-Subject: All Right Bugsy Lets Get Down To Brass Tacks

With remailers that unencrypt at each hop, this doesn't seem a
problem to me.

With remailers that accept unencrypted input, this is no more of a
steganoweakness than the body of the message already is.
