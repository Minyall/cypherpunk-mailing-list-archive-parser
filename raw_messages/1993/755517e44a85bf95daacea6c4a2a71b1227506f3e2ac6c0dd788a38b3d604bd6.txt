Ted, please don't be a bonehead on purpose.  I bet you can see the
difference between some bits coming down a wire and a bullet coming
at you at 1000 feet per second.  It has to do with the level of threat
and the feasibility of protecting yourself.

Not true at all!  Just because I like freedom doesn't mean I shouldn't
try to convince people to act in a way that is more freedom-loving.
