Subject: ANON: Shutdown of Anon.penet.fi

I have been told that Clayton Cramer, the bete noire of alt.sex.bondage, is
the "net.personality" responsible for the shutdown of anon.penet.fi.  I do
not know this to be a fact.

Funny, I never thought of him as being particularly "highly regarded".

Mr. Cramer is highly regarded for his scolarly work in regard to the 
Civil War, and the political history of the Second Amendment. He has 
just published a book on the later.

His other 'opinions' have always amused me somewhat, because he was one 
of the first net.people that got me interested in the Libertarian Party. 
Those rantings seem very out of step with this general political attitude, 
quite un-libertarian, in fact.
