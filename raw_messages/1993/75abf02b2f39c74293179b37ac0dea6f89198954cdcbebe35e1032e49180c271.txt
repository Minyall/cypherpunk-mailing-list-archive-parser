The following was posted by L. Detweiler as an example of a typical response to his 
cypherpunk postings: -->

>There is no cypherpunks cause.  Neither is there a cypherpunks
>movement.  Get these delusions out of your head.  There is, however,
>cypherpunks software.
>
>I repeat, the cause and movement are in your own head.

If there is no cypherpunks cause or movement, please let me know.  Being 
able to interact with people who believe in the cypherpunks cause is the 
only reason I subscribe to this list and if there is no cause, I would 
like to unsubscribe and spend my time elsewhere.  Can we have a simple 
survey of the list?  If you believe there is a cypherpunks cause and you 
believe in it, please post a short note to that effect to the list.  
Anyone who is interested can keep count.  I suppose to be fair, you 
should also post a note if you believe there is no cause.
