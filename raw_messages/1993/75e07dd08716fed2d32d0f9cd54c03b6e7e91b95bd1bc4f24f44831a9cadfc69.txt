          I've read about the cypherpunks and your mailing list in
          recent issues of _Wired_ and the _Whole Earth
          Review_.  I support your goals and would appreciate being
          added to the mailing list.  While I probably couldn't
          contribute to discussions from a technical standpoint,
          I am a lawyer and may have an occasional useful comment on
          policy/legal matters.
