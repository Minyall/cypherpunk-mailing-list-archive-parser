	Excellent comments, Perry, yes, but *I* have heard of Fringeware,
so maybe I'll throw some of my comments about Paco, as an "author
without credentials." (Not that I'm a cypherpunk with credentials or
anything. =)
	(I agree that reading the PGP-docs is probably the best way to
learn to use PGP, yet some people prefer simple tutorials-- when
advocating encryption-for-the-masses I don't expect everyone to
understand how RSA works, etc.)
	Fringeware is a 'zine which Paco Xander Nathan publishes, and while
he's no cypherpunk, he's an intelligent guy, so I'm pretty sure his
article would be a good one.
