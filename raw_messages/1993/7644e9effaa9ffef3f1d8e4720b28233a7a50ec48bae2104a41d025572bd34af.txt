My impression was that most of the new systems dealt with variable 
bandwidth automatically.  28.8kbps might only be acheived on a higher
quality line.  The stated rates are max, not nominal.

They told me they use their own design 'datapump', and I know they use
a 68K (I swapped the rom in mine).

Also, from a previous note, you wouldn't want to turn off V.42/V.42bis
since that is where the error correction is.  Also, even on compressed
data, you get some additional bandwidth because it does packetized 
synchronous data.  This gets close to 8bits/byte instead of 10 (start,
stop).

I get around 1760cps for LZW (zoo/compress) data.
This is Zyxel to non-zyxel (Cerfnet or World).
