I have taken similar precautions with my remailer...  as you can tell
from the header lines.  I'm still having trouble convincing my system
adminstrator to install PGP v2.1 (or even v2.0).  For some reason, he
seems to be ignoring my messages.  Since I only have a limited
knowledge of C, I really don't know how to fiddle around with the PGP
*.C source files too much, otherwise, I would install it myself.  

The error that I keep getting running under SunOS version 4.1.3 is:
> make sun4gcc
make all CC=gcc LD=gcc OBJS_EXT=sparc.o \
CFLAGS="-O -fpcc-struct-return -DUNIX -DHIGHFIRST -DIDEA32"
gcc -O -fpcc-struct-return -DUNIX -DHIGHFIRST -DIDEA32  -target sun4 -c  pgp.c
In file included from pgp.c:109:
/usr/include/stdlib.h:18: conflicting types for `abort'
<built-in>:0: previous declaration of `abort'
/usr/include/stdlib.h:26: conflicting types for `exit'
<built-in>:0: previous declaration of `exit'
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `pgp.o'
Current working directory /tmp/pgp21/src
*** Error code 1

If anyone can help me out, please e-mail me *DIRECTLY* and not to the list.
