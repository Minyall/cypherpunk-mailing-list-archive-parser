Sorry to put this on the list but I forgot who posted the original.
 
I believe it was Ed Carp that mentioned he had a wireless net set
up between his 486 and his laptop.  Could you detail this setup a
bit more (hardware and code necessary).  Also, is the connection
(or lack thereof) encrypted end-to-end?
