I hate to mail administrative  requests to the whole group, but I had
previously sent my request to cypherpunks-request to no avail. Is that
not the correct address? Maybe the reason you all keep seeing unsubscribe
requests mailed to the entire group is because such requests sent to
cypherpunks-request are being ignored.

Anyway, someone PLEASE unsubscribe me from this list. I would like to
subscribe to cypherpunks-announce only. I can't handle this volume of mail.

Thanks.
