A while back someone posted a message about being immune to having
property, etc taken in law suits.  Imagine if all your money (or nearly 
all) was tied up in anonymous accounts and that all your property was
owned by digital pseudonyms (from whom you rented the property).  This
would be a nice defense if you were scared that the government (in
protecting National Security, of course) would take all your 
posessions and make life a living hell for you and your family.
