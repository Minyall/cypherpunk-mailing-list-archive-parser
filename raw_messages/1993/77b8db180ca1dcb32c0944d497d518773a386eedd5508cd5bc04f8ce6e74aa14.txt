Here's a post that pretty much confirms that Dorothy Denning is
leaning toward schemes that outlaw competitors to Skipjack.

She continues to be the chief "Floater of Trial Balloons" (either
that, or she's awfully prescient) and I would suggest anything she
says about possible bans or restrictions on crypto that competes with
Skipjack be taken very seriously.

a few of the issues discussed in this group, and includes the
following :

     She also conclused that getting criminals to use the system
     will be a problem.  As a solution, Denning suggests legislation
     tlat places some constraints on the use of other products.  This
     would force them to come up with their own solutions, costing them
     time and money that they might not be willing to sacrifice, she
     explains.m
