On coombs.anu.edu.au in /pub/perl/misc/perl.code.sources there is a list
of places to get perl source/binaries for Ataris, IBMs, Macs, and VMS.
Unix is available everywhere in the GNU sections of ftp archives.

Also there is a large number of scripts in /pub/perl/scripts.

See the README file for usage details and for the European mirror site.
The INDEX file lists each script and gives a short description.

Hope this helps,
