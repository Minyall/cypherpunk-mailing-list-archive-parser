One disadvantage of CDROMs is that you lose a major advantage that real
paper one-time pads had - once you had used a page, you could burn it.
With a CD-ROM, presumably the whole pad *will* last you a while, and you
probably don't want to melt the outer tracks of the disk as you use them up...
So you either send ~600MB of secret stuff or waste the disk, depending on how 
secure your communications needs are and how soon you expect to be busted.
