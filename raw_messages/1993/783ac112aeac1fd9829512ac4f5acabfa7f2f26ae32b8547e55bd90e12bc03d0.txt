   Although we don't make custom versions of our software for specific  
   customers, our software, due to its nature, is highly customizable by the  
   purchaser.  Neither the Cantwell bill, nor the DPSWG letter mentions this  
   type of software product.

Huh?  Does the fact that Microsoft C or WinDoze contains run-time
libraries and is "highly customizeable" cause it to cease to be a
mass-market product?

Read the bill more carefully; it doesn't say anything about required
sales volume, and allows for telephone/etc support for installs and
the like.  It also doesn't say anything about "end users".  As long as
the *seller* doesn't customize it for each user, it's mass-market.

BTW a "standard commercial channel" includes mail/phone orders.
