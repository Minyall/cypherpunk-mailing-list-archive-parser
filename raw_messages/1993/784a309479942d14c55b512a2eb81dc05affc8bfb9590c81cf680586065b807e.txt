As soon as I read this (and thankfully the toad.com machine was sending
stuff through in a timely way), I flicked on KQED (San Francisco), where
the NPR report was already underway.

The hacker spokesman was, I think, a "Fred Davis."

An unimpressive interview, in my opinion. Confusing stuff about how if your
computer has "wires going into it, hackers can get in" (paraphrased from
the hacker's comments, not the interviewers).

Perhaps the time allotted was just too short to make any reasonable points.

Those who didn't hear it, didn't miss much.
