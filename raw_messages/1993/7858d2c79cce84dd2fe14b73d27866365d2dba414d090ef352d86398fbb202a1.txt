  Don't know if it's something stupid I'm doing,  or if there's a bug
in the Mac PGP 2.1,   but after selecting Text only,  and Radix 64
mode,   after encrypting the text,   I lose all carriage returns
after decrypting it.   Almost everything I get had no carriage
returns in it.    I use the Think C editor,  or BBEdit for editing
my text.   Is there an option that permits PGP to retain the carriage
returns?
