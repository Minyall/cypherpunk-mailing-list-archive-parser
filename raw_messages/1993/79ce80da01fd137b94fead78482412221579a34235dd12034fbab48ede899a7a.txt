 Unfortunatly for you (in a small way), people teaching English do not
agree. I have done more than my share of term papers and articles and in
the cases where I have used "man" for "humanity," it HAS been noticed.
There is no reason NOT to use gender neutral terms. It isn't going to hurt
you to do so and some people out there will appreciate it and will notice
if gendered terms are used. Why not then?
