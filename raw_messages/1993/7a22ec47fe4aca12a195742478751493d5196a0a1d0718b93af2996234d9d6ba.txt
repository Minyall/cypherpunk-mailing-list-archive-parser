Eric wrote about phonecards:

    ". . . I *can't* get an account with them because I
    don't have a phone line to tie it to.  There is a phone
    where I stay, but it's not mine.

    So, I'm stuck with US Splint."

Au contraire, several companies offer anonymous phonecards.  See
my upcoming "Norman French" article in MONDO 2000, issue #10.
