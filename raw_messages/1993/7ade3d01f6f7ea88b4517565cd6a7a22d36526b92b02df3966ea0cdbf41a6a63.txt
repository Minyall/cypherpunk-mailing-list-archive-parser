ACK!  I'm not responsible for the "Return-Receipt-To" in that message.
However, I am responsible for resending the message to the mailing
list.  Our mail2news gateway (we gateway cypherpunks into a local
newsgroup) bounced it because of a duplicate From line, and when I
resent it to the gateway alias, I screwed up and sent it to the list
as well.

I'm sorry for the extra traffic on the list.  I'll be more careful in
the future.
