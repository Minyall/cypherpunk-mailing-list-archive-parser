Here's a queer thought:

You've heard about the usenet dossiers that have been compiled and
sold to prospective employers?  How about a dossier-lookup function
integrated into your favorite news reader?  It would connect to a
dossier server and quickly provide a cross-reference of all the other
posts by the current poster...copies of the last 10 revisions of his
plan file...and an analysis of his individual quirks...(along with,
perhaps, a list of the top ten reasons not to hire him)....

Is this so off-base?  We've also been talking a lot about reputation
filters, which would probably require such activity logging.

Hell, it could even be put to a few good uses:  We could call up
Eric's dossier to quickly find his original remailer post to
alt.hackers...
