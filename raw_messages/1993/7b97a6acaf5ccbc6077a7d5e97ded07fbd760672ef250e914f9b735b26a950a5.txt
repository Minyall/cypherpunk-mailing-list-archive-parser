Yes. I saw proof that S. Boxx's posts are an annoying waste of time.
I suggest ignoring them, though -- whats the point in wasting MORE
time discussing them, given that he's unlikely to stop posting them no
matter what we do.

I think he thinks there is some sort of elitist conspiracy going on
here where the people that know how to add and multiply are looking
down on the people who don't.

Less than you imagine.
