I am representing the anti-clipper side in an ongoing debate in the "Wired " 
conference on OneNet. The governmental lemmings question the existence of 
the "Law Enforcement Exploitation Field" and want citations. Would the 
person who posted the hard facts about Clipper please send me all the info?
Thanks in advance,
