Bingo.  However, please note that one difference between the past
and the present is that the reason "hard" encryption is needed is
because electronic communication is so inherently insecure.  In
the past, communications tended to be hard to intercept but easy
to read, today the opposite is becoming true.

Thus, the difference is that today, it's much harder to be
discreet -- the encryption is a red flag.  "What's he hiding?"
And as any intelligence analyst can tell you, even traffic analysis
can tell you a _lot_.

Suggested Reading: The Spycatcher's Encyclopaedia of Espionage, by
Peter Wright.  VERY entertaining.
