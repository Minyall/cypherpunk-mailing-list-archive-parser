It is important to have recent version on both the PC and host side.
The versions that I run on my PC is 3.12. The Unix host version is
close to 5A... I had to slurp the latest Sun version from Columbia
to get decent performance. The version supported by my Sysadmin was
obsolete. I haven't claimed that Kermit is faster, but with sliding windows,
large buffers, and other tricks, the night and day difference goes away.

I agree. That is why I posted. Perhaps a Kermit guru lives within
the list.

I mean that a script that works  like unix or DOS command line programs
should (speculation alert!) be possible. We can handle obscure options,
switches, etc. My target audience can't. Kermit has automatic scripts
and macros that should be able to handle what we need. Heaven help us
when there are errors tho....
