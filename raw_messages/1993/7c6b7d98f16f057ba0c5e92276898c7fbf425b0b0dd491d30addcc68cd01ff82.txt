This week's NPR "Talk of the Nation/Science Friday" was on the
internet.  Both telephone callers, and internet "callers" were
accepted.  The show included the founder of Internet Talk Radio.
There was a question along the lines of "how can internet mail
privacy be assured?"  Unfortunately, the experts only breifly
mentioned public-key cryptosystems.  I was wondering if they
would go into a longer discussion about electronic privacy and
crypto issues.

I wonder if we could get a "cypherpunk" onto Internet Talk Radio to
discuss cryptography and it's privacy concerns.  Any ideas?
