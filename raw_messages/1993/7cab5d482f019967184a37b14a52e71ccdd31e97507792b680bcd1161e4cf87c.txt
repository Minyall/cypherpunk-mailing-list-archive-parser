brings back ugly memorys of burn detail, back when I was stationed
at a SAC command and control post up in the mountains near Westover AFB.

Every scrap of paper that was discarded had to be incinerated, and
we rotated through a schedule that made sure everybody got their
chance to share the experience.

Sounds to me like an enterprising pyro could have a nice little 
operation, contracting with individuals to burn or blow up their
sealed bags of trash. I understand that Beavis and Butthead might
be looking for a new job, hey the little weinerheads might amount to 
something after all!
