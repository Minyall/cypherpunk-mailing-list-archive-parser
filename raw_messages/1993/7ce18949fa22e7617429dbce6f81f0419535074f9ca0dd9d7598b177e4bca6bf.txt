>>>What does GCHQ stand for, and what does it do? Is it similar to the 
NSA?<<

(Feyd Eli)

The Royal Signals Establishment at Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England  
is known as General Communications Head Quarters (GCHQ).  It is also 
called 'Cheltenham' after its location.  It performs many of the same 
sigint jobs as the NSA.

There was a controversy a few years ago when the US wanted Maggie to 
outlaw (socialist) union membership by the Civil Service employees at 
GCHQ because the Regan administration considered it a security risk.
