Extropians,

Aside from the flamebait puke of the COLORADO CRAZIE, the cypherpunks list
doesn't seem to be an optimum forum for dicussion of false names, true
nyms, multiple personality entropy, blah blah.

Yet, I find it a fascinating topic. Anyone here interested?

My apologies to subscribers of both the Extropian and Cypherpunk lists who
received this message twice.
