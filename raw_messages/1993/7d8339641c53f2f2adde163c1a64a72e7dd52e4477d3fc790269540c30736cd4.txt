No, I did get the joke, I just didn't think it was funny.  I *do* remember the
thread some time ago of Perry being accused of being a Nazi because a well-

for indulging in childish games, not for meaning whatever he said literally.
I'd rather the pair of them just let it drop, instead of trying to outsmart
each other.
