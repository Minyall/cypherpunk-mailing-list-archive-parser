I just had a nice phonecon with Jim Ruester of Intergraph's public
relations department. For those of you who don't follow CAD,
Intergraph produces a line of workstations based on the Clipper CPU, a
private-label RISC chip that Intergraph acquired from Fairchild some
years ago.

He hadn't seen the press release, or heard of the wiretap chip. His
(predictable) reaction was to say that he'd forward it to their legal
department. I asked that he pass any comments back to me for reposting
here.

A plea: please *don't* call Intergraph and bother them about this.
Putting pressure on AT&T (which has announced products based on the
wiretap chip) is one thing. Harrassing a company with a similarly
named (and trademarked!) product, in the hope that they'll put
pressure on the gov't, is nothing more than bothersome.
