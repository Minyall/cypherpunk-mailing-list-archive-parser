   Excellent essay Tim (as usual). Is there a more practical method based on
a simpler 'intractable' problem? 

[not that it's useless. I could probably code up an implementation based on 
your description, but it seems like a pain to generate graphs everytime you 
want to prove some trivial knowledge.]
