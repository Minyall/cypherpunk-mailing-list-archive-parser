 >I can keep or mirror the electronic archive on soda.

Thanks very much for your offer. It would be great if you could keep
the electronic part at soda, since we only have five megabytes on
Netcom, and Joe's Garage is no the most reliable system in the world.

When Sunah and I start getting stuff, I'll send mail.
