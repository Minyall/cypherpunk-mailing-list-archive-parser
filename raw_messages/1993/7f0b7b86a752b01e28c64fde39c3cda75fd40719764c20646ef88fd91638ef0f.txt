The problem is that when sendmail executes your filter, your
environment is all messed up.  HOME and USER aren't even initialized.
PATH is probably /bin:/usr/bin.

This works when you send mail to yourself because your environment
gets passed along to your mail filter.


Here's a good wrapper script to use ....


#!/bin/sh

HOME=YOUR-DIRECTORY
PGPPATH=YOUR-PGP-DIRECTORY
PATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/ucb:/bin:/usr/bin:/etc:/usr/etc

export HOME PATH PGPPATH

cd $HOME

exec >> $HOME/Inbox/FILTERLOG 2>&1	# this logs error messages so
					# that you can learn from them

FF=/tmp/FILTER.$$
touch $FF
chmod 600 $FF

(tee $FF; echo '') >> Inbox/everything	# this saves your mail in case
					# it gets dropped on the floor

PGP COMMAND GOES HERE

rm $FF

exit 0
