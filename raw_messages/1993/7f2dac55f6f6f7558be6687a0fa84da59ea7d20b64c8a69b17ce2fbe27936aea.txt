  Worse, you can't convince anyone new to the list that you're not
just a group of children with large egos and complex privacy enhancing
toys. I've seen a few well written messages in this group and some
pointers to interesting information, but by far the most volume on
this list, and the xtropians list for that matter, has been petty
bickering. I had higher hopes ....
