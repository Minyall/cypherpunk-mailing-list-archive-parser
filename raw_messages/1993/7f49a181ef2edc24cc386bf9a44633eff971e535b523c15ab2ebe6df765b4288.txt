Mr. Barnes somehow found it possible to write me without assaulting me
with vicious ad hominem attacks, vilifications, obfuscations,
misrepresentations, all approaching blatant lies, completely tangential
points to my posts, and cc:ing my postmaster this time. My postmaster
and I thank you. It is free, too, of a subtle hint of censoring or
blackmailing me by going to `various former classmates and old friends
of mine who are computation center employees, faculty, and
administration members at CSU now.' No tarring me as a `overeager
wannabe' (well, I don't wannabe a pseudospoofer) and a `full fledged
psychopath' on `medication'...

I dunno. This is a big step. The choice at this point could really
affect future cyberspace, eh? Frankly, I think serious professional
uses of the internet are fundamentally incompatible with
pseudospoofing, and will make design decisions based on that
incontrovertable premise. Like quarantining databases from existing
toxic waste dumps.

you have just classified 99.9 % of the population as `ultra paranoid'.
But that .1% of the degenerates have never understood the idea of civility anyway.

hee, hee. or believe in elaborate, complex fantasies straight from SF...

As an example, look at Ender's Game, where Ender's brother and sister
get on the net under pseudonyms, and get treated just like everyone
else.  There is no biases.  People are judged on their actions and
words, not by who they are, how old they are, what they look like, or
anything like that.  Maybe you are blind, I don't know.  I've never
met you.

who wrote that? I forget <g>

I wonder if Mr. Graff would like to weigh in in this little discussion.
