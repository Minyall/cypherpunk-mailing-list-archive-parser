I was speaking with an international crypto consultant
who told me this story about a business with an office
in a South American country. They decided to start encrypting
their link. Within a week, a team of soldiers burst through
the door and smashed the encryption hardware to bits. On
the way out, they asked, "What are you trying to hide from us?"
