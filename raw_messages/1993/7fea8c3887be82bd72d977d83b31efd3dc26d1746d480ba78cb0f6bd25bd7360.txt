Correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I understand, "Dolphin Encrypt"
does not use any well examined crypto system -- its something that you
guys, without any cryptography credentials, cooked up. On that basis,
why should we care about it? Most crypto systems that amateurs come up
with are pathetic to say the least, and strong systems, like
triple-DES and IDEA, are widely available.
