Whooaa! Slow....

Please remember that the former SU is full of "companies" that claim to be
*the* whatever national initiative of Russia. Mostly they are just a couple
of former research scientists with a Grand Plan, and usually they have no clue
as to how to make it fly. They just think that with the new market echonomy,
simply forming a company and having some Big Words will make them filty rich
automatically...

I know there are exceptions. But.. Beware.
