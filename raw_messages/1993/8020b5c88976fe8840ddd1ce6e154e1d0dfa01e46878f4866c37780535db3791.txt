Actually, no it wouldn't.  A yagi antenna at 800 Mhz is not very large
at all.  A 16 element at that frequency would probably be less than 5
feet long.  Beans for a satellite to carry into orbit today.  Of
course the problem then is the beam will provide a fairly wide "spot"
on the surface of the Earth that will still cover several cell sites.
Although come to think of it, narrowed to area to adjacent sites
you'll not have to contend with hearing two sites on the same
frequency due to coordination.
