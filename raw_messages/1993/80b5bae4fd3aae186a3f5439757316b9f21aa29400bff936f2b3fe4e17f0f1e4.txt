	 Now, back to subliminal messages and the DSS.  Suppose the government
	 decides to authenticate the information on your driver's license with
	 DSS.  All sorts of information can be included subliminally, such as
	 an arrest record, number of speeding tickets, if the person in
	 question is suspicious, etc...

Or your Capstone keys, during certificate exchange.
