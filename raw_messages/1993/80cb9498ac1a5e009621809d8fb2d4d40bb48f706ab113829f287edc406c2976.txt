Yep, that was me. My idea was to use the "Intel Inside" logo, modified
appropriately and printed as "professionally" as possible. With a good
design, these might be seen as "official" stickers and might last for
months on the things we stick them on.

My model for these are some stickers Fen LaBalme and others pass out
at the Hackers Conference every year: "We are everywhere." 

Here's a very crude, ASCII-limited, diagram:
                
            ***
               ***
       ****       *
     **            *
    *   Big         *
   *     Brother     *
   *       Inside!   * 
    *               *
      **        **
         *****
           
       
(Well, I hope you get the idea!)
