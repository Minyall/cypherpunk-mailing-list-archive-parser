As a general rule, mere presence of a key on a keyring should not
indicate that this person wishes to receive encrypted mail.  There
should be a separate installation for that, either by an enhanced
alias file or similar.  There are many for whom reading encrypted mail
is not always desirable, because the effort required to download it
and decrypt it is more time than the content is worth.  I myself fall
into this category, unfortunately.

I mean, if you encrypted if there was a key for someone, and sent mail
to David Sternlight, he wouldn't be able to read what you wrote!  :-)
