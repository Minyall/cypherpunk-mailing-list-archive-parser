Checking the relevant document again, I think this is wrong:
--------------------
 Federal Information Processing Standards Publication XX
 1993 XX
 Announcing the Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES)

[blah blah]

The security equipment shall ensure that the LEAF is transmitted 
in such a manner that the LEAF and ciphertext may be decrypted 
with legal authorization. No additional encryption or modification 
of the LEAF is permitted.

[...]
--------------------

I remembered this text out of context.  Correctly interpreted, it
looks like it's just a specification for devices implementing the
(voluntary, natch) Escrowed Encryption Standard.  Sorry about that.
