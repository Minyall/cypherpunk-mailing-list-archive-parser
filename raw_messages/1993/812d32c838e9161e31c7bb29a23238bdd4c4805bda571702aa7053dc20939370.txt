Nothing like jumping into the middle with one's first posting...

Denizens of the nets have to realize that there are some extreme social
deviates out here who go beyond sodomy, go beyond working for the FDA,
go beyond rape as an instrumentality of war, go beyond voting and actually 
believe that adverting is an ennobling human activity.

Think about it.  Poor Michael in the last few episodes of "Thirtysomething"
suffering existential angst because he was great at advertising but 
considered it an unworthy occupation for a man.  If he'd only known that
advertising=mass markets=low prices=wealth beyond the dreams of ancient 
Kings.

Lack of advertising=Moscow before 1990.

If we have to accept your deviations (voting for the short fascist with the
bad haircut and the funny ears par example) you have to accept ours.  We
can live with each other without too much trouble.
