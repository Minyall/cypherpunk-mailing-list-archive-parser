Not flame bait in this forum, I hope. I posted a message (very genteel 
by comparison) in alt.security.pgp and was informed of my ignorance for 
advancing the theory that legislated standards should always be suspect, 
lest we lose what little privacy we have left.

If keeping the details of my life out of the government's data maw is 
anarchy, give me a brick.
