I must say I had never considered the possibility that
the Data Superhighway itself might be a scam; but it's
an interesting possibility.  

With all the hideous legislative work they cribbed from
the Bush clan, a former CIA chief; how surprised would
you be to find that the Data Superhighway AND Clipper
Chip proposals were intended to be enacted almost simultaneously;
to rein in the Internet.

Perhaps the spooks have, as we all know, been buying
CD-ROMS and grepping 'em.  It could be a conspiracy
to establish complete government surveillance of
all computer equipment.

I may simply be being paranoid, here, but in political
situations which smack of unlikely coincidence; one
must occasionally ask the rhetorical question _Cui bono_?

In this case, a number of people stand to benefit;
and, oddly, the people seem to be predominantly in
the government.

I'm not entirely serious about this theory, and
I do present it semi-satirically, as a perspicacious
few may have noted; but perhaps the topic shall
stir up a bit of debate.

"Route 666."  I like that.  How does one get
hold of Pat Robertson's people?  And get him
to think we're good Christian boys, so they'll
do it?  I think Pat's _already_ pissed about
this Clipper thing, and he'd be happy to talk
about evil liberal perfidy in the White House.

Anyone have their FAX numbers and addresses?
