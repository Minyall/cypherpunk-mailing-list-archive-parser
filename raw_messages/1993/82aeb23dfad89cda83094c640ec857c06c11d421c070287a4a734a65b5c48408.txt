In my opinion, few if any BBSs qualify as common carriers. Common carriers
hold themselves out as accepting all goods or passengers (or, in the case
of communications, all messages) indifferently. I know of no sysop who
operates under such a policy, or who would want to. 

uunet, in contrast, probably does qualify as a common carrier.

My discussions of legal liability are not grounded in common-carrier law
(in which I'm not yet an expert) but in criminal law and tort law.
