To all who responded to my question about some truncation of lines in PGP
messages, my thanks. It did indeed turn out to be a CR/LF problem. The problem
being that there were none in the entire message! I looked at the messages I
had been getting in my text editor and found the text to be one long line. I
surmise that this has something to do with why PGP then truncates at line
16 of the ciphertext every time, interesting. My friend uses a program called
POPMAIL to post with, which I now advise people to avoid. It seems to be hard
to hack with a Mac. Thanks to y'all again.
