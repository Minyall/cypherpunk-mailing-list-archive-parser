Could some kind-hearted cypherpunk out there PLEASE help me get my
name off of this list??!? I've tried every combination to cypherpunks-
request of which my fevered noise overloaded cerebrum could think--
but to no avail...
   If there's a moderator here perhaps he/she/it could unsubscribe me,
otherwise if someone would e-mail the secret spell to me directly I'd
appreciate it (as I've had to resort to deleting all that comes from
this list without reading it...)...
   Thanks in advance,
       Your Flame-weary Fool,
          clueless@phantom.com
