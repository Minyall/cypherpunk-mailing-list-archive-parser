Learn to either ignore posts you aren't interested in, or rig up a
kill file for any thread that contains things like "t-shirt" or
whatever.

I posted a long response to Paul R.'s call for us to put our noses
back to the grindstone (by talking to journalists, in _his_ opinion),
but it may not appear for a while.

Folks, there just isn't any agreed-upon set of priorities. For some,
it's PGP. For others, digital money. And talking to journalists,
writing rants, investigating offshore banking, for others.

Let a thousand flowers bloom.
