I'm looking for info, articles, archives, book and journal leads on
info related to applied cryptology in the 20th century... for a senior
thesis I'm writing on cryptology, warfare, and national security.

Specifically, I'm looking for

o Clipper chip archives of articles
o Articles on Phil (PGP) and RSA disputes
o Articles on the export of cryptology

I'd also like info on cryptology in the Cold War or leads to
such info.

Please send info to: genghis@blue.engin.umich.edu.

Thanks,

Garrett
