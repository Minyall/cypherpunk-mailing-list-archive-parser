Quoth Sandy, verily I say unto thee:

-=>Here's the deal.  The Queensboro Shirt Company will reproduce any
-=>logo or design on their two-ply yarn all-cotton polo shirts.  The
-=>special deal is the price for first-time customers--$179 for 6
-=>shirts, $499 for 20 shirts.  I could really go for a stylized,
-=>gold thread, "CYPHERPUNKS" on a black polo shirt.  Anyone else
-=>interested?  I'll bring info about Queensboro and other companies
-=>to the next physical meeting if I can make it.

My 2 bits worth, before the deal is done:  I'd much rather have a T-shirt.
In fact I would not buy a polo shirt.  I don't play polo, and see no
reason to dress like a yuppie/preppie.  Some may like them, so here's my idea:
Make a silkscreen and put in on poloshirts, caps, Ts, and tanktops (in the
middle, sort of like those german army tanktops.)  Maybe even on a jersey
or sweatshirt.  Then everyone is happy.  

My question would be, who gets the money, and who does the work?  Is this
something some individual is going to go do, or is some sort of CP fund
going to be set up (which could perhaps be used to help get a conference
or something going, or at least cover the cost of some duly elected
representative of the CPs to attend important conferences and report back
to us all.  Or something like that.
