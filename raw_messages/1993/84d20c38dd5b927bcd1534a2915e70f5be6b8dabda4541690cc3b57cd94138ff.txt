Whilst being heavily opposed to the chip although less affected by it since
I dont reside on US soil, one useful purpose of it would to exploit the
functions of it to send your pre-encrypted data through it and have it come
out the other end in the same form, thus using it's protocols of retransmission
and error correction. Using the encryption part of it isnt worth considering
due to the real lack of data integrity if (as?) the TLA's have backdoors.

Basically mooch it's good points and ignore the bad points as your data wont
be channeled to the phone in cleartext anyway.

(This isnt an advocacy of the damn thing, just a note that it has SOME
functionality for those that wont use the encryption functions).
