Something came through here at "Sun Jun 27 08:44:41 PDT 1993",
which is close to the stamps on the other messages you sent.
Perhaps it didn't make it back to you?  If you want to try it
again with full logging, tell me and I can turn it on.

Incidentally, there have been a couple of messages to the list
with the stigmata of my remailer, but the address 
"eli-remailer@toad.com".  Is the list software doing anything
that could account for this?
