>>   We must extend our apologies to those of you who read the CompuServe
>>   Magazine article on Data Encryption and tried to find PGPRIV.ZIP here
>>   in our library.  Due to the controversial nature of Phil Zimmerman's
>>   Pretty Good Privacy program and the fact that several legal questions
>>   surrounding this program have remained unanswered, we have removed it
>>   from our library. We are investigating the legal issues concerning its
>>   distribution, and it will remain unavailable until further notice.

>>   Again, we apologize for the inconvenience.
