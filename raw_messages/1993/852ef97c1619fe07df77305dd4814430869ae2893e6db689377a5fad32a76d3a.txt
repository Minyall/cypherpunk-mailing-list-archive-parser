I think the optimum solution is to provide it both ways, in
digest form as well as the way it is now.  Digesting it would
also help provide a standard way to archive the list.  We really
need archives of this available, "official" archives that we know
contain all the messages.  While many readers are keeping archives,
they aren't standardized.
