Is it just me, or is anyone else dubious about Dorothy Dennings
and company running their various Skipjack tests ON AN *NSA*
CRAY COMPUTER?  Since many of the objections to the whole plan
arouse because of doubts about the intentions of the NSA, why
would D.D. et al. trust them to run these critical tests?  How
difficult would it be for the NSA to spoof its own computer?

Next big news items:  United Nations hires Serbian troops to
report on human rights violations in Bosnia.  Farmer Brown puts
fox in charge of henhouse.  Film at eleven.
