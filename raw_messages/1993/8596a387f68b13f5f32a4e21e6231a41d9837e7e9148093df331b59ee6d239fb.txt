I agree with Phil that, in practice, the warrant requirement is a very
thin reed on which to base our Fourth Amendment rights. The magistrates
who review warrant applications tend to accept uncritically what they're
told by the government officials seeking the warrant.

Hellman's proposal would address only the most obvious and most extreme
abuses.
