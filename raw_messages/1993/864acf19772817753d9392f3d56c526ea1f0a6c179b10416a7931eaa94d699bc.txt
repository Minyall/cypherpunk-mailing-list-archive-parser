Does anyone out there have any technical specs and/or prices and/or
purchasing restrictions on Motorola's "Digital Voice Privacy" (DVP) and
General Electric's "Digital Voice Guard" (DVG) radio systems?  From what I
know, these are supposed to be DES encrypted voice radio systems used by
federal agencies like the DEA, FBI, SS, ATF, and perhaps the CIA.

I'm assuming that there are purchasing restrictions on these systems.  Are
there similar systems that are made by companies outside of the U.S.,
which perhaps could be imported without restriction and/or registration
with the NSA or Customs?
