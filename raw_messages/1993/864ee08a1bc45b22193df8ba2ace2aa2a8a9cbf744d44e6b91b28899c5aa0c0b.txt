     I would like to let everyone who hasn't already figured it out
know that I did *not* originate the message that was posted to
Cypherpunks through my account.  I do not know where it came from,
but it reached my account with the destination address of the
cypherpunks list because the message that came back to me from the
list said that "Anonymous <nowhere@bsu-cs.bsu.edu>" originated the
message.  That indicates that it went through the remailer.  If it
were from me, it would say "Chael Hall <nowhere@bsu-cs.bsu.edu>"
as the return address.  Another identifying characteristic is the
"X-Remailed-By: Anonymous <nowhere@bsu-cs.bsu.edu>" header line.
Just remember, don't believe everything you read.
