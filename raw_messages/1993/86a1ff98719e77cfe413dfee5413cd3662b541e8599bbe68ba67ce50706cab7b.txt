About the KOH virus/program:

I've receive two disassemblies of the program (but not the original source
code yet; I haven't had a chance to try to contact the author).

I'm not sure that either person who mailed me the disassembly wants to take
credit for it, publically at least :-) so I'll just thank them here for 
their work, and answer questions in email (although one of the disassemblies
includes an email address).  One person indicated that KOH really isn't a
virus at all, so maybe this can be answered by folks who know more about
such matters than I do!

Apparently the fast encryption method is indeed an XOR; other than that I
haven't had a chance to look over the code.  I am interested in the IDEA
implementation that KOH includes.

So, if you are interested in copies of the disassembly, let me know.  I had
one report that KOH locked up an 8088 PC from a tester (thanks!).

I'd try to post something intelligent about the code but I just haven't
looked at it enough to comment.
