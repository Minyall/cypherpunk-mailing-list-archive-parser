I think attitudes like Denning's pose a threat to the enforcement of the bill
of rights and the maintenance of public freedom.  People should be able to keep
their business private, without the government meddling.  I'll bet Jefferson
and Paine are both spinning in their graves.  Of course, Hamilton would
probably like Denning's ideas - he always was a bit of a busy-body...
