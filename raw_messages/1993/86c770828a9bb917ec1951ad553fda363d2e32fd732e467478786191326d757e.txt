Thanks to FutureNerd for the Mail Gateway suggestion (via
private e-mail). It is just the thing for which my associate 
was looking. (Never use a preposition to end a sentence with.) 

More questions will be asked of FutureNerd re Eudora privately
as we try to get it running, but until then, here is a public
thanks for your help.
