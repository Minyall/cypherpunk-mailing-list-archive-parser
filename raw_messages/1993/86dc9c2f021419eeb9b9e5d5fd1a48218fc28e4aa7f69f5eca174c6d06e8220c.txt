There are also performance concerns here. There is no reason to take
the substantial amount of time it takes to sign, if you don't want to
sign a message.

On the other hand, in terms of anonymity, you can always generate a
self-signed key with TIS/PEM (I forget the exact term they use in the
TIS/PEM docs, but you can just make yourself a certificate which
doesn't really say anything about your identity).
