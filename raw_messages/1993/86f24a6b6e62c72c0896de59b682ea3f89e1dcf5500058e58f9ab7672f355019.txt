- NSA harassment alive and well
- is this company a `small fish'? doesn't NSA have something better to do?
- his request is overbroad, but still needs some kind of help
- maybe the laywers on the list can help out too

An individual at the NSA has recently been warning
my publisher of Moby Crypto that they will be breaking
the law if they export the product.

Since I do not include any executables, only source
and other documentation that routinely appears in
textbooks that are exported, I think this hasseling 
is unwarranted and unconstitutional.

Since knocking heads with the NSA may result in
some kind of process, I need some assistance to
bolster my case.

What you can do: please send me a reference on every
book or magazine article you are aware of that
contains any 'source code'.  The code can be a fragment
or in any computer language as long as it implements
encryption or other material that would be
export controlled if incoporated in an executable.

I think collecting a large number of these citations
will help my attornies in pointing out the absurdity
of the situation to government attornies if necessary.

Please e-mail any citations that you have.  Thanks
ahead of time.
