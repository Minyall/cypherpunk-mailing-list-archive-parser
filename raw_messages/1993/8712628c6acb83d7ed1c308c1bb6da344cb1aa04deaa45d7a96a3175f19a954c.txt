The same is true of e-mail over the Internet--there is no statutory
exclusionary rule that would prvent its admissibility in court. It is at
least theoretically possible, however, to exclude illegally seized
communications of these sorts using a "pure 4th Amendment" (nonstatutory)
exclusionary rule.

Don't hold your breath, though.
