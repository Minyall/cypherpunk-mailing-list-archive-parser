What is it people want, exactly?

The Chaum paper in "Scientific American," July or August of 1992, has
been mentioned many times here. It also cites in its references the
"Communications of the ACM" paper, "Transaction Systems to Make Big
Brother Obsolete," November 1985.

And several times the Brands paper on off-line digital coinns,
available by ftp, has been cited.

Likewise, the Simmons books on "Contemporary Crytology" has good stuff
on digital money (and lots of other stuff you'll need to
cross-reference to understand digital money). Ditto for the "Crypto"
Proceedings papers.

There may someday be easier stuff to read, but these items--especially
Chaum's papers cited above--are very basic and must be assumed to have
been read by anyone interested in digital money.

If you want something more basic, a truly primerly "primer," I'm
afraid you're out of luck.

(I know of some plans to author such very basic intros, popular books
on "modern" crypto, but they are off in the future.)
