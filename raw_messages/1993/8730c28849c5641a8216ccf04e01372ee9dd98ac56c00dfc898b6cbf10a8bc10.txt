I don't know if this is consistant with what everyone here is talking about in
regards to "outdialing serivce," but some time ago I heard about a 900 number
that a person could call, that would redirect their call so as to avoid being
traced, etc.  Oddly enough, I think they advertised that all the calls are
logged and kept in some vault in another state.  I may be confusing something
here though.  (As if this is the case, they've probably gone out of buisness.)

Yeah, I've heard of the system too.
They claim they wont let their info out without a court order.
I feel that there are a good deal of legal problems with this.
It wont take much to get a court order and the ONLY reason worth
the 2 bucks or whatever they want to add to what would otherwise
be a local call (for caller ID evasion anyhow) would be to avoid
legal action of one type or another.  I suspect that the calls that
go through this system are monitored occasionally too.
