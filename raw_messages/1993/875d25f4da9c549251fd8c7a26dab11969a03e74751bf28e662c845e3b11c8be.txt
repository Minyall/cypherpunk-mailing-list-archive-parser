So "blinding" is a synonym for encryption with your own public
key, aka multiplication by a very-hard-to-factor number?

In other words if Alice encrypts and Bob signs, Da(Db(Ea(M))) = Db(M)?  
Under what conditions?  Does RSA (in PGP) satisfy those conditions?

For what applications would Bob want to sign an encrypted contract
instead of a plaintext?
