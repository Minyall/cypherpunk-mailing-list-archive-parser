Well.. I am starting a project (as soon as my mail alias is set up by the
sysadmin) to do something like this...  Mostly I just want to play with
writing software that intercepts email... and try my hand at calling PGP
from other software...  which leads to a suggestion...  It would be nice
if PGP had a publicly available API, similar to that provided by RSAREF.
