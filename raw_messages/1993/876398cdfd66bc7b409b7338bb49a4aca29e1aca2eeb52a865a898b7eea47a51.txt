I don't think it's correct to say that the 3rd amendment isn't violated.  If
you consider police forces standing armies and policemen soldiers, then the
cases of confiscation of private homes under civil forfeiture for the
occupation of cops constitutes violation of the 3rd amendment.  The problem
with this is that it takes some doing to persuade that police are standing
armies and cops soldiers by different names.
