I had heard about PGP and have been meaning to get and use it Real Soon Now for a few weeks.  When I heard it was an endangered species, I started looking around seriously.  Haven't found it yet, but I did find cypherpunks (I'm not sure if this is a blessing or a curse, but it is entertaining).  Anyway, can someone point me to an ftp site that still stocks PGP?  I'm running SunOS4.1.1 if that matters.

Thanks,
Russell.
