	Ryan has returned from his trip (also included some of
Germany and France) and has not gotten much net access since then.  
He's been busy on some other consulting projects, and has had some 
recovery to do.

	Almost immediately after returning to the United States
he was a passenger in a vehicle that was hit in a head on 
collision of about 50 MPH a piece.

	The vehicle was a Volvo station wagon and true 
to it's reputation the outside crumpled beyond recognition but
the passenger compartment was untouched. Ryan escaped with 
'only' internal bruising and general pain, while the passengers
in the other two vehicles were also treated for cuts, loss of
blood, massive smashedness and the like.

	Despite the realization that the superior armament of the
Volvo behemoth is what protected him from the other crazies on the
road (the oncoming vehicle was piloted by two guys who were watching
the aluminum in the back of their truck, instead of the which part
of US Highway 1 they were on), we are still going to West Palm beach this 
weekend to pick up the motorcycle he just bought. You'd think 
he'd learn from experience...

	One could say that *you* did not meet him...

	I guess that would include me! Yikes! If you are going to
firebomb our secret computing complex, at least let us be there
so we can be made into post toasties as the great ShorDurPerSav
from Waco has done.
