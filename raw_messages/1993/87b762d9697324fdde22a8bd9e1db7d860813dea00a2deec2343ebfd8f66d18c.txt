Bill is normally excruciatingly accurate, but in this case he is
slightly off -- he was charged with slandering the Royal Governor in
his newspaper. His defense was that his statements were true -- which
was not a defense under the law in question. The jury decided it was
sufficient, however. The rest of what Bill said was substantially
accurate.
