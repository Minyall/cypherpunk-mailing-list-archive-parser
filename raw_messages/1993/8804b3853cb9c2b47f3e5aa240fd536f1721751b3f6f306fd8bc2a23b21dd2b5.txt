If you wish to mix plaintext and ciphertext in an email message then
you can use Dolphin Encrypt.  Let's say your message is to consist of
P1/C2/P3, plaintext/ciphertext/plaintext, where C2 is ciphertext
derived from plaintext P2.  What you do is put P2 into a file F.TXT,
then run Dolphin Encrypt with a command such as:

                       DE E F.TXT F.ENC /t

After you give Dolphin Encrypt the encryption key F.ENC will be a file
which consists of pseudo-uuencoded ciphertext (that's what the "/t" is
for).  Run your mailer program.  Write your P1.  ASCII-upload F.ENC,
which is your C2.  (No need to mark the beginning/end of the
ciphertext block.)  Finish off with your P3 and send your message.

The recipient captures the entire message as, say, G.ENC, then runs:

                       DE D G.ENC G.DEC /t

(Of course, she has to know the encryption key.)  Dolphin Encrypt
skips over P1 to get at C2 and writes G.DEC containing P2.  Voila!
