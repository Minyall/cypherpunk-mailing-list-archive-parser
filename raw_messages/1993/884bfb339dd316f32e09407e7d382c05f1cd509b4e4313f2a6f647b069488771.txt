Wouldn't the solution then be to eliminate the capacity of local
municipalities to grant cable monopolies? Fiber is compact -- five or
even twenty cable companies could coexist happily in New York (where I
live) if the city didn't grant "franchises", which it charges
exhorbitantly for. With large scale competition between cable
companies, monopolies would no longer be a problem.

Isn't the problem in question the result of government granted,
rather than natural, monopolies? Isn't it thus wrong to call it a
"market failure"? Seems more like yet another government failure.
