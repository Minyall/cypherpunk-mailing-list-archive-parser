Maybe I'm the only one around here who feels this way, but when I see a
posting which begins with a whole bunch of inanely long quotes from previous
postings, often going so far as to have whole nests of stacked >>>> symbols
in front, I just go, *splat* and ctrl-C, and on to the next.  Like, if we're
reading this stuff regularly, we've got enough of a sense of the flow to be
able to recognise someone's position from an abridged or abbreviated quote.
For example, "Dolphin-crypt... an unexamined system (by analysts outside the
community)..."  does as well to convey the meaning involved, as posting a
huge nest of paragraphs quoted entire.  So in summary, what d' y'all think
of trying to cut down on the swarms of >>>>>>>>>>> lengthy full-paragraph
quotes and replace them with something a bit more compact, eh...?
