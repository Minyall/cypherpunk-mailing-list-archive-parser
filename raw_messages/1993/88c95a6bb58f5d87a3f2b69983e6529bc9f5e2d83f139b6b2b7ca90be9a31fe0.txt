There is also a company in Vancouver B.C. that will sell you a 
subscription to USENET on CDROM. Each CD contains about a week of 
traffic (the cost is something like US$20 per CD). They CDs don't 
include traffic from certain newsgroups (mostly the sex related 
ones. I guess they don't want to get busted for distributing
obscene material). 

I can dig up contact information, if anyone is interested. I spoke
with one of their representatives a while back, and they apparently
have sold subscriptions to various government agencies in the U.S.
and Canada.
