I notice, David, that you wear a tie when you come in to work in the
morning. (I happen to work with Dave.)

Why do you do this, in spite of your general dislike for imposed
standards? Because you want something out of your employer and feel
its better to put up with the minor inconvenience of wearing a tie.

Look, we can give people cryptography, or we can change their notions
of what "punk" means. Its not necessarily possible to do both at the
same time. I vote for keeping the world free, and putting up with
minor inconveniences in the meantime. I never liked "cypherpunks" in
the first place. I'm not a punk. I'm a reasonable person. Reasonable
people want the world to be free -- its not just a "punk" viewpoint.
We want people to have privacy via cryptography. Something like
"cryptoprivacy" seems like a better reflection of who we are.
