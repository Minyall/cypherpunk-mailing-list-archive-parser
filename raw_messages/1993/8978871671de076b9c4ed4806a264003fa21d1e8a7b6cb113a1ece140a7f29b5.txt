Hiyas,
   I've been discussing this with my friend who came up with the idea,
and he said that if anyone wants to discuss this whole concept with him,
feel free, he just doesn't have a huge mailbox, so he hasn't subscribed
to the list.  His address is:

      jon@werple.apana.org.au

mention 'punk.net'  which is his term for the concept. I prefer it to
the current subject of 'spread spectrum nets' or whatever is the
current vogue.

Also, anyone know how to set up aliases under elm? Or is the list in
general happy with this discussion taking place under the aegis of
cypherpunks@toad.com ????

I'd set up an alias file under elm to handle this, and then we could
boot off cypherpunk (maybe post a weekly digest or something) but the
man page for elm is missing on this site  (derrr...)

Dwayne.
