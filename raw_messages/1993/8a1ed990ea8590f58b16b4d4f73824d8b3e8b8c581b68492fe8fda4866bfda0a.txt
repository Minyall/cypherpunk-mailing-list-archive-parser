Yeah, the discussion centered on whether remailers should modify text
(converting tabs, crlf, strip signatures, etc.) or not.  I guess it
would be "best" if the remailers just pass text on through, but then
some people can't help extra stuff their mail software puts in.

Right now, you can form your message and encrypt it with extropia's
public key - that remailer will only forward text encrypted text, so
your signature will get removed.
