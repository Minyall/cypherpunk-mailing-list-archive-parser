This is called "security through obscurity."  I'm shocked to see it
advocated in this list!  ;^>

Opening up the list into a newsgroup has risks, but they can be mitigated
and doing so would make it easier to use, and reduce the load on toad.

One way to mitigate the effect on the list itself is (1) make the
connection 1 way (list->group), with postings to the group sent through
and anon remailer and (2) postings to the group from the list could
be signed to authenticate them.

Bottom line, isn't one of the goals of punkery in general (whatever
flavor) to _spread_ knowledge.  Shouldn't this stuff be shouted from
the digital treetops?
