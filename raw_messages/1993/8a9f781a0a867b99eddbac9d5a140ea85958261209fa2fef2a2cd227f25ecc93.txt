Sigh. Anyways, I've told you all the information there is to tell:
MIT administration (I/S) told me to shut down the keyserver.  They were
'pushed' by PKP (Probably Bidzos).  I do not know what was said, why these
decisions were made, nor what is being held over people's heads... But I
didn't believe I had the Political clout to do anything but comply.

----
notes: jim bruce is the vice president for information systems at mit.
in general, stuff like the above doesn't happen unless jim says so.
the request for the keyserver shutdown was apparantly not delivered in
writing to derek, so there is no permanent record of what happened.

the new keyserver at martigny.ai.mit.edu has the support of a full
professor; derek's did not.
