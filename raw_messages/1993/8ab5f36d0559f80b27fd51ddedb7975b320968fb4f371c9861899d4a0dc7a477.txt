600 bps is not realistic?  Voice has been gotten down to 400 to 600bps
by doing some coding on the output of a LPC (pitch + gain + filter
parameters) and transmitting that.  The remote decodes to recover
LPC parameters and uses that to synth speech.  The quality is supposed
to be the same as 2400 bps LPC (slightly synthetic sounding,  definitely
not 'toll quality').
