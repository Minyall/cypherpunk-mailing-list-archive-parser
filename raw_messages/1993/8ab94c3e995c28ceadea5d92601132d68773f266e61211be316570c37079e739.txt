I was hopeing to find a list of the remailers available that use PGP for
traffic encryption.

I noticed that the PAX scripts were made public recently, does anyone plan
to employ them at any of the current remailing sites?

Despite its problems, I thought PAX was on the right track with regard to 
tactics....
Comments?
