   Cheers for this note of sanity and compassion -- also proposed by Hal
Finney. Why can't we just discuss the pros and cons of the
spoofing/pseudonymity issue without flaming someone who feels very
passionately about the issue? The very vehemence of the discussion clearly
indicates that LD hit some nerves, and that fact alone should alert us to
try to consider the matter -- and post our replies -- dispassionately. Or,
if passion there must be, direct it to the issues, and not the people who
disagree with us.
