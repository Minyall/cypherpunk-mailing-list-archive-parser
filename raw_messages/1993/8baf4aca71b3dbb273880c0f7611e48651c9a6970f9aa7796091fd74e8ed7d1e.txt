Ah...do you mean "should not build", or do you really mean that it contains
a discussion outlining the logic behind predicting that they *won't*
build?

<shudder> I skipped that session because I was already bored to tears with
the prospect of "playing football from home while watching it on tv"
and by that of 500 pay-per-view-channels. Were they really boosting
HSN-type stuff? How completely evil!

I'm still dismayed by the recent FCC decision that HSN channels are included
in the category of (paraphrased) "for the public good". Was this due to
corruption, or merely a sharp drop in collective FCC IQ?
