The WSJ article about GPS has a familiar cypherpunk ring to it...the
commercial GPS signal is weakened (millitary 10ft accuracy signal is
encrypted), the "enemies" are using it for missile guidance anyway
(better than gyroscopes), and the hegemony of the US is wanning as
perfectly predicted in The Great Reckoning (James Davidson and
Rees-Mogg):  defensive technology is improving over destructive
technology and information technology eventually leaks out.
