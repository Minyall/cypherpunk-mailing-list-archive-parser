Guys,

(and, of course, all species that may be getting this)

I need a way to be able to have pgp envoked on a mail message that is
encrypted, or that has a pgp signature on it.  I would like it if it
just printed a banner about the fact that "this is a PGP encrypted
and signed meessage", then, if necessary, it asks me for my password,
etc.... and then says "message has been validated as coming from 
so-and-so" etc....


thanks,

- -nate sammons
