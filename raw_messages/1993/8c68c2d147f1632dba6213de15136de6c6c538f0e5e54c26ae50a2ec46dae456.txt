 I'm new at this, and i don't want to ask any favors
(i've seen what can happen to others that do)
but i just need someone to tell me where i can find
the pgp program so i can start to learn for myselt.
all you have to do is give me the ftp site, and i
don't care how much i get flamed because it'll be
worth it.
