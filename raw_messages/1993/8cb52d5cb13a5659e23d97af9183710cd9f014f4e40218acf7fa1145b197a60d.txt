Gopher to gopher.internet.com, port 2002, and you will find the Federal
Register online.  For most documents, you can only get the first
100 lines, but the use of the indexes is free, and many documents
are useful in this form.

You can pay them for access to the full documents, but they prohibit
republishing online -- though you're free to print the documents out.
What heart these guys have!
