As far as I can tell, the copyright issue exists only in David 
Sternlight's addled mind; and even he has conceded that he's got no 
factual basis for asserting that PGP might infringe someone's copyright. 
I can't tell if his messages about this reflect actual confusion about 
the difference between patent and copyright, or if he's simply stumbled 
across another FUD tactic to use against PGP.
