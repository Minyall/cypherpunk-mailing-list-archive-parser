My parents used to live in Canada and purchased some gold there; I was
using Canada merely as an example.  But the question of how the reputation
of a country might effect the reputation of its gold reserves stands.

Yes, but that would be at the expense of the owner, and if it looks like
gold, feels heavy in the hand like gold, and if it has the word Canada and
the number .999 stamped on it, then people (bankers) might take it at face
value (or might not, depending on the stability of that country).
