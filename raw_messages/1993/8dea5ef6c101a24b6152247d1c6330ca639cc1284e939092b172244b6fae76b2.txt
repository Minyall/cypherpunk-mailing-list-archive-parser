A review of the 
 ****Clinton Health Care Plan To Focus On Computer Support 10/07/93
WASHINGTON, DC, U.S.A., 1993 OCT 7 (NB)

"The Clinton Administration proposal would put smart cards in the
hands of every US citizen and some legal aliens that would
provide billing reference identification as well as carry up to
about 30 pages of medical data about the individual.

That change, along with a simplification of medical billing
forms, would literally save billions of dollars that could be
used to treat patients, and it looks as if there is growing
pressure from the public to actually force the health care
industry to take advantage of computer technology that has been
available for at least 10 years.

If health care reform really does take off, industry insiders say
that computer sales, and especially integration services, will
really explode, with health care taking on the same sort of high-
profile, high-profit role that was, until recently, the sole
purview of the military."
