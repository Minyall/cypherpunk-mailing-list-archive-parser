  I wrote some quickie installation docs and put a copy of my anonymous
forwarding software in soda.berkeley.edu:pub/cypherpunks/incoming/aforward.shar
If you don't know what the software is used for check the cypherpunks
gopher for a file like "Forwarding for multiple accounts"

p.s. I am not supporting it right now because of my workload. If it's bugged,
wait for a new version.
