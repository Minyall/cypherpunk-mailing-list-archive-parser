Welcome to TCP/IP. You've told us what most of us already know. (By
the way, its the SMTP EXPN command, not the "sendmail" one, as
sendmail is just one MTA -- there are many other implementations). The
whole point of this list is to develop techniques to ensure privacy --
most of us understand that there isn't much right now.
