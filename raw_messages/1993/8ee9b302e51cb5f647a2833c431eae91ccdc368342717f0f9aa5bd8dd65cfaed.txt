To really defeat traffic analysis you also have to remove any information
from volume of traffic.  If I don't know any message routing but I do know
that cme sent 10 MB of traffic and you received 10 MB of traffic and the
other 30 people on the anon subnet dealt with only 100B each, ....

So:  have everyone send and receive exactly the same size message to/from the
same sites at the same time every day.
