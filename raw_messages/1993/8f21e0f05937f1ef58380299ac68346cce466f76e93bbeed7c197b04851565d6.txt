Nonsense! (Not to sound like David Sternlight, or anything.)

This is what doors and locks are all about: to keep out folks who come
to our houses uninvited.

Anyone is free to look up the publically available information (or
privately available, if they get access to it...another matter) and go
to a physical location. My house, your house, Dorothy Denning's house,
whatever.

Trespass is another matter entirely. So is "stalking" (though I fear
the concept is being increasingly overused and may infringe other
basic rights).
