The fact that you have nested messages doesn't matter, since the
remailer, in theory, only opens the outermost envelope (The fact that
it finds another envelope and not some plain-text message shouldn't
matter to the remailer).

Also, depending on the kind and speed of the machine, and how much
mail it is going to get should affect the size of the key.

Does this help any>?
