This is an interesting point within itself. Anon messages from
remailers such as <nowhere@bsu-cs.bsu.edu> continually have the
same banner/header information, regardless of user (which in my
ideal anonymous environment is a GOO THING (tm)). Anon mail from
penet is account -ized and assigned -- not an ideal anonymous 
environment from my viewpoint.

The Net is still in its infancy, as far as I can assess. We will
all be much the historians, if the soothsayers are to be believed.
