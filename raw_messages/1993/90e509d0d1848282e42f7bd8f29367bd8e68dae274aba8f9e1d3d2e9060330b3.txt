A lot of coding?  You can come very close to doing it with
off-the-shelf code.  ka9q for SLIP.  Telnet authentication is now an
RFC, and encryption will be available probably within a few weeks.

Plus, with IP, you can use existing mechanisms (like POP) to get your
mail on your local PC and do your decryption there.  This is beyond
any PC code I know, and would require new development.
