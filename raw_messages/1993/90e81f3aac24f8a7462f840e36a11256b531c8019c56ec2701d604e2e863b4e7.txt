Not True.

The proposed legislation states:

	  (a)  Providers of electronic communication services and private 
    branch exchange operators shall provide within the United States 
    capability and capacity for the government to intercept wire and 
    electronic communications when authorized by law:  

This law does not prevent *users* from providing *end-to-end*
encryption.

This does not mean that they might not try to remove this right in the
future, but they haven't gone that far yet.
