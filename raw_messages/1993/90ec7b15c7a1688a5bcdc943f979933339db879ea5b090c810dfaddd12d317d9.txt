I sent the following to Julf earlier, and he encouraged me to post it to
news.admin.policy and the cypherpunks list. He mentioned that "the mapping
thing has been discussed recently". Feel free to tear it to shreds, but
remember that it is only a rough idea at present: don't tell me I forgot to
cross the 'l's (oops 't's).
