What theories? We *know* they are the ones who care about crypto and
have been trying to keep it restricted. This is as interesting as
saying "you know, I think that France is in Europe." Some have
accurately made the statement that the NSA does not directly enforce
any anti crypto export regulations but has to act through the commerce
department and the department of state, but we all know that they are
the ones who care in the long run. As for who in particular set off
this investigation, well, what does that matter? Lets say that it was
the NSA. Does this change anyone's strategy here?

Nah. I think that I pretty much summarized it the first time, although
you are misquoting me, in so far as I didn't use all those terms in
one phrase.
