I don't know if this is consistant with what everyone here is talking about in
regards to "outdialing serivce," but some time ago I heard about a 900 number
that a person could call, that would redirect their call so as to avoid being
traced, etc.  Oddly enough, I think they advertised that all the calls are 
logged and kept in some vault in another state.  I may be confusing something 
here though.  (As if this is the case, they've probably gone out of buisness.)
