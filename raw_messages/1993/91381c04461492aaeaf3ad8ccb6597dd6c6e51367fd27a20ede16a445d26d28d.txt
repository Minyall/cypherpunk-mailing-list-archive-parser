PCS is coming.  It will support data communications at moderate rates
to and from portable (handheld) units.  We may achieve some gains by
simply using PCS with encryption.  You (I don't know who:-) may object:
every PCS unit will have an ID will   hich will be traceable to a person.
But this need not be so.  What if XYZ cmpany were to buy thousands of
PCS units to issue to its independent agents and accept billing
responsibility for all of them? XYZ could use anonymous account registration
and pseudonyms from there on out.  Thus the telcos and PCS operators get
paid (by XYZ corp.) without having to know who the individual unit users are.
XYZ can cut off an anonymous user who fails to pay his bill by telling the
telcos/PCS operators to stop accepting calls from that ID (nobody needs to
know who the deadbeat connected to that ID is).  As long as there is
sufficient prepayment by unit users to XYZ, that meritorious company can
avoid losing its shirt to repeat deadbeats who keep registering
(anonymously) for new accounts, running up big bills and not paying.
What important point am I missing here? Thanks in advance to all the
professional flamers out there who will make it clear to me :-)
