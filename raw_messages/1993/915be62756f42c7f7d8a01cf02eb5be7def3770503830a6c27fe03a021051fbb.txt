    As an operator of an anonymous service, I'm constantly amazed at
    the things that supposedly worthwhile net.citizens will do,
    without even the slightest thought for the consequences.  And
    consequences there have been, sometimes potentially tragic ones.
    Perhaps I should tell some of my horror stories.

Yes! Yes!  Please tell us all the gory details!
