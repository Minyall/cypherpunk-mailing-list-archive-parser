Could you give an example?  I tried a message like the following
(between the cut marks) which I sent to elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu:

------------8<--cut-->8------------



::
Anon-To: klbarrus@owlnet.rice.edu




testing
------------8<--cut-->8------------

and it came back OK, with the blanks squeezed out.  So I'm probably
misunderstanding what you said.
