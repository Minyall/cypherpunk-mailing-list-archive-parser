On Nov 30, I sent a private msg to Eric Hughes asking him to put
Mike Ingle's Secure Drive program for MSDOS

   SECDRV10.ZIP    68155  11-19-93  Secure Drive 1.0 with SRC.

On the Soda.Berkeley FTP site and to advise me of its location.
I have not received any response at all.

I'm on a UUCP system, so I have to do FTP requests via an E-mail
server, which is cumbersome if one has to "fish around" for a file
one doesn't know the exact directory & filename for.

I'm aware that Mike said he hadn't submitted Secure Drive to the FTP
site because of "export concerns."  But since this site is already
distributing PGP, I wouldn't think this a "concern" to the site
administration.

So I'm asking any public-spirited Cypherpunk (perhaps even an
anonymous one) to place Secure Drive on an FTP site or a site
with an E-mail file server and to post the location of the file
either here or to me privately.
