	That definitely looks like a wise idea.
	Maybe if I can figure it out, among the writing of the
install-script I can add this little feature. Which newsgroup? Should
someone create an alt.remail? How exactly would it be implemented? I'm
thinking that simply the user would do:


::
Request-Remailing-To: sameer@netcom.com
Remail-ID: 572374237

	And the remailer would post to alt.remail:

Message with Remail-ID: 572374237 was remailed.
	Does that look good?
