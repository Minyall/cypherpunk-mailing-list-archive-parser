This is a great example of a issue we don't need to agree on.
The underlying cryptographic tools needed for private voting 
and digital cash are practically the same.  Once the common tools 
are written, each side can go finish off their own user interfaces, 
one labelled "cash market" and the other "voting booth".

So let's quit bickering and write those tools!
