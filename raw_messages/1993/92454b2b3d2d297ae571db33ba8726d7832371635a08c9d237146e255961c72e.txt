I learned about lots of this stuff in an advanced course in
cryptography taught by Zvi Galil and some of his students and
colleagues (like Stu Haber and Joan Feigenbaum) at Columbia.

I suspect that there is an academic discipline here (lots of PhDs
specializing in cryptography) and papers and academic journals and
conferences make it fairly clear that this data is common in academia.
