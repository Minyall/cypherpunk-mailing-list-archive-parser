I found the whole thing boring and very tiresome.  People here need to grow
up.  Get a life.  While some start and perpetuate flame wars, and take great
delight in screwing with other people, the NSA/FBI/NIST is sitting back and
laughing their heads off.  Stop wasting your energy fighting each other and
concentrate on the REAL threat.
