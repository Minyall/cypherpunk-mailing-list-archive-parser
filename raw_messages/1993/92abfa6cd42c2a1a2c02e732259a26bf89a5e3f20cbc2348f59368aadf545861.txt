re: AT&T questioning clipper and pushing clipped phones.

My guess is that AT&T corporate doesn't like the idea because they
know the long term consequences and the Greensboro division does like
it because it's income.  It's a classic case of corport schizophrenia.
Whether the patient ever becomes sane is an exercise left to the
patient.
