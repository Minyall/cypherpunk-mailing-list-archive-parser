I recall an SF novel that used small solar-powered planes as
repeaters. Add batteries for night time, make 'em cheap enough,
fly 'em high enough, give them smarts to avoid destructive
weather, and keep them light enought to avoid giving airplanes
indigestion should they hit, and I think you could solve a lot of
problems.
