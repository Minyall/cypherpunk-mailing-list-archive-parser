Jeez, talk about misinformation.

If it were copyright, then a US copyright is indeed restrictive world-wide;
that's the point of the Berne Convention.

However, it's not copyright; it's pretty tought to copyright an algorithm,
all one can do is copyright the exact expression of one implementation of
that algorithm. What's involved here is a patent, which is (as you note) not
binding outside the US.

Finally, is it certain that PGP indeed infringes on a valid patent?

Ah. This explains much.
