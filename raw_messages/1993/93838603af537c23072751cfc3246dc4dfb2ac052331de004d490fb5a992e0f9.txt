Hello, all!
 
There is an article in Information Week's October 11 issue titled "The 
Cashless Society" that discusses debit cards, smart cards, etc. This 
magazine is a management-type trade publication that bills itself as
"The newsmagazine for information management." A fair-sized article; it
may be of interest. Over the years, I've found this mag to be a fairly
good place to watch for trends; they carry the sort of articles that 
our brass photocopies and gives us with notes like "Can we do this?"
attached. FYI.
