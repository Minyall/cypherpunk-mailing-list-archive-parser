I wonder if Mr. Godwin will consider explaining whether making
"threats" like the above, serious or not, can possibly result in a
period of less-than-pleasant interactions between the author and the
FBI.  (I'm honestly curious; I really have no idea whether the answer
is "yes" or "no".)

If Mr. Detweiler were the President, then I would advise "rjc" to
rapidly locate a lawyer...
