   I am working on this very thing. We will be using LPC encoding for
   compression, IDEA for encryption, and DH key exchange for key handling.
   We plan to use something better than DH ASAP (something less vulnerable
   to man in the middle attacks). We plan to use 14.4kbps transmission
   speed.


Lance,

I'd be interested seeing the protocol that you plan to use.  

I've given a bit of thought to it, and it appears to me that the
protocol should negotiate *everything* up front.  This would include
data rate, xmit and recv speech coders, as well as crypto algorithm,
feed back modes, session keys, etc.  I've been thinking also that the
protocol should start out in async mode, and then possibly shift to
sync mode.  It should also be extensible.
