I don't get offended, I just save the subscribe/unsubscribe message
in a special folder that I will use to train a learning algorithm
to recognize these kinds of requests.  Then, I will create a program
that detects these so that mailing lists everywhere can automatically
bounce messages back to the sender with specific message like "please
send un/subscribe messages to fubar-request@node.com".

In other words, thanks for your example.  

Anyone who sends me examples will benefit this project.  (But don't send
examples from cypherpunks--I already get them.)

If anyone has suggestions for implementation that maximizes applicability
(e.g., I could write a C program that reads stdin or a named file and 
returns a status code), please let me know.
