	If everybody would be armend, we would no longer look at the
	government as the sole provider of protectios from violent
	crimes, rape, or muggings.

I'm sure lots of people could give examples of areas where "everyone"
*is* armed, and while they certainly don't rely on "the government"
(i.e., local police forces) for protection, most would agree the
situation is not desirable ...
