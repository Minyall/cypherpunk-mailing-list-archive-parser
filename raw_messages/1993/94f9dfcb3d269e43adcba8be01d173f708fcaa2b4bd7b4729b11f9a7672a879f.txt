Well, this is a problem with any nontrivial program.  But a script has going 
for it several very high-level constructs.  As people use any software, the
author will undoubtably have to improve it.  So, what is the difference if
he has to improve a script or a comm program?

That's why we have scripts in the first place!  Scripts' main purpose is to 
automate things.  How is this different with a comm program?  You still have to
remember how to use it....
