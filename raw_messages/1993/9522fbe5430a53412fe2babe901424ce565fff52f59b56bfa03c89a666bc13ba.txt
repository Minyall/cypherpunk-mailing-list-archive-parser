I have found myself writing things with nearly the same revolutionary bent
to congresional e-mail addresses.  Reading what Sandy has written, it 
finally struck me that the world we are envisioning and fighting to 
can very easily be cast as a communist/socialist movement.

On the other-hand, you can also envision an anarchist future much like
Gibson's novells where everyone is a free agent and thus out for his
own good: capitalism.

Lets have a discussion as to what political organization we ultimately
want to bring about.  If this has already been done, then please send me
references. 

I hope a world to come with an omnipresent network and widespread public
key encryption.  

National governments remain, but in a much diminished roll.  A global
government comes into being.  Represenative democracy is augumented with
the option of direct representation.  Everyone has a professional
represenative who is authorized and required to cast their vote on issues
which are appropriate for his domain.  At anytime, a voter can exercise
his own right to vote directly, thus reducing my represenative's voting
power by one.  There are represenatives at levels which might be
consistent with the current scheme: city, county, state, national, and
global. I believe that the inertia of the massess will give represenatives
in the larger domains the leway they require to impliment necessary but
less than popular policies.  Perhaps it should be implimented so that the 
larger the domain, the larger the percentage required to change a policy 
in that domain.
