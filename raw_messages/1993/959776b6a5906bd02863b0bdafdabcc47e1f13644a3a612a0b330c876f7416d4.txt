Will ViaCrypt consider exporting pgp? (well, I think I can guess the answer
;-) However, pgp is already widely used outside USA (at least as many as
the US users, I suspect). It would be interesting to know what they're
going to do about it. There exists no country boundaries in cyberspace, you
know!
