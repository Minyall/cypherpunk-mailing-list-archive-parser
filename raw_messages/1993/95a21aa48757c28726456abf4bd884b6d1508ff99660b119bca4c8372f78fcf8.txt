	Wouldn't it be possible to encrypt the plaintext with DES and
then when some TLA tells you to hand over they key tell them that it's
an OTP and give them an OTP which produces an innocuous plaintext?
	Then you don't have to worry about key storage, right? (Because
DES-keys are hashed from strings [right?] which can be kept in human
memory.)
