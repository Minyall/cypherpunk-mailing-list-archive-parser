I forgot to mention that mailcrypt uses a few emacs19 elisp features. It
shouldn't be too hard to hack it for emacs 18 compatibility, if you know
elisp. I only knowingly used two emacs 19 functions, `run-at-time' and
`kill-new'. The first is used to deactivate your passphrase
automatically after a time so it doesn't stayed stored in a
variable. The second is used in mc-temp-display, to transfer information
between buffers.
