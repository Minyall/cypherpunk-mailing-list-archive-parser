Here's mention of getting vinyl stickers made. Even smaller stickers,
for a "Big Brother Inside" negative campaign, could be even cheaper.
Paper labels could be cheaper still.

I have new prices on my vinyl stickers. They are now SCREEN PRINTED
so that the vinyl will NOT scratch off. My prices are now lower and
the stickers are better.

Anyone interested in these VINYL WEATHERPROOF GLOSSY STICKERS should
email menchett@cs.unr.edu for details.

They are CHEAP. $15 buys 100 cassette sized 2-color vinyl stickers!
