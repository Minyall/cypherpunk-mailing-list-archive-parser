Cypherpunks, Could someone send to me a list of software that expedites the  
processing of large amounts of e-mail? I'm on a next computer now and the browser,  
sorting, and mailboxes are very convenient. I won't always be using the next, though,  
and I'd like to start learning what the options are. Thanks, Walter A. Kehowski
