I just putting this out to test the "temperature" of the cypherpunks
"waters"...

I am considering posting a questionaire that I would like each cypherpunk
to answer...  Its not written yet, thought I do have a good idea of what I
want to ask, and I suspect it would be a little lengthy (I can think of a
good 10 questions, each requiring a paragraph or two to answer).  My goal
of the questionaire would be to see what type of people use
cryptography... (Quite a simple goal...  but not easily met...)  I will of
course make the results available to the group, and optionally the raw
data (the person filling it out would have the option of not having any
"written" (more than a yes or no) answer "published").  Would the majority
consider this good use of cypherpunks bandwidth, or are you all too secretive?
