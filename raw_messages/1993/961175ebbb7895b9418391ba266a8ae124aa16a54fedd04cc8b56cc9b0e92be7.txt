I sent some mail to pc-eudora-info@qualcomm.com about the status of an
MSDOS version of eudora that worked over a straight serial line (i.e.
a modem dialup) rather than a TCP/IP stack.  The reply I got back said
that they had talked about it, but had not planned it in yet.

Anybody itching to do the world a favor who can do this should contact
them directly and volunteer.  Consider this an open invitation.
