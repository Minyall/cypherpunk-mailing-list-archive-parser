I've released a few beta versions of my mailcrypt.el package to
alt.privacy.pgp, alt.privacy.ripem, and gnu.emacs.sources recently. It's
meant to provide an easy to use interface to PGP and RIPEM from within
emacs. It has support for RMAIL and VM.

I'm still making small changes to it, so I still consider it beta, but
everything does work. I will release it to the elisp archive when I stop
fiddling with it. I don't want to inundate this mailing list with
continual revisions of code only a few people might be interested in, so
if you'd like to play with it, you can pick up my last release to the
mentioned newsgroups, or email me for the latest version. If you have
afs, you can also pick up a copy at
/afs/athena.mit.edu/contrib/emacs-contrib/elisp/mailcrypt.el

I welcome any and all comments, suggestions, and additions.
