  The cell structure of 3 people wouldn't necessarily need to know
the "True Names" of anyone in other cells.  That's what the 
crypto-anarchy tools are for:  anonymous credentials, DC-nets and
webs-of-trust, digital signatures, etc.   These tools can be used
for "authenticating" the other cells, and communicating with them
without compromising (well... hopefully) your True Name and security.

  Knowing only anonymous Ids of other "persons" in the other cells is
useless to the "authorities".  Unless of course they can get your
passwords and keys and spoof you.  Now how can we make a protocol for
protection against such spoofing?  Some sort of Zero Knowledge proof scheme?
