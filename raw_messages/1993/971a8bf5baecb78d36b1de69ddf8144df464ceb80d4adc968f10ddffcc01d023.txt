  Unfortunately, I'm coming from the north, so I can't offer you a 
lift.  However, while we're on the subject, I'm wondering if any
arrangements have been made to distribute anti-Clipper material at
the con.  I'd be happy to distribute flyers or what-have-you, but
they'd have to reach the show by other means; I'm not willing to
carry such seditious material across the US/Canada border.
 
  I hope that EFF will have a presence at the show* as they did last
year, and can sow some further seeds of discontent among the
non-Internet online world, many parts of which don't seem aware of
the Clipper debacle.  Any comments from the EFF folks hereabouts?

Data Superhighway proposal.  Very libertarially-incorrect position to
take, Shari. :-)
