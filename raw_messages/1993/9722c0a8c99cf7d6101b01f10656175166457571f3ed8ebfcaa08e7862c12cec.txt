Re shredding documents: the best thing I ever found was to tear papers into
strips about an inch wide and feed them to an ordinary household blender
which is about 3/4 full of water.  Turns the paper into mush.  Flush the
mush and that's that.  NOt recommended for hiding evidence of crimes; the
perfect crime is an illusion fostered by the media.
