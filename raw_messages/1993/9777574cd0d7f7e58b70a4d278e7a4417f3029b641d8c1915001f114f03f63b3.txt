	Has anyone seen L. Detweiler post a *SIGNED* message, using a
*TRUSTED* public key, on this psuedospoofing matter?

	While I don't know L. Detweiler, I feel that there's reason to
believe that L. Detweiler might be undergoing an attack of a
spoofer/account-breakin who wants to discredit him.

	I can't see how someone who wrote an anonymity/privacy FAQ (I
haven't read that FAQ, so I can't say whether its a *good* FAQ or not)
could turn so irrational and paranoid. It's possible, but until it's
proven to me, with a trusted key, that *L. Detweiler* has been saying
these things, I'm going to assume that he hasn't, and ignore further
posts by an unsigned L. Detweiler.
