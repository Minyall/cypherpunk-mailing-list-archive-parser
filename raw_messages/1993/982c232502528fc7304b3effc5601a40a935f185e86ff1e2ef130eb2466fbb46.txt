	 I thought it was interesting that the danger of untraceable
	 drug dealers popped into the reporters mind when they were
	 researching the article. After all, they don't tend to 
	 mention illegal problems when they speak about used car dealers
	 or other services. 

Well, the article said that some of the phone store operators raised
the issue, often defensively.  Even if the reporter didn't know about
the issue beforehand, they sure knew after that.  Also note that part
of the market for such stores is that NY Telephone has cut off some
payphone service in certain areas, thereby sensitizing the reporter
to such questions.
