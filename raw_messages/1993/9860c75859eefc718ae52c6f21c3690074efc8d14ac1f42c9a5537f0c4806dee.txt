I'm truly amazed.  Mike Godwin, who is a lawyer who *specializes* in
this sort of thing, has rebuffed this statement several times, and
given his phone number for interested BBS sysops to call him.   And
yet, people continue to spew disbelief.

Of course, without real case law, Mike's opinion is still just that,
but when some BBS sysop gets nailed by the ECPA, I'm gonna laugh.
