Well, what if I need to the capability of doing 5-10 Mbyte/s?  I am still
haisng out a few design details of a "secure" BSD using encryption of the
filesystem before I hit the code and right now this particular issue is one
that I have still not worked out.  I need it in hardware.  Software is just
not fast enough and I a not sure how much work it will require to get a DES
card to do E(K1,D(K2,E(K1,x))) if I want to use 128 bit keys.

Does anyone know if there is a hardware implementation of IDEA or another
algorithm of suitable cryptographic strength available in a card or chip?
Then again, maybe I could use a clipper chip...   (big ;-)
