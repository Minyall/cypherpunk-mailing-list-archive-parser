OK So I am extremely irritating... :)(I sincerely
hope I am the biggest BURR under the saddle the government
has had in a long time) I too am disappointed... it had been my understanding
that julf was going to newgroup alt.whistleblowers... no action
on that front... I will be bringing up C-news this week and I will
see about it after that... you shouldnt have to wait too long...
   cheers
