Hfinney writes some excellent comments on anon remailers and how to
deal with them.

Possible low-tech solution: mail-list software where the moderator has
the ability to screen messages from particular sites and/or accounts.
In other words:

	IF account is in <list of jerks> THEN
		let_me_see_it_first
	ELSE IF site is in <list of anon sites> THEN
		IF account is NOT in <list of trusted anons> THEN
			let_me_see_it_first

Question: how easy is it to use public information (ie: out of the
phone book), PGP and an anon-remailer to create a "Fake ID"
