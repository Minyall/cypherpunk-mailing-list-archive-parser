As long as there is an approved version (ie., non-commercial, made by
the PGP cabal) -- interoperability will prevent any sneaking of back doors
into the message stream.  The only place to worry is with key generation,
both IDEA and RSA.

I wouldn't be surprised if they're using the BSAFE object code or something
equivalent.  In that case, key generation (random number routines, actually)
might be outside the package.  Does anyone here know?

If they're using a general purpose, purchased library from RSA (not RSAREF)
then there's no built-in DES limitation.

Meanwhile, I'm looking forward to the commercial version, for my machine
here at work.  Until then, I'm limited to RIPEM -- which few others on this
list speak.
