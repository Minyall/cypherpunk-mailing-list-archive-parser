regrets about the perhaps poor use of scarce bandwidth:

sci.crypt has disappeared from my news server
I haven't seen a cypherpunks mail item for some time... I used to see
something daily, some very interesting/some just valuable to me for
awareness raising value

is anyone there or did all the things we're concerned about come true?
