I have just set up a remailer on the system utter.dis.org
the address for this remailer is remailer@utter.dis.org.

utter.dis.org: is my home Sun Sparc Station thus you should not have
worry about the local sysad shutting the remailer down.
	
the system does not know that much about uucp aliases thus if you want it
get there you should use internet style addressing.

if anyone would like a direct uucp connection please email me.
