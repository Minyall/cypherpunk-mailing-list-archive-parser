 This is perhaps the most difficult feat to accomplish. Education and
 "awareness" are both strictly accomplished on a somewhat voluntary
 basis. For those who can absorb the importance and criticality of
 digital privacy, however, it's an eye-opener. A lot of folks have no
 idea how some of the proposed "legislation" would affect them
 personally.
 
 Cheers.
