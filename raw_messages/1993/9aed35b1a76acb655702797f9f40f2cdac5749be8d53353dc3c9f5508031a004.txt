A few years back a freind of mine was busted for putting up
anarchistic grafiti on some public buildings.  He told the judge
he was voicing his political opionions which was protected by the
1st amendment.

Rather than retort with "then keep it to newspapers and kiosks",
the judge actually told him that he was free to advocate any
government system he wanted, but advocating no government was not
protected.

Granted, boulder county's is not nessesarily the most authoritive
court in the country, but it is interesting that a judge would
actually say this.
