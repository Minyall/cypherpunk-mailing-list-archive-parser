    When amonium nitrate and diesel fuel in a 16 to 1 ratio are outlawed 
    only outlaws (and farmers) will have amonium nitrate and diesel fuel in 
    a 16 to 1 ratio.
If you're going to be cool and make ANFO, you gotta spell it rite:
Ammonium nitrate.  Don't leave your correct name and address on the
rental car, either.

Kids: Don't do this at home.
