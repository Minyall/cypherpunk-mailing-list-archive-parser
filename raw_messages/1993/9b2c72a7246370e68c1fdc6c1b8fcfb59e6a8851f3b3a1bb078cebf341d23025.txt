Hmm, I write code -- but so far no cyphercode.

Since I'd like to be part of the cypherdelic revolution,
what code needs writing?  I agree that the PC/modem
scrambled telephone is a good idea, but others are already
bashing that out; there must be other neat projects that
want doing.  Any thoughts?
