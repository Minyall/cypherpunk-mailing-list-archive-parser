Fans of the Numerical Recipes book might like to know there's a second
edition out.  It includes quite a few improvements, and a much expanded
chapter on random number generation.  However, the DES routine from
the first edition has been flushed on the grounds that it was too slow
to be useful as an RNG.  Oh well.
