Preempt government restrictions by fighting for the explicit right to
strong cryptography.  Point out how those foolish folks south are
going to screw themselves over by government mandated cryptography.

One of the arguments that is being made in this country against the
wiretap chip is that it will harm overseas business.  In Canada you
can turn this around and show what a great economic boon you have
available.  You can point out that the US has abandoned their foreign
markets in secure communications, which will, of course, be the only
kind of communications of the future.

Get Northern Telecom on your side.
