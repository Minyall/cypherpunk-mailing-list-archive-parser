I fully agree.

I think this is less of a problem. Given a good cryptograpic hash
function, I would simply hash *all* of the clock bits, without regard
to which are the "hottest" ones. If (important 'if') there is
sufficient total entropy in the input bits, hashing should effectively
"distill" the input entropy into the output bits.
