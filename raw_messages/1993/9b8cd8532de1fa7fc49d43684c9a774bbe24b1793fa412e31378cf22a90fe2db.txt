  As someone who has gotten some pretty crusty mail for posting 
issues related to the social and cultural aspects of encryption  -- "stay 
on the subject! this place is about encryption, not politics!" -- may I 
ask -- very politely, of course  -- what these plugs for netcom are 
doing here? I'm using a different provider, and am very happy with them. 
But should I be plugging them (or dinging them) on this list?
