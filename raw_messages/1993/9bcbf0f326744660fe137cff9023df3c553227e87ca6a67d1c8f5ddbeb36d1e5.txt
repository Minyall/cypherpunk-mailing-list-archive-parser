Since IDEA was developed outside the US, doesn't that mean it there 
essentially is no exporting of cryptography going on here?  To be 
perfectly invulnerable, the code could be distributed internationally
without any encryption algorithm--simply add the crypto you want that
is easily obtainable.

(Of course, selling crypto is the real trigger for getting attention.
A copy-left certainly isn't selling.)
