It should also be noted that the MMPI is designed to diagnose abnormal
personalities, while the California Personality Inventory (CPI) is designed
to diagnose more or less normal personality traits.  It seems that
companies indiscriminately giving the MMPI to individuals without suspision
of neurotic/ psychotic tendencies would open themselves up for a solid
thumping in court.

P.S. - I noticed a book on the statistical basis of the MMPI in the
psychology section of Border's Bookstore in Tysons Corner, VA, a few months
ago.  If there's interest, I could look for a citation on my next trip
there.
