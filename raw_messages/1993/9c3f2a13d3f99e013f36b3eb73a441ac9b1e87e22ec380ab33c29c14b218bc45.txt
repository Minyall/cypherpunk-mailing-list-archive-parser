If this PGP case ever goes to trial it might just end once and for all
the idiocy of the US gov't trying to prevent the rest of the world from
reading what's already been published.  

Butthead: uh huh...uh huh...say Beevis, do you think they have computers
          in Europe?

Beevis: huh huh...huh huh...Nope, they don't have phones either...huh huh

Butthead: So, uh huh...this PGP thing is gonna stay in America?

Beevis: uh huh...yeah, that's right...uh huh...right here...huh huh

Butthead: Encryption is cool.

Beevis: Yeah.
