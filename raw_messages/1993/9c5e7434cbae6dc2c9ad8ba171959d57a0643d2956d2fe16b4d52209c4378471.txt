Quoting from the FAQ (Bruce Schneier's "Applied Cryptography") pp. 213:

   1. If everyone needs prime numbers, won't we run out? No, Santa would
      never run out of prime numbers for all the good little boys and 
      girls. In fact, there are over 10^150 primes of length 512 bits or
      less. (For numbers of size N, the probability that a random number
      is prime is one in log N.) There are only 10^84 atoms in the universe.

only need about $50, including tax) and buy this book.
