Heh.  OK.  Well, if one behaves "ethically", then I guess *that* closes
the issue.  It's his machine and he gets to make the rules.  (this is
my personally-adhered-to point of view)

On the other hand, he doesn't seem to have protected himself against
steganographic users (though the low bandwidth of steganography compared
to obvious encryption may make the steg channel less useful).  Others
may choose to take this point of view- but it's your karma.
