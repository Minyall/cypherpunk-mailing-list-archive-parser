Forcing all three people for signing the document can be done as
by merely splitting the secret key into three parts.  Then, all three
must be used to reassemble secret key in order to sign the document.

If both methods co-exist, then each individual can sign the document
from information they know from being able to decrypt.

Unless you go to a modified RSA system like Eric described.

(it's much easier to force all three to sign and all three to decrypt
:-)
