I understand. I think that we're looking at different sides of the same
coin. I'm taking the long view, where you're taking the short view. For
the next several years, I agree that bandwidth will continue to increase
even as cost-per-bit-per-second continues to fall.

My previous comments were directed at the long term view, which may
be inappropriate to discuss at the moment, since naturally the long term
has no immediate pragmatic import.

Just keep those comments in mind 5 or 10 years from now. ;-)
