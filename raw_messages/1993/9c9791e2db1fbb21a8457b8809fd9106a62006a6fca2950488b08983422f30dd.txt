Commies -- Ya gotta love 'em.

Are there any "designs" for the NII that don't include telephones, email, 
and internetworking connections?  Given those, the rest is irrelevent.  
Anyone who wants to can build their own virtual networks no matter what 
the "service providers" do.

Are these people stupid or just power mad?  Networking is and will 
continue to be nearly free.  Who has better network connections with 
"universal access" Europeans or Amricans?

"Skim the Cream" "Skim the Cream" "Skim the Cream" -- the next commie that 
says that to me is sure going to get his cream skimmed.
