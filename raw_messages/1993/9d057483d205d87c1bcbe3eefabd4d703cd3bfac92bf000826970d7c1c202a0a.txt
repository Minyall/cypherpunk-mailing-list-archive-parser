Boy, its a good thing that was posted anonymously. A real budding deep throat

More recently, Inman was quoted by John Barlow in "Decrypting the Puzzle 
Palace" as saying ' "My Answer", he said "would be legislation which would 
make it a criminal offense to use encrypted communications to conceal 
criminal activity...you could have a registry of institutios which can 
legally use cryphers. If you get somebody using one who isn't registered, 
then you go after him." '
