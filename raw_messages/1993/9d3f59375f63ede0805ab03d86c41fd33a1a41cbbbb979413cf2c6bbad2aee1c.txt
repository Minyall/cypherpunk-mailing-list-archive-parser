In a discussion on the Well, some folks were speculating about the idea of
lots and lots of people & companies applying for those arms export licenses,
on the basis that they *might* sell crypto to a foreigner, or *might* go on
an overseas business trip with their laptop with a crypto program on it,
etc.  This is a great case of an old protest tactic which we used to call
"saturation," which involves lots and lots of people scrupulously obeying an
unfair or controversial law to the point where it starts to swamp the
system.  

Seeme like it might be worth looking into.  Any comments...?
