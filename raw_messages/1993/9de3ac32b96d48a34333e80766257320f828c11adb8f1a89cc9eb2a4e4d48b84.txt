Please, everyone who is working on this, remember.  You can't do hard
disk encryption in software on the host CPU.  Thanks to Jim for
reminding me to stress this.

DES hardware is already available and tested.  Use it.  Use a
triple-keyed EDE version of DES.  

Is someone selling a raw DES chip on an ISA card?  If so, use that so
that others don't have to hack together their own hardware.

The keying material for the disk should not be one key for the whole
disk.  The keying material could easily be one key per track without
the keys growing too large.

Ideally this keying material would be held on a removable PCMCIA card
and would talk directly to the device encryptor hardware with a
protected channel.  That will have to wait.
