I don't run my life based on a spreadsheet.  There are plenty of very profitable
things I could do that I don't because I think they're scummy.  The makers of
napalm didn't take "political rectitude" into account either; nor did those
bastards (Dow Corning?) who knew the truth about breast implants but hid it to
protect their bottom line.  Sorry, but I find this attitude extremely disturbing.

I'm not expecting anything of the kind.  I'm not a capitalist, so it's not my job
to work out these contradictions.
