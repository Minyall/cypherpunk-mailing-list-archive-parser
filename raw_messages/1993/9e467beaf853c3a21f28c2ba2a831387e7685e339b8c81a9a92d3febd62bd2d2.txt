Uu> I was shocked to find that people still use pgp v2.1.

I don't know where you've been, but version 2.2 has a notorious bug
that locks up the box under numerous situations.  In my experience,
version 2.2 locks up 8088-based computers.  Version 2.1 does not.
There is an unauthorized bug fix version, 2.21.  I use 2.2 as it runs
well on my system.
