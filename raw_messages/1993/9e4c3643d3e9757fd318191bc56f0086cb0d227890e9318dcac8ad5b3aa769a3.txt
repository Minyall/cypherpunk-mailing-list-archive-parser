Well, you can always run your own remailer or two... :-)

Actually, this is quite similar (identical to?) anonymous pools.  The
stuff about interfacing different pools sounds good.  Miron is running
one at extropia.wimsey.com (mail to pool0-request or pool0-help).
Basically, it is a mailing list with several subscribers.  If you want
to send a message to one person, encrypt it and send it to the pool.
Everybody gets the message, but only one person can decrypt it.
