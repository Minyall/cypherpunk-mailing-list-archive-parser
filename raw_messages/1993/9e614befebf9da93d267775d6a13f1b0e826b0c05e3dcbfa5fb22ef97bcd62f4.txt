Is anyone against changing the name from cypherpunks to cryptoprivacy?

Seems to be the general consensus... that cryptoprivacy would be more PC.
Unoriginal Thought:  couldn't the list/group name be changed to "CP"?

o  For outsiders, and formally, it could stand for CryptoPrivacy
o  To insiders... it could still stand for CypherPunks
o  CP is the opposite of PC (I like that).

back to lurking,
Garrett
