Actually you don't have to give the exact phone number.  In most dense areas
the phone number prefix should be enough to get you in the proximity of
where you want to go.  Then when you get there, find a pay phone call up
the person you want to reach and ask for directions from your current
location.

Of course, it becomes an invasion of privacy if you use the guy's real
number and he hasn't invited you!
