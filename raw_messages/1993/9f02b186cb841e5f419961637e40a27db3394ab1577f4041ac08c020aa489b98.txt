  There was some posting a while back on one of either sci.crypt
or alt.privacy I think by one of Chaum's graduate slaves about
a paper he'd written and put on anon. ftp.

  Does anyone have that ftp address?

  There doesn't seem to be a paper about digicash at
soda.berkeley.edu's  cypherpunks directories.  Any idea where it could
be?
