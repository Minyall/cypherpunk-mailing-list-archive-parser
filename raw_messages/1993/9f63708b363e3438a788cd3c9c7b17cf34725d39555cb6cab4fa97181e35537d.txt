That is insane... remailers are not the place where this kind of work
should be taking place. If anything the user should run his document
that (s)he wants stripped of grammer clues with software designed for
that purpose on on his/her own machine.  This way, the user can see
immediate results.  They don't have to wait anywhere from 1 minute to
a few days to see the results of the "rephrasing remailer".
