Is it possible to use RSA all the way through a PGP encrypted message
(do not use IDEA)?

If so, how?  I know it would take a LONG time, but it would make for
a nice option.

If not, why?  Although, it might take "forever", why not make it an
option for those willing to wait?

Am I mistaken in believing RSA is more secure than the present hybrid?


Thanx,
