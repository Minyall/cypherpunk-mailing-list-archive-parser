I didn't go that far,  but if we decide to send a letter to the White
House this way,   we all should collaborate on what to say,  in relation
to our concerns,  etc.   Then  each of us can "Sign" the letter
using our PGP Signatures.

I also thought about sending my PGP key,  but still deciding on what I
want to say relating to my personal concerns.
