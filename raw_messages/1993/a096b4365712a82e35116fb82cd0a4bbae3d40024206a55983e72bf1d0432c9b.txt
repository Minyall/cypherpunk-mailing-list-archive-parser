I remember a sf suggestion a while ago that went like this:
a. A mail reader that intelligently filters incoming messages to extract
only the factual content.
b. A mail sender that intelligntly "stylizes" a factual message with
appropriate "fluff".
That way I can send you a one line message "watch out for the MDS!", but
our computers will communicate with as much polite waffling as possible.

The suggestion was a joke but maybe it has applicability :-)
