A nice idea, but functionally impossible with today's technology.  The
firmware of CD-Rom players does not allow them to read the digital data of
an audio CD and output it in digital, the output must be analog.  The only
exception to this that I know of is the SGI CD-rom.  This restriction
against digital output from audio CDs was put in after the music publishing
industry made a big issue over pirating music, etc...

I am not sure what mods have been done to the firmware of the SGI CD rom
players, but the people on alt.cd-rom say it can read the digital data from
audio-cds.  Without this capacity you are not going to be able to stick the
message in the CD as easily as you would be able to with a cd-rom player
that could read digital...
