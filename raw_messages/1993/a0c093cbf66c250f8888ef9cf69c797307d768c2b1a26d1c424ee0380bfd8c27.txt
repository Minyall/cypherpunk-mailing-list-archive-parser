I  can think of two:

1.	a long-period PRNG (like subtract-with-carry) feeding a
	cryptographically strong hash function (perhaps triple-DES
	in ECB  mode with both key nad input taken from the PRNG
	and output becoming the new PRNG output;

2.	Russell Imagliazzo's (sp?) PRNG as strong as subset-sum.

	Reference:
	R. Imagliazzo, M. Naor, 
	``Efficient Cryptographic Schemes Provably as Secure as Subset Sum.''
	FOCS89.


	For example:  (if I  remember correctly)


	Algorithm:

	Take an array of 512 numbers, each 521 bits long.
	Fill those with true random bits (coin flips, etc.).

	fill a 512 bit register with random bits.

	associate each bit of the register with one entry in the array.

   loop:

	for each bit in the 512-bit register, if the bit is a 1, add the
	corresponding array entry into a 521-bit accumulator (init'd to 0
	at the start of this pass), modulo a 521-bit prime.

	at the end of the pass over all 512 bits, take the low order
	8 bits of the accumulator as your output byte (a pseudo random
	value) and the next 512 bits as the new register for the next round.
	Toss the top bit.

	goto loop
