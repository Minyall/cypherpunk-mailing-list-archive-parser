It doesn't much matter; they're using ten- and sixteen-bit keys.  
Assuming it takes some 50 ms to tell voice from the white noise that
a failed attempt will generate, a brute-force attack on these
systems should take under a minute and an hour respectively,
worst-case.  This is hardly rock-solid security; it looks like it
rests mostly on nobody reverse-engineering their algorithm.
