You don't use the system telnet, you write your own socket application.
No UNIX systems I know log at this level, but it is certainly possible.
Or someone could record packets off the local Ethernet. There's not much
you can do about this.

You could hack up a copy of sendmail, but SMTP is so trivial that you
could do it yourself, especially since the functionality you need
is so limited.
