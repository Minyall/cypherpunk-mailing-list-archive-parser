[excellent reasoning by Mr. Broiles deleted]

Also, as in the case of newsgroups such as alt*.abuse.recovery, the very
fact that your perp might be on the net, and harass or attempt to extract
revenge or retribution for posting, is a great reason to be anonymous.
There is a very real threat that if you post about your perp and he finds
out who you are, you might find yourself facing the business end of a
rather large, loaded, gun in the hands of a very pissed-off individual.
