Learn something new every day.  On *my* (SCO unix) system it is easy
to read the command line via ps.  On *my* system ps -e reports on
every process, not the environment.  I can find no reference to
'environment' in the ps man page.  Finaly, after talking with a more
knowledgeable-than-I unix guru, I felt that the environment was a
safer place to put the passphrase.

But, since there is at least one place where this is not true (and
after reading some BSD man pages, it seems there a quite a few), I
will have to *improve* my code.  I will offer all three ways
(environment, command line, and file-descriptor) to input a
passphrase.  (And will try to figure out how to read the environment
of other processes under Sys V...)  I would apreciate input from unix
gurus out there about which systems make the environment hard to read,
and which easy; and similar stuff about the command line, and pipes.

Thanks for your help making pgpmail even better!
