Cypherpunk leaders, state the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
the truth on the charges of routine, systematic, rampant, and
conspirational pseudospoofing and deception of the media and your
followers, publicly to all those you have affected in Cyberspace.

Cypherpunk followers, demand publicly and privately of your leaders the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, and accept nothing less.

Otherwise, watch the `movement' and your reputations dissolve before
your eyes far beyond the present deterioration, to near total oblivion.

You have 24 hours.
