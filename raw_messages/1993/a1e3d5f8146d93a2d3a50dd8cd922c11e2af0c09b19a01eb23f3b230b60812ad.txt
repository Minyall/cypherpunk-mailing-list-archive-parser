 MORE ON ESCOBAR DEATH
 MEDELLIN, ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT REUTERS REPORTED THAT POLICE AND TROOPS SHOT
AND KILLED FUGITIVE DRUG LORD PABLO ESCOBAR ON THURSDAY AFTER A FURIOUS ROOFTOP
SHOOT-OUT IN MEDELLIN'S LAS AMERICAS SUBURB.  (ALSO SEE THE OTHER DECEMBER 2
REPORTS.)  WITNESSES AT THE HOUSE WHERE ESCOBAR WAS KILLED SAID THEY HAD SEEN
THE BEARDED FUGITIVE ATTEMPTING TO FLEE ACROSS THE ROOF BEFORE SECURITY FORCES
OPENED FIRE. ESCOBAR'S BROTHER-IN-LAW CARLOS MARIO HENAO WAS ALSO KILLED IN THE
SHOOT-OUT. ESCOBAR HAD BEEN ON THE RUN SINCE ESCAPING FROM JAIL IN JULY 1992,
ALONG WITH NINE OF HIS ASSOCIATES.  POLICE CAUGHT UP WITH HIM AFTER A 16-MONTH
SEARCH BECAUSE OF A FATAL MISTAKE -- A TELEPHONE CALL TO HIS FAMILY ON
WEDNESDAY, ESCOBAR'S 44TH BIRTHDAY.  ELECTRONIC MONITORING EQUIPMENT ALLOWED
POLICE TO PINPOINT THE LOCATION OF THE CALL AND MOUNT THE OPERATION IN SECRECY,
SURROUNDING ESCOBAR'S HIDEOUT WITH SHARPSHOOTERS.  WITHIN HOURS OF THE DRUG
LORD'S DEATH,  ESCOBAR'S 17-YEAR-OLD SON VOWED REVENGE AND HIS MOTHER PREDICTED
THAT "HORRIBLE THINGS" WOULD HAPPEN, BUT THE YOUNGER ESCOBAR LATER SAID HE WAS
REACTING OUT OF GRIEF AND WAS NOT ISSUING THREATS.

I don't know where the babble about calling a radio station came from,
but this caught my eye as it seems to be the "offical" state department
word on the topic.
