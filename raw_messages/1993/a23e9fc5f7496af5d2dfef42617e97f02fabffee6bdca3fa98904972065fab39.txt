I think the question should be:

 Do I want my taxes to pay for somebody elses Internet connection?

I would answer no... (a moot point though, since for one, I'm Canadian,
and for another, the government would probably do it anyway, whether you
want it or not...)

This attitude tends to put me on the opposition for government supplied
networks. Hell, I currently have 5 unix accounts scattered here and there
in cyberspace... I think the main problem is that most people *don't* see
the benefits they would get (I think e-mail probably being the biggest)
since most people are fairly computer illiterate, and even many of the
ones who can handle themselves quite well on a computer don't know the
first thing about the benefits of a network...

(These attitudes were gleaned from working about a year and a half in a
computer store... Wonderful places to meet all sorts of redundant people :)
