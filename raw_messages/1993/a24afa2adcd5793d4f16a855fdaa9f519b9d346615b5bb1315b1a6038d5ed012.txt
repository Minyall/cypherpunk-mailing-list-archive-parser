Would someone be able to send me the most recent verions of the utils to
use PGP with ELM?  Just got a new account and finally have ELM.  If you
can, mail 'em or anon ftp to netcom.com and put them in pub/ral/incoming.

While i'm at it, has anyone ever tried to integrate PGP into VMS MAIL?

Thanks, 
 bob
