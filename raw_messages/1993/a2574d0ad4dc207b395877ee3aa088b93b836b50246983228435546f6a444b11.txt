John Gage tells me that audio from the Congressional hearings on
telephone privacy and Clipper will be multicast on the Internet
`MBone' (multicast backbone).  We don't yet know the multicast address.

If someone who knows about the mbone could hook in and record a copy
of the hearings (as an online sound file, or on tape), that would be
great.  I'll be at a conference on Thursday.
