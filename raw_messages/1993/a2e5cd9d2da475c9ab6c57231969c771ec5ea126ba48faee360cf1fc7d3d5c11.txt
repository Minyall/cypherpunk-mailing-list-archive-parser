Senator Harris Wafford (sp?) on Larry King Live just flashed a mockup of 
the Health Security Card.  It is white.  It has a red, white, and blue 
flag on it.  It looks like it has a 7 digit number on it in the EIN split 
pattern 99 99999.  It was hard to count digits though.  It might have 9 
digits rather than 7.  Wafford did use the term "smartcard."  I'm sure 
Willy will feature one in his speech tomorrow night.

"Where's your Health Security Smartcard."

"Sorry, I'm don't believe in that sort of thing.  I'm an anarchist.  You 
know, that's an alternative life style sort of like sodomy.  They're 
starting to teach it in the schools and everything."
