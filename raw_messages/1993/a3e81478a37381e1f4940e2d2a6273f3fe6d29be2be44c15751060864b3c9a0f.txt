This could tie a lawyer up in fits, because even if you sent digital
cash across the border, you could still produce a _spendable_ copy
in the originating country!  In fact, you could have the same 'bill'
residing on media in a dozen countries!

You couldn't legally spend more than one copy of the digital cash,
of course, but digital cash (unlike hard cash) can be located in
several places -- and probably would be if you're talking about a
substantial amount of money.

Many countries restrict or monitor the flow of currency across their 
border; this isn't simply a result of the WoD.  However, the WoD was
the main reason publicly acknowledged.
