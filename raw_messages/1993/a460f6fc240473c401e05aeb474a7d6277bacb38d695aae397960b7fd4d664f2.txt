no.  establishing and securing a monopoly is the whole point of patent law.

personally, i plan to continue to infringe on the pkp patents -- protected
by the research use exclusion and the rsaref noncommerical-use license -- 
while the onslaught of time makes pkp assets ever less viable.  

fuck 'em.  join me.
