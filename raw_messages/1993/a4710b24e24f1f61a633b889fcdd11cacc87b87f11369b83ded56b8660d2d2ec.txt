    I'm not really sure what point I wish to make. Packwood on 
    McNeill-Lehrerer seemed to deserve consideration. The question
    of what one may expect to be private seems paramount. Just now
    the whole country is paying attention to the issue, so if you 
    can figure a way to attract their attention, major leverage may be 
    obtained.

    What would Packwood have gained if he had used PGP or DES ?
