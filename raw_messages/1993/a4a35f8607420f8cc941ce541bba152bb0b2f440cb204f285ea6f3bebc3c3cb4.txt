...which would seem to put the lie to (the general application of) my
ealier statement:

  >[the key] can be mailed automagically to RSADSI


Which turns out to be true only for the 'low assurance' RSA Persona
Certificate Authority (currently handing out certificates for free) which
does no verification of the user<-->id link.  CAs with more stringent
policies have stronger prerequisites for the issuance of a certificate.

Hope this helps,
