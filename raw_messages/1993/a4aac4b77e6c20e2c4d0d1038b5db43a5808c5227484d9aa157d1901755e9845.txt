When a baby is born, a soul enters the world. When a person dies, a soul 
exits.

Reality is like the Internet. There are legitimate ways for souls to enter and 
illegitimate ways. You could be `born' under your true name, or you could 
get in through the subversive route and infect an outlet susceptible to 
Multiple Personality Disorder, or possess someone.

It's very difficult to detect, of course! When it happens, Call 1-800-EXORCIST
