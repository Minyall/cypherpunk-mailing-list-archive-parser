We at Illuminati Online have finally gotten to the bottom of 
l'affaire Detweiler.

It began with the simple statement, "This moron is *everywhere*,
no one person could be churning out all this fantastic babble of..."

And then it hit us. Of course! The REAL Medusa is L.Detweiler and
S.Boxx and The Executioner and The Pervert, a pseudopool with
STRINGENT stylistic REQUIREMENTS about how to disrupt, discourage
and defame cypherpunks.

We're onto you now... even now, agents are converging on your
secret headquarters...
