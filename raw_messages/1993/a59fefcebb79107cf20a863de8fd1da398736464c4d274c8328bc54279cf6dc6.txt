Hello, data-killers!
 
After reading recent posts about how to keep data (and PC disk
drives) out of others' hands (shredders, double-layer encryption
schemes for 'revealing' a bogus plaintext while keeping the real
data hidden, etc), I had an evil thought....   >:)
 
Thermit grenades are pretty simple; all they do is provide a means
of initiating the "thermite reaction." (Look it up in a chemistry text.)
Equal parts aluminum powder and iron oxide (rust), finely ground and
ignited by (say) a burning magnesium strip, produce the same effect
and would quite satisfactorily destroy a disk drive in a matter of 
seconds. Likewise the PC, desk, floor - quite possibly setting the 
whole building on fire - "collateral damage," I guess.
 
Don't screw around with this stuff in your basement, people - it is a 
_very_ fast, _very_ hot reaction that produces a slug of superheated 
molten metal. For the truly paranoid among you, however, it might be
a viable last-ditch ploy to foil the Gestapo. Do be careful.
