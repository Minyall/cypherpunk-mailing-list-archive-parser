Actually, I was thinking that whistleblower@anon.penet.fi would _be_
the moderator.  Then you just post directly.  All the messages would
come from that address, and no id's would be assigned.  Since all
messages are from "whistleblower", replies to a poster go right back
out to the list, also anonymized.

It's actually a much simpler system than is currently implemented,
since id's arenit involved at all.

PGP 2.1 contains the cleartext-signature feature, and the periodic
posting to the list should mention this.  This allows a real pseudonym
to develop, just like we want.
