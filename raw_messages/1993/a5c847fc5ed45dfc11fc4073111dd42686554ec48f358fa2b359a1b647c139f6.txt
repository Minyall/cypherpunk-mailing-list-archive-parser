Bombs & bulletin boards: the news media regularly mention the name of the
chemical used to stinkbomb abortion clinics, and the composition of the
world trade center bomb.  So it seems to me a decent defense could be made
on the grounds of "selective prosecution" since after all, juveniles can
always tune in the news and learn how to make bad things.  Well...?
