The problem is, unless you're very careful about distributions and such,
you can easily clog the net with zillions of public-key-encryptions to
alt.security.pgp.messages <grin>.  But then again, I suppose it's not
any more traffic than alt.sex.pictures.erotica.* generates. :)

It would be trivial to write a script to be put in your .login to
automatically skim that newsgroup for anything encrypted with your public
key.  Hmmm...
