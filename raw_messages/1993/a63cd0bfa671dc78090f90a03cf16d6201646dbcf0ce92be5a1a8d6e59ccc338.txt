	Right, but as the price drops more people will be able to
afford one? I would sure be willing to spend a few hundred on a CD-ROM
writer (that's how much the readers cost now, right?) in order to
make/destroy OTPs. (And by the time the price *does* go down that far,
I should have the money to buy it, hopefully.)
	On checksums-- I wouldn't know how the devices work, but that
looks like a task for a talented cypherpunks hardware hacker.
