Someone walking around a city shooting a rifle is likely to attract a
lot more attention than a secret network would.  Secondly, the
transmitter doesn't necessarily have to be exposed, it could be kept
hidden and only the antenna would need to be exposed.  You'd have to be
a damn good shot to hit a wire antenna.  Plus the antenna would be easy
to disguise or hide in many places.

Well, you may know that you can reach a certain person thru site #127,
and that stie #127 can be reached thru site 35 or site 68, and so
on...which gives you a sort of virtual-space map, which would reveal
nothing about actual phyical location of the sites or the person you are
contacting.  Suppose you were connected to site #1 and you were
communicating with site #3 thru site #2.  Site #3 could be 50 meters
away, or 2 km, and you would never know the difference because you
didn't have any way to directly contact site #3.  Hence we have achieved
our objective - you know how to contact site #3 in netspace - it has a
cybernetic location relative to other sites, but that tells you nothing
about it's actual physical location.
