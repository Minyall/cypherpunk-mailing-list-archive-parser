Yes, actually it does.  Hardware cannot be widely and freely distributed
the way software can.  I am looking to write something that can protect
EVERYONE, not just those people that can afford to buy some dedicated
hardware.  

Would PGP be so widespread today if it required a hardware coprocessor?

I like the whole Unix idea for PC's in general, and Linux in particular,
but the fact remains that the people who need security the most (the
average schmuck out there in the business world or the kid running a BBS)
are most likely to be using a PC DOS-based system, and I am writing for them.
