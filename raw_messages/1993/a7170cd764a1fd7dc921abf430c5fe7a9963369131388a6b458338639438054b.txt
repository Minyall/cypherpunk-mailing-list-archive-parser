THUS SPAKE Karl Lui Barrus <klbarrus@owlnet.rice.edu>:
# I forgot to mention I will take suggestions for what to place at the
# gopher site - for example, what 10 or so Clipper articles from the
# archives at soda.berkeley.edu MUST be available?  I haven't read them
# all and won't have the time for the forseeable future to do so.

My archives of SURFPUNK are archived at "http://www.acns.nwu.edu/surfpunk/"
via WWW (or XMosaic).  In the past I've appropriated a lot of
cypherpunk emails.  You might look through there for ideas.
 
# Pointers and suggestions to other docs and files are welcome.  Should
# I put stuff like appropriate rfc's and documentation (pgp and ripem,
# etc.) or not?  All of this is subject to disk space and it may be I'll
# give preference to shorter items.

I wonder if these are not already gophered somewhere.  Then you can
merely hyperlink to them.  Perhaps Mark could run a gopher with his
latest RIPEM docs for you, and others could do the same for their wares.

(Just for the halibut I tried "gopher gopher.uu.net" and
"gopher ftp.uu.net" but no dice.  If you were using WWW instead
of gopher, you could link "ftp://ftp.uu.net/inet/rfc/rfc1321".)

There are probably other gopherdatahavens (and WWW webs) with
cryptostuff that you could link to, en masse, in an "other gophers" section.

BTW, I took a look, Karl, and I think your gopher is off to a good start.
