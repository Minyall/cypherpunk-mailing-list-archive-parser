You mention that you feel there is a conflict of interest if you
were to charge money to sign keys.

Actually, by charging money, I think you would greatly enhance
the weight that people gave to your certification, and by leading
out with a fee/service arrangement, you would be able to avoid
the kind of overload that, say, Julf has run into with penet.

If you were to get enough business, you could then just farm the
whole thing out to a local notary/clerk type who would probably
have more experience with identity documents, the work of other
notaries, etc. 

Another thought: offer various levels of certification, based
on the level of documentation. E.g., one level for xeroxes of
id documents (you may just want to rule this out), another level 
for notarized copy of driver's licence, another for notarized
copy of d.l. and birth certificate, etc. etc.
