The Department of Defence in Norway have given permission to 
develop a new crypto-chip to use in all public and confidential data, 
which has been collected about persons and groups.

The algorithm is secret.

The chip has been compared with the American Clipper-project. 

The Department of Defense will be administering the keys, and the user 
will have no choice whether they want to use the chip or not.

They are even trying to enforced the health system to use this chip.

Last week  Hans Olav Oestgaard (head of the Norwegian secret 
service) said he wanted a law which enforce companies and single 
persons to encrypt all information such that the secret service can 
access the information in a simple way.
