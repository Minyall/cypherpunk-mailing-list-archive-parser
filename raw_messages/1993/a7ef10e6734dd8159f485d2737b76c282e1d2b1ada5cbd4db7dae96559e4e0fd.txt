On most UNIX systems, nothing prevents an ordinary user (one without the
root password) from writing his/her own program for sending mail to a remote
site with SMTP/TCP/IP; there's no requirement to go through the normal
sendmail queue. Incoming mail is a different story, but at least you can
keep the outgoing half of your traffic from being logged.
