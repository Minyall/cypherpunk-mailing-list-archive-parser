Robert J. Woodhead quoted Nate who wrote, in part:

    Imagine if all your money . . . was tied up in anonymous
    accounts and that all your property was owned by digital
    pseudonyms (from whom you rented the property).

To which Robert responded:

    . . . Do not be so quick to assume that these wonderful
    and interesting techniques we discuss will solve
    long-standing problems. . . .

No assumption necessary, Robert.  Non-digital variations of these
techniques have been used successfully for generations.  The rich
and politically savvy have always seen to it that exposure to
litigation and the burden of taxes fell only on the middle class.
Computers, the nets and crypto technology just make it easier for
the rest of us to get in on the same deal.  Once critical mass is
reached, governments can't survive.  The end, not with a bang,
but a whimper.

As for all the other nasty things governments can do to you:
Remember, they have to see you as a threat or a juicy victim
before they can focus in on you.  If you use traditional and
electronic privacy techniques, there is very little likelihood
that you will come to their attention.
