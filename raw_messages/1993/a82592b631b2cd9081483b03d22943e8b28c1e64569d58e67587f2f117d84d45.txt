Chilling thought:  strnlght@netcom.com

A subscriber to Washington-based Digital Express recently asked on  
the digex.general group that the cypherpunks list be gatewayed to a  
newsgroup there, too.  It hasn't shown up there, and I hope it  
doesn't.  Mailing lists just "feel" a little more private, and their  
central administration makes possible some control over abusers.

Has anyone sent mail to postmaster or news@netcom to ask them what  
they're doing?  I'd feel a little funny doing so myself, since I'm  
not a subscriber.  I have asked Digex not to gateway the list,  
though.

Joe
