Note: I doubt that they will have to "bring in" CPU designers.
Back when I was an EE undergrad in Massachusetts, I had a part-time
job at a small outfit that did custom VLSI design work, the guy who
ran the mass. office was the best VLSI designer that I had ever seen,
he eventually became the chief enginneer on a couple of major CPU
projects for a very large well know computer company (not IBM) headquarted
in eastern massaachusetts.  He was also the mentor to some of the people
who made RISC work at berkeley.  He learned his trade at the NSA.  He told me
so himself.
