	Hello All, does anyone know much about the this program?
I would like to be able to pick the passwords out of the database file.
	In this program (Q&A) the database can be set up so that users have limeted access to different areas of the files. I just got the code and doc files
for WP hack, and they were great. I am still going thur the code. 
	Well thanks
