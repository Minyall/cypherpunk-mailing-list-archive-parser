   There is only one realistic and moral solution to threats of
   violence.  Punish the perpetrators, not the messenger.  Even in
   today's world, crimes are rarely solved by wiretaps, forensic
   science or any of that.  Perps gets fingered by someone they
   know; perps confess; perps screw up and accidentally give
   themselves away; or the intended victim blows the perp's head off
   during an attempt to carry out the threat.  Again, punish the
   perpetrators, not the messengers.

I agree 1000%!!!!  But in order to punish the perpetrators, it is first
necessary to *identify* the perpetrators......
