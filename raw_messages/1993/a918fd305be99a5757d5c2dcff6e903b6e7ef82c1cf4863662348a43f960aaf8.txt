You have to accept that the tools for the one are the same as the
tools for the other. Its reasonable to not want to emphasize both, but
its unreasonable to assume that the enemy doesn't already know that
both are done with the same algorithms. If this worries you, come up
with your arguments now -- you will need them later.
