I recently heard an even better hypothetical that illustrates the
issues raised by encryption:


Suppose the only two navajo speakers left in the world were talking on the
phone to plot the overthrow of the United States.  If the FBI
could not obtain a translator, would that mean the plotters could be
compelled to hold their phone conversations in English?
