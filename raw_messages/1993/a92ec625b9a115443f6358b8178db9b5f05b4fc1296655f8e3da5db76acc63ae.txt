	>>> So I assume the cats must have somekind of bank accounts

[ maybe you're kidding? ]

The way those old coots leave their money to their cat is to set up a
trust with an executor (human) who pays the bills incured by the cat.
The cat never actually receives money, just services that are paid for
by the executor.

This is silly.  You must (under US Banking Regulations) provide a SSN
to open any kind of account.  This includes (but is not limited to)
non-interest bearing accounts.  Any bank that would open you an account
without proof of who you are is asking for a lot of trouble.
