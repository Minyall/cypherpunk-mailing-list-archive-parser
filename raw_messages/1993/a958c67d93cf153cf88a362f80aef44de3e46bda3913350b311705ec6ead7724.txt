data is most usually stored in a way that makes sense on the underlying
hardware, ie 24 bit palette.  Why 24? because it is 3 bytes per pixel,
one byte for R,G and B.  R G and B arent even weighted the same perceptually!
Why should they have the same amount of bits? Because it makes sense on
the machine!

Not everyone is trying to squeeze every last "bit" of performance,
take for example crystal clear fone lines over fiber optic connections
with extra noise added in to sooth the listener.

I'm not familiar with oversampling in CD players but where I am familiar
with anti-aliasing is in cases where it is easier to do anti-aliasing
filtering digitally than it is to do it with analog circuitry.  Maybe
you can tell me why there are 64 times oversampling playres.

The compression in these mini-discs is more of a coding scheme than
a compression I believe.  It eliminates elements in the sound that
are perceptually unimportant to the listener.
