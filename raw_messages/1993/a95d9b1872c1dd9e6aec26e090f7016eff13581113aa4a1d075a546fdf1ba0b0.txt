I have made a mockup of what it 'should' (note my quotations) look like.
I'd appreciate it if some of you would take the time to ftp the .eps and
dump it to the nearest postscript printer. Let me know what you think
about the text and the font sizes, also what you think about the layout.

Does anyone want to pursue this?

Let me know, I think they might be pretty nice looking (and a way to get
our name (& cause) known).
