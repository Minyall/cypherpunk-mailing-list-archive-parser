Then maybe a list for warez topics should be formed.  I find alot
of things on the cypherpunks list that is off-topic to be interesting.
The list is however for the discussion of cryptography and privacy.
The only thing that all people on this list have in common is their
interest in crypto and privacy, and the list should stick to those
points.  Other topics that are interesting should be taken to
private email or put on the appropriate lists (barring of course
the occasional slip or wandering of the topic).
