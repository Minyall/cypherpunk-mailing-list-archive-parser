If it's reasonably democratic, sure. But L.D. could simply re-appear as
another entity, which means all new additions to the list would have to
be 'investigated'. I don't like this idea.

The best idea to shut L.D. up is to just ignore him and his rants. Don't
reply to them, and don't talk about him. IMHO witch-hunts are low on the
list of credible actions one can take.

Matthew.

ps: I find the arguments interesting, mostly because a lot is gained by
watching how people (entities ?) argue, techniques used and so on, though
this is hardly within the cypherpunk scope of activity.
