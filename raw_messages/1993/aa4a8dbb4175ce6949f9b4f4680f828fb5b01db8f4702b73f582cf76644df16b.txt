I just wish everyone on this list would either GROW UP or SHUT UP.  Take
your little flame wars and "my sysadmin is bigger than your sysadmin"
childish tantrums and threats and promises and anything else that doesn't
directly relate to what these lists were formed to discuss and take it to
alt.flame, huh?  What an ungodly waste of time and bandwidth...
