I heard you were asking about online versions of Levy's WIRED article. I'm
the editor of WIRED. It's available in an e-text version in the WIRED
folder on American Online, but not elsewhere at the moment. In a few months
WIREDs' gopher site will be up.

My own article in WER is not yet ready for ftp world. I'm finishing a book
of which that is one chapter, and I need to focus on that before geting
stuff up on the net.
