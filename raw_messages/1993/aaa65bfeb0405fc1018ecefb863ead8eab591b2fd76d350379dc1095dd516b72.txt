The human genome fits nicely in 1GB. Mere Gigabit networks could allow
you to send your whole genome in seconds -- and fiber can do many
orders of magnitude better than that.

A complete MRI scan can be sent on a gigabit network in mere moments,
too, and again, fiber can do far better than that.

If you can send a thousand video signals down your fiber at once,
sending complete plans for a factory to build Fords, and the complete
plans for the cars, will likely take a wink of an eye.
