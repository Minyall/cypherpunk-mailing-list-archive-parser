Some very good points.

Eric reports that there are more than 550 subscribers. No doubt many
will drop off, for a variety of reasons, but the number seems to be
consistently edging higher.

We can think of conflicting goals for the membership:

* as many people as possible, to help spread the word, to get local
groups formed, etc.

* more selective, more elitist.

Which is preferable? At what point does a group like ours get so
extended, so large, that all sense of community is lost and we're just
each doing our own thing?

Hard questions to answer, so we'll probably just continue on as we
are.
