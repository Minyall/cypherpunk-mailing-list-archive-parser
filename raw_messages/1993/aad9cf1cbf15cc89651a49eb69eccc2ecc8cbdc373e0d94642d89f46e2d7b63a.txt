     I've been thinking lately.  (No, it didn't hurt.)  Does privacy have in
inherent value, or are "we" simply concerned with what others can do with
sensitive information about ourselves?
 
     What raised the question was that I was thinking about all of the ways in
which information was being gathered about me and my new wife.  I asked myself,
"How far would I go to erase my name from ever database in existence?" and, "So
what if the government knows how much money I make, it's not that much! ;^)" 
Comments?
 
     Also, I need to investigate my options for putting my own machine on the
internet.  I may be loosing my account when I (finally) graduate.  Any pointers
will be appreciated.
