I disagree with your conclusions and believe, that your high
esteem of her is rather subjective.  But this is way off the
topic of this list. Now:

Don't you just love that "must get approval"... Fine, but what if
that agent just happens to have a key or two left over from
previous tap? And another one is willing to trade him
the key he wants now, for one of those other ones?
How on Earth is this going to be detected?

Once the key (Unit Key) is released -  there's no force in the
Universe to make it un-released again! From now on, everything
encrypted with this chip is essentially clear -  AND THIS WILL
ENDANGER EVERYBODY TALKING TO THIS CHIP, no matter whether YOU
have YOUR key "released" or not...

Besides, isn't the described "authorized" tapping procedure
the same good old one in use today?   How come it doesn't
stop illegal wiretaps? [I guess, people break laws?! :-]
