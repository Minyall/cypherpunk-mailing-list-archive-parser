I have heard that tapping high speed modems can be a little tricky
because of the adaptive filtering done.  The modems both have
adaptive filters that adjust to the line as they see it.  If you
are tapping at some other point the filtering will not be optimimal
for your case.  I believe these filters take care of smearing and
echos and things of that nature.

Maybe someone in the know can elaborate and clear up all the
bad data I probably just spewed :)
