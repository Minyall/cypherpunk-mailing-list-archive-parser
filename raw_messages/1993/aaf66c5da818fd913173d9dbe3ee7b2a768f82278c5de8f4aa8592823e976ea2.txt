There's a Subject Line to Grab You

For you Fox TV fans Inside Edition on Tuesday 16 November apparently 
features "International (Danish) Kiddieporn Downloaded Over the Nets -- 
and the Government is Powerless to Stop It."

Happy viewing.

Sorry I haven't posted much lately.  When one agrees to talk at a 
conference, one actually has to *write* the talk not to mention clear the 
decks for the trip.  Hope to see some of you at The First European 
Conference on Computers, Freedom and Privacy next Saturday in London.
