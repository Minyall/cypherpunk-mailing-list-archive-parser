Zachary, Steve and I went to each Chinese food tonight, and clearly
the fortune cookie daemon was up to no good: 

Steve got Zachary's fortune:

   "Your winsome smile will be your sure protection" 

Zachary got my fortune, 

   "You will go many places" 

and I got Larry Detweiler's

   "Don't let doubt and suspicion bar your progress."

Oh, and Larry, your lucky lottery numbers are 1-15-18-39-47-50
