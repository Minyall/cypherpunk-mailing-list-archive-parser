At the first bay c-punks meeting I attended, someone mentioned a variation
on huffman encoding that used your key to initialize the compression tables.
(This was a while ago, so I probably garbled that description...)

Anyway, could the person who mentioned this scheme please mail or post a 
pointer to code or references?

	Thanks,
