Excuse me if I am misunderstanding the "obscure newsgroup" concept, but
is not the "Request-Remailing-To:" feature of cypherpunks remailers
unable to post to newsgroups, but only to individual or mailing list
addresses?  I have been told that only Penet's remailer could remail
directly to newsgroups, obscure or otherwise.

Thanks for any clarification.
