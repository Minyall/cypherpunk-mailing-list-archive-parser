Actually, I still do not think he knows the answer.

However, the second part of the question is more relevant.  No, the
bank, my associates, or the government does not have the right to know
who I am simply because I exist and do business with them.  Those
entities should only know what I tell them, nothing more.  The current
trend towards Big Brotherism in the *real* world is why I'm a
cypherpunk.  I wish to control my own information, not some faceless
bank, credit beaurau, or other possibly wrong information provider.
