Yup. All those tens of thousands of people (including unpaid summer
interns) working in the Ad business have all been sworn to
secrecy. Yeah, thats the ticket. And none of them ever talked, because
ad people are like the mafia, and will kill each other for talking,
which is why all those ad men end up floating in the East River all
the time. Yeah, thats the ticket.

By the way, I've got some swampland in Florida to sell you. Along with
some subscriptions to some Lyndon Larouche publications that will give
you incontravertable proof that the Queen of England is the worlds
biggest drug trafficer.
