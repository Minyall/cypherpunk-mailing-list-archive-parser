Jim McCoy says:

> The NSA is not chartered for domestic surveillance work.

This statement keeps showing up. If there is any support for it I'd like 
to hear it.

We know it was not true as far back as twenty years ago, from July 1, 
1969 to October 1973.  For details on the MINARET Charter see page 150 of 
"The National Security Agency and Fourth Amendment Rights", and pages 323 
and 324 of "The Puzzle Palace".

NSA has a long history of ignoring whether they are chartered for an 
activity, of course.
