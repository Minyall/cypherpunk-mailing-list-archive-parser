             FROM THE VIRTUAL DESK OF SANDY SANDFORT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Following Harry Shapiro's lead, I did some research on Mykotronx
by calling up the California Franchise Tax Board.

The bureaurats told me Mykotronx is a California corporation
(#1403668) in good standing.  Incorporated in April of '87, its
address is 357 Van Ness Way; Torrence, CA.  They could not tell
me if Mykotronx were publicly traded.  Its filings with the State
are not available for public inspection.
