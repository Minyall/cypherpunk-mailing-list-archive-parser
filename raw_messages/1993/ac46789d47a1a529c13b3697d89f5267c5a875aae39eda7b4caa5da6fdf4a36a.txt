Of all the lists I'm subscribed to, this is the only one that I read
*every* article in.  Even the "noise" articles.  Humans being what
they are, the noise is needed to help decide the direction of the
group.  Besides, for those of us who are just starting on our journey
through crypto-underworld need the noise to help familiarize
ourselves with how crypto works.  I've learned more from the informal
ramblings than I've gathered out of all the formal and/or mathematical
postings to date.

I don't mind tech... but let's not do away with the noise either.
Thanks.

One persons opinion.
