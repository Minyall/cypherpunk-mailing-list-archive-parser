The NSA does mask inspection for it's own purposes.  They require
source code for products they buy under certain conditions too.

The CIA has been accused of stealing a company's source code and
reselling said software modified with a trojan horse to specific targets
outside the U.S.  I don't remember the name of the company, but read about 
the lawsuit pending against the government.  Anyone have more details?
This is nice evidence for people who think the spooks are fully accountable.
