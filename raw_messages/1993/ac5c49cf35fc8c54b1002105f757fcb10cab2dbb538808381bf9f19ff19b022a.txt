Save a few exceptions (like France), I believe it is legal to transmit
encrypted data across country borders.  The question comes in as to
how to define "cryptographic material", as used in the ITAR (for the
US) or similar statutes for other places.

Basically, I doubt that anyone will do anything other than raise an
eyebrow if you send encrypted data out of the country.
