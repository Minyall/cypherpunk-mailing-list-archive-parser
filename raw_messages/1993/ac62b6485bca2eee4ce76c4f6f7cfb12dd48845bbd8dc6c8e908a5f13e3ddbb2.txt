Subject: Direct E-Mail: J.S. McBride & Co.

According to the Internet Business Report 1.3 (page 4), J.S. McBride and
Company are selling access to a database of Internet addresses, including
demographic information.  They claim over one million entries.  The net
address is jim_mcbride@netmail.com, and I am sure they would enjoy hearing
from anybody who would like to be removed from the list.
