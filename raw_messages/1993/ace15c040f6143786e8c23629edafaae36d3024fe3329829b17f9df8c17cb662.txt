  Hi,

  I'm fairly new here and not sure if this topic has come up before, but
I'll offer it anyway:

 In using encrypted communications, how does one avoid the problem of
calling attention to the message BECAUSE it is encrypted? "If he went to
the trouble of coding it, there MUST be something in there!!" Granted that
if everyone begins encrypting, this problem will vanish... are there
practical solutions in the meantime? (eg, Codes that look like plaintext?)
