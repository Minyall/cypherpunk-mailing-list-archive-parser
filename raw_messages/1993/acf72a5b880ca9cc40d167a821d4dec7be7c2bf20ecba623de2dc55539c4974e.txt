I agree with ssandfort that a total ban on advertising on the list is a
not-good thing.  Commercial speech is still speech, and censorship is still
censorship.

Here's a possible win-win solution: on any commercial message, the subject
header should say "advertising included" or some obvious words or
abbreviations to that effect.  This way, those who wish to avoid such
messages can do so painlessly, those who wish to read them can do that, and
one more potential for restriction is eliminated.
