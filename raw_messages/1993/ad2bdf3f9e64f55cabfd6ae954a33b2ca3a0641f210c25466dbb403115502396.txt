Well, after two days or so of missed mail and a lot of headache and missed
sleep, I think I've got this working ok. The remailer address is 
<cdodhner@indirect.com>, and so far it is a vanilla remailer, nothing 
special at all. I have not tested it with encrypted messages yet, the public
key, however, is below. Consider the remailer in 'test mode' for the next
few days, and if all goes well I'll turn off the logging etc. by the 25th.
Until then the remailer should be considered unsecured and all messages are 
subject to being inadvertantly read by myself in the process of debugging.
If it works as well as it looks like it works, at that point I will turn
off all logging, debugging, and archiveing, and generaly keep my nose out
of it.
Send any questions to me at cdodhner@indirect.com.

Happy Hunting, -Chris
