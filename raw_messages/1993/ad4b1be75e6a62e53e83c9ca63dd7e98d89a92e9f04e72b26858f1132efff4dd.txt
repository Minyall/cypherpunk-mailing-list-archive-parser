Ok, I just spoke with Dave somebody at viacrypt, and he told me that the
ViaCrypt PGP would be based on PGP 2.3a, and the only code changed would
be the lines implementing rsa itself. He told me it would be backwards
compatable with all past versions of PGP and that as improvements were
made to ViaCrypt PGP, the same improvements would be made to the freeware
version. I was thinking that if a bunch of us cypherpunks wanted copys we
could order them as a group and get a volume discount. I've asked to have
the price scheduals sent to me. If anybody has any questions for ViaCrypt,
you could refer them through me if you like, as thier offices are just 16
miles or so from my house.

Happy Hunting, -Chris
