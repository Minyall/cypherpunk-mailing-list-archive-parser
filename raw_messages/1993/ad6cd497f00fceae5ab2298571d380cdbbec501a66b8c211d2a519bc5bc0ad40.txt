True or False, the EFF accepted money from AT&T in return for the EFF's
support on various issues/bills before congress wherein AT&T came out on
top in it's effort to commercialize parts of the Internet for it's own
monetary gain?  I've that's not bribery and corruption of what otherwise
is supposed to be a non-profit organization, then I don't know what is.
