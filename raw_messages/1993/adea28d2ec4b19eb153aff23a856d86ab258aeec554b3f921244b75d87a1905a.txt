RSA might try to cash such a check, but if their bank is smart they
won't accept it.  A check is not negotiable if it contains a
condition.  Negotiable means it can be bought or sold.  If the check
is not negotiable then it can't properly be processed by the check
clearing house, since that would require a negotiation.  Only if the
check were drawn on RSADSI's bank would such a check be depositable,
since then your order to pay is being made to the same entity which is
receiving the check.

Return them, I would suppose.
