You can look in the contrib directory of PGP 2.{2,3}.. There are a
number of elisp implementations.. And there is also rat-pgp.el, or
something like that, which I know is available via anonymous ftp but I
don't know what machine its on...  It should be in 2.4, hopefully.

I have not tested any of these implementations.
