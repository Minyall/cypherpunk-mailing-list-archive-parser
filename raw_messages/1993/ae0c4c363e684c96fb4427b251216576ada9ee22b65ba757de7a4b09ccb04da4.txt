As an individual, who would he be talking to via Clipper? His victims? Not
bloody likely. High-tech protection doesn't fall under the MO of this kind
of killer.

They find these all the time through other mechanisms.

Legalize drugs and prostitution and the Mafia will dry up and blow away.
Besides, these guys have enough money to have purchased and used private
scrambling gear anyway; the fact that they haven't (leading to their
capture) leads one to believe they wouldn't use Clipper anyway. If the
current leadership is smarter, they'll be smart enough to use non-Clipper
gear anyway, eliminating the advantage Clipper gives to the Justice Dept.

I gotta admit that I kinda like this. I should point out, though, that it
ought to be applied regardless of the wiretapping technology applied; that
is, this mechanism should be used today for all court-authorized wiretaps.
