I thought this was already true, at least in theory. It's known as the
"fruit of the poisoned tree" doctrine. Evidence gathered as a consequence
of illegally gathered evidence is in itself inadmissable. Of course,
this is probably what has been weakened the most by the Reagan/Bush
Supreme Court.

*This* is the fundamental problem. There are many possible ways that
illegal wiretaps can further the collection of other evidence, without
the existence of the illegal wiretap ever having to be revealed.
