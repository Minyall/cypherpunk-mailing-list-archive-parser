I tried pinging all the remailers on the latest copy I have of
Karl's remailer list (except extropia, which I know only accepts
encrypted messages).  I sent to each:

::
Request-Remailing-To: hfinney@shell.portal.com

then a short test message.

I only heard back from 8 of them, to wit:

I did not hear back from the following remailers.  Perhaps their operators
could check on them, or notify Karl if they are no longer operating.

 1: hh@pmantis.berkeley.edu 
 2: hh@cicada.berkeley.edu 
 6: remail@tamaix.tamu.edu
 7: ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu 
 9: remailer@rebma.mn.org 
14: 00x@uclink.berkeley.edu
