Yes, that is true, but it still must be a primitive root w.r.t p. 
Unfortunately I am not well versed enough to explain the mathematical
reasoning behind this, but in the texts I have read, they all stated
this fact.

In an implementation of D-H I did for a project once, I ensured that
these conditions were met. Some probablistic analysis showed that approx
37-38% of numbers < p are primitive roots (done by sampling primes and
testing all n < p to see if n was primitive root), so finding a primitive
root was trivial.
