Some of you may have worried that the list was down to due government
interference yesterday.  The truth is much more prosaic.

toad.com, where the mailing list resides, is on the commercial side of
the Appropriate use barrier.  In order to send to NSFNET hosts, all
the traffic must pass through uunet.  The default mail router that
toad uses, relay2.uu.net, was munged for mail yesterday.  All the
queue has been flushed out at this point.

Thanks to Hugh Daniel and John Gilmore for figuring this out.

Eric
