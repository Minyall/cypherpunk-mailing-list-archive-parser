Amen. (meaning a lot coming from an agnostic!)

I think that what does not belong on this list is people bickering,
essentially, about what cypherpunks are supposed to be doing.
If you don't like a particular article, don't read it.  Look at the 
subject, and decide.  I often don't read all the mail thoroughly,
but I don't tell everyone to stop posting so much ;-)

I think that it is important to remember that one of the basic
ideals of the cypherpunk movement is the protection of FREEDOM.
Freedom to not worry about if a posting in CP-Politically correct
not.  It's almost (but not quite) censorship.

Let everyone do what they feel is important.  Publicity is important,
talking to journalists is important, and everything we do here and 
outside of the net is important.
