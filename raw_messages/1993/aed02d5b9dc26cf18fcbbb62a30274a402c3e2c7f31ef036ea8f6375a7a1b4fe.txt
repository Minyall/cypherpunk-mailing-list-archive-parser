That is why we try to make them as cheaply as possible. Then if they
are hard to get hold of (hidden/camouflaged/stuck up cliffs and flagpoles)
the cost to retrieve them will be prohibitively high.

Errrrr. Hadn't thought of that. Placement will be a major factor, I
beleieve.

Depends how you place them. If you put them _on top_ of things, you'd need 
a helicopter to shoot 'em.

This is true.
But if we make the things in thick boxes (well, slightly bullet-proof,
anyway), and put them in places where theyare hard to shoot at, then we 
should be right. We would only need a few each suburb.
