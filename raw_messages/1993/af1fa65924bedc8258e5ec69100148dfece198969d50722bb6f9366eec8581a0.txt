Mike Godwin says:
[Lots of stuff that add up to "Gee, what fifth amendment"]

I wonder when the last remaining clause of the Bill of Rights will be
declared to be meaningless tripe. FDR destroyed the 9th and 10th
amendments with his threats of court packing. PC is destroying the 1st
amendment. The fourth and fifth amendments are nearly gone thanks to
things like the war on drugs. Lots of people have been claiming the
second amendment doesn't mean what it says, and the supreme court has
refused to take a case since the Miller case in the 1930s. The court
recently held that you can execute a person even if there is evidence
that he's innocent without giving the evidence a hearing provided he's
technically exhausted his right to appeal. It seems like its only a
matter of time before other than stopping the government from
quartering soldiers in your home except in time of war, there will be
nothing more the courts will prevent.

Fun, ain't it?
