Hiya Folks,
	I'm gonna assume that no one has the PGP docs in postscript or rtf
format because no one has responded to my post except a couple other ppl
looking for the same thing.  So...
	I have converted the ascii txt files to WfW2.0 docs.  I'll be
uploading (to my account) a uuencoded file of them for windows ppl, and
I'll do my best have a couple portable formats as well. (RTF, and probably PS)
	To folks who asked for copies: Gimme a couple days and I'll mail
them out to you.


	Later
		FRC
