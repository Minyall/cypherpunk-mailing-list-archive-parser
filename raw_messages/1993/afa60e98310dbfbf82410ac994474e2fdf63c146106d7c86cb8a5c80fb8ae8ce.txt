	   A better course of action might be to remove the RSA engine from
	PGP and distribute the source code, and a binary for free, but require
	users to pay $30-50 to RSA to get the source code and binary for the
	RSA engine.

Thats what people have *always wanted* to do.  RSA won't let them.  That's
why any talk of a newer friendlier Bizdos is bullshit.
