I have been looking for information or a FAQ for setting up a mailing
list of my own..

I would like to compose a list that used PGP encryption by default
supported a key-server swap like enviorment with online extraction
of specific keys, as the server lists are huge and PGP's extract and 
sort routines often do not work on them and when they do take quit long..

information and direction needed, recommended, and thnaked for..
