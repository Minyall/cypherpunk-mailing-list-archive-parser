Tim,

That was very manipulative, and did not achieve much. 


It has also very little to do with the subject of this mailing list.  
If anything, you discouraged at least one person I know who became  
genuinely interested in encryption and PGP as a result of your post.

If you had posted an actual David Hamilton photo, even encrypted, you  
would have put yourself forward, perhaps even bravely, as a test  
case. You then would really have had a point to argue, having taken a  
stand. 


As it turns out, you hid behind a pretty lame scheme, the only object  
of which seems to have been to make a fool out of as many people as  
possible. This is not how you accomplish constructive change, Tim.  
People resent being made to feel stupid, and they certainly will  
_not_ listen to what you have to say if you are belittling them. 


I happen to agree with those points you deigned to make in a  
straightforward manner. But you hid them so well behind trickery that  
they will go unnoticed. Learn to deal with people, and you'll see  
they are willing to listen to reasonable arguments.

If your parents didn't give you enough attention as a child, don't  
take it out on the world by trying to get some here... Learn to work  
_with_ people, not _against_ people, lest within ten years you'll be  
walking into office buildings with automatic weapons strapped to your  
body and shooting lawyers... ;)

Michael
