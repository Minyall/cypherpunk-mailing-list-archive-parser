You mean "their past track record that I don't agree with."  Sure, 
many excesses have been committed in the name of the "Christian Right"
(whatever that is ... I'm supposedly a part of it and I've never seen
a coherent definition of what it is).  But the "Agnostic Left" has
probably committed a few excesses in its day, too.  

Frankly, a coalition with people from a wide variety of political backgrounds
can only help to make the anti-Clipper cause seem more respectible.  
Otherwise, the anti-Clipper folks might end up sounding like just another
liberal protest group, and be treated just like any other lobbying group.

Not really.  From my experience, the "Christian Right" is composed of
conservative Christians -- both Protestant and Catholic.  It's only in
certain parts of the country where conservative Protestants and
Catholics are unfriendly ...
