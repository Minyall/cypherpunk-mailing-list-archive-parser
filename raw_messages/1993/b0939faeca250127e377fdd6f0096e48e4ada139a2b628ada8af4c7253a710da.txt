The Thursday Oct 7 San Jose Mercury News lead editorial contains a note
acknowledging a sane point of view about cryptographic exports.

(It's titled "Unshackled Tech -- Looser export rules will boost Silicon
Valley Sales", and it discusses Clinton's decision last week to boost
the speed limit for exportable computers.)

The *good* part, though, is:

  "  * Congress should update the Export Administration Act.
     A 1990 version would have lifted export controls on
  telecommunications and software with encryption codes, which give
  the software users a better way to keep data secret. President Bush
  vetoed it. His administration wanted to deprive the Chinese and
  Russians of the latest, hard-to-bug telecommunications equipment, and
  the latest encrypted software.
     Well, the Chinese already know how to make the new
  telecommunications equipment. The encryption software is in the
  hands of anyone who can find a pirated copy."

Awareness is beginning to grow out there.
