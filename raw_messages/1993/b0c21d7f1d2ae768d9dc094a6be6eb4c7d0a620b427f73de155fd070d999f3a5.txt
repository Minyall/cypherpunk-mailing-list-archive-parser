Well, I decided to comment out the timestamping (what a short lived
feature! :-)  I'm starting to work on a caching remailer, and the
timestamping info could be used to map input and output mailing pairs 
- especially since I was going to change the stamps to read
"X-Time-In:" and "X-Time-Out:".  That would defeat the entire purpose
of caching...
