	Anybody know about the voice capabilities of the ZyXel class modems?
	I own a ZyXel 1496E which can digitize voice and also transmit
	voice data that has been digitized.  It would be easy to
	first encript this stream before sending it out.

	The 1496E+ also support CELP (or is it (CLEP?) but that one
	cost about $400.  (The 1496E is around $300) It also is a 14.4 K
	baud modem and does FAX.
