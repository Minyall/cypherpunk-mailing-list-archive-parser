An online definition (telnet chem.ucsd.edu, login webster)
supports Postman, although it only goes back to Arabic:

Word: cipher
[ME, fr. MF cifre, fr. ML cifra, fr. Ar s.ifr empty, cipher, zero]
(14c)
1a: ZERO 1a
1b: one that has no weight, worth, or influence: NONENTITY
2a: a method of transforming a text in order to conceal its meaning --
    compare CODE 3b
2b: a message in code
3: ARABIC NUMERAL
4: a combination of symbolic letters; esp: the interwoven initials of a name

                [verb defs -- "to cipher" -- deleted]

I'll refrain from smartass comments about 1b as it relates to all of us...:-)
