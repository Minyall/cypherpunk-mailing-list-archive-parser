Is there some reason that we shouldn't pick a different
public key encryption algorithm than RSA to use as a
freely-available standard?  The PGP docs imply that "almost"
all practical such schemes are patented, implying that
some are not.

The legitimacy problems of PGP are a major roadblock to
widespread use of encryption, IMO.  Let's get something
in the public domain!
