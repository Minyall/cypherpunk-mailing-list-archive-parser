You should be able to do it. But, you will first have to get permission
from RSADSI to access RSAREF in ways other than by the published interface. 
I trust they'll grant it, given what you say above.

Also, be sure to get the RSAREF version included with RIPEM (wait for
version 1.07 if you can). It has several significant performance 
enhancements (generic and some platform specific asm versions of
time critical code).

You won't be able to export this 'legal' version of PGP. Tracking
and updating to new PGP releases will be a pain as much of
the development is done outside of North America.
