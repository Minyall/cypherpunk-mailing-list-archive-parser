Here is my vote for a tee shirt below.  People are always asking my what
"/nev/dull" means on one of my T shirts, so I'd like it to be
understandable to more people (and my C++ tee shirt with 
Bjarne Stroustrup on the front with a screw going through his head
is understood by almost *no one*...)

On the front:

>- Big Brother is watching YOU (picture of those pointing Uncle Sam
>pictures, dressed like a spy)


On the back:

Random dot stereogram with the combined image that says "Cypherpunk"
or "Crypto" and under it, a plain text message: 
	"Eternal Vigilance for your Privacy".
