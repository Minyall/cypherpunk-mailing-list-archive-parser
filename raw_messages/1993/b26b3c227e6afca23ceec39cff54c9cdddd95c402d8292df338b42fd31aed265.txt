     I think what he's saying is that a signature that identifies which
*user* on the system as well as the system name does not exist.  I'm sure
there are a couple, but I agree with your point that most BBS's on any mail
network append an identifying "tagline" or signature.  As a matter of fact,
in many nets it is a requirement that your system append a tagline to all
messages.  Incidentally, it is preceded often by "--" on a line by itself.
