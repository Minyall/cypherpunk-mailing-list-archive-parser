I mention this 'cause I am the Technical Contact for fidonet.org.  The
fidonet.org domain is served out of ieee.org, and with some of the
gating that Burt is doing, the fidonet.org domain is not being appended
to the fidonet address and ieeee.org is.  The ieee.org domain is not
something I would guarentee as working all the time or permenate.  You
would have less potenial problems if you used fidonet.org.
