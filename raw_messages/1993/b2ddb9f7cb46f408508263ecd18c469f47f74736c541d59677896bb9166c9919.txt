I believe it is very valuable to have an anonymous
identity that nobody can associate with your
actual one. 

Besides asking embarsassing newbie questions (which I will
become more and more famous for), I am learning a lot about
what it means to build up an anonymous reputation. I have
posted to a few other newsgroups as well, and I am having
dialogues with people through e-mail. I feel as though I
have a real identity.

My actual identity also has reasons for not wanting to
appear on this mailing list. 

I wonder if I am catching some strain of multiple
personality disorder...
