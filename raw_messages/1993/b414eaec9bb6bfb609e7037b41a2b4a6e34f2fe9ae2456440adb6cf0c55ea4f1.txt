The dig output explains what's going on.

In other words, ftp.eff.org is an alias for the official name of
the host.  Quite properly, the inverse map lists the official name
for the host:

	$ dig -x 192.88.144.4

	; <<>> DiG 2.0 <<>> -x 
	;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY , status: NOERROR, id: 6

	4.144.88.192.in-addr.arpa.      86400   PTR     kragar.eff.org.

But by advertising the name ``ftp.eff.org'', instead of ``kragar.eff.org'',
the administrator gains the flexibility to move the archive to some
other machine if necessary/desirable.  That's exactly the right way
to run such a service.
