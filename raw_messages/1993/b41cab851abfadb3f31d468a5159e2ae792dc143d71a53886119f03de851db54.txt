Full text of patents and claims are available (for a fee) from Dialog
Information Systems on-line.  Subscribers can access it in file 654.
If there are particular patents that are important and that we need full
text versions of quickly, I can oblige.  Also extremely useful is the
cross-indexing and forward references, so that you can find all patents,
e.g., which reference a particular patent as prior art.
