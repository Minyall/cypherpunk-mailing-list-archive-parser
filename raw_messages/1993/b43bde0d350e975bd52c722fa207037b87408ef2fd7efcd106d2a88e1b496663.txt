Ok, this is really getting bizarre.  Why is it so hard to accept that
the ECPA---federal law of the land---applies to BBS operators in the
United States?  It may be a pain in the butt, and it may be an insult
to the noble souls who operate FIDOnet nodes out of the goodness of
their hearts, but that's Life In The Big City.

Perhaps some of the confusion stems from ignorance on my (and,
perhaps, other Internet weenies') part about the topology and
operation of FIDOnet.  As I understand it, ECPA applies if private
third party communications are routed through some FIDOnet agent.
Does this ever happen?
