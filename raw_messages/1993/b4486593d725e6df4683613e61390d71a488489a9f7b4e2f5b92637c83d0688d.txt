I think I have a scheme for real off-line payments, that is, payments
that do not require an observer at the time of transaction (although
they would require a couple of on line transactions in advance). They
would require that people conduct transactions in a style that they
are not used to, but would require no trust and would allow full
anonymity of parties.  

Unfortunately, I don't know enough about the mathematics of Chaum's
blinding schemes to know if the scheme I have in mind (which depends
on his scheme) would work. Could someone point me at a reference or
two on Chaum's original work? The mathematics associated with blinding
is, sadly, something that I haven't spent sufficient time on.
