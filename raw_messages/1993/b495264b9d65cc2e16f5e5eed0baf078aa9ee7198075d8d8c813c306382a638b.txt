Oops, forgot to finish the last sentence of my privacy post.  The last
paragraph should read:

Since there is no specific mention of a "right _of_ privacy" in the
Consititution, one must fall back on the implied construction and interpret
Constitutional privacy as defined by other amendments.  What this
construction of the "right _to_ privacy" allows is for appellate courts to
weight enumerated rights as more important than implied rights.  Thus, in
the name of furthering the goals of another amendment (say #6,
speedy/public trial), the courts can limit the implied "right _to_ privacy"
with fewer problems than if two "textual" amendments had come into
conflict.
