This is welcome news, indeed.  I can see why AT&T would be pissed -- if
it gets out that the Clipper/SkipJack/Capstone combo is a major step
towards Big Brotherism, then their whole "You Will" commertial series
will not be accepted as well as I think it has so-far.

Maybe not, but we should not just say "Well, there... we've done it." and
stop pushing all together.

Agreed.
