Re: not discriminating between remailer mail and user mail.

The problem of persons uneducated in remailers not distinguishing
between different kinds of mail is a problem that will scale badly.
It looks like a problem that will have to be solved for any design
which relies on user accounts for remailing.  I have one suggestion,
but I'd like to hear others.

Suggestion--Put a big "Comment:" field in each remailed message which
explains what is going on.  Regular users will get tired of it, no
doubt.  Perhaps it could be called "X-Remailer-Education:"
