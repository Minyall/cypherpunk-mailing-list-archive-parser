Here's some info folks might appreciate (all numbers area code
303, unless otherwise noted):

Lance is the college of engineering subdomain.
Scott Douglas (lance sysadmin) scott@lance.colostate.edu 491-7954
College of Engineering Dean's Office: 491-6603 (Dr. Jorge Aunon)
Vice President, Student Affairs (discipline): 491-5312 (Keith Miser)
ACNS switchboard (Computation center) 491-5133 (Gary Edelen)
ACNS Consulting Desk 491-7276
CSU Information 491-1101
Degree Verification 491-7159

Hold off for a bit on these numbers; it's still not clear who (if anyone) 
is really responsibile for him now. 

I had a very productive talk with Gary Edelen who (like me) is not pleased 
that state funds are going to subsidize someone's highly disruptive, insane, 
quasi-religious rants; he's contacting Scott Douglas, who is apparently the 
administrator of record for the lance subdomain. 

Lawrence Detweiler was awarded a BS in Engineering Science in Spring 
of 1993.

LD's finger: 
------------

Notes:
He is no longer listed with student information or as a staff/faculty 
member, nor is he listed with 303 directory; there is no L. Detweiler 
listed in Fort Collins anymore, or in Denver/Boulder, although there 
is a Jeff Detweiler listed in the 1991 phone book; a call to 498-8278 
got an answering machine, 491-5893 forwards to the Kater Laboratory 
Optical Core.

The 1-5893 number is for the Department of Anatomy, Dennis Giddings 
(staff member). LD apparently worked for the Kater Laboratory as an
hourly student. 

Rene Olson (491-6849) used to be his supervisor, but could not be reached 
for comment.
