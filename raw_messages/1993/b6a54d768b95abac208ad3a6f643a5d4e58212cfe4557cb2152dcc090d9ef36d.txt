To which I fire back:

"Since you consider it OK for Internet to carry pictures of naked men, 
women, children, and animals as well as text (tiny) sex and such kink as 
alt.fan.bill.gates, you have to put up with *our* ideas of the sorts of 
activities that consenting adults can engage in online.  I'm sick and 
tired of this discrimination against commercial intercourse."
