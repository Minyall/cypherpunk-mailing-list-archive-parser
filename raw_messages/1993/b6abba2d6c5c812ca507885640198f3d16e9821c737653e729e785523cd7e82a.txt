Cypherpunks:
      I now have David Colston's [5542837@mcimail.com] source
      code for "CALL SECURITY".  I also have the IBM PC executables.

CALL SECURITY is an implementation of David's QPK (quick public key) algorithm.
If you are on BIX I can E-mail to you with binary attachments,
please specify which files.  I am not sure how to get this to an FTP,
BIX doesn't have FTP posting yet. I know it is done from BIX, help is welcome. 

  So, I will make this software available on my PC this *WEEKEND ONLY*

      The purpose is to S P R E A D this stuff around.  Please
      upload to an FTP, BBS or what-have-you.
