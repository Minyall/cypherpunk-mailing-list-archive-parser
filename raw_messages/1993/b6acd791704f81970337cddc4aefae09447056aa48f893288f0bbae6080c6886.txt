I am among those "generally supportive" of E. Hughes' suggestion that
signed messages be encouraged in some way.  It wouldn't bother me a
bit if that led to a decline in CypherPunks mailing list membership;
with luck, the quality of the list would improve.  Furthermore, class
consciousness is a good thing (?), so let's create classes of CypherPunks
and try generally to elevate consciousness.
