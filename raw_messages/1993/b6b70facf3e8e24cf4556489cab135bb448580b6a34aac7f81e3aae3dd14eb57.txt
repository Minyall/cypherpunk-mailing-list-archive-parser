Fellow cypherpunks:

I have been working on a digital bank, implementing Hal Finney's
simple bank protocol (random account number and random digicash - not
Chaum's more sophisticated system based on RSA encryption, decryption,
blinded messages, etc.)  The enhancement posted by ?? - I can't
remember right now - (having to do with wallets) is not implemented.

I beleive it is ready to enter the next test phase: everyone on the
list may apply for an account.

Send a message of this form to the anonymous remailer I run
(elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu) :

::
command: help

user@host



Be sure to include your real mail address in the user@host line,
because that's where the bank will send back the information.
