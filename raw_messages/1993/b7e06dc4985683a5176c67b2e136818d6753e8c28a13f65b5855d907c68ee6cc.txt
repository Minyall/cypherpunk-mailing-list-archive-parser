Well, part of the time he was heading up MCC, the Austin-based research
consortium.  Someday y'all can buy me a beer and I'll tell you the saga of
my 3.5 years at MCC, about 2.5 of which overlapped with Inman.

But as a leader I'd say his biggest strength was his incredible intelligence
and ability to deal with almost any problem.  He never let *anything* faze
him.  He was a good leader, too, giving MCC just the right profile in the
eyes of the people (corporate CEOs mostly) who were signing our sponsorship
checks.

Biggest weakness: trusting the wrong people.  His "Chief Scientist"
underling was a joke and he let too many of the wrong people do too many of
the wrong things while they worked for him.

The belief that enhanced understanding will necessarily stir a nation to
action is one of mankind's oldest illusions.
