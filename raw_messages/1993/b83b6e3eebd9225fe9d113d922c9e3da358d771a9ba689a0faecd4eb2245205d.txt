I agree 100%. Security packages like PGP are meaningful only when you
have your own personal machine to run it on. Indeed, it would be nice if
PGP could somehow tell when it is being run over a network, and severely
warn the user when he is about to type something secret (like a passphrase).
I don't know of any clean way to do it, though.
