Rather than pointing people to strange publications we've never heard
of written by authors without credentials, might I suggest...

1) The PGP docs themselves are very good and far better as a tutorial
   on cryptography than any of the "PGP tutorials" that have appeared
   in the fringe literature. They are also free.

2) Read a real text on cryptography. It isn't a childrens game. Its a
   real branch of math and computer science, and really bright people
   devote their lives to it. If you wanted to learn about medicine,
   would you pick up a professional medical text, or something written
   in a 'zine by people you hadn't heard of?
