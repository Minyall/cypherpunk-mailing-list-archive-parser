I noticed something about PGP signed plaintext the last time
used that feature to send a message to Cypherpunks.

Apparently PGP takes any line beginning with 5 dashes ("-----")
and adds "- " (dash blank) to it. I guess the purpose for this
is to avoid confusion if the plaintext message should contain
a PGP delimiter like

   -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----

But in my particular case, what I specified in my input plaintext was

   -----END OF MESSAGE BODY-----

(but with no indentation), but what came out was

   - -----END OF MESSAGE BODY-----

Given that PGP is going to make changes like this to signed plaintext,
I suggest there is no longer any reason to object if PGP also removes
trailing blanks from signed plaintext.
