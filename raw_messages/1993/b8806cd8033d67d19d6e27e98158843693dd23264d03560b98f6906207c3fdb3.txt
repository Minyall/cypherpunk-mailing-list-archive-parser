  I think you miss the point of Public Key Crypto.  The idea is that
you CAN publish your public key, to one and all.  Then when you sign a
post with your private  key (and do work hard to keep that key
private!), then anyone can verify that _you_ (in the guies of your
public/private key pair) wrote the message. No one else can sign a
message such that _your_ public key will decrypt the sig in a valid
way, unless you have let your private key leek out.
  This is the whole wonderful idea that make Public Key crypto so
wonderful.  
  You are createing a strong and valued Psudonym, and signing your
messages will only make it stronger!  Then there is no way to really
spoof a message from 'Wonderer', as you will be ('Wonderer'*KEY) and a
solid nym-citizen.
  Make sence?
