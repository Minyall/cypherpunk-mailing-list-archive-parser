Does PGP compress the text before it is encoded?

Does this allow a cracker to search for the compression's signature after every
attempt?

Is there a checksum that a cracker could use to test for success after
every attempt?

Would using UUENCODE on the text and deleting the "begin/end" lines before
encrypting it have a synergistic effect on the difficulty of cracking a secret
key from that particular message?

Is there an easy way to generate keys larger than 1024 bits?
