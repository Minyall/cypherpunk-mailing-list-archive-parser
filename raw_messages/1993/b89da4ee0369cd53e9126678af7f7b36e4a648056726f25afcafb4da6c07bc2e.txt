Ah, but they are, on mac anyways...pop open ResEdit (available from 
ftp.apple.com or in most book stores or development packages), choose 
'get file/folder info' from the file menu, and pick any directory in a 
standard dir/file browser which comes up.  When the info box comes up, 
just click in the 'invisible' box.  When u exit ResEdit, it will ask u if 
u want to save changes.  Click 'yes', and...voila...an invisible 
subdirectory.  Many programs make this interface even easier, too.
