 I can make life much easier for you simply by mentioning the fact
 that you can add the line:
 
     clearsig = on
 
 to your CONFIG.TXT file (Drive:\path\PGP\config.txt). Once you add
 this line (note to dox writers: add it to the next version release,
 especially as a #commented line in the default config), then you
 won't have to worry about adding that pesky argument on the command
 line ever again!
 
 Cheers,
