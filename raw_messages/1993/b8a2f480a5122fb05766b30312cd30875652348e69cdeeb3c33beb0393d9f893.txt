Hmmm...most drivers I've known would be thrilled to get off with just
"embarrassment."  In fact, they'd probably be proud to have it broadcast
to everyone else on the road (except the lawmen, naturally) that they'd
just been clocked at 110 MPH or whatever.  But somehow, I doubt that this
data is used only for embarrassment, don't you?
