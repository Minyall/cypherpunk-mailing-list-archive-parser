For anyone interested, i know of a company that sell (until it's illegal) a 
computer package that enables the user to communicate over normal phone lines
with complete (and i mean it) security.  it runs on a 386 or higher with a 
sounblaster card.  The encryption is up to triple DES encoding with user 
programmed keys (no record kept and no back doors for Big Brother or anyone
else to use).  It would take serious effort by the NSA and all of their 
supercomputers to decode a single transmission (assuming they could come up
with a 'hook', something this program is incapable of transmitting).
