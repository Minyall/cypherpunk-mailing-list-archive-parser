Perhaps the banker can't be anonymous, but the account certainly can
be. Many countries have centuries of experience with this. Hell, the
Austrians have 100% anonymous accounts to this day. Works just fine,
and no trust is involved.

Feel free to check my credentials. I assure you I earn more than
enough money at my job that it wouldn't be worth the FBI's money to
make the bribe big enough -- it would also have to cover the risk to
me that being an anarchist presents vis a vis my job -- someday I
might lose it for having strange political ideas, and salaries like
mine are hard to come by in other professions.

Its entirely possible that there are FBI agents on this list -- I
proceed on that assumption every day. Its also possible that there are
agents provocateur. However, I fully assure you that many of us are
legitimate anarchists of long standing, most of us being of the
capitalist anarchist persuasion.

I'll fully agree that arguing for anarchy with the general public
won't work at the current time -- and I agree that our image is
important. However, at this point the battle is being fought by folks
like EFF and CPSR. I for one don't see any reason to hide my politics,
although I try not to make an issue of it.
