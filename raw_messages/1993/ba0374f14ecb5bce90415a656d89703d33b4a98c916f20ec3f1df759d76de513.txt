Does anyone wish to second the notion?

I do.  

I think it would be very important if we could attempt to
sway the Christian right into this; it is certain we
probably don't agree on many issues, and the "700 Club"
anti-Clipper piece was very effective, good video.

If you don't believe me, watch it.  They almost seem
to agree with us entirely on the issue of cryptography.
Perhaps it's time for a _new_ group; the cyphermonks.

I nominate St. John the Divine as a patron saint.
