Does anybody know of specific examples of wiretapping without a
search warrant, or beyond the scope of the search warrant that
we can cite?  Especially famous ones (didn't Nixon wiretap
somebody?)
 
-----


By exec. order (12333 is it?)  those suspected of espionage for a
foreign may be wiretaped, searched without warrant.

(foreign = foreign power)
