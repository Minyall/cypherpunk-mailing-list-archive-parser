Let me try to put it another way.  The higher you drive the DTE rate,
the more likely you are to loose characters.  At the same time, you
start to care less about the (small) protocol overheads involved.

But if characters change during transmit, how can you tell that the message
wasn't altered by some agent other than the device/driver?  Further, if it
happens only occasionally, won't you react with mistrust of the original message?

   "Hey, this message doesn't check with the author's key!"

If it happens a lot, aren't you more likely to say, 
	"Well, he must have meant $10,000, not $1000, the serial port must
	 be loosing again."

rather than resending some number of times?

The older I get, the more I understand, "Power to the people."
