Hal:  you should definitely keep your caltech remailer up, and
forwarding it to portal will not destroy its usefulness.  Remember
that a primary function of the remailers is to obscure the sender of a
message.  A message that passed through both caltech and portal would
require collecting logs from both systems to trace back beyond that
point.  That can't be easier than collecting the logs from only one of
the systems.
