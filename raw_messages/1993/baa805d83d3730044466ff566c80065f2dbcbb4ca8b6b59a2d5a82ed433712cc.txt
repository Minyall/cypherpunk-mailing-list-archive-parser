Ok nate@monet.vis.colostate.edu sez that you can trick the host ftp site 
into decompressing 4 U!!!1

Use "get" instead of the easier wildcard "mget" and the ftp site does the rest
just follow the prompts...if any.

However, I am not sure that the ftp sites appreciate this practice so
don't do this if you can find alternate means...

Also, ftp time takes a LOT longer...so get a cup of tea and sit by your 
terminal as you need to do some typing if you are going to "get" several
.gz files.

LOKI on a crippled convex with a fucked kermrc (send me a good one please)
and no gnuzip util on the site at all.
