I've never gotten a response from this one. Has anyone?

These last two seem to remail from the same address. Are there really two,
with one automatically feeding into the other as a two-tier? What's the
deal?

I'll send this message to remail@tamaix.tamu.edu to illustrate. I tried to,
and this message bounced. This is the second try, to
remail@tamsun.tamu.edu.
