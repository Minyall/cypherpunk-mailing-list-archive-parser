HEy, there was a recent 20/20 story on something like this.  Basically
the inmates in a lot of jails were swamping the legal system with bogus
lawsuits.  Some included were: the right to sacrifice animals due to religion,
the right to get to watch TV, and have a roast duck dinner every night also
due to religion.  Some were even more on the far side.  One guy sued the
jail for now allowing him to run a drug trafficking business out of his cell.

All of these get thrown out, but the cost to the legal system is a few thousand
per case!  This stuff can be >VERY< effective.

Mind you these guys didn't always do whatever they were granted a right to,
they were just badgering the hell out of the legal systems in their states.
