Clinton security plan hints of Big Brother

Clipper Chip would let governemnt eavesdrop on encrypted voice and  
data communications.

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- President Clinton last week announced a policy  
review of encryption while endorsing a new encryption technology  
called Clipper Chip that would give law enforcement agencies a key to  
unlock users' encrypted communications.

But government officials had a difficult time last week rebutting the  
question why any criminal would use a Clipper Chip-based product when  
the person knows the government could listen in, particularly since  
there are a host of other encryption products available on the market  
that are, in theory, unbreakable codes.

"A criminal probably wouldn't use it," said Mike Agee, marketing  
manager for secure products at AT&T, adding that the Clipper Chip is  
for the rest of the world.

Nice quote, that.  I like the headline, too.
