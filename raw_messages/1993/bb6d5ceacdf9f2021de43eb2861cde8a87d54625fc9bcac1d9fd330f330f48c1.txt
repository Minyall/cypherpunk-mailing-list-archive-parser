	Soundz like you have opinions on what type of anarchy you'll
advocate.  "getting away with something" also means breaking the law
when the law is severely screwed up.  Privacy is needed to maintain
our human rights, which brings in the Bill of Rights.  
	You want to be able to communicate freely about your opinions.
Me too.. but maybe my opinions are about the overthrowing of the government
