One element of the "right of privacy" debate I've seen is the distinction
between a "right _of_ privacy" and a "right _to_ privacy".  Linguistically,
"right _of_ privacy" == "privacy right", indicating that this particular
right would be enumerated somewhere.  In the case of a "right _to_
privacy", the concept is a bit more vague and allows the penumbral
(implied) construction given by Stanton.  

Since there is no specific mention of a "right _of_ privacy" in the
Consititution, one must fall back on the implied construction and interpret
Constitutional privacy as defined by other amendments.  What this
construction of the "right _to_ privacy" allows is for appellate courts to
weight enumerated rights as more important than implied rights.  Thus, in
the name of furthering the goals of another amendment (say #6,
speedy/public trial), the courts can limit the implied "right _to_
privacy".
