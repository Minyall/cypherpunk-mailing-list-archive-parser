  Obviously, if you had a brain, you'd be using FreeWare TeX instead of
PageMaker, or you'd realize that there are competing packages out that
with similar features but at a lower cost. Ya, software is extortion alright.
Produce wealth in today's world but refuse to release it to looters without
charging them a fee and you're in the protection reacket. Ha.
The part about warez being digital coins is nonsense. If there was
a free fL0w 0f wAr3z, your currency would be devalued to nothing. There'd
be no point of "trading" warez cause anything you had, I could get
myself. It is only because wArEz]<1dZ like yourself run pseudo-elitist
cliques where having 0-dayz old wAReZ is king that you see any value at
all in trading Mortal Kombat or beta copies of Windoze.


(these "warez" sites on the net are hilarious. 99% of them are run out
of the /tmp directory (under ftp or fsp) and others under student accounts.
Unknowingly, many of them show up under archie! So much for secrets.
Save yourself, and the net, the trouble of trading warez via anonymous
remailers and call up your local pirate bbs instead)
