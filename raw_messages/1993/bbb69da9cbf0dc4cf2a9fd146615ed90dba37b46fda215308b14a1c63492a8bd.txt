Cypherpunks,

I downloaded 'pgp' from soda.berkeley.edu and 'unproto' from
win.tue.nl, ran the Makefile (make sun4cc) and got a binary that passes
the test given in setup.doc.

However, I got the following warnings:

"crypto.c", line 1445: warning: constant 256 is out of range of
unsigned char comparison 
"crypto.c", line 1445: warning: result of comparison is always true

(along with the same messages for line 2445.)

Here are the relevant lines...  from pgp.h:
		#define MAX_PATH        256

from crypto.c:
			unsigned char litfile[MAX_PATH];
			...
1445 -->                if (litfile[0] < MAX_PATH) 
2445 -->                if (litfile[0] < MAX_PATH)

I can see where this is a problem; 256 won't fit into eight bits.  What
is the correct way to fix this.  Should MAX_PATH be set to something else?

Thanks for your help,
Eric Fogleman
