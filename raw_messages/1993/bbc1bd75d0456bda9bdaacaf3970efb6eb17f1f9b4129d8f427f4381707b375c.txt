Its not as simple as that. Phil Zimmermann has explicitly asked, on
advice of his attorneys, that people stay calm on this and not start
spewing accusations out or agitating so as not to cause harm to his
case.  Detweiler thinks he's "helping" even though Phil and others
don't want his help and feel that they could end up in jail as a
result of it.
