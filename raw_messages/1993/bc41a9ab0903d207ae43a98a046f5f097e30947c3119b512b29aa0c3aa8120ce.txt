	You are talking about thousands of dollars of cost to do such a
	search.

Sorry, I do searches like that all the time for "serious" candidates.
Takes me no more than 10 minutes to set up the criteria, and an hour or
so on an airplane to browse the output.  Granted, I don't search a year
(hey, if a candidate is a jerk on the net, they'll show up more than a
few times in just a month's worth ...), but your "it's in the noise"
statement is naive.
