Hi there,
I tried to post anonymously to netnews using the remailers with not
success.
The procedure was for example:

::
Request-Remailing-To: misc.test@cs.utexas.edu

and I addressed my mail to let's say nowhere-cs.bsu.edu. Using
cs.utexas.edu to post (not anonymously) works though. Any help is
highly 8-) appreciated.
Thanks in advance.
