  Lefty, go stuff yourself. You have all the credibility of Blackwell.
The only time you ever post a message is to ad hominem someone else. You've
been doing this for 2+ years on the Extropians list -- lurking 99% of the
time and only posting when you have a snide comment.  (just look
at your last message against wondered)

  If you can't recognize the difference between a silly comment and a real
murder threat, it's time for you to have a medical check up. You nicely
illustrate my point anyway. I would never make a murder threat face-to-face
particulary because I have no intention of physically damaging anyone. It is
this fact alone which Detweiler, and you need to realize.

  Threats made over the net are vapor.
