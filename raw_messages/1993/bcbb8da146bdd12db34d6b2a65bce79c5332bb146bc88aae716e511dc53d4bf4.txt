I subscribed to the Extropians list for a while and was quite impressed
with the list management software they were running. Commands could be
sent to the list processor like 'exclude <thread>', 'exclude <user>', etc
via regular e-mail messages; with this capability, anyone who can use 
e-mail can personally manage the stream of postings headed for their 
mailbox. In my opinion, this approach strikes a comfortable balance between
outright censorship and mass confusion.
