Unfortunately, the anonymous sytem at pax has been closed, as the local
network in Australia was considered unsuitable for this kind of thing,
partly due to the narrow bandwidth of the link to the US, and partly because
of the prevailing attitude at the US end that anonymous mail is generally
a bad thing.
