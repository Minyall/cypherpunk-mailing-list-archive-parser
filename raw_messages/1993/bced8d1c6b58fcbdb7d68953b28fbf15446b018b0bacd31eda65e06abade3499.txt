20 dollar bills have them, too.  Actually, all they say on them is "US
20 dollars", or something similar on the 50 and 100's.  They are to
prevent counterfeiting because you can just hold a bill up to the
light and see this bar on it.  It does not have any serial information
on it, so I doubt that it eases the tracing of money.
