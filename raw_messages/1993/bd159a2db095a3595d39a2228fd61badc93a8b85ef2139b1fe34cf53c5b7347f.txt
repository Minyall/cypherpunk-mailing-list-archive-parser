Maybe someone has said this, but another key way to foster privacy is to START A 
BANK that values this.  I recal some references to Swiss banking, anonymous accounts,
etc, before.  So wouldnt it be a good idea to find some bankers out there who wanted
to create a niche market for themselves, and sell them on the crypto-protocols?
First suggestion:  try Miami....
