Well, we can weekly publish the submission address.  It would take
slightly more intelligence on the part of the would-be poster.

What are exactly the politics of propagating this moderator's address,
anyway?  Is it particularly difficult?  Is it automated?

Please advise.  alt.whistleblower, in addition to being a public good,
is a great way to raise hell.
