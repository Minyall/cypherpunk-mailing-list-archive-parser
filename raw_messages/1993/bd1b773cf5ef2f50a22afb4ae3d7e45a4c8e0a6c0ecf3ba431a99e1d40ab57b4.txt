Subject: DC nets for network access?

DC Nets allow a single person to talk in a group of people without
giving away the identity of the talker.  

Telnet servers are programs that are easily set up from a user account
that allow a you to connect in to and then back out of a machine with
little or no logging.

Would it be possible/practical to marry these two concepts?  Make a
network of clients who wish to have anonymous access at some point
or another and ahve them transmit information by using a DC-NET 
protocol and then having a listener which is a telnet server and 
allows connections to the outside world.  The biggest problem I see 
is 'sessioning',  keeping data originating from one user seperate
from data originating from another user without giving away the
users identity.  If data is allowed to mix then there will be a
resulting security problem of course.

Any comments?
