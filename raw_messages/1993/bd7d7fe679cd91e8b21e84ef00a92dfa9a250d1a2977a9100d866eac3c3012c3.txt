Yup, the 3 microcurie source makes sense.  With a pair of diodes we could 
make the detector 4 pi, but no big deal.  3 microcuries is not a problem
health-wise as long as you don't eat it.  As it's an alpha source, any shiledingor even a few centimeters of air will stop the rays.  Howerver, I just encountered a new angle on it.  According to my father, that's on the order of $100
worth of radium :(.  If we're willing to go with a much slower source, we can
use thorium which is only $2 per gram or so.  Alternativly, anyone have 
an old clock with a radium dial? <grin>

BTW: Cosmic ray background is only 1 event per square foot per minute.  Plus,
they occur in showers.  So that isn't going to work.

          grown men pull their own heads off rather than see Doug.  Even
          Dinsdale was frightened of Doug.
Interviewer: What did he do?
Vercotti: He used sarcasm.  He knew all the tricks, dramatic irony,
          metaphor, bathos, puns, parody, litotes and satire.
