"Most would agree"? What a silly statement. You're in a big virtual
room with lots of different people, but a lot of them are "card-carrying"
libertarians who most certainly don't agree with that.

However, Marc also said, "I am glad that someone is finally mentioning
[the parallel between crypto and arms]." which is vacuous in light of
the _endless_ discussion on this very point on Usenet (sci.crypt and
elsewhere) in the beginnings of the wiretap chip flap.

Which leads me to my main point: please take this off-list before it
turns into the same flamewar that currently rages on
talk.politics.guns and for whatever weird reason, sci.skeptic.
