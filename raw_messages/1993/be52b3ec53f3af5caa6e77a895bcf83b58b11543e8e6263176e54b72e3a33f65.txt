Already happened.  The fellow used something like PGP, if not PGP, to
encrypt stuff to disk.  If I remember correctly (Mike G., help me out
here) he was asked to cough up the passwords in court as part of the
legal proceedings. (I remember this only because of the following
discussion of 'can a court make me give out my passwords?)  No call
for banning of encryption by The Media(tm).
