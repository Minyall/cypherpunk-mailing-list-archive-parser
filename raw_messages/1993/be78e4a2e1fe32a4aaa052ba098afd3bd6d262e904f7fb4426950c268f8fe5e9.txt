I finally got my mailer script to work.  I deleted the -S parameter to less in
the perl script.  But now, it seems that it can't sign my mail unless i'm in 
another directory but my home.  It complains that it can't find a key in 
secring.pgp for user 'me'.  me is an alias that I use for myself, but even if I
send mail to mdiehl@triton, it still tries to find a key for 'me'. What gives?
