Punksters,

Paul Ferguson asks if the new WIRED is out yet.  The answer is
"yes and no."  Complimentary copies were given away at a couple
of recent conferences.  Also, subscription copies are going out
now or in a few days.  Newsstand copies should be available in
three weeks or so.

I would appreciate any Cypherpunk thoughts, opinions, questions
or raves on my article, "Intelligent Island?" which appears in
this issue.  It and William Gibson's "Disneyland with the Death
Penalty" are the lead articles in WIRED #4.  Hope you like it.
