OK.  It seems that remail@extropia.wimsey.com (#15) is down.  This is a
shame, as it was the _only_ remailer that would function as an anonymous
remailer for me.  It worked beautifully while it was up.  Its apparent
demise has been reported by other users as well,
.   Several of the remailers listed (2,3,4,5) have _never_ worked using
standard cypherpunks syntax:

::
Request-Remailing-To:

.   All other cypherpunks remailers, reliable or not, retain the footer
addresses automagically inserted by the host box here & are therefore
not in any way anonymous for my purposes.  There was a discussion of a
"cut line" syntax before I temporarily lost access to cypherpunks, but
as far as I know there was never any agreement or implementation (I
shall be pleased to be corrected if this is not the case).
.   Penet.fi will no longer work for me since the forced-password
implementation due to an apparent header conflict with the
X-Anon-Password: line & local host/gate software.
.   Why am I depressed?
