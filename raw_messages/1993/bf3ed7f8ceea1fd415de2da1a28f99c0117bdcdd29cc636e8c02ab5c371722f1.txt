From the Loompanics Catalog:

"Special Notification Regarding Books Seized by the Authorities

Loompanics Unlimited cannot be responsible for any shipment of books 
seized by any government body.  This applies in particular to Canada, 
where many books are banned, and to prisoners, whose keepers often 
confiscate books.  If you are a prisoner or a Canadian, you are advised to 
check with your authorities before ordering books.  We cannot be 
responsible for books siezed by ANY government, since neither UPS nor Post 
Office insurance covers such a situation.  Be warned!"
