  One of the many neat features of PINE is that it allows one to talk
to the SMTP server _directly_, bypassing sendmail (and its security checks).
What this means is that instead of doing a  "telnet xxxx smtp", you can
build and configure a PINE client to do it for you, and retain all the
nice features. PINE source code is freely available, and does not require
root privs to run (any more than it requires root privs to "telnet xxx smtp").
The pine executable does take up a Meg and a half though, which could be a
problem for folks without a lot of space to play with.
 Coming down the pike though, I see SMTP, maybe even NNTP protocols being
secured (check out the magazine someone mentioned earlier: INFO-SECURITY.
You just have to fill out a bingo card to get it, Write:INFO-SECURITY NEWS
498 Concord St, Framingham MA 01701-2357). If that happens, the days of EZ
phreaking are over.....
