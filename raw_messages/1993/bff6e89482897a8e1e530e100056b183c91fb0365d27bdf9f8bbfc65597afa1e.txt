In fact, "triple" DES goes three times through the engine, but only uses
two keys:

     EN(DE(EN(data,k1),k2),k1)

My understanding is that this was chosen for hardware implementations
because it is equivalent to single DES when k1 = k2.  This is important,
of course, when some people you want to talk to are still using single DES
and the hardware is hard to reconfigure.

Nowadays, when most DES (technically, DEA) is done in software, it would
make more sense to use three separate keys.  Two key "triple" DES has 112
key bits (56 * 2), while a three key system would have 168.  I've seen the
latter system used recently, though I can't remember where...
