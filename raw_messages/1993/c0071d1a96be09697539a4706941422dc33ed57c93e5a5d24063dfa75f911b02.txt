So he intended to cause pain? Big deal. I'm beginning to believe the
book "I'm Disfunctional, You're Disfunctional": it concludes that
people involved in the recovery movement are generally doing the
opposite.

I'm the sort of guy who gets flamed constantly. I've been called the
worst possible things. Hasn't hurt me or crippled me. Calling people
names is stupid, but individuals who can't take being called names are
emotional cripples.
