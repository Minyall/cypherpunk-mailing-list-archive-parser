Fellow Extropians, Cypherpunks, and Computer Freedom and Privacy seekers--

Is anyone else hoping to share a room at the SF Airport Marriot for CFP '93?
The rates are $99 per room, single or multiple occupancy, for
conference attendees, with a limited block of rooms available, offer
expires Feb 9.
