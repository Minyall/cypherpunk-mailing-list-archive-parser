Let's talk less and do more. :)

How about adding encryption to kermit and iScreen so that they may
talk to each other in a secure manner?  I am proposing these two
programs because they are widely portable.  kermit works on most
Unix and MSDOS systems.  iScreen works on most Unix systems.

(Note that this would solve the network/modem eavesdropping problem,
but not the untrusted remote system problem.  The latter has no
solution in my opinion.  You just have to trust the sysadmin.)

I propose writing a link encryption library which could be usable
in other comm and BBS programs.

Any takers?

BTW, watch for an encrypted Unix talk program coming to a ftp site
near you.
