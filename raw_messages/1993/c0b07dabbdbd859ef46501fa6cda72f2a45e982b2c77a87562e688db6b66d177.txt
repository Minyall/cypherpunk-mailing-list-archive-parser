I will not "advertise" on the list as long as John prohibits it.
But I sincerely hope his prohibition does not discourage others
from discussing the issues it raises.  I would like to hear what
the rest of you think.


I do not argue with the decision to prohibit blatant advertising,  
however, with the increasing awareness of the internet and its  
potential, there is going to be more and more individuals that will  
want to extend beyond what it is currently being employed for.
	Regardless about individual feelings and ideals as to how and  
what the net should be used for, the issues WILL become increasingly  
debated, more than likely resulting in the eventual acceptance of  
advertising.  Simply put it is the new marketing frontier- many many  
people are seeing that already, and the beliefs of the few will not  
serve to stop it-as bad or good as that may be.

I will apologise beforehand since I am new to the net, but who is  
John?
