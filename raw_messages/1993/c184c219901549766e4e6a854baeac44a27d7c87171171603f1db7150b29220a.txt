"Do not attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by
stupidity."  Without support, I think CERT is merely being stupid.
Someone else (maybe even a government employee) is being malicious.  I
do think cert is harming their effectiveness by doing this.  My guess
is that they never stopped to think that someone might use them in
this way to shut down an "unpopular" ftp site.
