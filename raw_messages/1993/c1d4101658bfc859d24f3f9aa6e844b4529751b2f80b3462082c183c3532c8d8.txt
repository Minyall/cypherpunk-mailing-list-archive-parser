Some novels to enjoy...

Earlier today Nick Szabo (not his True Name?) made some references to
True Names. I'm sure you all have heard many of us speak about Vernor
Vinge's "True Names." If you have not yet read it, buy a copy today
and read it tonight in lieu of reading this list!

Another novel is "Ender's Game," by Orson Scott Card, in which some
kids carry on a political debate on the Nets of the future under the
digital pseudonyms "Locke" and "Demosthenes." Over a period of months
and then years, these nyms ("True Nyms"?) develop a large following
and are demonstrably important entities.

About the way our own "S. Boxx" could be if he/she/it didn't
periodically lapse into rants and flames about "traitors," the "death
fo the cypherpunks cause," and so on. Actions have consequences, even
in cypherspace.

Anyway, I strongly recommend both "True Names" and "Ender's Game."
