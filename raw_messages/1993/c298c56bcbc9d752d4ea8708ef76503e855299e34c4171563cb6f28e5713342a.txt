My bogometer just triggered, so I decided to check your math.

(2^56)*8 = 576,460,752,303,423,488 
((2^56)*8)/72 = 8,006,399,337,547,548 or eight quadrillion bytes.

Gee, half a terrabyte. Thats 16,000 times less than you claimed.

Your off the shelf slow speed tape technology isn't even 1/16,000 of
what you claimed, and its over a million times less storage than you
would need, in *RAM*, for the proposed task.
