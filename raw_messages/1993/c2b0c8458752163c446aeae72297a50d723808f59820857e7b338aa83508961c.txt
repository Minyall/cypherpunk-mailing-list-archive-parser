 Vint Cerf, President of the Internet Society, projected some
 interesting figures at ONE BBSCON in Colorado recently. According
 to an article in the October BoardWatch magazine, ".....by December,
 1993, there will be over 2 million ping-able hosts on some 46,000
 registered IP networks in 22,000 registered domains strewn across some
 91 countries. As of June, 1991, it is NOT primarily academic use, but
 actually that was the crossover point where commercial use applications
 exceeded academic use. Over 137 countries are now reachable via the
 Internet domain name e-mail system via UUCP, and the NSFNet backbone
 is now carrying some 7 TERABYTES of traffic per month. The Internet
 overall is growing at a rate of 12% per MONTH."

 You do the math.  ,-)

 Cheers.
