CELP resyncs.  Not sure how fast.  Maybe after a tenth of a second or so.

On a side note, we are finishing up an implementation of CELP on the
TMS320C5x.  This is a 20 MIPS integer chip.  We are taking up less
than 15 MIPS.  We also know how to write error corrected CELP (such
that bits that cause more significant degradation are protected
better).
