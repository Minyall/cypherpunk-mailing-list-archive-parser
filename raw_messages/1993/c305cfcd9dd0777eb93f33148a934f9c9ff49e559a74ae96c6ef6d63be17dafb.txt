That was smoke and mirrors by people who understand chaos better than
they understand encryption.  All it boils down to is a synchronised
pair of (not very good) PRNGs.  It's not a substitute for a one-time
pad by a long chalk, which is how they seem to be using it.  Basically
they've just reinvented every schoolboy's exor encryption program all
over again, this time with the latest 'chaos' buzzword thrown in to make
it sound hip.

Forget it.  It's a dead end.
