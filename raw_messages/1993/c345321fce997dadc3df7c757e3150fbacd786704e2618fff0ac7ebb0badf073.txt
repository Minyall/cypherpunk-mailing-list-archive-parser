This is GNU's zip compression utility. I am not sure if a port to the mac
has been made, but the source code is available. However, I have the prog
available here at aql.gatech.edu /pub/cypherpunks/pgp/binaries in cpt.hqx
format. The source code for gzip is also available in /pub.

Hope this helps.
