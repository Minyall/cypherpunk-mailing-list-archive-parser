I was with you all the way until you said:

->
I realize that by not compiling the code myself on my own machine I basically
have to trust the ViaCrypt PGP implementation.  So be it.  If there is
something wrong with ViaCrypt PGP I believe it will eventually be discovered.   Someb
ody will no doubt disassemble it and look for backdoors.  If someone finds
one, ViaCrypt's reputation will be worthless.  It's in ViaCrypts best interest  not t
o put in any backdoors.

Call me paranoid:

I'd never take what it's in someone's "best interest" as a 
major factor in predicting actions.  Look at the crime
section of the local paper or that bit called "news of
the wierd"

I happen to agree with you this time, though it would be nice
if ViaCrypt had included the code and a compling mechanism.
I suppose this is outside the realm of marketing possibility though.
