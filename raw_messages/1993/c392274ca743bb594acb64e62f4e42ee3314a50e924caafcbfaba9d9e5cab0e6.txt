Much as it pains me to agree with Perry when he's in his traditional
'wet blanket' mode, I feel I ought to point out that the kid who's
currently in jail under half a million bail is there because files
on his system apparently suggested direct violent action against
law enforcement officers.  While I understand that the comments made
here are in fun, I'd be willing to bet there are some tight-assed LE
types reading this who don't see the joke, and that the people who
suggested various forms of bombs as data protection devices are now
in the list of people to bust first when the revolution doesn't come.

By the way, all schemes that rely on your computer detecting some
change are useless.  Any half-intelligent cop raiding your machine
is just going to take the drive out and put it on one of his own
machines.  The only thing you can do is encrypt the drive.  And we'll
find out soon enough how the land lies on divulging of encryption
keys when prz ends up in court.

If anyone seriously implemented a dead-man's-handle to destroy his
data, I can promise you that all that will happen is that you'll
accidentally destroy your own data.
