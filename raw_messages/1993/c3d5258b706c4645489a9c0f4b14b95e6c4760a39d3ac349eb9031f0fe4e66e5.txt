ATT has an ad in today's (June 10, 1993) Wall Street Journal for their
secure phone for $1200; they do not say how it works (neither 
cryptography nor Clipper are mentioned).  Strangely, they suggest that
it could be used in places where one could easily be overheard (like
an airport--I don't know how they would connect to a public phone).
