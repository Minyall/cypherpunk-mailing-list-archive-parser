The latest "Wired," 1.6, has an article entitled "Big Brother Wants to
Look Into Your Bank Account (any time it pleases)." 

It describes how FinCEN, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network,
cross-refererence IRS records.

(I've been curious about FinCEN since around early 1990, when I first
heard about its formation--as a joint task force of Treasury, State,
NSA, FBI, etc.--and this article in "Wired" has filled in a lot of
gaps. Suffice it to say that FinCEN is likely _very_ interested in our
schemes for money-laundering, tax evasion, black markets, and collapse
of the U.S. and other governments.)

By the way, I generally avoid here the well-trodden ground of
libertarian politics, anarcho-capitalism, the "duties" one putatively
owes the State, and so on.

One should not take my unwillingness to "debate the basics" to mean
assent for the views others express here.
