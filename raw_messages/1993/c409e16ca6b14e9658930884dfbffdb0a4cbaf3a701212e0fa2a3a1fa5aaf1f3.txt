I just put up Ron Dippold's wpcrack code up on the ftp site, a program
that breaks the (very bad) encryption of Word Perfect files.  The
distribution is four files

	wpcrack.c
	wpcrack.doc
	wpuncryp.c
	wpuncryp.doc

in directory pub/cypherpunks/cryptanalysis.

The anonymous ftp site is soda.berkeley.edu.
