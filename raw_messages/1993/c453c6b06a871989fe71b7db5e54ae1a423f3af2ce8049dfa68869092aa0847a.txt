Interesting assertion. I suspect that you could say the same of any
other regional IP provider. A lot of service providers leap to claim the
appelation "common carrier", in the hope that it will absolve them of
responsibility for their users' actions. In the real world, most
providers, including UUNET and PSI, make their customers sign
agreements that said customers won't use the networks for nefarious
ends. Note that the phone company doesn't do this. 

It'll be a while (and a few court cases) before I have any confidence
that the U.S. Gov't recognizes IP service providers as common carriers
in any real sense.
