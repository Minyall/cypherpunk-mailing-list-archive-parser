There are many such systems. I suppose the kerberos suite's "klogin"
is the most popular these days, and options were being defined in
telnet to allow end to end encryption, though I don't know where
they've gotten to at this point.

Of course it would require a special communications program on both
ends -- there is no other way to do it.
