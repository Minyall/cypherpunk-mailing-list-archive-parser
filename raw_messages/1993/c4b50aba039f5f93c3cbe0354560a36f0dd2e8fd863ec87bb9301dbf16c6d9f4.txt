 As has already been shown from Fidonet policy, Fidonet does not guarantee
private mail  in any from and, in fact, advises that mail will be going
through many sites and can be read along the way.

 The third point does not apply if the sysops offer no private mail in the
first place.

 I don't need sysops to tell me otherwise. I've been running my own BBS
for over three years. My system has a very clear policy statement that
refers to the ECPA and states VERY clearly who can read the messages
posted on my system in different areas. As I'm not a Fido hub (and barely
participate in that network at all), I don't have to worry about passing
other mail through my system.
