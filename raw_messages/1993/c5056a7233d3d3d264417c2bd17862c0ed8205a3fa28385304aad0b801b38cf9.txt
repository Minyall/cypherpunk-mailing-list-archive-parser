Does anyone have a copy of the Viallage Voice article from the 3rd of 
August 1993?  I don't want to type it in, and I know I saw it on the list
a while back.

Also, I am compiling a list of articles that explain what we are all about 
(I know, there is no CypherPunks agenda per se, but there are common
goals here), to be given out to the public.  If you are in posession of 
such an article (or know of one, I'll type it in) send it to me, please.

Thanks,
