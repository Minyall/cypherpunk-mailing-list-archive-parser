I didn't write the item above, but I'll add my comments anyway.

Zero knowledge interactive proof systems are a critical part of modern
crypto. Here's the brief summary from the Cypherpunks Glossary,
available by anon. ftp at soda.berkeley.edu in pub/cypherpunks/misc as
glossary.text.gz.

***     zero knowledge proofs -- proofs in which no 
knowledge of the actual proof is conveyed. Peggy the Prover 
demonstrates to Sid the Skeptic that she is indeed in 
possession of some piece of knowledge without actually 
revealing any of that knowledge. This is useful for access to 
computers, because eavesdroppers or dishonest sysops cannot 
steal the knowledge given. Also called minimum disclosure 
proofs. Useful for proving possession of some property, or 
credential, such as age or voting status, without revealing 
personal information.


By the way, this Glossary was distributed at the very first
Cypherpunks meeting, a year ago. While never intended as an FAQ, it
still may be of value to subscribers here.
