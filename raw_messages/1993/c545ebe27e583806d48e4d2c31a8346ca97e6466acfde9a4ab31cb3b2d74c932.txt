Your English is much better than my Russian. :-)

I've cleaned up spellings and punctuation in the quote below, to reflect my
understanding.  Was I correct?

What's missing in the last statement is the qualification of <text>.
Is it

	A text
or
	E text

?

Meanwhile, some method of learning f would be nice :-).

Is it also claimed that:

E g(k,text); A k1,k2,text; E k0  ST len(k0)=len(k1)=len(k2) and
des(k2, f(k1, text)) = g(k0,text)

for f(,) as defined above?  (That is, does this method continue to
apply for an indefinite number of DES copies?)
