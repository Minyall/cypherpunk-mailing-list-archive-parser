Hi Shari,

I am not quite an expert on GIFs, but I know a thing or two about
manipulating digital images to hide information - steganography,
and I am writing a shareware tool for the MAC that can embed data
undetectably within GIF images. The first release date is scheduled
for October 15. I am also working on providing an IBM version of this
about one month later. If this interests you, let me know.

Cheers,
Romana
