As I recall, GAs are rather inappropriate for crypto applications, as they
tend to give rather inexact answers.  In a message where one wrong bit
could mean the difference between "en clair" and garbage, they are useless.
But for simple substitution ciphers, they can enable one to get "best guess"
clear - enough to make the message readable.  Hopefully. :)
