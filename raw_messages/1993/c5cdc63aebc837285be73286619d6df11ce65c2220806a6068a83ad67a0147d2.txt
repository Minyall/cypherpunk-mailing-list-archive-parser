I'm talking about buying the color *copier* itself.  In all the
copier businesses I've seen, none of them allowed one to make 
color copies unattended.  Is this because they are complicated 
or expensive per copy or because of some kind of technology 
restriction (e.g., high quality color copies cannot simultaneously
be anonymous and private).
