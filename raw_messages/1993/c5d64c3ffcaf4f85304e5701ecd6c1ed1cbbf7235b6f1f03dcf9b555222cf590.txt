Geeez, Eric!  I'd think a penny a hop would be a pretty high price...  And
given that most messages go through two hops, then you'd really be giving
your 2 cents worth!

Note that there can be about 50 cypherpunks messages a day -- if each went
through 2 hops at $0.10 / hop, as you proposed, that would be $10 / day in
revenues for the remailers.  Seems like a lot to me.

I would support the idea if I felt that the system would quiet the flame
wars, but I think rather it would simply quiet the poor...
