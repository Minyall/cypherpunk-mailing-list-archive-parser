Yep. Switzerland for sure (every draft age citizen keeps an assault rifle
and ammo). Similarly for most US rural states; Oregon, South Carolina,
Texas and Arizona come to mind. So do shooting ranges and guns shows most
anywhere.

I've never felt safer than in such places, and most would say most such
places are desirable, compared to say Washington DC or New York where guns
have been outlawed for ages. Except for of course, those in the hands of
the state and the criminals.

Why in the world would you say otherwise?
