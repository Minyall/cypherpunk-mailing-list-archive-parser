"Spread spectrum" does *not* imply "encrypted". The spreading
sequences are quite often just simple linear feedback shift registers,
which anyone with basic knowledge of cryptanalysis knows how to crack.

Anyone with knowledge of the signal format and the right hardware
could easily intercept such a signal. This *definitely* includes the
government.

The fact that spread spectrum usually thwarts the average scanner
enthusiast is actually rather unfortunate in my opinion, because that
lessens the demand for truely secure cryptography.
