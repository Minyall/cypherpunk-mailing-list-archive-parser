Some time back (maybe quite a long time ago, I forget) I heard rumors
that a BBS that someone had uploaded child porn or some such to,
without the sysop's knowledge, resulted in the sysop's arrest. Was that
merely a rumor?

Or is that a different category than the mail traffic you're commenting on?
