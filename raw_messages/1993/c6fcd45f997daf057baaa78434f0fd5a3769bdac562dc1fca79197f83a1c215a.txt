According to the ftp log, 10 people have so far obtained copies of the
MacPGP 2.3 source that I offered.  Unfortunately, a local problem
unconnected with ftp brought all processes on my machine to a halt at the
weekend, and no further sessions were possible until I cleared the fault
this morning.

Connected with the fault, if anyone knows of the domain name or whereabouts
of the machine with IP number 179.135.226.153, I would be most interested
in contacting its manager.

I'm back from my travels a day earlier than I expected, but I'll leave the
PGP stuff available until I said I would, i.e. 8:00 GMT Friday 8.
