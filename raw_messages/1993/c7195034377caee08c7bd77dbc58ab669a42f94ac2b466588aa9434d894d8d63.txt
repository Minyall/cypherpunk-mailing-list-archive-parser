I know there exist many variants of mailers today, but the major packages I
have heard of are "Major Domo" and several varietiest of "Listserver." You
can archie for the various sites. As to public key usage, I have little
experience with these programs and some other people on the list could
answer far more adequately than I -- my initial feeling is are going to hack
on the programs a bit.
