This quotation needs to be debugged a little bit. The actual quotation
reads as follows: 

"They [the framers of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights] conferred,
as against the government, the right to be let alone--the most
comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men."

Olmstead v. United States, 227 U.S. 438, 478 (1928).

(Note in particular that it's "let," not "left.")
