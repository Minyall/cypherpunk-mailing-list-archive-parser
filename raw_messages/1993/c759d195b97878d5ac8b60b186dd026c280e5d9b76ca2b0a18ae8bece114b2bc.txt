Hi John.
 
Actually, they refer to themselves as "SprintLink." ;-)
 
In all reality, I'm leaving Computer Sciences Corporation for a
consulting position with Mindbank Consulting Group, based in the
Washington, DC area. While CSC has kept me travelling five days
a week (mostly in New Yawk City), I welcome the opportunity to
stay closer to home for a change. (My wife is certainly happier.)
 
If you turn to page 339 of "The Whole Internet User's Guide & Catalog
(by Ed Krol, copyright 1992, O'Reilly & Associates <nuts@ora.com>),
in the middle of the page you'll see the name of gentleman for whom
I'll be working.
 
I remain distanced from the controversy surrounding the
Sprint/Congressional-hearing debate, because I do not work there
yet. <g>
 
As far as their reliabilty, I certainly hope to contribute to the
future of Sprint's connectivity reputation; hopefully that will be a
good thing.
 
Wish me luck, chum.
