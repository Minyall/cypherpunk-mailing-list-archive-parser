I'd just like to say that I think this sucks bad.  I don't like cops,
and you're being one, or worse.  And with a team of folks helping you
to dig even deeper?  This is ugly, vicious, and authoritarian, and I
can't believe that you would actually BRAG to hundreds of people that
you're doing it.  Sounds to me like you're a very frustrated person.
You are clearly an insensitive bastard.  I just hope that you encounter
this kind of sympathy if YOU go through a "difficult period" in your life.
