Problem: how much trust do you have for a temporary site set up to give
Internet access?  Can you assure yourself they're not capturing your telnets
and remote logins?

At a recent SF con I attended, there was a rumor going around to the effect
that the admin was doing just this.  I found the idea disturbing but
eminently plausible.
