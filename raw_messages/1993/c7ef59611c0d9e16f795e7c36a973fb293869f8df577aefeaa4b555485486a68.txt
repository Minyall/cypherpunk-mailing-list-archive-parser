This is only the tiniest bit related to crypto, but that doesn't seem
to be much outside the criteria for submissions to this list.. :-)

Anyone got pointers to decoding audio tones?  An intro book, source
code, newsgroup, mailing list, somebody I can take to lunch?  I'd like
to sample audio with my SGI, and suck out various simple tones and
combinations of tones.  (DTMF, single pitch variant tones, etc.)

thx.
