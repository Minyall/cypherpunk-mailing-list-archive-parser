I saw on "Clarinet," the news service, a couple of A.P. reports on
armed attacks on chip warehouses.

The latest was yesterday when a van pulled up to the loading dock at
Wyle, a distributor in Santa Clara (across from Intel). Two armed men
forced everyone in the area to the floor, while they went straight for
the Intel microprocessors and filled a large bag. 

An investigator called this type of crime the wave of the future, and
said something to the effect that "chips will be the coke of the 90s."
Also talk of black markets and how computer networks are being used to
coordinate things.

So, if you see folks using BlackNet for advertising Intel chips....

(I regret that I cannot post the Clarinet article, as Clarinet has
fairly draconian policies about reposting its articles--even though I
never signed a contract. Still, Cypherunks should be aware of
this....I've seen at least one Clarinet article reposted here on this
list, and this could expose the list to actions.)
