To those interested in participating in a hardware specific cypherpunks list,
(punk-net, net underground, whatever) e-mail me.  My sysadmin is cool with
the idea of setting the list up here, so if a decent number of people respond
over the next week, I'll set it up.

So, hardware fiends... time to bring a whiff of burnt flux and overheated
resistors to the world of underground cryptography.
