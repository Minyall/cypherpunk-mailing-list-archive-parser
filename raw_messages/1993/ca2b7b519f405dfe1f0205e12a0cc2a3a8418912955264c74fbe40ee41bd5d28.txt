Not unless they cc:ed the an12070 address, of course, or replied
directly to it.

I avoid ever sending Detweiler any mail. I used to respond honestly to
his many pestering questions to me, a few months back, but he then
used comments out of context in his "S. Boxx" rants---so now I make it
a point to leave him off any comments I might make about him in this
forum.
