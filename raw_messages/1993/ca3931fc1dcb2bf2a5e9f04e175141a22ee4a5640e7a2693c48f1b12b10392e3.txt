                  Anonymous Digital Kiosks

With all the talk of reputations, digital cash, anonymous
remailers/posters/DC nets, Data havens Grey Markets one quickly
comes to the the conclusion that the future is here now. 
Sufficient protective technology is currently available
to create a "greymarket" anonymous digital kiosk.
This ADK could be located literally anyplace with net-connections
in real space, and using Public Key Encryption Technology and
Cypherpunks Remailers as well as newly emergent Digital Cash systems
with say a "friendly" Lichenstein Account be able to
vend ANY kind of service and collect payments for same 
 regardless of the prevailing laws
in the real space location of the ADK.

    This indeed is what is most likely frightens the goverment,
code from projects like DOD/SBIR A90-217 "Electronic Countermeasure:
Computer Virus" and other more "black" projects could be spirited out of
projects and sold to possible clients with relatively little fear of reprisal.
Solicitation for grey market information and responses to same
are relatively safe and untraceable making  current civil intrusion
by the state impossible in the case of net.citizens choosing to employ
this technology.

And composite entities and persona will become popular such as this one...
Sam Hill is actually several people... :)(sorry about that LD)
