Yes, the PGP 2.3A distribution has incorrect MD5 values in
contrib/md5sum/pgp23.md5. I think that they were not updated to acount for
the changes between versions 2.3 and 2.3A. 

Nevertheless, the file pgp23sigA.asc (which is distributed separately from
the .tar.Z and .zip files) contains good detached signatures from Colin
Plumb, covering the various .zip and .tar.Z files for PGP 2.3A.
