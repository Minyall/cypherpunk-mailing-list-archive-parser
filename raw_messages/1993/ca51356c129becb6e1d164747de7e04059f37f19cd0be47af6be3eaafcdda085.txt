Another problem in this set up is:  What if "B" is caught and put in
jail/killed?  How are "D" and company (including "J, K, L" and on) going to
stay in touch?  Some one posted that useing a "I am caught" key might help
cover the trail. I think it would cut down on the uptree pateren but might not
pass on info downtree.  Would a side to side contact help?
                            A
                           / \
                          B - C
                         /     \
                        D       G
                       / \     / \
                      E - F - H - I
How would one keep the cross over safe?  An "in case of loss of contact, use
PGP Key xxx?"
Ideas?
