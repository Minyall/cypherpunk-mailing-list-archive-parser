Because the spelling of my last name is fairly uncommon, and someone
used a pseudonym that happens to be a good part of said name, I just
wanted to make it clear that an4914@anon.penet.fi is not me, and I
have no idea who "Nitch" actually is.

Sorry to waste bandwidth on that... with the heated discussion on
pseudospoofing etc I don't want to get caught in the cross-fire.
