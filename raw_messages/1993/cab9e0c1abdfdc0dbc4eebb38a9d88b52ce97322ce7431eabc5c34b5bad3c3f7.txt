Which prompts me to ask:

Is anyone out there using the Pine email software?  If so, do you know of
any way to integrate PGP into Pine?  If not, any other ideas?  I see a lot
of signed messages out there, but the only way for me to send one is to
shell out to AIX, use vi to create a message, run pgp to create the signed
message, then run Pine and read the message in, at which point I can
finally send it.

Notice that this message isn't signed.  It's just too much hassle!

Thanks for any advice anyone can give me.
