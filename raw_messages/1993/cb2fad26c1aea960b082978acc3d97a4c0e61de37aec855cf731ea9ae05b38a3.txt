No.  Our local list alias is "cypherpunks-list" and the only recipient is an
incoming news processor that posts messages in a local newsgroup
(pro.cypherpunks).  The only transmissions to the cypherpunks@toad.com
address are when posts are made in our local newsgroup.

I will double-check everything though.
