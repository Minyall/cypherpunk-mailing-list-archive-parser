An open message to "lurker@cyberspace.nil"


As your list administrator, Erik Hughes, has requested, we will no longer
accept messages posted on this List. (For bandwidth reasons.)

Brief open answer to lurker@cyberspace.nil: No, Yes, Thanks, and
"unreliable stock tips" probably have no market value.

We understand that ventures like ours have a long way to go. But cyberspace
is infinitely extensible, and we will eventually colonize it.

In the meantime, this initial experiment proves the concept is basically
sound. Lots of work needed, though. More places to post, better anonymous
remailers, out-of-the-U.S. mail-to-UseNet services, etc.

Onward and Inward!
