Out of curiousity, has any ftp-archive maintainer tried to join the
American Library Association, either directly or as part of some
university's library system?  It would be an interesting way to start
building precedents.  Are there any equivalent international or
non-US national library associations that take strong anti-censorship
pro-privacy positions?
