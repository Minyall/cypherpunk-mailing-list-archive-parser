That's why I called it "Graynet" instead of "Blacknet"... not
exactly Stealth bomber plans or protected witness True Names
for sale here.  The interesting part is how (s)he structured the 
advertising (anon ID server) and payment (check or money order 
by P.O. Box).  All sorts of controversial services (porn, gambling,
mail order contraband, etc.) might be structured this way, as long as they 
are legal or at least widely tolerated in the jurisdiction of the 
mail drop.  

I wonder how many folks will trust new anon services.  If they 
don't, is it easy to go from a traceable business to an anon 
business, taking the business's reputation with it?   If so, 
we may see controversial net-based services such as pirate software 
and porn BBS's "activate the cloaking device" upon being threatened, or
when desiring to advertise blatantly and in volume on the Internet.
