This is how I see the situation:

 Neural Nets : Computers  ::  Chaotic analog encryption : DES

The chaotic encryption work depends on a secret algorithm, no less.  If
you want a system which works, do it digitally.  If you want to play and
get papers accepted to the next hot-topic-of-the-day conference, go play
with some op amps.  If you want to play, there's an article in SciAm
this month on building a chaotic "encryption" machine.  It probably
provides acceptable security if you use triple DES on signals prior to
sending them.
