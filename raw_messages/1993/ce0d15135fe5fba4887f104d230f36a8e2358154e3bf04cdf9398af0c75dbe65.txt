Cypherpunks:

A user new to unix, pgp, the net, etc. wrote to me asking for a "menu
type of shell" to protect from switch overload.  So I hacked this
together pretty quickly and have given it a once over testing.  It is
meant for new pgp users; something which will help until they are more
comfortable.  I mailed to the original user, but I thought there may
be wider interest.

pgpshell: it pretty much just passes on arguments to pgp, nothing
fancy, minimal functionality.
