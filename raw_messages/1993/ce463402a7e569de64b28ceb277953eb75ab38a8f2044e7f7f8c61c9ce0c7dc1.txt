I'd like to see this...

A couple of points...  It looks like you were trying to stress test
someones software.. I saw a --- BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE --- at the start
of your message, but no matching signature block...  And it is kind of
annoying to the rest of the group to request "let me know and I'll..." and
then use an anonymous remailer to prevent replies...  Oh well...
