I'm probably going to be out of town that weekend, so I can't organize
things..  If someone else wants to organize, feel free.  Otherwise, I
can probably work on organizing the weekend after for this month,
assuming people have things they want to talk about and can generate a
meeting agenda.  I havent had an agenda, which is why I havent called
a meeting since the last one in April.  Also, I've been busy on my
Thesis.  ;-)
