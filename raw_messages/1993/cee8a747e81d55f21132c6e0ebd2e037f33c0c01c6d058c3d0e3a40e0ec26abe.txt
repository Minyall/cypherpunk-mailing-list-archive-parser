I believe you are confusing cash with deposits.  Cash (either paper or
digital) can be passed untraceably from palm to palm (or palmtop to
palmtop, if you will).  Deposits, on the other hand, require a method
for the bank and the depositor to authenticate each other.  In the
past, anonymous authentication was rife with problems, but cryptography
might solve these problems.

However, I think the deeper question is worth considering: what is the
justification for anonymous bank accounts?

Avoiding taxes just doesn't cut it for me; much as I hate to pay them,
I recognise the need to do so.
