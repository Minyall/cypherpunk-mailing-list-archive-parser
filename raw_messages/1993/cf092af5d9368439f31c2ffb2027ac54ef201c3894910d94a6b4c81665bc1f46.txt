			Thanks and keep up the good work.

	I personally think people should use their DISCRETION when
	posting, not hard and fast rules. If I wanted hard and fast
	rules I'd sign up for Prodigy. An occasional post related to
	the subject that is obviously of interest to a large sub-
	population of cypherpunks is appropriate, perhapse in the future
	put a warning in the subject line so the whinners can hit the
	"d" key in advance and save that .25 cents or whatever it cost them.

	And for the person who complained about bandwidth, how do you feel
	about the fact that we now have to waste more flaming about wasting
	bandwidth. (Please don't reply to the list, reply to me if you must)
