     Sorry if I'm just wasting bandwidth here.  I just asked if I'd gotten
through because I couldn't find any reference to this list on the system and
I figured the people at Mondo 2000 probably just made it up.  I guess not.
Cool.  I got a message telling me how to subscribe, so I guess I'll talk to
y'all later.
