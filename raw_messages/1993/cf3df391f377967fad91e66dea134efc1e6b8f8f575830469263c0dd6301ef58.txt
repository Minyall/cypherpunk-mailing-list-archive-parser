Get on the phone to EFF ASAP.

Here's the bibliography I promised earlier. If someone would put this up
on soda and perhaps even add to the list, I'd really appreciate it. --Phil

As a few people have requested, here's my current bibliography of DES
source code listings found in various widely published books or
magazines. Note that I have explicitly excluded the dozens of books
and publications that merely *describe* the DES algorithm -- even
descriptions complete enough to use as a basis for implementation.
They don't count because, as we all know, only Americans are smart
enough to turn an algorithm description into C code (or so our
government believes.)

Additions or corrections to this list are welcome. Again, I'm only
interested in actual code listings.  --Phil
