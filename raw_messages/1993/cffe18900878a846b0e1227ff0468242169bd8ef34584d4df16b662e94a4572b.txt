I understand this, but could I be cited for failure to produce
evidence not known by the court to exist?  (Clearly, I could be so
cited if the evidence were ever discovered.)  Is there a process that
the court can use that says "hand over absolutely all artifacts
pertinent to the case at hand known to *you*, whether such artifacts
be known to the court or not." ?  Or is it the case that failure on my
part to offer up such evidence is inherently contemptuous?

I wholeheartedly agree; I'd of course encrypt my secret backups :-)


Gee, now that I've publicized this great idea, I suppose it can never
work for me.
