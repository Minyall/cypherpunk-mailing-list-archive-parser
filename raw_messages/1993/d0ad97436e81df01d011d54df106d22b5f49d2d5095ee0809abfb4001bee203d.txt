    Hmmm...  In other words, everything that you have suggested so
far has been alright with me.  But a project to render the Internet
useless would not be okay.

     It has been moved to port 70 like all other gopher sites.  You
should be able to do 'gopher 147.226.53.28' or 'gopher chaos.bsu.edu' now.

     Once again, anyone who wants an account on here, apply for one by
telnetting to chaos.bsu.edu (147.226.53.28) and logging in as guest.
