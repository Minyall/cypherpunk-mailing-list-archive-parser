As I understand it, the Skipjack system is symmetric, i.e., decrypt key=
encrypt key.  Also, the unit serial number seems to only get encrypted
with the family key.

So, once the family key and the algorithm are known, it will be
possible to create messages with any unit serial number you want, right?

Wouldn't this be enough to foil the casual traffic-analysis feature
of the crippler?
