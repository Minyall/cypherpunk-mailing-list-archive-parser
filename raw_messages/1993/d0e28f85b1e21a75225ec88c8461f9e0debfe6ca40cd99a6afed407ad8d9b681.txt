I tried "unsubscribe cypherwonks Alan Wexelblat" and got back a barf message
saying that I had to "unsubscribe <listname> <address>" so I tried
"unsubscribe cypherwonks wex@media.mit.edu" and got back a barf message
saying "No matches found for 'wex@media.mit.edu'

Help!  Is there a human being associated with this annoying piece of crap?
I suppose I can just add a new formula to my .procmailrc, but I'd rather
kill it at the source...

Withdrawing in disgust is not the same as apathy.
