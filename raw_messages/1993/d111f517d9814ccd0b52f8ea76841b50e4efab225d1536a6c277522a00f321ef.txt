BTW, there is a story in today's NYT about a poor, French kid
who watched McGiver make a bomb in the TV show and then decided
to "try this at home." He was killed. Now his family has filed
a nice, big law suit. 

The guy on the show made the bomb with sugar and some kind of
fertilizer or other stuff.
