In these days with much abdication of individual responsibility to various 
agencies, it seems to me that we should not encourage any entity to take
care of poor old us and filter *anyone*, when we can do it as individuals. 
Any new members who are discouraged by the rants and raves of LD or any other
messenger of boredom will learn to use the delete key or killfile. If they
can't hack LD for a couple of days (till they figure out his rap), then there
is not much to be done for them. I think we should give most newcomers the
chance (as well as the credit for having a brain) to figure out the value of 
list conversation on their own, warts and all. Funny thing about warts, get 
rid of one and, alot of times, another crops up.
