Yeah, but that kind of assumes connectivity to the net. It's rather inconvenient
for a pair of phones who only have dialup modems connected to each other
to do this on every call.

You could probably use temporary RSA key-pairs for each call, but RSA
key generation is notoriously slow. A lot slower than a Diffie-Hellman
key exchange.

Eh? No, as I've been saying, you can produce a very strong hybrid in
which both Diffie-Hellman and RSA each play an important part.
Diffie-Hellman generates the session keys, while RSA signs them.
