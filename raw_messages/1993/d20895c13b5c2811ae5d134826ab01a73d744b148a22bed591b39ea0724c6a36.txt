    Remember, the government is not a single entity -- out to get us -- but a 
    collection of individuals, some fraction of whom are covering their butts 
    and looking for goats at any given moment (as has been revealed to us by 
    the media).  All of whom are interested in maintaining/improving their 
    current status.

What a superb observation. As a newspaper journalist who's seen government
slime up close for a while, I can tell you that this is true, true, true.
The _biggest_ threat to Clipper isn't cypherpunks or other patriots; it's a
bureaucratic civil war.
