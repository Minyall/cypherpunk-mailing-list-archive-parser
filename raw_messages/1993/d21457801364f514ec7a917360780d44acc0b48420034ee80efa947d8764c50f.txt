Over on ASAR, we give warning for anger. Consider yourself warned.

I despise Detweiler. I also think he ought to be in a mental
hospital. However, this is evil, anti-social behavior. It is
abusive beyond any possibility of shrugging it off.

Stop it. Don't make excuses. I don't *care* if you think this
sort of think is "just a joke". It isn't. OK, you don't
understand. That's irrelevant. Just take it from older and wiser
heads that it is unacceptable. STOP IT.

No, I'll make it stronger. Either you apologize to me, to
Detweiler, and to the list, or the list owner removes you from
the list, or I go. I will not be associated with a group that
tolerates this sort of behavior.

(Does anyone want to know why I'm so incensed. Check out ASAR for
awhile. Understand that this person's behavior, and excuse
making, is indistinguishable from the abuse that makes that
newsgroup necessary.)
