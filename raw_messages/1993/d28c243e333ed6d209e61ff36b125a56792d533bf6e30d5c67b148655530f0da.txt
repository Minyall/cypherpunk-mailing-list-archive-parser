Well, I hereby relinquish my claim to having the most complete PGP site.  Aql
beats NitV hands down!  But not for long...  >;)  Truly impressive though!

PS someone requested that I UL my stuff (much of it hard-to-get Fido/PGP
utils, and the like) to their site.  Who was that? I've lost the msg.
