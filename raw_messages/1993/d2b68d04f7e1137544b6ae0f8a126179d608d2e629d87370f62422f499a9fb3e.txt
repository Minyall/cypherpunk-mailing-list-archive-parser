Excuse me, but it seems that you are being very defensive. I was not picking
a fight. It is evident that you cling to "It used to be that" ideals. Just 
because something "used to be" is not justification for its perpetuation. Is
it such a drastic step to replace a couple words that you feel necessary to
ridicule something that I consider important? As far as I am concerned, Mr.Diehl
it is YOU who are being childish. Wake up, will you? And please refrain from
using the word "we". I do not enjoy being patronized.

Obviously. You are indeed a man of tremendous wit and satire.

Also plainly obvious.
