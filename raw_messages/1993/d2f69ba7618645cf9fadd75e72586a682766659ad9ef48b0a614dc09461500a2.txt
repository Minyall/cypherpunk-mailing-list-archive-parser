But that's not a population count (all bits set count) instruction.
In the Motorola 68020/30/40, there's BFFFO, for Bit Field Find First One,
if anyone was curious about 'find first set' instructions.  Might as well
mention that the 386/486 have BSF and BSR, Bit Scan Forward and Reverse,
but now we're just getting into run-of-the-mill bit manipulation.
