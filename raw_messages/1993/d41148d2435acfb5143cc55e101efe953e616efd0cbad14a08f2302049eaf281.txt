Think about this scenario for a moment: dclunie sends mail to the system
adiministrator of an institution complaining of the mail sent by a
particular user. The system administrator confronts the user, who then
explains the situation. He explains that he has sent numerous requests to
be unsubscribed from the list, but they continue to send large volumes of
mail. Out of frustration, he sends an 80K file to the list hoping it will
get someone's attention. The mail continues, and several members of the
list makes threats of "dirty tricks" and "mail bombs" against him. Now one
of the "cypherpunks" is sending libelous mail to the system administrator.
The system administrator now understands the situation; an educational
institution on the net is made aware of a rapidly developing campaign of
harrassment and vandalism by the cypherpunks. So what happens now? Are the
cypherpunks winning?

Are you people blind to what you are doing? What fools!!!

What upsets me the most about all of this is that I am truly an advocate of
net freedom, privacy, and anonymity. But the cypherpunks is setting itself
up for a big fall and they threaten to tarnish the whole movement toward
net freedom and privacy with their petty, puerile, and vandalous behavior!
