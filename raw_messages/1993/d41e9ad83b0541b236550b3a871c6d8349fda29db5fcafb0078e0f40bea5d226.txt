[Talks about real-time end-to-end encryption of user sessions on BBS's.]

It's not quite as sexy and "James Bond" as real-time end-to-end encryption, 
but I think an easier approach to this would be to adopt the architecture of 
the offline mail-reading programs that are available.

For the benefit of people unaccustomed to offline readers, these programs 
collect up all of the unread messages, E-mails, and file descriptions from a 
BBS, .ZIPs or otherwise packs/compresses the files, and then the user 
downloads that "packet", and hangs up. The user then uses a program on her 
local PC to read and reply to messages in that packet, dials the BBS again, 
and uploads her responses.

I haven't fussed around with offline readers much, but I'll bet it'd be 
pretty simple to add a step to the collection/.ZIP process, which would 
encrypt the whole package with some prearranged key.

This would allow folks to use standard BBS programs, standard terminal 
programs, and perhaps even standard offline readers. It should be pretty 
simple from a programming standpoint, as well; it's perhaps implementable 
with only batch commands. Yes, the "bad guys" will get to watch the user log 
on and log off, and can read the menus and choices - but so what? It's 
possible (easy, really) to encrypt all of the really interesting stuff.
