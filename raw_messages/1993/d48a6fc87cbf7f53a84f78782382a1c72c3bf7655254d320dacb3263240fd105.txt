  John Draper has already expressed an interest in having everyone 
  exchange keys, and will probably mention this during his speech.
  I can guarantee there will be numerous laptops, and even full 
  systems avaialable. Last year, we even had 4-machine internet  
  site going - hohocon.com. Yeah, it was great for about 5 minutes
  until all the power in the wing went out.
