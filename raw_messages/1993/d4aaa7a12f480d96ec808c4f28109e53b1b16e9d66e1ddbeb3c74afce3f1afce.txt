I would like to assemble an archive (electronic *and* paper) of graphics
relating to privacy and encryption. These could be made available for
republication in books and magazines, so any items not already in the
public domain ought to be accompanied by source citations so that
permissions may be obtained.
 
I'd be interested in graphs, diagrams, flowcharts, cartoons, line
drawings, photos, and any other graphical content you can think of. More
specifically, graphs (e. g. comparing the difficulty of breaking various
encryption methods, encryption time as a function of RSA key length,
etc.), diagrams (such as Hal Finney's excellent flowcharts in Extropy
#10), cartoons (e. g. political cartoons about various government
attempts to control/stifle encryption), and photos (of commercial
software product packaging, photos of secure phone systems such as
marketing depts would produce, photos of famous cypherpunks,
cryptographers, and crypto programmers)
 
Items on paper as well as items in electronic format will both be
welcomed. Send the former to 1800 Market St, #243, San Francisco CA
94102. Send the latter to slippery@netcom.com in uuencode or BinHex4
format.
