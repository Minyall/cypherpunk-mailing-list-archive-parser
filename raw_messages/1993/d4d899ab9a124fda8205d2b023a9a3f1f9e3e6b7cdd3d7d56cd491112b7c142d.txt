Hi,
    Can anyone suggest some good references/mailing-lists
about UNIX security ?  I've already read lots of popular
papers/books, such as "practical unix security",
"improving UNIX security",internet worm, race condition
to gain root permission, phrack(25), CERT, etc.  I heard
that there exists some references circulated among the 
SAs only, such as Neil Gorsuch mailings, right ?
I doubt if there any way to get some ?
