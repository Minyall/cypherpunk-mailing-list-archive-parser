That's not really too meaningful.  Our Constitution provides for
protection against unlawful search and seizure (comments on the
reality of this to alt.flame, please :-).  Does the draft Russian
constitution forbid *all* tapping of mail, phones, etc?  I doubt it.
So that basically gives them the same protection we (nominally) have,
and our government seems quite happy with Key Escrow.
