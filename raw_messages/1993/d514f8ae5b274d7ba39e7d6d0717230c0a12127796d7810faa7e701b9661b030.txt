For those into such things, it might be worthwhile to check out
the articles on the last page of Science News, Vol. 144, No. 9,
August 28, 1993. Interesting tidbits are "...computer scientist
Dorothy E. Denning..." and mention of the panel that evaluated
SKIPJACK.

(Isn't Denning a lawyer turned ersatz cryptography expert? Or do
I have her confused with some other "expert"?)
