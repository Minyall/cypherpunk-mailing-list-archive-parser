it would be nice it remailers accepted MIME multipart messages then procesed
each separately thus I can "queue" up outgoing email into a single letter
to a remailer.   Another side is it a remailer would queue up mail whose
desination was another remailer and sent it a digest/MIME multipart format
thus making traffic analysis more more difficult.
