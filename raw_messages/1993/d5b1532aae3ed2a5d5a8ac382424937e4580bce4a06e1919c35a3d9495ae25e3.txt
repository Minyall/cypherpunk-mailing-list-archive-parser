Change-making machines also do a test to see if the ink used to print the
money is magnetic (on real money it is magnetic, however copier toner is
not), as well as shine a UV light to see if the paper glows (most
chemically whitened paper glows under UV light, but U.S. currency paper
does not). 

If you use non-chemically whitened paper and put MICR (magnetic) toner
into the copier, you can VERY EASILY fool the change machines.  Trust me
on this one :)
