Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension(s)...

It provides a simple framework for sending typed body parts in
RFC822 mail.  One popular use for this is multimedia, but it can
also be used to send binaries, references to ftp-able files, etc.

It also provides an ideal framework for incorporating message
encryption and authentication into rfc822 message.
