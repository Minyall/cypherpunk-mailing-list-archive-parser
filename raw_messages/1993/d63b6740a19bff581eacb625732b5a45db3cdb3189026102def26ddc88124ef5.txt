Have you read the article in _The New Republic_, titled "Mitch Kapor: Data
Highway Guru"?  It's been conveniently electronified and is included in
O'Reilly's _Global Network Navigator_ hyperzine, even.  (Mail info@gnn.com
for details.)

This quote's well within fair use size, given the size of the article:

   Kapor supports a nationwide fiber grid, and sees ISDN as a transitional
   step, not a substitute. Still, he does oppose big government financing
   for fiber, and this financing did seem a live prospect in January,
   after Gore's ambitious campaign rhetoric. Gore now says he was
   misinterpreted and had never envisioned a big government role. In any
   event, the interest in ISDN stoked by EFF and Markey helped end
   discussion of any such role.

I highly encourage you all to give the article a look; since GNN is free,
anyway...
