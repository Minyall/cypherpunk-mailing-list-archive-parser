Building boards from scratch always sounds a lot cheaper than it is.
You'll find it hard to build any kind of electronics for less than $126 5.
The manufacturing cost almost always exceeds the component cost, and
you always needs l    lots of little components that you didn't think of
at first (miscellaneous glue logic, power supply, enclosure, etc.).
