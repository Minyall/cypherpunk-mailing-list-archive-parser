	 The PGP feature that a key doesn't have to belong to the True Name of
	 an entity is a big plus in my book; otherwise, we'd have no Wonderer,
	 no deadbeat, and no S. Boxx.

It is, of course, worth noting that the PEM specs make explicit
provisions for aliases; it's just up to some issuing agency to
decide to issue them.  And if no one wants to -- well, no one has
to sign an anXXXX address's key, either.
