[Thanks for your hospitality last weekend.  The following is a form
letter--EH]

The cypherpunks list is for discussions on implementing cryptography.
To mail to the whole list, send mail to

	cypherpunks@toad.com

Every mail message sent to this address will be forwarded to everyone
on the list.  Make sure that the message you wish to send is
appropriate for such a broad delivery.


If you want to be added or removed from the cypherpunks list, or have
any other questions which pertain to list management, send mail to

	cypherpunks-request@toad.com

I don't manage the list from my regular account, so such mail which
ends up in my ah.com account will just get you another copy of this
file.
