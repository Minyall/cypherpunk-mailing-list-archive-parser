	Aren't these the same thing?  TTFN!

Sorry; typo on my part.  What I meant to say was "No, I am not arguing
that free speach is bad."  Mr. Metzger was putting words in my mouth
when claimed that I was saying that.

Anonymity and free speach are *NOT* the same thing.  As I posited in an
earlier message, which no one has yet to comment on, those two concepts
are not the same thing.  

Sorry for the typo; in my outrage that he would stoop to such depths to
make his point, and what I meant to say and what I actually typed
weren't the same thing.
