The US Gov policy for the disposal of any media that has been used to
store classified data is:

wipe  -- demagnatize with a *massive* demag unit
grind -- toss in a thing that'd make ground chuck out of godzilla
incenerate -- at some amazingly high temperature.

The media is treated as if it had classified data until after step #3.
