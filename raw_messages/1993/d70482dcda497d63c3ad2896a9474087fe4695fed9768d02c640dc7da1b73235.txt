Mr Rides;

Your rudeness is exceeded only by your apparent incapacity to read.

As has been stated, quite clearly, no one is doubting that such systems
exist. The "none exist" in the last paragraph refers to REASONS FOR THIS
PRACTICE, not to the number of sites practicing it.

As was said, the "From:" field satisfies the stated requirement without
the need for autosignatures. The notion of an automatic footer when automatic
headers exist already that satisfy the identification requirement is without
merit.
