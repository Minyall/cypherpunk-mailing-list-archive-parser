But to realy get PGP going (or PEM for that matter) will require
wide spread key distribution.  It's clear that such distribution
mechanisms are not going to arise out of any "respectfull" institutions
mostly because of the legal entanglements they present.

Perhaps the time has come for "alt.pgp.keyrings".  A standard format
for postings could allow them to be automatically added to global
keyrings at usenet sites everywhere.  Several security issues will
have to be addressed before this can work.
