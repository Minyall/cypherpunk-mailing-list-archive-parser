I *never* had a penet account.  I sent mail to cypherpunks, and I was
magically allocated an ID.  When was I supposed to set my password?

BTW, this has happened for both accounts I use regularly, immediately
after I sent mail to the lists from those accounts.  The two
occurrences were days apart.

I think the only solution for this problem is to make id allocation
*not* be automatic.  I should have to explicitly request an id to send
through the remailer.
