True.  However, there are some fairly general attacks on
congruential PRNGs, and I wouldn't be willing to place much of a
prize on the unbreakability of schemes such as the above.  There
are simple techniques whose security is better tested.

I'm hardly the person to ask, but here's a simple one:
  Given a cryptohash function hash(), and a key K,
  generate your series S as S_i = hash(K+i).
There are plenty of other games you can play with a secure hash
function.  They have a practical advantage over PRNGs built on
top of ciphers: there's no problem exporting them.  There are
also "pure" cryptographically-strong RNGs, but I don't know
anything about them.  (The name "Blum-Blum-Shub" springs to
mind, but how could it not?)
