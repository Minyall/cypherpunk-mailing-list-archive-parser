There is a new Usenet group that some on this list might be interested
in.  It's called

	alt.privacy.anon-server

This group seems to have been created as a spillover for the debate on
anonymity in news.admin.policy.  My nntp server has seen less than 100
articles to date.

I would encourage those in this group who have strong opinions to
participate in this new forum, as it seems the advocates of strong
privacy are not so numerous as they are here.
