Well, I learned about the RSA algorithms in 18.063 (Introduction to
Algebraic Systems), which is a required mathematics course at MIT for
an undergraduate CS degree.  It is normally taken by sophomores and
juniors.  MIT isn't exactly a "common" school, but it's certainly
academia.  Unfortunately, there is no textbook for this course.

Public Key Cryptosystems are also discussed in the textbook
(Introduction to Algorithms, Corman/Leiserson/Rivest, MIT Press) for
6.046 (Introduction to Algorithms), but are not discussed extensively
in the class.

As I know foreign nationals who have graduated, they must have taken
these courses.
