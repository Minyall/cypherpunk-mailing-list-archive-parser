It's compressed with the gnu utility gzip, as Tim May and Paul Goggin have
pointed out.

However, as they failed to mention, soda at least will decompress .gz files
on the fly.  If you want to pull down the file "xxxx.yyyy.gz", issue the
command "get xxxx.yyyy" (i.e. leave off the .gz suffix) and soda will unzip
it for you as it ftp's it down.
