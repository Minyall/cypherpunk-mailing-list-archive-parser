Phonecard-only account: minor inconvenience to support a major principle.
As far as I'm concerned, "convenience" is the biggest hook that Big Bro has
to use on us these days, but it only works if we're lazy enough to go for
it.  So sign with Working Assets and write them a note telling them you want
to see a phonecard-only option soon, and chances are they'll be responsive
if they get enough of those.  Especially if they're getting them from people
who used to have accounts with teh Big Three.
