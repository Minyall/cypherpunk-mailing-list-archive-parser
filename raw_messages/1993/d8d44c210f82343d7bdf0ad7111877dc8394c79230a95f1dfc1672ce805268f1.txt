Since I announced my intention to re-establish the full anon.penet.fi
service, I have received several messages with very valuable and useful
ideas. I just want to clarify my situation. What I'm doing now is to
simply re-establish the old service, without any changes/improvements
(except for an AUP-free connection and a faster box). This gives me time
to work on the improved Mk II with support for PGP, multiple ID's,
selectable double/single blind etc.

I expect to bring up Mk II as penet.anonymous.net this fall, but I need
some time to implement the stuff, write documentation etc., and I have
to take care of my "daytime" jobs as well. Somebody has to pay for all
that new hardware and that international connection... Not mentioning my
rent ;-)
