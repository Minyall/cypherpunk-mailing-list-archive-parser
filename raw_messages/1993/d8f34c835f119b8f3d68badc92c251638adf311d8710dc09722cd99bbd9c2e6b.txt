KNO3+sugar works fine.

By weight.

The iron oxide you get from ceramics supply places is plenty fine enough.
DO NOT ball mill the aluminum, it can explode.  If you're not a minor, chem
supply places should be willing to sell you 200-mesh Al, which works fine.

>7) don't tamp it! - it needs that O2 between the flakes of powder.

Not as far as I know.

Personally I'd rather use some sort of cryptographic file system,
with the key stored in volatile memory.  Connect the power switch
to your perimeter sensors and you're safe.  Thermite sounds macho
but the reality is messy and dangerous.  Do you really want to
risk a false alarm?
