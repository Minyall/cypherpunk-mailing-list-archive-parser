Is there some reason that all these people are unsubscribing to the list? 
It's getting quite annoying. To anyone who wishes to unsubscibe, please 
do so to cypherpunks-request@toad.com, I do believe that's the correct
format. I already know why your unsubscribing, you don't have to tell me 
either of the two reasons.
