   Found: a (Philadelphia) City Paper review of Covert Culture Sourcebook,
which closed out with:
   
"Debating the "cutting", or rather "covert" edge, is beginning to seem as
silly as labeling bands "alternative," since so much of it is becoming
more and more chic. Still, it's not as if mainstream-king Jesse Helms
(scapegoat for all ultra-conservatives that he is) will pick up this book
and say, "Hmmm, maybe I _will_ subsribe to Future Sex...."

(review written by Margit Detweiler, who is no doubt a tentacle.)
