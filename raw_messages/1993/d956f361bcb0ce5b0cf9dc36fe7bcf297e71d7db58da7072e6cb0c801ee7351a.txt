Outdial services: we most certainly will as soon as we install our first
digital exchange (Community Dialtone; email me for more if you're
interested).  Now we've got a bit of a quandary here, what if someone uses
it to make bomb threats or such?  So I was thinking, save the CDR data on
that and make it available under court order?  What's the general consensus
of opinion here as to our responsibility in these areas?

More on outdial services: if you want to set up your own, I can provide a
Teltone M-106 adaptor, for which you'll need a 24-volt key system power
supply and some 8-pin phone hardware and two lines.  Dial in on one,
connect, and out on the other.  We have a bunch of these in stock right now;
I gave some to some friendly folks for setting up a service, but they
haven't yet.  So maybe giving them away means the price is too low...?
Okay, send me $200 for one, or tell me you're definitely committed to using
it once you have it.   (gg@well.sf.ca.us)
