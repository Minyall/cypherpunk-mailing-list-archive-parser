This is a very interesting thread. But should university academicians working
for state-supported institutions be subject to the same constraints on privacy
and freedom from arbitrary search and seizure in their email and computer files
as high federal governmental officials? I submit that the amount of (real or
potential) oversight should be somehow proportional to the potential for harm
or abuse of power available to the individual involved. Surely Ollie North
or Richard Nixon had much greater abilities to subvert the democratic process
or otherwise break the law than Professor Smith of the Chemistry Dept. of 
State U.
