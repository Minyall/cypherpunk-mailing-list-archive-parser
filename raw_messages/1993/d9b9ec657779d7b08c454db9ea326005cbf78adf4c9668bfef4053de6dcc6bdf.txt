	It is, and I think that aspect merits discussion.  I'd simply
like to see it occur in some other venue, where I can avoid it more
easily.

	I just nearly signed off cypherpunks (and many good people
did) because the list was clogged with pointless flaming.  I don't
want to see it happen again, and trying a bit of restriction based on
technical content is one way to do that.

	Look at it this way: there are n places (alt.privacy,
alt.security, extropians, sci.crypt) where you political types can
flame merrily away.  Where can I go for a rest from the flames?  Let
cypherpunks be that place.  I'd like to see only high-quality
technical posts, and occasional well-thought out commentary and
pointers to the political developments elsewhere.

	I'm tired of the terrible tyranny of the voluble, where the
debate becomes controlled by those with nothing better to do than type
first and think later (if ever).  Not that I mean to imply that's what
your doing -- I'm just gun-shy.


	Cheers,

P.s.	Some people get very upset if you quote private email
publically without permission.  I'm not one of those people, but I
thought I'd let you know before you actually meet one.
