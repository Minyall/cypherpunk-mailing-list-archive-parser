Uploading a GIF to a BBS is definitely a different issue from those raised
by ECPA, which has to do with electronic mail. For one thing, presumably
an uploaded GIF is not a private message, so there's no reason for the
sysop or anyone else not to look at it.

In a child-porn case, the sysop may be arrested, but his criminal
liability will likely depend on whether he knows about the image and his
knowledge can be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.

Nothing I have written here should be construed as telling sysops they
can't look at a) public files on their systems, and b) private files on
their systems that aren't communications.
