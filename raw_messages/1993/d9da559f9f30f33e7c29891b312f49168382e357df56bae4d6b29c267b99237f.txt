I uploaded the package Circ.tar.Z
which is the latest version of my encryption protocol
for use on top of IrcII clients, to soda.berkeley.edu
in ~ftp/pub/cypherpunks/incoming.  I have also sent
Eric the description of the package.  It has so far
not moved to a normal directory (why?).  Oh well I
was going to wait before announcing it, but you can get
it from this directory now.
(I am having technical difficulties posting it to
comp.sources.misc so far.  Still working on it )
