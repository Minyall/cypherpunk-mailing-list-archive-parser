Are there enough Cypherpunks in the Midwest to have a meeting, no matter how
small?  I've been following the list (rarely posting) for quite a while now,
but I'd like to discuss these issues in person, and maybe feel a little less
isolated here in Ohio.

E-mail me back directly if there is any interest.
