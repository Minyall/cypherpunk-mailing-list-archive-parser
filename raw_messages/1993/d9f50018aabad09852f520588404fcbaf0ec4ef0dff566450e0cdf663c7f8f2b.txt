Punksters,

Ron McCoy asked about the 1-900 number I posted some time ago.
The number is 1-900-STOPPER.

Though I originally mentioned STOPPER, I would recommend that the
better solution is to use a pre-paid calling card.  Several
companies offer them, including AT&T (buy them at AT&T Phone
Stores) and Western Union (buy them at authorized Western Union
agents).  They both charge you about sixty cents per minute for
US domestic calls (more for overseas).  They come in various
denominations ($5, $10, $20, etc.)

To use them, you dial a special 800 number.  When you get a beep,
you dial in the card's unique serial number.  When you get a
second dial tone, you dial the area code and phone number you
wish to call.  Depending upon the card you have, there will be
some method for determining how much time/money you have left
after each call.

Since I have not yet found out whether or not the issuers retain
*your* phone number (captured by ANI), or for how long, it would
be prudent to use the cards at payphones for any highly sensitive
communications.
