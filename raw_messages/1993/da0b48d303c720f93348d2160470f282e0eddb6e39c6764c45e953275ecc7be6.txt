Yes, you can get Thorium from lamp nets.  A simpler way is to get it from
welding rods.  They are 40% thorium.  More than one unsespecting lab
technician has welded together an ultrasensitive detector with them, only
to find it not working for some reason <grin>

Vercotti: I was terrified of him.  Everyone was terrified of Doug.  I've seen
          grown men pull their own heads off rather than see Doug.  Even
          Dinsdale was frightened of Doug.
Interviewer: What did he do?
Vercotti: He used sarcasm.  He knew all the tricks, dramatic irony,
          metaphor, bathos, puns, parody, litotes and satire.
