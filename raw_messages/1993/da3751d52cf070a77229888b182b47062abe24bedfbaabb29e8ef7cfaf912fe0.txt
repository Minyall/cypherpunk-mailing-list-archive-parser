I take this with a grain of salt; see below.

I am not surprised that they find this interesting; David Chaum has
patented all the observer protocols.

Having read these protocols in the original, I can say this is not
much of an advantage.  The observer protocols are tremendously
expensive computationally.  Anything you build on top of it won't be
any faster.
