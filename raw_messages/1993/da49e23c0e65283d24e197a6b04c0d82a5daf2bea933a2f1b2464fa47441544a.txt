   group-name@ucbvax.berkeley.edu *  (blocked from non-bky sites)
   group-name@cs.utexas.edu
   group-name@pws.bull.com

For the utexas server in particular, you need to put a subject line in
the pasted header like so:
 
::
Request-Remailing-To: alt-test@cs.utexas.edu
Subject: this is a test
Organization: Organization name you desire
 
[body]
 
 
* Note that some of these require trans-literation of periods to dashes
in the newsgroup name; others do not.  Ucbvax is supposed to block
mail from non-Berkely sites; it _might_ work from these Cypherpunks
remailers:
 
   1: hh@pmantis.berkeley.edu
   2: hh@cicada.berkeley.edu
   3: hh@soda.berkeley.edu
