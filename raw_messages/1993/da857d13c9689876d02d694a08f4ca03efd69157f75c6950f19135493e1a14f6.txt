About NSA assistant director Dr. Clint Brooks:

This is why it is _imperative_ that Cypherpunks develop secure
voice communication systems, to kill Clipper market share.

Of course, the assault weapon issue is, for the most part, a bogus
attempt to grab rifles.  Semi-auto long weapons do not actually
show up in the crime stream with any regularity, there are millions
of legally owned rifles that are never used in crime, and anti-gun
groups are using people's inexperience with semi-auto weapons and
crime statistics to achieve their ends.
