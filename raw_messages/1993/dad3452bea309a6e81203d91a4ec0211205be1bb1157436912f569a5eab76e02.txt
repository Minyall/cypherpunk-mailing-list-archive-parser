Re: vincrypt package blatherings

Can someone post the addresses of this company so that product
literature might be ordered?

I'm tempted to do a consumer education article exposing the danger of
secret and unreviewed ciphers, non-trustable encryption packages, etc.
It looks like these folks are prime candidates.
