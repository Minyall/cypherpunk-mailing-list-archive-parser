Evidently I mis-interpreted his exact meaning in his statement, but if I
remember correctly, wasn't one of the original mail messages along this line
stating that any mail system which included a signature or identification
automatically was broken?  The point being is this is a common example
of how this is used, and that if an anonymous poster comes from such a site,
his sig would close the search area greatly if not removed.  So this
appears to me to be a good point in favor of signature stripping.
