I read mail and news offline, but preprocess mail from this list and
the IMP list by using Berkely mail to quickly scan message headers
and delete mail from CERTAIN PEOPLE before downloading.  Since there
are some useful posts from penet.fi, and Detweiler uses different
"names," I find the phrase "an ID that will live in infamy" mnemonically
useful in zapping his rants as quickly as possible.

Interesting coincidence that his ID corresponds to a major date in
the history of cryptography...he'd probably regard it as Divine
Confirmation of his Messianic role...:-)
