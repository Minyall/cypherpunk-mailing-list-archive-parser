The voice at the other end laughed and said "This wouldn't happen to
be YOUR phone number, would it?".

I had to laugh back, because it wasn't.

This is a great way to find out just how much information they really
are getting about you.

I work for a company with several hundred employees, and when I
called, it recited the company's main switchboard number.  Without my
company's cooperation, there'd be no way for trace a particular call
back to me.  Does our phone system even log 800 number calls?  I don't
know.
