That's not too risky for graphics, since many scanned pictures aren't
based on raw A/D converter output; they've been processed and squashed down
to some smaller number of bits.  A more serious concern is compressibility -
a real image file is probably more compressible than a file with the
low-order bit replaced by a crypto-bit, since the real data has moderate
correlation and the crypto-bits are random.  I doubt the Feds will immediately
start looking to see if you're shipping GIF files that have significantly
worse compression than average, but they'd probably find something if they did it.
