Several people have asked about anonymous posting given that the utexas
gateway is blocking (some?) cypherpunks remailers.

Another possibility is to use Julf's anonymous remailer in Finland.  I'm not
sure what groups it posts to but I'm pretty sure it includes sci.crypt and
most of the alt groups.

For more security, you can mail to it from my remailer at
hfinney@shell.portal.com, and probably other cypherpunks remailers as well.
I'm pretty sure my other remailer, hal@alumni.caltech.edu, will work too.

Send mail of the form:

========================= cut ====================
::
Request-Remailing-To: alt.privacy@anon.penet.fi

This is a post to alt.privacy.
========================= cut ====================

This should work.

You can also use PGP encryption; encrypt that message above with the PGP
public key of my remailer, add the header:

::
Encrypted: PGP

and a blank line before the -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE----- line, and send
it to the remailer.  You can chain through a bunch of cpunks remailers
using Karl's scripts for higher security.
