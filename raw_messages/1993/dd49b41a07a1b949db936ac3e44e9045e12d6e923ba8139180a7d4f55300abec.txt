It should be a secret key algorithm, and be able to hanlde blocks of at least 
256 characters in length.  Keysize isn't as important as the type of encryption
being used.  Something that is reasonably secure such as IDEA or DES is 
preferable to a function that just XORs everything.  

I'm sure if I was a more patient person I could download a few megs of source 
from the net and pore through it to find what I'm looking for.  I was hoping 
that someone on this list could be of assistance and save me the trouble.  
Thanks.
