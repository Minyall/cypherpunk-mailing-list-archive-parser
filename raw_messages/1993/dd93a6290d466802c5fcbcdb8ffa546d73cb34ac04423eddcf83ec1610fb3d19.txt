well from what I have read, an observer watched as one of the members
loaded a program, called a local telephone system, (the utility was a phone
utility produced by the phone company) and then whala he could hear the 
people voices or if data he could watch it scroll down his menu.  I was
amazed when I heard this.  No tech available but I thought I should
mention that it was a hardware utility available through the modem.
