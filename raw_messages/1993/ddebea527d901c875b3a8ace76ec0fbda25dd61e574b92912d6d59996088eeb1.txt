Punksters,

I was just watching cartoons on TV with my granddaughter.  I
almost missed a commercial that is right up our alley.  Casio has
come out with something called, "My Magic Diary."  It's a kids'
version of the electronic pocket planner.

What caught my attention was its password protection of the kid's
privacy.  How subversive!  Kids can now buy an encryption product
to keep their secrets, secret.  I imagine the password system is
extremely unsophisticated, but I wouldn't be surprised if it were
parent-proof.  Sure beats the hell out of those pitiful little
traditional diaries with their oh-so-pickable "locks."

Want to raise the consciousness of the next generation?  Give "My
Magic Diaries" to the kids of your anti-privacy relatives and
acquaintances.  It will empower the kids, frustrate their parents
and help pave the way for a pro-privacy future.  Like the song
says, "Teach your children well" (or your neighbor's children).
Know any cops with kids?
