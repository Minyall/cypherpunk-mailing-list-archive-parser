I think the problem stems from the way most people initially got access
through the Internet, which was through fairly conservative affiliations
such as the military, government or academia; I've seen relatively few
military, government or academic environments that encouraged or allowed
people to go by "Black Unicorn".

Increasingly, however, people are using the Internet for solely personal
reasons, independent of such affiliations. (Which is how Fidnonet, WWIVnet,
etc. have always been.) Now, no big surprise, we have Black Unicorn, 
Wanderer, etc. I think it's a great testimoney to the rapidly increasing
diviersity of the net. (Although CERTAIN PEOPLE I'm sure will tell me that
such alleged diversity is only a PERVERTED SHAM and the number of REAL
people on the net is RAPIDLY DROPPING.)
