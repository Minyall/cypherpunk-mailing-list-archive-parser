I wonder if anyone would want to start a PGP key server dedicated only
to *real* identities. Obviously, there is no such demand with the current ones.

And please don't start with the `that would be impossible' arguments. A
key server that had the official policy `if you register here, on your
honor your legal name is what you give, under penalty of public
exposure if you are caught' would be enough for me.
