Stanton:

Actually, I think you're missing Loyd's point here. Basically, we 
really wanted to set up an anonymous remailer here at Illuminati
Online. We encountered opposition from a certain individual on the
grounds that "anonymous posts can destroy civil conversation" and
individuals, groups and lists "should have the right to easily 
filter out posts from anonymous remailers."

Although this is highly debatable (and I myself am opposed to it),
it has nothing to do with inflicting moderation where none 
exists now, and is rather a call for a voluntary standard for
tagging of posts that have been anonymized so that they can be 
filtered out wholesale. (Rather than the retail filtering that
I'm sure goes on already in some quarters.)

The advantage of this is that if a group or list or individual
decides they want nothing to do with anonymous postings in general,
they need not see them. The chief disadvantage in my mind is that
it poisons the infrastructure against the strong pseudonymous 
entities that I think will be key to an underground digital economy.
Other defects will be left as an exercise to the reader. :-)
