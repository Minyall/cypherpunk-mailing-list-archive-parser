I agree with sentiments against a direct democracy for all the reasons
given and some extra reasons:  laws should have expiration dates and
a better feedback process is needed to determine whether particular
laws are beneficial (hmm, sounds like PPL.)  

The real problem seems to be a general lack of education and wealth, but
there is always the bell curve--such things will always be unevenly
distributed.

However, tracking proposed laws via the net creates the possibility
of anyone being able to have a cheap lobbyist--the stuff can
be posted and filtered, etc.  This has nothing to do with people
proposing stupid laws whenever they feel like it (this would require
more significant legal changes).
