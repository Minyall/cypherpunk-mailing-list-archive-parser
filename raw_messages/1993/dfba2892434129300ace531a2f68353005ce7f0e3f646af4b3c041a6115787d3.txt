This came from a conversation I had with a friend of mine.  This guy is usually
on the ball when it comes to technology, so I'll ask him for a refrence.  He's
fairly reliable when it comes to discovering weaknesses in systems, and is
particularly knowledgeable in unix and OS/2, so this sort of thing is something
that is of concern to him as well.  He's worked with a lot of comm stuff as
well.

However, it could wind up as a rumor, so let me ask him and find out where
he found out.
