Greetings,
   On the EFF Conference on the WELL,  some people over there who are NOT
in the cypherpunks list want to get the question list we generated at the
last meeting.

   John G.  posted it but no revisions were done.   Is someone going to be
adding more stuff to the list,  and is it OK for me to cross post thje list
into the EFF Conference on the WELL??

Thanx
JD
