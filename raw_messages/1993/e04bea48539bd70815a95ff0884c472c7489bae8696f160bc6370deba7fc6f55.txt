I'm really at a loss how to respond to this lunatic.  I hope
the following doesn't just stoke his boilers more, but on
a worldwide public forum I don't think I can let something
like that go unanswered.  Anybody out there with good advice
(legal, tactical, or otherwise), I'd greatly appreciate it.

Why Mr. Detweiler, that's mighty flattering of you!

I'd be even more flattered by Detweiler's singling
me out, if he wasn't also making death threats and 
accusations of criminal violations against several people who 
have recently disagreed with him, trying to track down our
physical locations, and otherwise doing his best to scare the
shit out of net users with his digital stalking.  No, Mr. 
Detweiler, I'm not "pseudospoofing", but with
nutcases like you on the net I sure as hell wish I was.
