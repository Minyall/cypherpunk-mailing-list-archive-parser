CPs,
 
I am working on a revision of my PGPcompose program,
and I would like to know if anyone knows a good way
to get bsd mail to call a program when it is going to
send mail (i.e. when you type 'mail user' or when
a message is replied to.)
 
So far, it (my app) can be called as follows:
comp -s <subject> -c <Cc list> -b <Bcc list> <recipient>
these arguments can be given in any order, as long
as the recipient is at the end.  It will prompt for the
information that is not provided at teh command line.
 
I just need to get mail to spit a subject and a recipient
out, so I can call this app.  it will do the rest.
 
Also, is there a fast and easy way to get mail to give me
the expanded version of a .mailrc alias from the command
line?  I read the man, and it does not look possible.
 
thanks,
