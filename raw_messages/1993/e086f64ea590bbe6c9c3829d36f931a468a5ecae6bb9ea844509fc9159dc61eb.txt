Well, I have to say that I love this idea!  I have a few suggestions, tho.  How
about we take a copy of the public domain bios source, or disassemble one 
ourselves.  We hack the code a bit...  Then we burn a new prom to install into
our machines.  AND WE EPOXY THE MOTHER TO THE DAMNED BOARD!  We build a card to
stick in our machine which receives a radio signal which contains a decription
key to be supplied to the bios hacks mentioned above.  So we use a protable
radio transmitter to send the password to our machine.  Our bios waits for this
password for use in decripting the filesystem.  If the bios doesn't get this
password, it trashes the cmos and does whatever other mean things it wants to.
Perhapse part of the card could have login in it which would short the power-
supply to the memory bus... shit!  Hypothetically, we have two passwords for
our system, one for the Feds, and one for Honest people.  When the bios receives
the Fed-password, it acts normally, (for a time?) except it also unleashes a 
*nasty* virus from within it's own rom!  This would take "care" of the Fed's 
data in adition to screwing up the machine.

Just my two cents....
