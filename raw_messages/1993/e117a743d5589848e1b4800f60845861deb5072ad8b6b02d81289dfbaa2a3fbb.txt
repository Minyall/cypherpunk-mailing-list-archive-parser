I agree.  I was relieved to read a sci-fi which wasn't socialistic.

I have to differ here.  These mutli-national (all-powerfull?) corporations were
held powerless by those with the technology to do so.  This is the essence of 
why I have developed strong computer skills; technology is power.  Power to 
protect yourself from many threats.

Well, I don't think mankind will ever shed all forms of behavioral control.  Man
has an inherent set of norms which I doubt he will shed, and remain civilized.
