I argue that encrypted hard disks should be encrypted at the transfer
level.

Never fear.  Layered encryption is the way of the future.  One layer
of encryption for the disk as a whole, another for the users.  When
the stuff gets cheap enough, it will be everywhere.

The question is "Who is your opponent?"  If you are concerned with the
users against each other, then use user level encryption.  If you are
concerned with the outside world against the machine, then encrypt at
the disk controller or device driver level.  If you are concerned
about both, then do both.
