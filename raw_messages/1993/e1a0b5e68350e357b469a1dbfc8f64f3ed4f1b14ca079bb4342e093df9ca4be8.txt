    Is this hearsay, innuendo or fact? If fact, what can you site as
    reference to support your statement? If you know this to be fact,
    please cite your references and provide as much detail as possible.

This was based on a verbal conversation at Interop with someone from
uunet, from whom the tapes are purchased.  I or they could be
mis[led|informed|remembering], but if you really care, ask uunet.
