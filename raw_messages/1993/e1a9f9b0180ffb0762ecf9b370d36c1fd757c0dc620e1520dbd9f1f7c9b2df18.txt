If you plan to do this yourself, I can guarantee you, 100%, that
*NONE* of your work will go into the next release of PGP!

The work you suggest is underway.  Please be patient, for if you
did look at the PGP code, you would see what spaghetti it really
is!  If you remain patient, and wait for the next release, then
maybe things will be a lot better for you!)
