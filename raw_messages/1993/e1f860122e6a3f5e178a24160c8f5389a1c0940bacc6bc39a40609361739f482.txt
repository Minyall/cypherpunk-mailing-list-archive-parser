This sounds like the tricks he and Mark Lottor showed off at Hackers
last year, according to the first issue of Wired.  Of course he was
anonymous there; I guess Wired didn't offer him immunity.

I'd like to know more about Shimomura's testimony -- was he just
showing off, or is he selling us out?  Sounds like both.
