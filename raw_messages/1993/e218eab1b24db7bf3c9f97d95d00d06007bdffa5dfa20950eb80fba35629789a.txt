Strong words that, IMHO, put way too much faith in the argument that a
"restrictive" work environment inevitably crushes individualism and
creativity.  Any organization, .gov or !.gov, that:  

  *  recruits the best and the brightest and pays them well; 
  *  gives access to substantial computing/financial resources and academic    
     knowledge; 
  *  fosters team-building, creativity, and competition *within the group*; 
  *  rewards achievement and provides status *within the group*; and 
  *  provides other movitivation, be it patriotism/pride/whatever, 

will produce more than its fair share of advances in a field.  Given a
concentrated environment and an advanced set of tools, it seems improbable
that any group, regardless of organizational affiliation, could be
outperformed *on an evolutionary basis* by a loose band of academicians and
private researchers with irregular contact.  

Revolutionary change is impossible to predict, though I feel that no
organization with sufficient resources would throw away promising methods
without thorough investigation.  Even so, I do personally believe that
private individuals may have an edge in revolutionary research. 
Unfortunately, both statements are unverifiable.

The key point to remember is that motivation is relative - regardless of
our personal opinions, if someone seeks status within a group then more
"restrictive" environments are not a hindrance to creativity.
