This list is becoming completely unreadable! First the POISON PILL and now
PGP IN FIDO just seem to go on and on. And how many before that?
(Troglodyte mind-rapists, etc) I've got about a meg of utter crap in my
email file, most of it unread or skimmed. If people want to fight, why not
do it in private mail, back up your positions, and then post your
conclusions if you manage to come up with any. Please don't CC all your
flames to the list. And please don't echo a three-page post to add one
line of comments to it.

What happened to all the idealism? Total privacy, cryptophones, digital
cash, zero-knowledge cooperation, bringing down governments and setting the
world free? That's what the list is for, not mindless flaming.

Aargggh! MikeIngle@delphi.com
