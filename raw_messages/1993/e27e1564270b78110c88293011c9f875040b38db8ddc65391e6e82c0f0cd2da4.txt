If all you're worried about is entrapment, you need only ask the person
in question if s/he works for any law enforcement or surveillance agency.
If they lie, then anything after that is entrapment.

I'm not a lawyer but I learned this from my masseuse in SLC UT, where
mixed-gender massage is considered a "sex act for hire" and she was
constantly subject to entrapment.
