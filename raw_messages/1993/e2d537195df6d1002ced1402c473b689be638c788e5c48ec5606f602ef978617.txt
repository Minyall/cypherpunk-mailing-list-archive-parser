I just wanted to let everyone know that another penet.fi-style
anonymous service has been set up.  It works the same as anon.penet.fi
did for anonymous mail, but it only allows anonymous posting to about
ten newsgroups.  For information, send a message to
"anonymus+info@charcoal.com" (yes, anonymous should be misspelled).
