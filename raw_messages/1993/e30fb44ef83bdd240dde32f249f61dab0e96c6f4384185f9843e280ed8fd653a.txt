  I'd just copy everything to tape as I'd been doing for years. You don't
need anything new to tap the phone line to pick up the data. After that,
you just need to figure out the baud rate, parity, and data compression
(which could be done by trial and error pretty quickly) and then just
play the tape into a modem that was set up correctly. 

  Unless I'm missing something, it seems pretty simple.
