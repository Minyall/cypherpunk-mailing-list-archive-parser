I was doing some password ginding a few days ago (I do this as a favor for
a few people, and I sometimes  throw passwd files from friends systems
into the "soup").  Recently I cracked a friends dialup slip password, it was
a hard choice on if I should "slip in" or not (the possiblities of the
practcal jokes was endless).  If I was attampting a malicious attack or
to compromise system integrity for future attacks

btw: if I "sliped in" I would have just run changed their Xwindow backgrounds
    to say they should correct the situation (nothing malicious).
