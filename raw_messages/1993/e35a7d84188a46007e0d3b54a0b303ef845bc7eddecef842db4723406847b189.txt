So what if some small time drug dealers are using them.  One thing is for sure,
the Big Time drug dealers, (the ones with the ships, planes, and enough money
to finance the transport of tons of contraband) do not, and will not be using
them.  As far as dening payphone service in "high crime" (read black areas),
well the information kiosk would tend to solve the problem of vandalism, so
what's the big deal?  An for all you supposed libertarian types, I'm sure there
is some enterprising person or family who will be willing to take the
perceived risks with operating such an establishment to get the potential
financial reward.
