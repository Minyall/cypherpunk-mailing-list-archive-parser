     Alright, I hear you, Mr. automatic sig (you really ought to
append it only when you want it).  I implemented a "kill line" in
my remailer.  All you have to do is put the line "--ignore--" exactly
as that, no spaces after it, no spaces before it, just a line precisely
like that and neither it nor the rest of the message will be put into
the outgoing message.  Edgar, you can test it by sending to my remailer
on this account.
