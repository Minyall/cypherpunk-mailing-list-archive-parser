I know you want to do this with UNIX, but Windows NT allows you do this 
quite nicely.  One of the "groups" of users is INTERACTIVE, another is 
NETWORK.  You can specifically prohibit network users from accessing a 
file by adding "NETWORK - No Access" to the p
ermissions list in File Manager.  I do this with secring.pgp and 
secring.bak, on top of the restriction which allows only me to access 
the file.  So even if someone guesses my password, they can't snoop on 
my private key except by physically being at my machi
ne.
