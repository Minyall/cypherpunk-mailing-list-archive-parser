The SYSOP of this system posted the following enquiry to me:
 
    I've heard that there is a program to allow pgp stuff online with
    waffle; if you know of such a thing, please point me towards it.
    I'd like to be able to secure this site for people who want it.
 
I haven't heard of any such program, but if you have, please reply
by E-mail to
