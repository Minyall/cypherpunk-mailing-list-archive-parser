I have received valuable and detailed feedback on the second-draft cypherpunk
FAQ from a couple of posters.  Accordingly, I expect to post a third cut
either later today or around 8th September, on my return for California.

(I'm flying out tomorrow for the World Science Fiction Convention.  I'll meet
some of you FTF at the 5th anniversary Extropians party.)
