X-Rated movies are a huge business. I suspect cable companies would
love to broadcast them. However, there are government impediments to
transmitting them -- fears of lawsuits, FCC intervention, and criminal
charges being among them.

Of course, this is comparing apples and oranges -- when TV channels
per se cease to exist, which is inevitable, it will be difficult if
not impossible for bluenoses to detect when such services are in use.

Of course it would, BARRING LEGAL OBSTACLES. Again, as before, the
market is not currently free -- the obstacles are government created.
