NO! I was NOT trying to set up a host, I was trying to set up a CLIENT!  I
don't have source for a host, nor do I have room in my disk quota for it!  I
do, however, have source for two IRC clients, neither of which works yet.

But really Chris, I think the Clipper is more important.  Not only to the people
who read the list, but to me too.  This is the biggest reason why my time online
does not get spent hacking the IRC client into shape.

Please stop posting these messages to THIS list.
