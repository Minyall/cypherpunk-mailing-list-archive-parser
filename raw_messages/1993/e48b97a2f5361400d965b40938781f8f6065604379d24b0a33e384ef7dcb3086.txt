I have just uploaded to soda a file of code for generating random dot
stereograms, as well as the following short description file.
This is the code to which I referred a month ago or so.
I'm going to play with the code myself as soon as I have time, but
because of the expressed interest, I thought I'd give the rest of the
list a crack at it as soon as I got permission.

====================================================================
The file stereo.tar.gz holds code for generating random dot stereograms
which I discussed earlier on the list.

This code is not mine.  I received it from a friend of the man who wrote it.
She assures me that he doesn't care who uses the code or for what.
I haven't run this code myself.
