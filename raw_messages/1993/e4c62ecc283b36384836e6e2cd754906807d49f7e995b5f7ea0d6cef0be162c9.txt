     I use the following .forward file to make slocal "sort" my mail based
upon the contents of the .maildelivery file below.

-- $HOME/.forward --
| /usr/lib/mh/slocal -user nowhere
<EOF>

     You should use something like the following .maildelivery file to
tell slocal where to put the messages.

-- $HOME/.maildelivery --
#
# field	"pattern" action "command"
#
To "cypherpunks@toad.com" file ? Mail/cypherpunks

     This will file messages directed to cypherpunks to a file in your
Elm mail directory, but leave all other messages untouched.  You have
to then choose the folder "=cypherpunks" to read those messages.

     NOTE:  You need to change the path of slocal to the appropriate
path for your system.  You can find it with the whereis -b command or
the find utility.  Am I forgetting anything?
