Headline: DEMANDING THE ABILITY TO SNOOP
Afraid new technology may foil eavesdropping efforts, U.S. officials want
phone and computer users to adopt the same privacy code. The government
would hold the only key.
by Robert Lee Hotz
Times Science Writer
 
The article covers PGP, Skipjack in graphic detail (picture of Mykotronix
chip), the growth in dossiers and information requests from the Federal
Crime Info Center, and all our pet issues. This and a related article take
up more than a full page. Eric Hughes is quoted. My mail inbox was
crammed full, so I may have missed it before. If not, whoop, there it is.
