Cypherpunks,

I'm having trouble using the new remailer at utter.dis.org.  I've sent
several test messages, but have received none back.  Recently, I tried
to email to the person running the remailer (shipley@merde.dis.org?),
but my mail bounced:

I'd like to include this new remailer in the scripts, but would first
like to verify that it works...  

So Peter: I'd like to help work out any problems, but I can't reach
you at shipley@merde.dis.org (unless this is related to soda's disk
crash?)
