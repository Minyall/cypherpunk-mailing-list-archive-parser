I have shied away from any "political" action against Clipper because I am
unsure how a Canadian can help...  I would like to think that the Canadian
government will not follow the US lead, but I'm sure that its just a
matter of time.  I am open to suggestions...  How do I avoid being told
that I'm fighting "someone elses" war?
