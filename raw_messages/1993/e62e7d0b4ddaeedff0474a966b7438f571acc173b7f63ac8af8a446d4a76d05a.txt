Hi all,

I'm having problems with pgp 2.2.  I am trying to add someone's key to my ring.
I get e-mail from them, save it to a file and xfer it to my home system.  Then
I type pgp -ka <filename> to add the new stuff to my keyring.  I've even edited
the file to just include the pgp stuff.  What am I doing wrong?  
Thanx in advance.
P
