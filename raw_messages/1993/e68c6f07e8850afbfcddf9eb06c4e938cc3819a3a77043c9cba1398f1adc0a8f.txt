"once data encryption becomes illegal, searching for LSBs will become
standard procedure for datacops."

Aha, but if we can establish artistic protection for cyphertext, that will
be one more brick in the wall that keeps the censors out.  The point is to
prevent it becoming illegal in the first place.  Now so far we have one
great strategy: making crypto ubiquitous, so there is no way to get the
horses back into the barn.  I think we can benefit from additional
strategies, such as expanding into all the various areas of constitutional
protection that might be available.
