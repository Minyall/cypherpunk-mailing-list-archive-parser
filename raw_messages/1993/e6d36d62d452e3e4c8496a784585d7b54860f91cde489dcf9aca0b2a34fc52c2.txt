It seems to me that a simpler solution than challenge-response would be to
emultate the tear-sheet crypto systems and just have a series of one-shot
passwords generated.  Each time you log in, it requires the next password
from the sheet, so capturing the old one does no good (just as breaking the
one-time codes from tear sheets doesn't help).

Now if I could just figure out a simple way to do this on UNIX...
