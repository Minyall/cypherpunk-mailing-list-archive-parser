	I've seen a lot about remailers on Internet but has anyone done any
work with remailers on Fidonet, or WWIVNet style networks? I've been thinking
about a WWIVNet anonymous remailer and can easily implement one for email, but
the public postings would be much harder although I do have some ideas on that.
If anyone else out there has any ideas, or has started on this already I'd
really like to hear about it.
