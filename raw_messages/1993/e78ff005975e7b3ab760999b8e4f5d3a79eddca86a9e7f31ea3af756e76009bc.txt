With all this talk about various libraries going on, I figure I might
as well ask this:

Is there an implementation of IDEA that will let me do something like
this:

encryptedbuf = encypher (databuf, buflen, passphrase);

Where the arguments mean the obvious, and databuf can be of arbitrary
length?

If not, I may do it, but I wouldn't want to duplicate efforts :-)
