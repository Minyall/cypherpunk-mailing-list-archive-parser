Rick Adams of UUNET confirmed on the com-priv list that his
organization had been selling the FBI a usenet feed on tape.  I could
find the exact reference if you want.  I don't know for sure that the
NSA has a feed, or from whom, but it wouldn't surprise me.

However, the obvious next point is, so what?  It's a public system.
Any idiot can pay $20/month and get a public access account.  If you
say something in a news post which you wouldn't want the FBI or NSA or
whoever to see, you're the person who has done something stupid.

Tapping a news feed isn't like tapping a phone line.  It's more like
turning on the television.
