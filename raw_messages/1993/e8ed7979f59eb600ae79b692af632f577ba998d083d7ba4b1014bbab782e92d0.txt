PLEASE HELP ME LOCATE THE FOLLOWING SHAREWARE AND IT'S AUTHORS.

The following shareware was removed from Compuserve Information 
Service because a sysop feared it might be downloaded by someone 
outside of the United States and get him in trouble.

 1 DES Documentation for DESJWW.ZIP
     IBMPRO/C and C++ [P]  DESJWW.DOC

 2 Data Encryption Standard (in MSC v5.0)
     IBMPRO/C and C++ [P]  DESJWW.ZIP

 3 Knapsack Public-Key Encryption System
     IBMPRO/C and C++ [P]  KNAPSA.ZIP

 4 Confide - encryption/decryption program (DES)
     IBMSYS/File Utilities [S]  CONFID.ARC

 5 The Private Line (tm)
     IBMSYS/File Utilities [S]  TPL.ARC

 6 The Private Line Documentation

I am trying to do a survey of ALL data encryption shareware, 
especially that based on the DES or RSA algorithm (I have PGP).
