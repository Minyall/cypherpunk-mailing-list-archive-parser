Folks, part of the list volume problem is apparently that a lot of us
are skipping a lot of the messages. Sounds paradoxical, but hear me
out.

Someone asked about the Indian code talkers used in World War II, and
suggested they might be Apache or Cherokee.

Well, to date, about half a dozen responses have all pointed out they
were the famous Navajo code talkers. Nice to see such knowledge.

But the responses seem to indicate no awareness that several others
have already answered the question. And this is not a "response
cluster" phenomenon, as the answers have been straggling in for
a few days. (However, it may be that some folks are way behind in
their reading and fired off an answer when they read the first
question.)

I don't have an answer to either of these problems (people skipping
messages, people behind in reading), but both appear to be symptomatic
of an overloaded list. Eric H. tells me we're well over 500
subscribers now. Gulp!
