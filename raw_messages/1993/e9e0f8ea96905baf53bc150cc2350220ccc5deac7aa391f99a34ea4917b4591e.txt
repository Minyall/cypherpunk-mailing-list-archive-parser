    Hi Phil...
         All the reports I have seen on the widespread phone tapping and
voice recognition by the NSA allegedly was in reference to Operation HARVEST
According to private estimates immense intel value results even if the
recog phase gets 15-20% accuracy on most? speakers... for 
phrases such as Spook, espionage,drugs etc... Most of the references I saw
to HARVEST were published by the Bill of Rights foundation  in various of their
books and phamplets and reports from the Church Subcommittee hearings
on intelligence activities during the earlier abuses of COINTELPRO,
with a few references in "The Puzzle Palace" by Cliff Bamford.
I also saw some refeneces about 5 years ago in comp.dcom.telecom... as
to these kind of operations. Do they really do it??? hmm
dont know but I am not taking any chances!! :)
