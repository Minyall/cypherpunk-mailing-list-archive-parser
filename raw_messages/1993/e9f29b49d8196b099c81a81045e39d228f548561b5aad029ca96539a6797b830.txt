	 PS: Extra special thanks to Mr. Tribble for finding this. Where did you pick
	 it up?

Thanks for the thanks, but I just forwarded it.  I don't know who
originated the message.  Afterward I noted that the chatty part of the
message sounded like I had written it.  We can appropriately give
thansk to a now anonymous source :-)
