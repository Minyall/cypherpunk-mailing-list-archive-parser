Some quotes from the December 13, Ô93 issue of Newsweek:

Cover:
ÒGlobal Mafia: TheyÕre Ruthless. Stateless. High Tech. And Deadly.Ó

p. 22
  ÒAround the globe, intelligence agencies are refocusing their operations from spies to criminals.  Some of this may reflect the desire of spooks to protect their budgets in the post-cold-war world.  But the threat is real...Ó

  ÒThe first trend is the development of computer and communications technology.  Electronic fund-transfer systems can whiz billions of dollars around the globe within seconds.  Faxes and cellular telephones can be encrypted, making it all but impossible to trace calls from them.  Drug-cartel planes flying north to the United States have signal interceptors to plot radar and avoid monitoring.Ó

p. 24
  Ò...the Cali cartel treats cocaine as a business like any other (give or take the odd murder).  The cartel recently tried to lease its own satellite so the CIA and DEA couldnÕt listen in on conversations.  CaliÕs recruits are intelligent and its systems are high tech.  In one case, the DEA arrested a trafficker who had 20 computers to run his distribution network.Ó
