I still don't know about that - I think all it does is remove the
problem one step from immediately solvable.

Is that P term public knowledge (here P = 256)?  If so, the revised
equations are:

c1/2 + 1/4 = 63.75   ===> c1 = 127

c1/2 + 1/4 x1^2 + c2 = 223 + 256k  ===> c2 = -7905 + 256k

And this will yeild either c2 = -225 or c2 = 31.  The computational
expense of trying both is small.

If it does turn out that the magnitude of the constants must be less
than P, I don't think taking the mod of each coefficient obscures the
problem very much at all.  It still boils down to solving systems
of simultaneous equations, which isn't the same complexity as solving
discrete logarithms or factoring.
