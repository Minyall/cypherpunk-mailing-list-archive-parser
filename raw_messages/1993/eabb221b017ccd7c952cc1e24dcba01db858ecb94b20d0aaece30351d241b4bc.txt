Voting arguably endorses the system.  If you are vocal about why
you dont endorse the system, your refusal to vote can have alot
more impact than going to the polls.  After all, in any reasonably
large election, your vote barely counts at all, but your voice can
be heard a long way away if your saying something interesting and
your saying it loud enough.
