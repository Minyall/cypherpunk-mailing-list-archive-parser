I assume everyone saw the message from Philip Mulivor here asking for our
input on the issues related to anonymity and newsgathering. As of
Friday afternoon, I was the only one to respond.

I can't help but think that we are being dissolute in discussing
T-shirts, coffee mugs, et al when a *REAL* *LIVE* *JOURNALIST* came to
the list asking for information and got almost zero response.

If we're looking at shirts which will raise people's awareness and
provoke questions, that's great. Many of the slogans and designs,
though, will be indecipherable to anyone who's not _already_ a
cypherpunk. If these shirts are just a membership badge, like a DoD #
in *.motorcycles, then IMNSHO we're wasting our time.
