Already done so. Using MCI also, though their "Friends and Family " plan
stinks of bigbro also.  What better why to catch up with those who skip out
on their phone bills than getting the names and phone numbers of all their
"friends and family", eh?

In case any corporate spies from AT&T are reading: Not only do you lose my
phone service, but your AT&T-Paradyne branch just lost out on modem sales
too.  Which is just too bad.  AT&T-P. had THE best sysop-discount deal on
14400bps modems.  I was all ready to buy a couple of them.  Tsk tsk.
