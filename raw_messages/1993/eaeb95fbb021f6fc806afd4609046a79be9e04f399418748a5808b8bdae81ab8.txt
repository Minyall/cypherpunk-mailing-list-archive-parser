Yeah, you are correct that some cameras (especially the ones w/ CCD's) can
see IR. However they are not tuned to the lower end of the IR band as normal
IR goggles (at least the Russian tank driver pair that I have access to) and
it is possible to use a laser designator style setup (toward the lower IR end)
to defeat a normal video camera. As to turning the light off, unless you are
dealing with a complete incompetant they will bounce it off a window or a
spike reflector through a wall or roof. Another very good place to check for
these style bugs is in fireplaces.
