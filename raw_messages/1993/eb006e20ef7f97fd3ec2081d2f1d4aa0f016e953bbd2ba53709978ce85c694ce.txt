Well, this is yet to be seen.

Practically none, especially since RIPEM is already running, and
is as free as PGP. Of course, single DES is somewhat less
resistant to brute force, thus triple DES would be more
appropriate...

Oh, come on now. It looks like every fool in the world
believes now he can crack DES... Let me enlighten you:
even IF one gets a DES engine fast enough and can put
lots of those in parallel - that one still needs lots
of ahrdware/software. Which isn't very feasible today.

Agreed.
