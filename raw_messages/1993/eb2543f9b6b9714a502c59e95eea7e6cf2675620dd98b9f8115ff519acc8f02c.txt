What's overly simple about this?

I don't think anyone cared that "S. Boxx" posted pseudonymously.

Anonymity has nothing to do with this.  Nor does pseudonymity.  This
is a simple case of exploiting technical loopholes the size of
Neptune.  Unfortunately, many people give more credence than they
should to the From: line, perhaps not realizing that present
protocols were never designed for security.  An easy way of making
reality conform to expectations is to spread the use of digital
signatures.

Your examples of "harmful spoofing" are problems, but they are old
problems having nothing to do with the use of nyms.  You can't,
for example, post to alt.cyberpunk as an47351@anon.penet.fi (William
Gibson) and expect to fool anybody.  Yes, forgery is obnoxious.
But this putative offense of "pseudospoofing", of having multiple
names, is very from forgery.
