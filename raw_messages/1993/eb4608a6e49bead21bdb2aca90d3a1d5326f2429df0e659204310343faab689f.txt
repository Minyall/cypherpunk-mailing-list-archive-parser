Addendum my to previous post: the Internet commerce list is
at imp-interest@thumper.bellcore.com, presumably you can
subscribe via imp-interest-request@thumper.bellcore.com.
Great articles on electronic cash, "digital pennies",
Internet Billing Service, etc. from people intending to 
implement and use this stuff, soon.
