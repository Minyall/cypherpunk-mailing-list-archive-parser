G. Gordon Liddy, "Radio Free DC" can be reached at:

Vox: 1-800-GGLIDDY
Fax: 1-800-937GFAX

I'm going to go wash my hands now. With lots of soap.

My guess would be that Liddy and Limbaugh would both be very
happy about the Tapper chip proposal, and would recognize us
as natural enemies. Try 'em if you want, but be wary.
