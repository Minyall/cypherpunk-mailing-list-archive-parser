There is already non-pseudonymizing reply available for pseudonymous
mail.  It periodically comes up on the list, and is periodically
corrected.  The irony of the situation is that the solution was
invented on this list a few months ago.

Solution: if you send to na12345@anon.penet.fi, then your mail won't
be pseudonymized; if you send to an12345@anon.penet.fi, then your mail
will be pseudonymized.

	an = anonymous
	na = not anonymous
