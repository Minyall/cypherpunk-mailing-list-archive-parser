I heard a theory about how the government can "spy" on us by using cable
television.  somehow, according to the theory, the cable is a 2-way
transmitter, and the television, when turned on, can act like a video
camera for the government.  I do not know ANY of the specifics of this
theory, and really find it hard to believe (perhaps because I do not
have any more information)...does anyone have any information on this?
is this an appropriate inquiry for the cypherpunks mailing?


thanks a lot
