In case you missed it...Wall Street Journal of May 24, page B1 had an
article by Wm. F. Buckley on Internet anonymous messages.  The article
was about some professor who wrote a program to erase anon messages
automatically and how he got "shouted down" and withdrew his program
(it only ran on his netnews site anyway).  The analogy Buckley used
was that of self-policing coffee houses where people doing anti-social
things are shouted out by the crowd.  I guess Buckley is into anon
remailers (or at least their use as free speech devices) since he 
portrayed the guy wiping out anon messages as being anti-social.
