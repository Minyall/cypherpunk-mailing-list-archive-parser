How about a poor public key system?  What is the simplest public key
system you can invent, if you didn't care that it is trivial to break?
If the NSA can crack RSA, does that change the fact that it is a pkc?

message=99

public_key= 1/3
private_key= 3

encrypted_message= message * public_key
message= encrypted_message * private_key

Would PKP reading of their patent claims cover this pkc?  Seems overbroad!
