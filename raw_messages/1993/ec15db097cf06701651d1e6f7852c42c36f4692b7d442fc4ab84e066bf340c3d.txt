Indeed. And because LAPM uses HDLC framing over the modem, you could
be completely compatible with a regular (asynch DTE interface) V.42bis
modem on the other end of the call. But by implementing V.42bis
yourself, you would have complete control over when frames get sent,
and how large they are.
