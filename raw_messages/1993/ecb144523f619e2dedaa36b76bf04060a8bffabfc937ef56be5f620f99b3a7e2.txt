Yes. But in this case we are talking about somebody who definitely feels it is
OK to check in on other people's messages - but he only admited to it after a
very lengthy debate on a.s.a.r, that he did his best to shut down - without
replying to accusations of him eavesdropping.

I still feel a remailer operator should make his policies known up front.
Just like Karl Kleinpaste's "if you do something I consider abuse, I will
expose you" policy.
