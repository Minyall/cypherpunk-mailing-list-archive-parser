Quite likely what you heard were 9600/4800/2400bps (bits per second),
not baud.  The two are different.  2400bps compression of voice is
quite a bit beyond current GP CPUs.

Also, note that 9600 baud (V.32 carriers) are based on a 2400bps carrier.
(And if they're not, I'm sure someone will correct me.)  2400 baud modems
are based a bit rate something less than 2400bps, though I can't remember
exactly what it is right now.
