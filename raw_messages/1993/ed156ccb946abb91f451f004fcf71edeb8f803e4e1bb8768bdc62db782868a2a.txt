Any Cypherpunks planning on attending the Mid-Atlantic Anarchist
Gathering in Philadelphia this weekend?  It's running from Friday,
July 30, through Monday, August 2.  It's supposed to be a smallish
regional gathering (as opposed to a major Continental gathering, 
like Chicago '86, Minneapolis '87, Toronto '88, S.F. '89), but it's
looking like there may be way more attendees than our hosts in
Philadelphia originally anticipated.  Should be big fun.

I'm considering throwing together an ad-hoc workshop on crypto-anarchy
and related issues if there's sufficient interest at the gathering
(should have thought of this three months ago when things were being
planned, of course).
