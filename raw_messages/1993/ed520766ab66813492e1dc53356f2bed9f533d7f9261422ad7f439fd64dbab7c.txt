I thought it was pretty good.  After all, the implications of such a scheme
are widespread.  I can imagine someone posting a message to talk.politics.guns,
purporting to be from clinton@whitehouse.gov (or whatever the White House
email address is these days), saying that personally he thinks Sarah Brady
is an idiot, but that he has to go along with the Brady Bill for political
reasons, and hell, he's just an Arkansas boy who goes out behind the Oval
Office and target practices with the Secret Service staff on weekends...

Of course, along more sinister lines, someone anonymously posting death threats
to Clinton might not be caught, but the Secret Service would sure be all over
someone's system REAL FAST.  I suppose it's an interesting "denial of service"
attack against a site that you don't like...
