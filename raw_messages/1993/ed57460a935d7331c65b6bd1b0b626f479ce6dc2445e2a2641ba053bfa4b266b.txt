DC's 26oo meetings are held in the food court of a local mall.  The location
doesn't require scheduling, can be gotten to via Metro and while private
property, usually doesn't run into problems with peaceful gathering.  A National
Park would solve (for the time being) the later problem (perhaps the park in
front of the White House?).

Any other DC folks interested?
