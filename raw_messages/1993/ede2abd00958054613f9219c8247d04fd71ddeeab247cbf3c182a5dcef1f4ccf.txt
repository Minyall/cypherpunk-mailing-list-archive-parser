This seems to imply pretty strongly that the issue is not PGP, it's
the possible abuse of the cypherpunks upload area if it is world
writeable.

Having CERT go specifically after the distribution of PGP would be pretty
amusing considering the several PGP keys I have on my keyring from CERT
people.
