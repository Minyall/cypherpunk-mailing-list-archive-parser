tamsun and tamaix are two different machines which share, NFS-ed, user
directories; hence, any mail sent to tamsun or tamaix goes through the same bit
of remailing script.  They both work independantly, however, and I decided to
keep both in case one of the machines goes down for some reason.

Let me know via email to remail@tamsun.tamu.edu if you still can't get your
message through.  It should work though.
