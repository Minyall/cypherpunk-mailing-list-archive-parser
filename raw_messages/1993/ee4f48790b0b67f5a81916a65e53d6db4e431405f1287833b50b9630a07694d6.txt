I received a nice message today from Mitch Ratcliffe (I misspelled his name 
in my earlier post to C-punks) re my posting of the sidebars from his AOCE 
article. I'm not forwarding his E-mail as I was raised to consider that 
impolite :), but feel safe in summarizing thus:

1. There are a number of weaknesses in AOCE, but it is also a step forward 
in some senses. Discussion/elaboration of these weaknesses is precluded by 
space limitations of MacWeek, as well as other trade or mainstream 
magazines.

2. Editing for space accounts for some lack of detail in the sidebars; they 
are also intended for a general audience. Mitch suggests Apple as a source 
of further technical information re AOCE, and mentions a talk given by 
Gursharan Sidhu at the Apple Worldwide Developers' Conference in May, in 
which Sidhu suggests the government should be able to crack a system's security
in some cases. Sidhu is the technical director of collaboration systems 
development at Apple.

Mitch's e-mail address is godsdog@netcom.com; I've written back asking for 
clarification about other points raised in the article.
