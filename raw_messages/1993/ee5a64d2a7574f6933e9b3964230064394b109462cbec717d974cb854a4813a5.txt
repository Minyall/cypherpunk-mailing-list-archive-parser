I have included, below, a copy of my pgp menu system.  It is a 4dos batch file.

With this program, you can encrypt, sign and decrypt a message, and generate, 

delete, extract keys, wipe files.  I've been trying to iron out some of the 

bugs for about a month now.  (BTW where did all my alpha testers go?)  I think

it's pretty stable now, so I'm posting it.  To be able to use the program, you

MUST BE USING 4DOS as your command interpreter on your PC.  But, I've found that

this little requirement is well worth the utility that (I hope) my program
