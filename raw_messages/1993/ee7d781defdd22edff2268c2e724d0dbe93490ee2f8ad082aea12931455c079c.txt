Is there a way to set up an encrypted login session, whereby the calling
program would need a 'key' in order to decrypt the connection to even
see the 'login: ' prompt?  I thought I saw something like this for the
ham-radio enthusiasts.  It uses plain-DES to do the work.  But this would
require that your calling program be some type of comm prog with the
decryption/encryption abilities within.

I understand that some gov logins use this type of scheme.
