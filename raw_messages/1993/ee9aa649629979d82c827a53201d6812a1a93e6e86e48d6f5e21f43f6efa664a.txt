An excellent paper (author and title have slipped my mind - the paper
describes key-and, key-or, and other operations) describes how to do
something related to part 2 of the above.

In that scheme, you would have the three key pairs for the
individuals, Pa, Sa, Pb, Sb, Pc, Sc, and the "joint" keypair Pj, Sj.  

A message encrypted with Pj can only be unlocked with Sj, which in
turn is encrypted with Pa, Pb, Pc.  Thus, the final message looks like

E(M, Pj); E(Sj, Pa); E(Sj, Pb); E(Sj, Pc)

where the four parts are passed around as one, and E(a,b) means a
encrypted with b.  Thus, each of the individuals, knowing their own
private keys, can extract Sj, and then the message M.

Offhand, I'm not sure if the paper describes joint signings in this
manner.
