Yeah, its an arms race, and we don't have time to wait for the ultimate
weapon. Similarly, it doesn't matter how ultimate the weapon is in the
hands of someone who doesn't know how to use it. I wish that the generic
security advice was separate from the IBM-flavored instructions in the PGP
manual. It's very tedious for a Mac user.
