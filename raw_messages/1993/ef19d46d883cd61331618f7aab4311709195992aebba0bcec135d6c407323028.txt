    And "holding somone responsible for their actions" doesn't necessarilly
    mean throwing someone in jail, or sueing them for lots of money --- it
    can be as simple as their knowing that what they say can be traced back
    to them, and their own personal credibility is on the line.  

ted, do you think today's nets offer this assurance?  i certainly do not.
