In response to Eric Hughs:

I disagree that income tax is a bad thing. What other way
does the government have of maintaining fairness across
income tax levels. Someone who only makes 15k a year should
not be expected to pay as much as someone who makes 200k.

Income tax generates too much revenue to be that easily
dispensed with. Given the financial trouble our country
is already in, I hate to think of the consequences to
the budget if income tax disappeared. 

Note: I do not enjoy paying this tax, but I'm glad to know
that the people making a lot more than I am are contributing
more.
