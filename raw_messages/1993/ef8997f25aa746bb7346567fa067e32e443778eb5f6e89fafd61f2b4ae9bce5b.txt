You would have a better chance if you took just the low frequency components
of a 2D Fourier transform of the pictures in question -- perhaps at only
certain frequencies -- to get a vector describing features of the picture.

You'd have to choose your 2D frequencies and build a set of such indicators
and then look to see what distance between two vectors suggests that the
pictures are the same.

You'd want to use only the magnitude of the transform, to remove translation
effects.  You could use a sum around a circle of frequencies to remove
rotation effects.

The low res picture by averaging is easily confused by any translation
or rotation of the image.
