Very good summary!! It's much clearer now!

So, can I take it that if Alice or anyone else can
figure out how the bank randomly picks half of the
k values sent in, that Alice or anyone else can now
get free money by using bozo instead of her real
identity in the right k/2 messages?

Also, how does the bank calculate cube roots?
