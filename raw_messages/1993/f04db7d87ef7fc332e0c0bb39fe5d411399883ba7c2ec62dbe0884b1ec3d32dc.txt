If the military is worried about delivery systems' accuracy, Phil Karn
already mentioned kamikazies, but if you don't want to make suicide part of
the package, you could always just have someone drop a radio transmitter on
your target sometime in advance, possibly a day or two.  The missile can
then home in on the signal.  (If you need to get it inside a high-security
area, you could always encase it in foam and drop it from a model airplane
or launch it in a model rocket.)  Or you could just leave a suitcase with a
timed bomb at your target location; plutonium bombs can be very small.

It boggles my mind that the military mind prevents the use of tools that
are just too complicated for the "bad guys" to bother with.  Does CBS have
an email address yet?  :)
