My mail reader (Xmh) allows me to sort incoming mail by any header field.  I key
off the "to: cypherpunks" to put this mail in a different box.  The information
you need is already in the header, and I would object to adding more noise to the
beginning of the subject field to obscure the real subject.

On the second point, I agree that the second is better, but my mail sorter is
smart enough to sort "Re: foo" with "foo", so again, no change is necessary.  Is
there any chance you can get access to a more powerful mail reader, rather than
asking everyone to clutter up the headers with redundant info?
