Hola all,

I've just started working on a good Mac implementation of IDEA, but I
need a little more info on something.  I've got more info on IDEA than
I know what to do with, but I've yet to find any good references on doing
a secure wipe to remove the plaintext file from the hard disk.  Can anyone
point me to some good refs on the topic?  Many thanks...


                             Ken
