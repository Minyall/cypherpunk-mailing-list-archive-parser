The good guys are beginning to prevail in the news.admin.policy battle
over pseudonymous postings, aided in no small part by the opposition, one
of whom began unilaterally cancelling articles by nyms.  This tactical
blunder produced a firestorm of protest and brought in fresh voices eager
to speak out on the side of privacy and freedom of expression.  We need to
continue to weigh in on the side of pseudonymous postings.  Perhaps the
most constructive approach is to do so pseudonymously!
