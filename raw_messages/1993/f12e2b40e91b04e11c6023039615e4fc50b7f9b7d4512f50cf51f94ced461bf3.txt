An admirable solution, but it does not take into account the vested
interests involved.  The only way to deal with them is to design a
new system that is sufficiently more efficient (and/or wealth
generating) that they are better off supporting it than opposing
it.  The U.S. Government has been under construction for over 200
years; you are not going to break it apart so easily.
