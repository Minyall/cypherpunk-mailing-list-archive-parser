I do, too!  I don't have time to read sci.crypt, which has upwards of 50
messages a day posted to it.  I'd much rather see relevent culls posted here.
Isn't that what this list is all about, getting information out to people
instead of censoring or controlling it?  I'd rather delete the ones I don't
wanna see, personally.  I think your flamer was way off base.
