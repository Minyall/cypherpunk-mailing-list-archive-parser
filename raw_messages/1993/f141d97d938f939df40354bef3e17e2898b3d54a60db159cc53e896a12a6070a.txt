Hmmm.. Unless you guys in the states get third level education for free you've 
*already* plunked down some $$$ as course fees. I would assume that a portion 
of the fees for an IT related course would be applied to purchase/upkeep of the
relevant kit.

IMHO the attitude of educational establishments which can border on the 
paranoid whenever they come across usage of "their" systems which isn't typical
is very similar to the classic model of the commercial DP gruppenfuhrer... Both
can be regarded as empire-builders..
