I don't belive people were talking about Kermit the Protocol. They
were talking about Kermit the PD terminal emulation software, which
contains Kermit the Protocol. Obviously the protocol can handle error
correction -- but that does nothing for you if you want to log in to a
machine and do arbitrary things.
