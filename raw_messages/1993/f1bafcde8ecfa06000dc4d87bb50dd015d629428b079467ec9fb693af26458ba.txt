True and if I had netmail set up for my system, I would probably allow
encrypted netmail. I already offer the latest version of PGP (source and
executable) to my users. The sysop ultimately has the right to choose if
he or she allows encrypted mail on his or her system. After all, the sysop
owns the machine and pays the bills, especially since most Fidonet sites
are hobby sites with no fees for access.
