Thanks to everyone for a really interesting and informative discussion
group.  I started out knowing almost nothing about encryption systems, and
now I feel like I am at least an informed novice.  I have learned a lot, and
I really appreciate it. 

I will be in the Sangre de Christo Mtns. in New Mexico for the rest of the
summer (w/o net access, this time), so I'll have to catch up in the fall.

thanks again,
-john
