   I know for sure that Soviet KGB did a lot of work in graphology and 
kept samples of print of every typewriter there was in the country.

   It might be easy to write a program that would randomly modify spacing,
indentations, punctuation styles, spelling, replace words with random
synonyms, reorder words in phrases, etc.  It can eliminate most of the
clues, excluding the concepts.
You will have to compromise between the accuracy of the message and its
