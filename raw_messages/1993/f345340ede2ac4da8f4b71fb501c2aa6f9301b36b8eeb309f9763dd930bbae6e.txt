I have 1/72nd of that storage capacity in the next room, using
off-the-shelf technology.  Also, 8GB RAM, and another 300-500GB of
'fast' storage local to the CPU.

(Cray C90, 1GW main memory, .5TB drive storage of various types, 9
tape silos)

Again, all off-the-shelf technology.  Tape robots are a few years old,
actually. :-)
