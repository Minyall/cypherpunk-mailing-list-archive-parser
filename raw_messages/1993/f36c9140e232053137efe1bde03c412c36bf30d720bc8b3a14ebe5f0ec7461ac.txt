Alas, water pipes are much better for

1) noise and unintentional transmissions (which can be quite garbled
and no one cares), and

2) low frequency transmissions (which can carry only low bandwidth
communications).

Trying to transmit meaningful communications at high data rates
over water pipes would be a TREMENDOUS technical challenge,
requiring a vast amount of signal processing to compensate
for multipath reflections, impedance mismatches, thermal noise,
pickup of an almost variety of interference soures  ces,                                infinite variety of interference sources. ,

the cold water, I have seriously considered this scheme and
believe that it can be used only for very short haul, very low
