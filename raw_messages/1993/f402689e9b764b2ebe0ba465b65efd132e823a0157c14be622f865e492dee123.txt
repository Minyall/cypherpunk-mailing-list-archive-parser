1) The fl0w of wArEz keeps the universe in perfect harmony.  Without wArEz
there would be no life as we know it.  And just because you are a rich fat
fuck who can afford to plunk down $795 for a copy of Pagemaker, you
shouldn't take a moral stance against those who cannot afford such
extortion yet need these software tools to keep up technologically with
rich fat fucks like yourself. 

2) wArEz have A LOT to do with Cypherpunks.  Software, pirated or
otherwise has value, and as such it must be considered as a form of
digital money.  One may trade encrypted wArEz anonymously over anonymous
mailing lists, FSP/FTP sites, newsgroups like the proposed alt.waste, and
BlackNet.  wArEz _are_ digital gold coins, they have inherent value,
unlike useless encrypted random number certificates advocated by others. 

3) I don't give a flying fuck if you pay for your DL time.  If you're
stupid enough to be using AOL as your Internet port of entry, then you
deserve to be ripped off by Compuserve's evil bastard cousin.  Why don't
you point and click yourself a new brain, and join a flat-rate system like
Netcom or any of the hundred other public access internet sites. Support the
small entrepreneurs instead of those lazy fat bastard nazi censors at AOL.
