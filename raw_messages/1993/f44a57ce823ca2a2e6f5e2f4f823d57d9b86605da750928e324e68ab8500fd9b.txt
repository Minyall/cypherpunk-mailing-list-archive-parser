Isn't it obvious?

1.	People try to do key escrow in S/W (rather than refuse to play
	along with key registration)

2.	By doing so, they lend apparent approval to the idea of
	registration.

3.	The S/W effort fails, of course.

4.	Conclusion: S/W encryption is no good and must be abandoned because
	you can't do key registration that way.

It is important not to entertain the notion of registration, even as an
academic exercise, lest the effort be used to claim that some reasonable
person believes key registration is OK.
