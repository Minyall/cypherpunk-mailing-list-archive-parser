Cyphertentacles and Extropiates,

Here's a convenient list of the latest Netcom sites, which span the U.S.

I've been happily using it (well, they changed to a new emacs
yesterday and now my autowrap doesn't work....I hate having to spend a
couple of hours on such a trivial matter) for a year and a half and I
conservatively estimate I've influenced at least 30 people to sign up
for it....too bad I don't get any usage credits for it.

The best things about it: flat monthly fee ($17.50), unlimited connect
time, full range of services (much better than most universities have,
folks tell me), and--best of all--your Netcom account won't change
when you change jobs! And posting with Netcom presumably won't run the
risk of angering your employer.

I'm thrilled that Netcom is expanding so rapidly.
