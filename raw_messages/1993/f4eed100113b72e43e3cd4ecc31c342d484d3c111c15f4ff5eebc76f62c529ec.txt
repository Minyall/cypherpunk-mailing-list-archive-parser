This is not where my masters make theirs most money. Remember, over
the course of a few weeks during which you hold the travelers checks,
the riskless rate of return will bring in an insanely small amount of
money. Currently, even long term rates are at best 6% per annum, and
you can't make that much in the money markets in practice. In fact,
real interest rates, that is rates taking inflation into account, are
near zero right now.

On the other hand, the percentage of face value that you are charged
when you buy the checks makes a couple percent instantly.

The float is just cream -- its not the bread and butter.
