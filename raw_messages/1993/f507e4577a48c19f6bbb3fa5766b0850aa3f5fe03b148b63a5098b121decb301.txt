Cypherpunks,
 
  There is an article about the future of Encryption Regulation in the May 1993
issue of BYTE.  Its not TOO bad and our side is at least represented. (With a
most excellent spokesman BTW).  They offer up a "solution" to the
Denning/Privacy Schism.  Including Silvio Micali's (I thought someone else
had this idea first...) multiple repositories.  I recall some talk about
this with regard to time released crypto.
 
  I think they could use some refining.  The author is Peter Wayner and can be
reached at pcw@access.digex.com.   Take it easy on him, I think he is really
trying to struggle with issues that we understand already.  Lets school 'im guys
(and gals).
 
  The article actually mentions steganography also...Not bad BYTE.
