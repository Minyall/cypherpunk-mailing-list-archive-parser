   Someone is probably doing steganography in netnews and/or mailing
   lists right now!  (Besides cypherpunks, I mean.)  How would we find them?

Food for thought: that, at least as of recently, the NSA bought weekly
dumps of all usenet articles on tape.  I highly doubt they were for
their reading pleasure...
