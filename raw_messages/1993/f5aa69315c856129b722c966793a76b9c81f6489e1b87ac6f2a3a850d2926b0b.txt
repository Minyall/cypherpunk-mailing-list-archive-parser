 Uu> You're walking down the street, and a gang of thugs jumps out
 Uu> from behind some bushes. Their leader approaches you and says:
 Uu> 
 Uu> "Don't be alarmed, we're your very local community - we believe
 Uu> in the noble principle of Democracy, majority rule, and you
 Uu> have an equal vote with each of us."

Et cetera, und so weiter...
