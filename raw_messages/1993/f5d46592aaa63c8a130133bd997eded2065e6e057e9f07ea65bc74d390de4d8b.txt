Some points:

* When Alice deposits the gold, the many television cameras in the
Zurich bank take many pictures of her. When she later dials in and
uses the pseudonym "Clara," the bank can associate Clara with the
images (and other True Names data). Little is gained. None of the
"blinding" which is so elegant in Chaum's work (and recently described
by Hal Finney).

* The role of *gold* is tangential and secondary. Any stable currency
would suffice, and in fact gold bullion would be no more desirable
than yen or Deutschmarks.

* Also, how does this solve the problems of digital money (double
spending, transferrability, etc.) we've been talking about? After all,
there are still banks which allow "numbered" accounts (in
Lichtenstein, I hear), so this level of anonymity stil exists. And
where banking laws don't allow such numbered accounts, they likely
won't allow "gold bullion anonymous accounts."

* However, I have heard--as Stuart Card may have also--that "warehouse
receipts" could form the basis of a new type of bank. I don't know
anything beyond this, so maybe this idea could be developed.
