Thats not my advice. I just recommend that we leave the lawyering to
the lawyers or those who, like John Gilmore or Dan Bernstein, have
learned enough that they might be able to tell valuable things to
them. The rest of us have many things we can do, which Tim has already
said, but among them are...

1) Code! Code! Code! The more stuff is out there, the less they will
   be able to do.
2) Spread cryptographic software.
3) Catalog publically available cryptographic software overseas on the
   net. The lawyers might need this.
4) Catalog publically available cryptographic software and textbook
   descriptions in the U.S. -- the lawyers might need this.
5) Write articles describing the overall picture and get them
   published.
6) Keep informed.

etc.
