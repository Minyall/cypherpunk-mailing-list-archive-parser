Is there any reason why a single mail address should have only one
pseudonym? Along with declaring a private password, why not declare any
number of public names? One password per name would be nice. Another plus -
then penet could be chained between cypherpunk remailers. Now this is not
possible because it identifies users with their 'From:' field.
