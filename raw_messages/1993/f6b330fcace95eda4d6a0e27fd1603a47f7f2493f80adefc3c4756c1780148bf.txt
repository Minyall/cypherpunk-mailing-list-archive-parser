The perl419x.zip in simtel:msdos/perl doesn't even use the 386.
However, those without 386 + memory manager may have a bit of
a hard time with memory.  I don't know about the perl4019.zip in
the same directory; I snarfed it to check, but it has no docs (and
I don't care to disassemble for 386 code!)
