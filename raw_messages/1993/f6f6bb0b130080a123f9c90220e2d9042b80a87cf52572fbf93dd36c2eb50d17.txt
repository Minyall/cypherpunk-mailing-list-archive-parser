Oh, come on now.  You give the "Christian Right" (and I still don't know
what that means) far more power than they have.    There is this popular
notion that the "Christian Right" has some master agenda that all 
conservative Christians buy into blindly.  That simply ain't so ...
just as there isn't a single master cypherpunks agenda agreed on in this list
(complaints by Mr. Detweiler notwithstanding).  

Clark Reynard has rightly pointed out that some in the Christian Right
agree with the cypherpunks on the need for legal cryptography and that they
might be able to help in the fight against things like Clipper.  
Why that should bring out deep-seeded hatred against the Christian Right
for unrelated offenses or differences of opinion is beyond me.  Isn't
it enough that we could agree on this one issue?

Let's try to make this issue non-partisan, OK?
