With even current remailer architectures, it's trivial to simply have
different services for normal remailing (which leaves body intact) and
stripping services that grundge the message arbitrarily.

When we really want anonymity, for instance, we will need message
rewriting services that break the correlation between authors and
writing style.  A friend of mine looked into that material and claims
that such analysis can do a depressingly good job at figuring out what
messages were written byt he same author, even if the author tries to
stilt his style.
