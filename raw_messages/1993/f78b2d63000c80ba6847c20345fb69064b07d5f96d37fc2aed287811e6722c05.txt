Let me quickly try to clear up some confusion. I've gotten several replies
(real quick response) that are answering a different question.

I'm not trying to reimplement TCP/IP. I'm trying to provide a Windows
version of NUpop, which is a DOS program that works fine over a
simple serial line. Most folks automatically associate SMTP/POP with
TCP/IP, but there is no connection. Admittedly they work better with
a robust, end to end protocol. But I've been using NUpop for a year
over a non-TCP/IP line. I get hundreds of messages a day. It works.
But there are no sources available to NUpop, it is a DOS program,
and it doesn't support piping messages thru PGP/RIPEM/...


I have lots of DOS libraries that do exactly the simple things I need. I
don't want to use DOS, I want native Windows code.
