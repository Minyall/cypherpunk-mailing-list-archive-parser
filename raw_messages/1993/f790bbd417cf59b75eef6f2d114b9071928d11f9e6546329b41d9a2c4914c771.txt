So the person intends harm? Words cannot cause physical damage. They
can always be ignored.

Bill has spent too much time in the recovery movement, and has dealt
with people who are nearly completely deranged so long that he no
longer understands what is expected of normal people.

Thats false. Everyone has the capacity to decide whether or not to pay
attention to words. Force, on the other hand, provokes a physical
reaction (such as bleeding, or perhaps dropping dead) that you can't
help.

Read Thomas Szasz's (sp?) "The Myth of Mental Illness" for a critique
of modern excuses like "he couldn't help it". Also read "I'm
disfunctional, you're disfunctional" to learn about the sort of cult
the recovery movement has turned into.
