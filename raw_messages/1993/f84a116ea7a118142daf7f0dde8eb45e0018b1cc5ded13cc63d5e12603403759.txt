# ... and have every cypherpunks message have a "CPUNK:" prepended
# to the subject,  ...

I do this on two digests that I edit, and I have one realtime
reflector that automatically inserts a tag into the Subject: line. 

The problem is when something gets nandoed into more than one
mailing list, the tags take up the whole subject line.

But it seems worth the bother.
