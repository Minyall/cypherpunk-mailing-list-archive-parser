Yes, I'm certainly interested.

A practical use for such a device would be to generate "random" data
for use by PGP or RIPEM. Both need "random" data to generate session
keys and public/secret keypairs. In fact, the whole security of these
programs depends upon the unpredictability of the "random" data used.
