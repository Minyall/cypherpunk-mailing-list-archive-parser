Bull. You cannot prove that all strings are contained as substrings of
PI. The mere fact that a bit string is infinite and non-repeating does
not mean that it is wholely random. For instance, I can very readily
construct infinite sequences that do not contain arbitrary bit
strings.

See, as an example, this non-repeating bit string

101001000100001000001....
