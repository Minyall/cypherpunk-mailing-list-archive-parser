What exactly is "Moby Crypto"?  Is it a book?  A disk?

The current law can be interpreted to mean that a piece of code on
paper is legal, but on a disk is not.  Clearly, this is what the NSA
is doing.  Stupid?  Yes, IMHO.  But the government has refused to see
it this way.  This person does not need lawyers.  He needs
congresscritters, preferably a majority of them :-/
