i'm impressed.  (honest.)  but the task here isn't to compare viacrypt
to pgp -- they use different rsa engines -- it's validating that viacrypt
doesn't have a backdoor.  the diff scheme you describe presupposes that
this step has been done, but it has not, and i think it would be very,
very hard to do.
