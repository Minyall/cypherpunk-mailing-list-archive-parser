I was recently at my friendly neighborhood technical book store and I noticed a  
cyptography book I hadn't seen before.  It is called "Cyptography and Secure  
Communications" by Man Young Rhee.  The publishing data is 1994.  Does anyone  
here know anything about this book?  How does it compare with "Applied  
Cryptography"?

Thanks,
