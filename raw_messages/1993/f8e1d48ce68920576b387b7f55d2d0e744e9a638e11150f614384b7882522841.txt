Re: adding notes indicating remailing.

There is a standard RFC-822 field, Comment, which would be perfect for
just such an application.  The original remailer I wrote added the
header field Remailed-By to indicate this.

You could also use another standard 822 field, Sender, as follows:

	Sender: anonymous remailing service <remailer@host>

Either way, the note goes in the header, where it can be seen or
stripped, but in any case handled without munging the message body.
