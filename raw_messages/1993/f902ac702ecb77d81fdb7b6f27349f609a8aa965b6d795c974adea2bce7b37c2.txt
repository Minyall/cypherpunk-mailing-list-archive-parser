Perhaps my post needed some clarification:
I do not believe that a lawfull governmental police force becomes
unneccessary once we hand every citizen a gun.
Just as the police can not grant an unarmed public's security, an armed
populace alone is no guarantee for safe streets. Only the combination of a
well prepared public working together with a responsible government can make
our lifes truely safe from infringementes by anti-social individuals. I
beleive that if people were allowed to used crypto in all communication and
carry a gun at all times, crime-be it street crime or white collar- would be
reduced to levels far below the present rate.
