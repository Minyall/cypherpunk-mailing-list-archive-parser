In Japan they do.  Some banks recently got scammed by people putting
photocopied Y10,000 ($100) bills into changers at the banks (getting
10 Y1,000 in return).  They've now done a ROM upgrade on the machines.

A cultural point: Japan is a very cash-oriented society, so nobody
blinked twice when someone went up to the changing machine and plunked
10 or 20 bills into it.
