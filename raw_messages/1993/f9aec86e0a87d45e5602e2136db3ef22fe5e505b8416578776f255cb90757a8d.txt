I received several requests for my text file on TEMPEST, which
I offered to send to Victor Borisov.  I have sent a copy directly
to Victor; but rather than try to send copies to all who requested
it, I'm going to post it to the list.  To save bandwidth, I'll
use PGP (compressed) armored form.  So you'll know it's from me,
I'll sign it, but it won't be encrypted.
