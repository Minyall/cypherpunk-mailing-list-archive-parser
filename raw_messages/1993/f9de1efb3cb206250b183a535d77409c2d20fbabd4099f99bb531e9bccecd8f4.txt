The business about replacing copper with optical fibre and who's going to
pay for it is a total red herring.  Currently, it's much cheaper for the
RBOCs to lay fiber than copper.  Over the whole nation, about 5% of the
wiring is replaced annually.  For at least the last two years, that
replacement has been 100% fiber and (IMNVHO) that trend will continue.  In
~20(*) years the whole country will be fiber without anyone doing anything
out of the ordinary.

(*) It's a little more than 20 years because there is some overlap in the
areas that get replaces; I.e. it's not a new 5% each year, but the overlap
is well under 1%.
