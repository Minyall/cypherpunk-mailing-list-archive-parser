In the "is this weird or what?" category, I came across something
fascinating in the December 1993 issue of "Smithsonian" magazine.
In an article by John F. Ross about ventriloquists, an outfit
called Maher Studios in Littleton, Colorado is described.  Maher
is a major supplier of ventriloquism "how-to" books and tapes,
including "Maher's Home Ventriloquism Course" ($79.95).  In it
are revealed (quoting Ross) "secrets of the art, information once
kept closely guarded by the now defunct International Brotherhood
of Ventriloquists".

The proprieter of Maher Studios is a middle-aged (judging by his 
photograph) man named Clinton Detweiler.
