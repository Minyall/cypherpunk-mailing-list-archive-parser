Well go to some other forum, we don't need your kind around here.  <just
kidding, I'm only being sarcastic to make a point to some other readers>

Someone against the "religious right" would probably say they (those in that
group) are brainwashed.  Those in the "religious right" would say they
(anti-religion) are possessed.  (other readers: please don't try to debate
this, ok?  I lived in a very religious town in Texas, so I know how they
feel.)

The axiom of Mass Media follows: "Print, Show, Or Speak What Will Bring In
The Money."  Most folks get kicks out of watching cults like the RR
getting the bum rush, like most folks enjoy watching the accident scene. 
The Media plays no ideological favorites, it just gives the hungry masses
what they want.

I disagree here (a lot is done in the name of national security/encryption
which threatens innocent lives), but even I won't diverge this far from the
intent of the cypherpunks forum to debate this.  If you do want to carry
this further, please drop me a line directly.
