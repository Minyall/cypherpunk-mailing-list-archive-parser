For what it's worth, I don't think this interpretation can be read into
EFF's Open Platform paper. EFF doesn't care about making money off the
Data Highway, nor does it think the debate should be about the number of
channels cable offers.

Instead, EFF wants an infrastructure in which Tim May's anarchic vision
can flourish along with the visions of anarchophobes. On an Open Platform,
a hundred flowers can and will bloom, and a thousand schools of
thought will contend.

Anarchists like Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassidy could find
individualistic redemption on the (government-built) road.
EFF thinks private-enterprise roads are better, but we also think 
its promise is unfulfilled if it doesn't allow net.kerouacs and
net.cassidys to create there.
