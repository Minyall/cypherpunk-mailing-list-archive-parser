I appreciate the replies I received on "how to cheaply detect
eavesdropping devices," but I'm afraid that I do not have access
to the types of equipment which were mentioned (IR glasses, etc).

Any further suggestions?

PS - Has anyone else been watching the lunatic ravings of one
     l.detweiler on comp.org.eff.talk? This guy is a fucking
     fruitcake!
