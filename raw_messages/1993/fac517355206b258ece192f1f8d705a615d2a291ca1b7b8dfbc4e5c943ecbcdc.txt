Actually, there were plans to move the CyPunks meeting to Sat, Jan 15
anyway, since Jan 8th already conflicts with something else (Usenix?
something Unix-y).

Of course, the 15th is when the ExI-BATF (Extropy Institute - Bay Area
Transhumanist/Task Force, for the extropianly-impaired) meeting would
normally be held. I think we can ask Dave Krieger to put this off one week
to the 22nd. If so, then I'll be happy. What d'ya say Dave?
