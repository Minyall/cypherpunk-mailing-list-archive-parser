Damned line noise zapped this last time just as I was about to send it.
I don't think it went (uustat apparently knew nothing of it), so here
it is again:

From Eric Raymond's draft FAQ:

Privacy extends to more than just invulnerability to eavesdropping
upon one's communications.  One may have private records which are
viewed only by oneself, and never communicated.  A cryptosystem
suitable for encryption of such non-communicated information need
not be a public-key cryptosystem.  Thus:

2 d. Cryptosystems for protecting privately-held information
     against unauthorized access.
