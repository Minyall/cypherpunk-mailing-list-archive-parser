My experience with network licence managers suggests that most of
them are more or less a joke in terms of security, anyway. Whether
this is due to the underlying licence software and protocols used in
that or poor integration on the part of the vendor, I don't know.

I did some investigation of this, a while ago, from the point of view
of designing something more secure than the currently available schemes.

I don't need to say it in this forum, but there is a long history
of people coming up with schemes for various types of security where
the designers claim a certain level of security that they don't
actually achieve. Licence enforcement software is also prone to this
type of thing.
