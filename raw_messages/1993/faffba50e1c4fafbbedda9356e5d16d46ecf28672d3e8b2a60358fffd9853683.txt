I don't know why I should trust it, and there are schemes I do trust
available that work fine, like Rabin's or even RSA.

No, because the patent says so. The patent might be overbroad --
indeed, I'd say that it is, but the only way to get it thrown out is
to have it reexamined or get the courts to toss it. If you have
several hundred thousand dollars available I'll gladly arrange to have
this done.
