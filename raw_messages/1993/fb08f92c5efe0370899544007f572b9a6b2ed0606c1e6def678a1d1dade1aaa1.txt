 Fortunately... Libel is a totally ineffectual law for attempting
to impose the kinds of censorship that Ted seems to be espousing.
Libel and slander laws are OFTEN used by the powers that be
(governmental, corporate etc) to silence the oppostion in
matters of human rights, ecology etc...
just because a charge of libel or slander
has been made doesnt mean that the charges are just or proper...
often it is merely an attempt to silence the opposition...
 The world of cyberspace crossing without form international
boundaries for now is a shield against censorship due to the
 complex legalities involved... remailers in seperate countries
careful chosen offer complete protection against Ted and his loyal opposition.
(your cabal ted... :) BTW: for me... control=censorship,interdiction etc...
