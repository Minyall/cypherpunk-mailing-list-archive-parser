I wouldn't worry about either.  I don't see how enforcement of  
copyright will be possible under crypto-anarchy any more than  
taxation will be.  If one person pays for a posting, what's to keep  
him from sharing it anonymously with whomever he wants?  Is there any  
way that crypto-anarcy won't bring the death of "intellectual  
property"?
