Let's be realistic, Mike.
 
The biggest threat to any security, on any basis, is the threat of
human nature. The chances of someone factoring your PGP encoded
message is somewhere in the range of slim-to-none, but the chances
of someone (you) -physically- compromising their key is much, much
higher.
 
In fact, I'd venture to say that it's much higher than even you or I
imagine, given the fact that some folks ignore what most of us would
deem common sense and use PGP on a multi-user system (such as a SUN
server, any other UNIX-flavored workstation, or even a Netware
server).
 
Fact Two: That's why you won't see messages from me either (a.)
signed with PGP, or (b.) encrypted with PGP from any of my other
e-mail accounts. All are UNIX (open) environments and I don't like
the implications of the possibilities of my secret key being exposed,
even if I do trust the folks I work with. Call me a schizoid.
 
Cheers,
