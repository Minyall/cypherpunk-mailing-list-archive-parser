FYI, to be married in this way, you have to declare yourself in public as
married - introducing yourself as someone's husband or wife, for example, is
enough.  But being "common law" married, it's only "legally" - that is, if
one or both parties want to dissolve the marriage and don't want to exercise
their rights, they can just walk away from the marriage.

Texas is such a state.
