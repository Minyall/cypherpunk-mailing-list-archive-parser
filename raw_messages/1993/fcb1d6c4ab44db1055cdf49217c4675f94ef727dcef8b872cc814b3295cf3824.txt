Nick asks:

A very good question.  The reason is largely because it's a very profitable
business *for the card merchants* (banks, mostly).  They get their
percentage no matter what, and losses don't eat into it all that much.

I agree with much of what Nick says, but I think we have to consider ways to
help make digicash pay for its own implementation and enforcement, or it
will not take hold.
