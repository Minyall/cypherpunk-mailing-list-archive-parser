I'll take John up on his kind offer! 

Though I expressed that to me this experience was kind of funny (in a
devil-may-care way, I hope you all understand), it *does* raise larger
issues of whether CERT is developing list of what might be called

So, I'll try to pursue this and keep you folks posted.
