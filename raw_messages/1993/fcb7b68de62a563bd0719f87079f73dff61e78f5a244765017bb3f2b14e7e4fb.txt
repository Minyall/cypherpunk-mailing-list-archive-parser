That is not generally required for publication; what counts is whether
the submitted paper follows the norms.

In some instances referees may want to see that the paper has the support
of someone else in the field who is known or at a known institute to
save themselves wasted time, if the paper is novel and would require
nontrivial time to check, but that's easy enough to obtain.

Page fees can often be waived, too, when someone doesn't have a grant
or institution to pay them.
