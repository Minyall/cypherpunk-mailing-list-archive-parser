Oh for christ's sake, knock it off!  If the poor bastard really is
going through a paranoid phase (and I'll bet there more of us on this
list who've been there than would care to admit it) this is just the
sort of thing to push him over the edge.

If you can't ignore him, install procmail and put him in your killfile.
If you escalate this into a petty netwar, just think how hard it's
going to be for him when he finally starts to get over it.  Would
_you_ want to be in that position?

I suppose someone posting from a site called 'Illuminati' thinks
this is all very funny.  I don't.  Neither would you if you were
above the age of 14.
