Without makeing any claims one way or the other, I would like to point out
that LD's posts are almost always readable, while S.Boxx's are often as
not _very_ difficult for me to understand. No, that doesn't realy mean
anything, but just because two posters send messages of approximately the
same length about approximately the same subject, doesn't mean they are
the same person.
Happy Hunting, -Chris.
