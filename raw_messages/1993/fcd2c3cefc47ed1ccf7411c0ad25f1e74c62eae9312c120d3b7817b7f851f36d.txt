.... And THAT is perhaps the most cognizant, practical and lucid
suggestion I have heard to date (not as an aside to those who have
proposed technical solutions, et al).

Let's face it -- the net will do nothing less than become larger, more
accessible, more complex and even easier to spoof, if a cryptographic
stop-gap does not materialize which provides a comfortable buffer for
those desire anonymity and those who are afraid of it.
