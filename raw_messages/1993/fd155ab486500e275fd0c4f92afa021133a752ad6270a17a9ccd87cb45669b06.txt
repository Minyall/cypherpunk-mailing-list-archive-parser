This was well-debated about a month or so back. Some remailers are
archiving mail for debugging, others for legal protection (in case
threats, blackmail, etc., used), and others are simply automatically
archiving by site policies.

In a note I wrote back then, which did not name the particular site
involved, I reported that after sending a piece of "anonymous" mail, I
got a letter of "support" for my position from the remailer operator!

After I mentioned this to the Cypherpunks list, it came out that other
sites were also keeping various forms of archives (for some or all of
the reasons listed above).

Anyway, such human-operated remailers, running on UNIX boxes in
unsecure conditions, have many nonideal characteristics.
