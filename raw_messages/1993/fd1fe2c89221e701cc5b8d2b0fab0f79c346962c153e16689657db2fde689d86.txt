Will an input-oriented (recognition mode) Nymalizer be able to differentiate 
between the outputs of "actual people" (ha) and actual people as filtered 
through output-oriented (generation mode) Nymalizers? After all, once we 
discover that username 'x' posts using LOTS of CAPITALIZED words and phunny 
SPELLINGS and so forth, it doesn't seem so hard to turn a Nymalizer into a 
filter which would create (or at least describe to a human creator) text 
which would fit that pattern ..

I'm pleased to see that Perry now supports moving politics off the list; his 
posts do make me wonder if he's being spoofed, as he cheerfully participated 
in the econ-flames of a month ago. Still, I wholeheartedly support either 
him or the spoofer in their call to take the politics somewhere else.
