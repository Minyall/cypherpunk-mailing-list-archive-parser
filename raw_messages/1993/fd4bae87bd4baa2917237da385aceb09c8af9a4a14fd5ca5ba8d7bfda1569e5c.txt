Instead of these ballooning regexps, how about just using Chael
Hall's standardized "end of body" marker?  Even if some people had
to add it manually to each message, well, that's not a big deal.
But I suspect that the people who have sigs being added by BBS
software are going to have trouble adding strange header lines, even
if they have the regexp expertise to construct them.  

Anyone who does control their sig, but doesn't want to take the
trouble to include it only some of the time, can just add the
marker.  People might even be able to convince BBS sysops to add it
to their autosigs.  Or if this just looks too cluttered, maybe the
sig-clipper header could just be "Signature-Lines:" -- clip that
many, or none by default, and you're done.
