This question already has a known answer.  The author of the words is
the one that is liable for them.  No other parties are liable unless
they had prior knowledge; this would make them conspirators.

In libel cases specifically, if you can prove who the author was, you
can sue.  If you can't, too bad.  Heh, heh, heh.

I asked Mike Godwin about this specifically a few months ago.  I
mention him here to give him to opportunity to correct or elaborate.
