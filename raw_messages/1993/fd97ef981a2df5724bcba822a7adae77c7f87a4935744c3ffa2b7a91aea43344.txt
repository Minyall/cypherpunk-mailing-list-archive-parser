Do you agree or disagree that:

 'the concept of "anti-gravity" device is not patentable.
  If I could duplicate the effect of your anti-gravity device without
  using any of the same novel mechanisms.  My device would be
  separately patentable.' ?

If you agree, then how can you patent "public key systems" as a concept?

If you disagree, then we can leave it at that.
