"Overpopulation has led to ever-increasing governmental control over the
private citizen, not on the old-style police-state models of oppression
and terror, but in terms of work, credit, housing, retirement benefits,
and medical care: things which can be withheld. These services are
computerized. No number, no service. However, this has not produced the
brainwashed standardized human units postulated by such linear prophets as
George Orwell. Instead, a large percentage of the population has been
forced underground. How large, no one knows. These people are NUMBERLESS."
