Dear Dr. Honeyman,

  A postscript version of the paper is available on our anonymous ftp site
(csp2.csp.uga.edu) in the /pub/documents/amf1 directory as rng.ps.

PS:
  We are just beginning this ftp site, but have already collected a number of
(hopefully) interesting preprints from several authors here, as well as from
Japan and Israel.  Please feel free to browse through the selection of papers,
to upload any articles you feel might be interesting to simulational physicists
and to spread the word about this new service.
