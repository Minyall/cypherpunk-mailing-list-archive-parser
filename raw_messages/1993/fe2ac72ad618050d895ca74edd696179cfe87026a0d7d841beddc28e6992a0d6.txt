To those who have requested Secure Drive: How's it working?
How widely is it being distributed? How many people outside
the Cypherpunks, if any, are using it? Please let me know how
the program is doing. Any serious bugs?

(Note: I do not have a list of people who've received it.)

To those who haven't: Big Brother is watching you!

Any ideas on better ways to distribute it? I'm thinking about posting
the ad to some newsgroups, since there haven't been any reports of
major bugs as of yet.
