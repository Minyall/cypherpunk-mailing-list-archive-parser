Re your "I like this ("Oh My God" proposal for tap authorisations): THis
gives us a possibly interesting place to start from.  Sponsor and lobby for
(etc) new legislation which would update the existing wiretap laws to
include the Oh My God! standard.  The point being to put that standard in
place & let it run in test mode for a while to see how it works.  

If it works out well in practice, and isnt subject to "venue abuse" (judge
shopping), then it could be extended to key escrow systems.  However, I
still have a strong preference that even an "improved" key escrow system be
implemented via the free market and make provision for free choice in
cyphers.
