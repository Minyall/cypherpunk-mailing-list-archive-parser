In the US, you can use any identity you like, provided you're not doing so
to defraud anyone ... that is, if you do it to escape child care payments,
that's fraud. If you do it to rent a mailbox, *provided you don't do
anything otherwise illegal using the mailbox*, it's kosher. Start a
checking account -- I don't see why not.

I have a casual background in law/law enforcement, but got the first two
examples from a law school grad. who is currently working for a law
enforcement agency. I'lll have to run the third one by him ...
