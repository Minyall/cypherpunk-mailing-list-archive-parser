I'd really like to see the toolkit in plain ol' C. I realize that
other languages and systems have great advantages over C, but C is
portable beyond belief.

It would be nice to have something built & documented like RSAREF but
with the capabilities of PGP (plus D-H exchange) built in. It would
probably see widespread and immediate adoption.
