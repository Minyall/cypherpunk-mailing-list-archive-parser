Does anybody have source code to Istvan Mohos "mix" programs?  I have the
binaries but I lost the source a while back.  It's kind-of a fun encryption
algorithm because it's a transposition cypher rather than a stream cypher --
the result set contains exactly the same characters as the input set.
