"Externally verifiable" is the key phrase here.  An anonymous
allegation that Bush and Barb do unspeakable things their bedroom is
much harder to verify than the location of Jimmy Hoffa's bones.

The weekly posting for alt.whistleblower will contain an exhortation
to include such information as can be verified without requiring the
accused party to admit to something.
