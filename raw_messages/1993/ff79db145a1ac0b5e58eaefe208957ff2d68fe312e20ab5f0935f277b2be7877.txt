Does anyone know of C source code for low speed CELP or vocoder
software available on the net?  

I feel if we can develop even a low-speed software based answer to
the secure-phone, it will probably be used and distributed to many
people.  I think it would have to be based around the soundblaster
card though.

Perhaps we can also devise an internet secure-phone standard, and
clients can be written for NeXTs, Suns, PCs, and etc.  

I've had no luck getting our SparcStations to decompress ADPCM encoded
Internet Talk Radio in real time...either the software I have is truly
sad (could be), or we need to look at other compression methods
such as CELP, or at worst, vocoder.
