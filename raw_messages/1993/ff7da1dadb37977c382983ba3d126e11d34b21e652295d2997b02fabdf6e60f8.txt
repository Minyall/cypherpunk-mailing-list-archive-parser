Even as a former 'hacker' myself, the second to last person I would
trust not to install a backdoor (next to the NSA) is a hacker.

In addition, merely having been a systems hacker hardly qualifies
one for writing complex crypto software.  Without any assurance as
to the authors' qualifications for writing a crypto package, or
their integrity.  Even if I could trust their integrity, I'm very
leery of black-box software.
