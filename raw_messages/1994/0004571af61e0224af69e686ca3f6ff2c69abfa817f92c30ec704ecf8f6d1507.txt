I think, that the original poster forgets the fact, that "Clipper"
isn't just the Skipjack encryption algorithm implementation. Thus
to compare Clipper to a chip that implements _only_ IDEA isn't
very helpful.

If one wants to imitate the Clipper - one will have to provide
_all_ of the external functions it performs, and it doesn't
matter at all, what encryption algorithm is implemented
deeply inside. Of course, if the "internal" key is
longer, than the "system standard" - you'd have
to expand those 80 bits, let's say via running
SHA over it...

There are problems, but this isn't one of them (:-).
