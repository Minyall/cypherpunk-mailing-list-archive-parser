Given that this is a public forum, is it a good idea to announce that
you are going to lie about Clipper?  Next time Tim May (for example)
is on a radio prog talking about Clipper, he is wide open to the question
'Why should we believe you? Your group advocates spreading disinformation
doesn't it?'

I agree that this should be fought, but I would be cautious about announcing
tactics like this to the world.
