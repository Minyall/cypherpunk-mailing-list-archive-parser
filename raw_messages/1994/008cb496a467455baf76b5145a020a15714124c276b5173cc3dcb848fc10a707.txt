Whats going to happen when direct satellite phone service becomes a
reality ( as in the joint Loral/Qualcomm effort ) ?

When one notes that it is difficult to impossible to prevent service
stealing in the cellular environment, how will it be prevented in
direct broadcast?

It might not be possible to detect unauthorized encryption schemes
without direct monitoring.  

Do the Feds think this is can be won?
