    Some of the peace movement folks I've hung around with over the
    years were part of the "Resist paying taxes because they pay for
    the War Department" movement, with various methods of not paying
    ranging from public refusal to working in the underground economy
    to making less money.

Yup.  There's also at least one couple who have been resisting
taxation for several decades using the only fully `legal' method --
they give away, in a deductible manner, any money that would put them
above the `poverty line'.  Of course, this method makes it more
difficult to play with computerized crypto :-)

BTW, has the LP made any `official' statements on any of the legal
issues relating to crypto?  If Howard Stearns is elected, will NYC pot
holes be filled with Clipper chips?  (BTW, isn't the LP
anti-death-penalty, unlike their NY gubernatorial candidate?)
