Backfire on whom? 

Sounds to me like cold feet.  If you don't want to run a remailer and
put your actions out in the world, don't.  Very simple.  If you don't
want to take the heat, fine.  No one said you had to.

But don't expect anyone else to follow you.

You do sound a lot like LD.  "I'm right.  Everyone should do it my
way.  I'm going to throw tantrums until you do.  And if you don't I'm
just going to take my ball and go home."

You can escape your true name with cryptography, but not your own
psyche.
