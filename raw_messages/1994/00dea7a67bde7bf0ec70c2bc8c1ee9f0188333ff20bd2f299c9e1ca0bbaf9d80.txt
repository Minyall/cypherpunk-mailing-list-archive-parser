I've had quite a few messages requesting ghostmarks, and I'm responding 
to each of them. For the first few days (at least) I'll be sending a few 
(less than 4) ghostmarks to whomever wants them (and starts up their 
"electronic wallet" -- the client software). 

send me mail with your clients' key to redeem my startup offer. 

Remember, if you want to bet on the sonics/nuggets game, the deadline is 
3pm PST. Stakes: 20gm. (you need not have a client key already generated 
to enter this drawing)

if you have any questions about how to use my bank or where to get the 
software, feel free to mail. That's what I'm here for.
