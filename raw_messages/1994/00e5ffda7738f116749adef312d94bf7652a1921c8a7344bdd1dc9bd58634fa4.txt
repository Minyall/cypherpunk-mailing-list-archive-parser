Roger, you ain't no mad dog libertarian if you haven't read "The Moon
is a Harsh Mistress," by Heinlein of course, and from whence came the
popularizaiton of of TANSTAAFL--There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free
Lunch.

I say "popularization" instead of coinage, because Goldwater use a
variant ("There isn't...") in his 1964 campaign, reportedly written by
one of his speech writers, Karl Hess. (The same Karl Hess who is
involved in libertarian matters.)
