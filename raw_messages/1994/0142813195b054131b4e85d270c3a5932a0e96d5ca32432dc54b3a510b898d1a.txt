Hunh.  I'm surprised that you would select a fixed medium (CDs) for a
variable information source.  How often do you plan to press new CDs?

Would it not be simpler to use steganography to encode the desired
information into GIFs of, say, US weather maps?  These maps are revised
quite often and it would be natural to send person X a new weather map every
day or so.

Yes, as we all know from past discussions, it's possible for someone who
knows what you're doing to recover the data "hidden" in the pictures.  But
how likely is that to happen?  What's the cost of this (or another non-
media-dependent solution) versus the complexity and cost of using CDs as
your transport mechanism?

[About the CDs: what will the sound like when played on a normal CD player?
Isn't this likely to attract attention?]

All the world's a stage and most of us are desperately unrehearsed.
