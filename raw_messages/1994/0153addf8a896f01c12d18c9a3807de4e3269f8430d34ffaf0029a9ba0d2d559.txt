No problem -- just add them to the killfile.  Sure, new `rogue'
remailers could slip by, but so can any fool with a telnet 25.
Participating remailers would have some assurance that they're
not sending material from someone in the source killfile.  Non-
participators wouldn't, and could take the moral high-ground
all they like.
