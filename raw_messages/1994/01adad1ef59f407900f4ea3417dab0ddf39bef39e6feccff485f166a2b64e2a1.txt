Greg Broiles <greg@goldenbear.com> offered,
"I suggest that remailer operators might find it useful to redirect
remailing requests originating from Detweiler directly to
postmaster@lance.colostate.edu."

Here are results of a somewhat unfair but curiosity driven experiment. I
have got to admit I agree with the postmaster, but I figured it was worth
a try. They are reproduced without permission.

Like it or not, this is a free country where the right to free speech
is highly valued and protected.  I will neither endorse nor censor
anything posted to a public forum by any user from this site.  Unless
some law is being broken or some other user's individual rights are
being violated, I don't want to hear about it.

You may stop now.

I believe the best way to deal with net.pests is to ignore them.
When they realize they are talking only to themselves, they will
go away.  BTW, his name is not Lance.
