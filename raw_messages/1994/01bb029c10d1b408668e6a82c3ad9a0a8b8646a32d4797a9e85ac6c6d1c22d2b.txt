You are displaying not inconsiderable ignorance about Time magazine
and about such polls.  "Time" isn't terribly highbrow -- we aren't
talking "The Economist". Furthermore, Time/CNN polls are random sample
phone polls conducted by random sample by a fairly prestigious polling
company and simply stuck with the Time/CNN "brand name". Those polled
would not have been "Time" readers. Although you are correct in your
later assertion that the information may have been presented in a
slanted manner, it is likely that the sampling and statistical
techniques were rigorous.
