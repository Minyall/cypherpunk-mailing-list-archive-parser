Would the "boys and girls" with this choice be the users or the comm
equipment manufacturers?  If the users, the system would become that
much more user hostile (already a big barrier to common use of crypto).
If the manufacturers, the system would not be practically different from 
today's, where manufacturers are free to choose their encryption method 
but get leaned on by the government in various ways to use weak methods.
