Gee, what about POTS?  Oh well, I guess we'd better make sure that you
can't dial the phone without first entering your personal ID code;
otherwise, Junior might be able to dial up 1-900-BMY-SLUT.

And cable TV?  Nope, can't switch on that cable box without first
keying in your ID.

Hmm... NYET to censorship?  Ok:  No thanks, NYET (or maybe, niet,
spasebo, NYET).
