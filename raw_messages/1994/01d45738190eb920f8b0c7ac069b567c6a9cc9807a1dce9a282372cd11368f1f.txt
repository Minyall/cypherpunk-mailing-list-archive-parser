Evidence, how did the cases the FCC brought turn out?

If the network had used commercial radio licenses, how much more
would it have cost them (per node; I have a vague idea of the
size and power of a random Amateur Packet Radio node (in computer
terms and cost))?

Would this have given them greater immunity in prosecution?

(Hmm.. if you're passing it on, you're broadcasting it? Could
encryption tech be used to "enhance" APRN to give sysops "plausible
deniability?"
