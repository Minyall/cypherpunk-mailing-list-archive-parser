MacPGP, available by anonymous ftp from the soda.berkeley.edu site, is
the only one I know of using public key methods, and hence the only
one of real interest to Cypherpunks.

Commerical products (like the various "Kent Marsh" products) are
mostly DES-or-weaker and are oriented toward local file protection.
(MacPGP will do that, too, of course).

About six or seven years ago I bought "Sentinel," from SuperMac, and
used it a few times. The problems were obvious: lack of other users
(so my friends couldn't receive or send), and the symmetric cipher
nature (we had to share keys for a message). Public key systems based
on PGP have solved both problems (though problems of convenience
remain).
