    Are there any implementations of DES-variants that use variable S-boxes?

Well, if you don't use the DES S-boxes then it isn't DES :-)

Variable boxes tend to weaken DES.  The DES S-boxes were chosen to
make differential cryptanalysis difficult.  Random S-boxes don't tend
to have this desirable property.  Use IDEA.
