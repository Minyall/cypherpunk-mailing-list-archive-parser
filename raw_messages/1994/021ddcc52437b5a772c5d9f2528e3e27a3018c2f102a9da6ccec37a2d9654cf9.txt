Tim,

Looks like Berkeley Breathed stole your idea re: The Information Highway
Patrol. There was a rather hilarious spoof in this Sunday's comic strip
'Outland,' complete with CHiPs-like CyberFuzz arresting the tykes
for reckless abandon on the Data Highway.

Rich, very risch stuff.  ,-)

Cheers.
