Currently I have information on the high tech methods for the following
states:

California
Ct
Florida
Hawaii
Illinois
Maryland
Mass
Michigan
NH
New Jersey
New york
Oregon
Penn
Texas
Virginia
 
Alberta (Canada)
British Columbia
Military ID
GB European Union Model
 

In many cases, the information is insufficent, so I encourge anyone
who hasn't to submit the information even if your state/prov./country
appears on the list.

The most important facts seem to be

1>  State
2>  Month and year of issuance
3>  Is there a bar code?
4>  Is there a Digitized photo or merely a polaroid?
5>  Is there a magnetic strip?
6>  Is there a hologram or such?
7>  Was the license mailed or given on the spot?

Anything else important you feel you should add.

When I have around 30, I'll post the list.
