In the latest issue of Scientific American there is an article on quantum 
computing and how the first working machine is to be built in the 
immediate future. This raises dark portents in my mind when one considers
the rate and the size constraints on such devices. We may be looking at a 
technology birth which will allow brute force computation of RSA style
algorithms and their cracking. 

As an aside in a Physics mailing list I subscribe to Rajashi Roy from 
Georgian Tech supposedly has managed to synchronize two chaotic lasers
which would provide a basis for a optical one-time pad system.
