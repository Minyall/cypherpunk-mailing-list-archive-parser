nobody says:
Is there someone out there who would like to act as a broker (for a small
fee, natch), so that I can maintain rigorous anonymity while trading?


This seems like a good way to earn some ghostmarks! I'm sure *someone* 
will take you up on this offer.

Alternatively, you could perhaps do business through the penet remailer...?
