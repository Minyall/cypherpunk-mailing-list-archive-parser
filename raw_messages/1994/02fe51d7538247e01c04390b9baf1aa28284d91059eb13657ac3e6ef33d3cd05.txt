Hey, I've just been told in e-mail that my $200,000 figure for the
Clipper keys (a tape or compilation of the ones that are held in
escrow) is way too low, probably by two orders of magnitude.

Maybe so, as having these keys could mean a lot.

But my point is that nearly any such figure will represent an
incredible temptation. Such is the risk of any centralized system in
which a master key (or set of escrowed keys) unlocks such valuable
information.

And my point is that just the _rumor_ of such a black market may be
enough to destroy what little confidence in Clipjack already exists.

So, let the bidding begin! (But don't send your bids to me,
personally.)
