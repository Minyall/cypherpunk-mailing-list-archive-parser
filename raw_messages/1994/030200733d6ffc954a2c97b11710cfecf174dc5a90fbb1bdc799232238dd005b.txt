C'punks,

If you live in the NYC area or will be visiting this coming
weekend, you are invited to a Cypherpunks get-together.  We will
be meeting at Linn & Barbara Stanton's apartment on Saturday from
noon till whenever.  The Stanton's live at 315 W. 106th, Apt. 2A
in Manhattan.  This is between West End and Riverside.  The
nearest subway station is on the 1 and 9 lines at 103rd.  If you
need better directions, call them at (212) 316-1958.

We will actually start at noon, so plan to arrive sometime before
that hour.  Everyone should eat first or bring some snacks with
you.  Later, if attendees want, we can have food delivered or go
out for dinner afterwards.

Though I will attempt to hold court, I expect it will be every
bit as anarchistic as the Bay Area meetings.  Anyone wishing to
depose me, is welcome to do so.  If someone has something for the
"agenda," let me know when you RSVP.  Or don't.

If you are sure, kinda sure, or think maybe you will attend
Saturday, please e-mail me at this address.  (If your message
bounces, try ssandfort@attmail.com).  Give me your best guess on
the likelihood of your showing; I'd like to have a reasonably
accurate estimate of how many we will have.  Please feel free to
bring anyone you think might be interested/interesting.  If
possible, let me know that too.
