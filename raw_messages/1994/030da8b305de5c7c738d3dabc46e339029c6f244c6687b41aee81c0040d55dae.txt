I generally speaking am leery of arguments from how well manufacturing
can be done -- especially since manufacturing might someday be done
perfectly using things like nanotechnology or even primitive
percursors like placing your atoms for your quantum dots one by one
using atomic force microscope tips (our own Tim May once proposed
constructing scanning grids of such tips for such purposes.)

On the other hand, I've still yet to hear any good commentary on what
Shor's result really is and what sort of techniques it depends on.
