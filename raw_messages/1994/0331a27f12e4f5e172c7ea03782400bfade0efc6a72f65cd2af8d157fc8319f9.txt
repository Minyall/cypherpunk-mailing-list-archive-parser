Some do; see for example http://northpole.net/buttons.html (as noted by Hal
Finney previously).

Wired is tired. Someone should call them on this.

Incidentally, I just tried to get into HotWired using the "cypherpunks"/
"cypherpunks" combo I recommended to Amanda earlier this evening. It didn't
work. I'm just about to re-register cypherpunks on it, so don't be surprised
to see a verification key sent to the list soon. I'll summarize to the list
once the new membership seems ready to go.
