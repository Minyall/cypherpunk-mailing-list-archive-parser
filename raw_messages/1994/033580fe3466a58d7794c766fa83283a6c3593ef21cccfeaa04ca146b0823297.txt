<<CLIPPER COMPROMISED?  "Security Insider Report," a monthly newsletter
published in Seminole, Fla., has reported that government officials are
seeking to determine whether former CIA employee and alleged traitor
Aldrich Ames may have sold information to the Russians about the
government's secret key-escrow technology used in Clipper Chip chipsets
and Capstone Tessera cards.  The secret key-escrow technology, dubbed
Skipjack, can be used to encrypt network voice and data.

Hahaha!!!!!  This is really great.  In the least this puts a bit of
a delay in the clipper-release, and gives us a bit more time to get 
more people to oppose it.
