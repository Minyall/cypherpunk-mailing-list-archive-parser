werner asked,
"Can a remailer be used to post to an arbitrary Usenet group?"

newsgroup@news.cs.indiana.edu posts things quickly via e-mail. When I
use anon.penet.fi for Usenet, I often use this, since it is quite a bit
faster than using anon.penet.fi's posting feature.

"Is the above a stupid question?"

Is this a stupid answer? Both are in various FAQs.
