I saw the following on imp-interest, and thought somebody here might
be interested in responding (perhaps?)...

PS: She has David Chaum's internet address by now, I'm certain...

I would like to explore the issue of digital cash in my next issue of The
Internet Letter. I am trying to contact David Chaum but don't have his
e-mail address, so I'd appreciate any help in making contact with him.

I'd also like to get a grip on some of the issues involved in developing
digital cash as well as the status of work in this area. Who else should I
talk to?
