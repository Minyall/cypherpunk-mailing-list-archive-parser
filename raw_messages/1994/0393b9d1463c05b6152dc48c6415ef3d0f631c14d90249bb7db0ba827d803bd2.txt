What you've got here is very similar, but you've added a very
interesting slant to it.  The cost of setting up a prepaid mailer (at
least in terms of distributed compute power) appears to be pretty
high,  but the security you gain from it is likely to be worth it for
certain applications.  I'll have to spend some time studying this.
Very interesting indeed...
