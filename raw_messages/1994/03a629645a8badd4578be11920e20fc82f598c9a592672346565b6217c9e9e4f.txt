Site name may be true, but there is no insurance that the user ID is 
right.  IRC asks the client for the username at startup.  It is possible 
to recompile IRC and have it search for a environment variable containing 
the user ID you wish to use (or put it on the command line if you like.)  
I have done this myself.
