Perhaps not yet on the Internet but there sure is a lot of 
ascii-interfaced net.gambling going on internationally. The best example 
might be the currency market. The major Swedish telecom supplier Telia 
(until some years ago a monopoly like Ma Bell) recently entered a two-
page ad in the biggest papers boasting of their bandwidth capacity ("we 
already have what the US is planning"). As an example of the usefulness
of this technical superiority they announced that Stockholm players on 
the fast-moving net.markets had some 3-second lead in certain areas that 
could mean a lot of opportunities.
