Well, I would imagine that it would be GCHQ in that case, but nevermind.
MI5 is the UK equivalent of the FBI.

In the case of an Australian mentioning something the NSA did not want
mentioned, I would point out the existance of the UKUSA agreement (on which
Australia is a signatory).  I doubt that the DSD would contact anyone,
they're rather pleasingly careful about not exceeding their charter.  However,
I would not be surprised if ASIO made a phone call and asked someone to
cease and desist.
