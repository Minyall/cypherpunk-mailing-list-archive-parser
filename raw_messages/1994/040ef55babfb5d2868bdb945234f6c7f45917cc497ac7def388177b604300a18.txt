I've often felt that the solution to this problem is that citizenship 
should not be given by birth. Everyone, whether born in the US or abroad, 
should have to go through roughly the present process to be granted 
citizenship. I'm explicitly including required study of US history and 
taking an oath to support the Constitution.
