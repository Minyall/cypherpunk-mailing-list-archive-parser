You can be a member of the communist party, actually, although many
laws holding that you can be harrassed by the government for it are
still on the books. Sexual relations are governed by state law, so
only in some states are consentual acts illegal -- in many all
consentual acts between married partners are legal. However, the point
is well taken. The U.S. is not a libertarian paradise.

I will note, however, that the U.S. has far better press freedoms than
almost any other country on earth, and that Germany is pretty damn bad
about freedom of the press. I can walk into any book store in America
and buy a copy of Mein Kampf -- and although I hate Adolf Hitler's
works, I am happy that I can read them if I so choose. I cannot do
things like that in Germany.
