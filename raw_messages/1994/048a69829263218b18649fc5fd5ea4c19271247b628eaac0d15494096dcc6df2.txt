I believe that real business will be done over the Net using EDI or some
derivative. Given the Net's many security holes, cryptogrphy is needed
for both digital signatures and to ensure that my business plan doesn't
show up in my competitor's inbox.

Most of this could be done with MIME, DHS, DSS, and PEM, if those standards
ever get deployed to the "widespread" user community. But we cypherpunks
must, at least, make sure that the weaknesses in the standards are exposed
and corrected.

I personally think stealth PGP is the wrong direction. Widespread, blatent
acceptance of PGP by the 10 million PC users with modems will do more to
guarentee the legality of PGP than all the CSPR petitions. (Hey, I sent in
mine too, I just don't think that a few thousand voices will be heard)

Digital money is another thing. I think it is great. I'm realy to put $1000
real US dollars into the first bank that has digital money that I can sepnd
on real things. We are probably a ways away from this, but Pr0duct's work is
a great step forward.
