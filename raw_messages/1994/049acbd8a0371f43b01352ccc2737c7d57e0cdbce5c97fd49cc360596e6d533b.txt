I don't think so.  There might be some aspect of the "escrowed" keys that 
would allow them to be accessed from duplicates or some other end run.  
The question should include inquiries that address the accessibility of 
the keys outside of the "warrant issued upon a showing of probable cause" 
view that many people have fallen for.
