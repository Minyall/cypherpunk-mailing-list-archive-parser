Something better?  I guess most of us think that "something better" would
be _not_ having increased penalties for criminals who use cryptography in
their crimes.
I'm certain that this was the "something better" Mike was suggesting.
What rationale is there to have increased penalties for using cryptography
to commit a crime, any more then there should be increased penalties for
using computers at all?  (or do you think there should be?)  What reason is
there to have increased penalties for using modern technology over using
older technology to commit a crime? Using modern technology is somehow
"worse" then using older technology?

Should we have harsher penalties for someone that uses a getaway automobile
after a bank robbery, instead of trying to get away on foot? That might be
a better analogy to what's being proposed then Mike's sarcastic ones, if
you really want a good analogy. Automobile technology surely makes it
easier for a bank robber to escape from the crime scene and not be caught,
just as cryptography surely makes it easier for someone selling drugs to
close a deal without being caught. So if that somehow justifies harsher
penalties for crimes committed with the help of cryptography, does it also
justify harsher penalties for crimes committed with automobiles? Why not?
