I dunno.  Has anyone succeeded in doing that?  I can't recall 
ever getting a chained and encrypted message posted through soda.  
Messages sent there as plaintext seem to get posted just fine.  
Could it be that:

1.) They wont post CHAINED Usenet bulletins, or;

2.) They are rejecting messages encrypted with PGP 2.3a rather 
    than 2.6.

Any success stories?
