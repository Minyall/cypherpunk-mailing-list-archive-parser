I'm sure there must be many, many more such gateways out there, if you
know of any, send them my way so I can put them in the listing.  If you
think you have one, but aren't sure, try this: post a message to
alt.test via your mail software (configured to your local machine) and
CC: it to me, so I can see the name to the mail-to-news gate.  Thanks!
