Subject: REMAIL:  Logging turned off

     The BSU remailers are behaving very well lately.  So I am going to 
turn off the complete message logging again.  It appears that adding 
Anon-To did the trick.  Anyone with problems remailing through either 
nowhere@bsu-cs.bsu.edu or remailer@chaos.bsu.edu should first check the 
following finger information before giving up:

	remailer.help@chaos.bsu.edu

	remailer.list@chaos.bsu.edu

     Any requests for help or information will be referred to these 
finger addresses.  If you cannot finger, send an e-mail message to 
remailer.help@chaos.bsu.edu and it will mail you a personalized copy of 
the same file.  :)

     Questions, problems, and complaints that can't be solved with the help 
info provided should be addressed to remailer-admin@chaos.bsu.edu.  By 
the way, there is lots more information available from chaos via finger.  
Try fingering remailer@chaos.bsu.edu for a list of other account names to 
finger.  For example, remailer.policy@chaos.bsu.edu...

     Happy remailing!
