i'm writing a lot of perl scripts that need to interact with pgp.
however, i have not found an easy way of getting a passphrase to pgp
from a script.  i realize of course that this is for security; pgp
only wants things typed in from a keyboard.  however, there are plenty
of times when automated processing is desired, and security of the key
does not need to be perfect.  in these cases, the only way (it seems to
me) to get pgp to work is to setenv PGPPASS, which is really terrible
security.  is there a better way to do this?  will there be some
easier way in future versions of pgp, like being able to read
the passphrase from stdin?
