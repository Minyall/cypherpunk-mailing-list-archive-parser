For the Alison Armitage fans out there (YO! Sandy! :-), the local
snoozepaper TV listings indicate that she's going to be co-host(ess) of an
athletic competition program called (stand by....) BeachClash.  Guest
athletes compete against regular cast ("Hardbodies" with names like Ripper,
Breeze, and Zuma) - Beach Blanket American Gladiators?  Appears to be
nationally syndicated; might be worth looking into (pun intended!).

Here in the Dallas area, the new program is already slated for the old
H.E.A.T. timeslot (midnight!); haven't found out where H.E.A.T. went off to....

Hmmmmm.

Athletic competition.

Alison.

Beach.

*drool* :-)
