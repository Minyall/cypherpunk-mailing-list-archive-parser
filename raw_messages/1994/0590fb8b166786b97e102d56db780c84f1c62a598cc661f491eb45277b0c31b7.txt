I'd say the obvious next step is a lawsuit -- at this point there is
standing and little point in accomodating the clowns.

I've already offered Phil a donation towards this suit, and if he
chooses to pursue it I encourage others to donate money towards it as
well. In my opinion there is no more important action this year in the
area of cryptography than Phil's export license request.
