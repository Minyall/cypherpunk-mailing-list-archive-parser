An amusing possibility has cropped up.  While looking at a motion
to dismiss the AA BBS (porn) case, it dawned on me that the same
aggument might apply to exporting crypto.  Namely NAFTA seems to
have negated laws which interfear with free trade (with some minor
exceptions).  I will post the full text of the motion to the list
later today or tomarrow.  Keith
