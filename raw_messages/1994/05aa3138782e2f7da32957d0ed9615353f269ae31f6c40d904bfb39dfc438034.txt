Are there any cypherpunks remailers outside the US and Canada? Having a
message cross multiple political boundaries makes it much harder to trace.
A remailer with a return receipt would be nice too. This is a multiply
encrypted message back to you, which could be attached to your outgoing
message. When your message reached the last remailer in the chain, that
remailer would send the receipt back to you through a different route.
This would eliminate the need to ping a remailer before using it. Pinging
a remailer can leave a trail back to you.

With the current remailers, you can change the subject as the message
propagates, by putting
Subject: blah blah
after the request-remailing-to line. Is there any way to send a message
to multiple recipients at the end of the line? Multiple request-remailing
lines don't seem to work, nor to requests separated by commas.
