Actually, it's a bit more than a "little bit of hardware".  One of the
interesting realisations of pondering VLSI crackers was how much chip
real-estate storing 2048 bits of laregly static internal state required,
disregarding the size of a 2048 bit bus (remember "transistors are cheap,
wires are expensive".)   All transfers would have to be multi-cycle
operations, which adds complexity due to the need to time and synchronise
these transfers.

It's by no means impossible, but the design of such a device is
certainly not a trivial exercise in engineering, and I would never call
the result a "little piece of hardware".
