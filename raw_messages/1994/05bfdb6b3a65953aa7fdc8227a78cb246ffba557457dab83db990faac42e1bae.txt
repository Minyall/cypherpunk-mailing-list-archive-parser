OK, but one of the main characteristics of electronic cash is its anonymity.
If we don't care about serial numbers we can just use an RSA-signed message
from the bank saying "I'm worth $1.00" as the cash (at least in an on-line
system).  The whole reason we go through the blinding rigamorole is to make
it so that the cash is unrecognizable after transfer.  That is why I keep
raising the issue about recognizability.  You are probably right that most
people wouldn't care, though.
