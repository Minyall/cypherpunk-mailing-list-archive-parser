Good point about the source of the appended bytes.  The reason I think it might
be more secure is that the length of the appended segment is less than the
length of the key on each pass, so it would seem to be the equivalent of a
one-time pad for those relying on the appended bytes to get the key.  That is my
only basis for not worrying about wekening effects.  Any holes?
