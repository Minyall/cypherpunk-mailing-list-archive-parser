Speaking of the exportability of cryptography textbooks, I've filed a
15-day Commodity Jurisdiction Request with the State Dept for Bruce
Schneier's book "Applied Cryptography". No official response yet,
though I did get a phone call from an amused Commerce Dept engineer
who wanted me to know how much they enjoyed my filing (I did have fun
with some of the sections).
