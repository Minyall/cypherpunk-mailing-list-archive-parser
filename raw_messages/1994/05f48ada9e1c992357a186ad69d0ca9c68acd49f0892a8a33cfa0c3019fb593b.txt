PLEASE READ!  (sorry to shout)

All subscription requests should be sent to cypherpunks-request@toad.com
This is an address that is personally handled, by hand, by Eric Hughes
(thank you, Eric :-)  I may take upwards of a week for Eric to process
request, as he is a busy man (boy, do I know the feeling).

If you want more information, I suggest you go reread RFC's 1325 and
1396, as well as FYI 17 about mailing lists.  These are available via
anonymous ftp from venera.isi.edu:/in-notes

Thank you!
