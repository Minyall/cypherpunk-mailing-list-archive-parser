Several easy ways to avoid this:

1. No reason that "N messages in, N + M messages out" can't be a
common occurrence, e.g., dummies. (Messages will in fact get absorbed
by sinks, so dummies/padding/MIRVing is expected anyway.)

(And the values of N and M will have scatter anyway.)

2. Or could delay one of "other" messages, inserting the
locally-generated one. (Pushes the "problem" to next transmission, one
could say, but I doubt it matters.)

3. Circulate dummy messages into one's won remailer, replacing the
dummy with the "real" message. N messages in, N messages out.

4. No reason for the "N in, N out" approach anyway, as a probabalistic
method can be used, with the (dreaded) "random delays" used. (Provided
sufficient reordering occurs, as we've discussed so many times.)


I don't think it's likely that all remailers will have some fixed
policy for the value of N.

This has always been a likely possibility, but not tested in court. 

Logging is a VERY BAD THING, though I understand why remailer
operators feel compelled at this point to do it. (I don't run any
remailers, so I won't moralize...the point about it being a very bad
thing is in terms of what a "mix" is supposed to be. People should go
out and find Chaum's 1981 CACM paper, which has been referenced so
many times.)

Forward security, a la certain Diffie-Hellman protocols, is needed. A
true Chaumian mix does this with some security hardware
(tamper-responding modules), and the DC-net approach eliminates even
the need for TRMs.
