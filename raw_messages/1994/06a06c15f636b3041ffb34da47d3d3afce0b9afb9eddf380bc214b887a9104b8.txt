I remember that little dustup in alt.config.  A single newgroup was
barraged with 9 or 8 rmgroups, along with an extra helping of flame.
FWIW, alt.numbers.random wasn't the first group proposed... it was
something like alt.numbers.interesting (followed by suggestions for
alt.numbers.odd, alt.numbers.even and so on).

Sending another newgroup will probably have as much effect as the first
one did. :-(

I suppose alt.is.doomed could be used for a pool.  I can set an
automoderator daemon on it.

OBcypherpunk:  Matt Blaze's paper (_Protocol Failure in the Escrowed
Encryption Standard_) is only available in Postscript format.  But at
my local Kinko's, the fascist session logging utility doesn't seem to
notice that 'copy /b a:eesproto.ps prn' in a DOS Prompt window causes
printing to happen. ;-)
