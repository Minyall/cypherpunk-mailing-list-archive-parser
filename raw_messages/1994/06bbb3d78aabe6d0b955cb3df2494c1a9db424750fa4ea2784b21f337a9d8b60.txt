According to netfind, eng.dowjones.com and dowjones.com are DJ's sites,
and wsj.com is WSJ's. They aren't real hosts; they are registered domains,
so mail should reach.

IAC Walter Mossberg is at 360-2227@mcimail.com, according to KIS.

I'd have thought that members of this list are more net-aware than most;
able at least to use netfind and the KnowBot...
