	Yep.. sorry about the confusion.. I wiped the first msg.. and
only had your reply to go on.  

	Now on to the topic at hand.

	I always associated flames with rash, unfounded accusations..
It's ok to confront.. |-]

	No, verifying identities [even pseudonyms] is fine.. if you
trust THE LIST.. which is also fine.. but it does leave a gap.
[note: this filter approach is similar to the Clipper chip in that
       it provides a [possibly] false sense of security -- if people
       want to filter what they see, trust in themselves and don't
       filter what other people see]

	  This also eliminates anonymous postings.
Well.. unless the filters are willing to let all messages that
are from people NOT registered with THE LIST thru..

	If THE LIST wants to tack on a little note at the top of
every msg saying "VERIFIED AUTHOR WITH LIST DATABASE" then fine..
but don't FILTER it.

	a warning from THE LIST, no less.

	If THE LIST can filter msgs by PGP sigs, then so can you.  It
will be no more work for you.

	By trusting validation to just HAPPEN to your incoming mail
on some remote location is ludicrous.

In conclusion. . .  

	All too often people want to patch a problem and have it go
away.. for everyone.  Why don't we make the solution available to
everybody, not make the solution for everybody.

Nice chatting, Robert.  I'm sure I'll be seeing more.  TTFN.
