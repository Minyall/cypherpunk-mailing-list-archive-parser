Actually, no, it's not really a forward of anything at all.  It's just
that this forwarding business is *really* getting out of hand.  For
Christ's sake guys, if *you* can read stuff on other groups, credit
us with the intelligence of being able to find it too.  If this keeps
up we'll have the who 20Mb/day of usenet funnelling through cypherpunks.

How about in future just saying "Hey, anyone who doesn't know about
talk.politics.crypto, go have a look at it on usenet.  By the way
there's an interesting thread going on just now about blah blah blah."?
