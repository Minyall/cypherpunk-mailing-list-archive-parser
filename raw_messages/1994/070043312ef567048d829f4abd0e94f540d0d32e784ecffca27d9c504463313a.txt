The mag strips are only for ease of use.  They contain the same info that 
is on the front of our liscence.  Earlier on there was a discussion about 
how you can really piss cops off if your card doesn't read, because they 
have to write it all down by hand.  

Also, what we they do if you accidentaly erased that strip, arrest you?  
Many people are ignorant of the fact that magnetism erases the info on 
that stripe.  Is it your fault if the stripe losses even one bit of 
information that might cause it to read incorrectly?
