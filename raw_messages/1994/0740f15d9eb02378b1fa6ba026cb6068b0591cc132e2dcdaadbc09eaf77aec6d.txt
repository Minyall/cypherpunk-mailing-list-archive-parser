"I'm not sure their economics can float that well either - if it costs
$500M to build, and holds 1000 people, that means $500K/person....

Does it not seem that they are putting more effort into the publicity, 
marketing, & attraction of money for support of this virtual country, 
than into the establishment of other fundamentals?  Like: setting up an

business with the rest of the conventional world, and resolving the 
many little problems that would be of concern when living under such 
conditions?
