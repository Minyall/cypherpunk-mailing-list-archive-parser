The problem I have with this is that there is no such place as cyberspace.
I am not in cyberspace now; I am in California.  I am governed by the
laws of California and the United States even though I am communicating
with another person, whether by postal mail or electronic mail, by
telephone or TCP/IP connection.  What does it mean to speak of a govern-
ment in cyberspace?  It is the government in physical space I fear.  Its
agents carry physical guns which shoot real bullets.  Until I am able
to live in my computer and eat electrons, I don't see the relevance of
cyberspace.
