Yeah, sounds like a clean sweep. I spent Saturday afternoon trying to
get the mbone working on my workstation. I was unsuccessful. (It
hasn't worked ince I upgraded to a Sparc 10, not that I spent much
time on it before). I strongly suspect that our $#@!! firewall was to
blame.

Puncturing fascist firewalls was one of the reasons I suggested swIPe
in the first place...
