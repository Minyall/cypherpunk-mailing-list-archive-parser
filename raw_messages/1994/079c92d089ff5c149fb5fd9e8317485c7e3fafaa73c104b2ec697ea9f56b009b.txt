Illegal betting is merely illegal.  Murder is also immoral.  

This really does make a difference to reputations.

For example if you have a criminal record for shoplifting a
packet of cigarettes, most bosses will not hire you.  But
speeding or even drunk driving will not seriously affect
your employment prospects.

Similarly tax evasion convictions seem to have little effect
on ones credit rating.
