The MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour, a PBS television show (for you non-U.S.
residents), has a good report tonight on the black market in Russia.

Mostly an emphasis on the "shuttle traders" who take chartered flights
down to Dubai and stock up on massive amounts of stuff to sell back in
Moscow. (An inefficient system, compared to the systems of shippping
and mega-malls we have, but encouraging to see.)

The traders then pay off customs inspectors, etc. Apparently Russians
are doing better than official stats would indicate, similar to the
way Italians are much wealthier than tax stats would suggest.

I was heartened to see this report. All Cypherpunks, of course, are
encouraged to see thriving black markets (or markets of color, to be
politically correct about it).
