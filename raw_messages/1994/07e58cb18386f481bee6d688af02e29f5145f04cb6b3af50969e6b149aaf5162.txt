The problem is not freedom and diversity, but assholes.

Those who did the most for freedom, got the pants flamed off them.

Namely TC May, and Netscape.

Tim was flamed for not having the latest and greatest hardware  --
thereby allegedly holding back the revolution, though his hardware
and software is typical of 99% of the net, as I determined by
looking at the way in which binaries are posted.

Netscape was flamed because the first encryption that they 
implemented was not in accord with cypherpunk priorities (It was
in accord with commercial priorities, as it should be.)
