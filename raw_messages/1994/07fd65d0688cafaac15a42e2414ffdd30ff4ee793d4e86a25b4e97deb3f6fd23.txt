This reminds me a lot of the language used when describing the changes
in FOIA policy, which was something like "The agencies are supposed to
be good, but if they're not, this change doesn't change your ability
to do anything about it."

Is this a Clinton administration policy to make such feel-good,
govern-bad pronouncements?
