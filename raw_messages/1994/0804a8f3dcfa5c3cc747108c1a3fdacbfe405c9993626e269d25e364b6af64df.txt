No it is not.  This is the second time Clinton has lobbied the Saudi's in
favor of US companies (the first was when he helped McDonnel-Douglass and
Boeing get a $6B contract for jet transports.)  The other companies
competing for the contract were Northern Telecom (Canadian), Siemens AG
(Germany), Alcatel NV (France), and Telecom AB L.M Ericsson/NEC (joint
Swedish and Japanese venture).  As long as the U.S. still has points in the
region it seems reasonable for us to use them in favor of US companies,
doesn't it?

(which has the PGP article in it so you might want it anyway :)
