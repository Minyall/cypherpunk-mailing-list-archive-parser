Wow, I never knew that... then again, since Disney is its own government,
I should have expected as much....

Here's another idea... in terms of spyproofing one's house, how about

rigged to an internal alarm... Ifg a lot of these detectors go off, 
the folks inside can be fairly sure of some weirdos outside...
