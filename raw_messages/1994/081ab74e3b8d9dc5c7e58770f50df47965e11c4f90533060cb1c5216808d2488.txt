How come people in law enforcement are calling for us crypto junkies to
help them by giving up crypto (especially when that's useless, since
criminals don't need us for their crypto) ?

I've heard DERD and Co. ask us (me) to come up with a compromise stand.

Well -- here's mine:

NSA can do cryptology in secret and we won't try to pry it out of them.

We'll do cryptology in public and publish it, give away code, etc.

We'll be good citizens and join the local Neighborhood Watch, etc., calling
the police to report lawbreaking which we witness.


What more could possibly be expected of us?  What better way is there to
support law enforcement?
