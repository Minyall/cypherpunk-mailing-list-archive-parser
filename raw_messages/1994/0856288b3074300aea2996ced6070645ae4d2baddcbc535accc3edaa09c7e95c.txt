Yes it is, although I haven't seen any posts from "Tommy the 
Tourist" for several days, now.  A test post sent a few days ago 
has still not shown up.  Also, there seems to be some sort of 
problem with soda's public key on chained remailings.  Even when 
the Usenet gateway was operational, chained posts where the 
message to soda was PGPed seemed to go into the bit bucket.

Also, FYI, Matt Ghio's remailer now offers Usenet posting as 
well.

Through the magic of dual entries in a Domain Naming server 
somewhere, no doubt. Next time, you might try the new "csua" name 
and see if that's working, too.
