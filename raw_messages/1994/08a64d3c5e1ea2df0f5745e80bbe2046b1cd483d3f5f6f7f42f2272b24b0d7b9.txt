When I mean "hasn't been applied", I mean as in it doesn't seem that
anyone has been prosecuted explicitly for crypto export. The
regulations deal with lots of other things as well (export to Iraq,
Libya, <insert bad guy of the month> and export of nuclear and
munitions et al) and it's sure to have been enforced on many other
points.
