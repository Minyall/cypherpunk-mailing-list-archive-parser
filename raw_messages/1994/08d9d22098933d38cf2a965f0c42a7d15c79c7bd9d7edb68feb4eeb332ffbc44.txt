This makes sense..  A signature is a binding between a key and a
userID.  If you remove that userID, then clearly the signatures
binding that userID to the key should be removed as well, since
otherwise they are binding nothing.

What should be available (although it is not implemented) is a userID
revocation, where you can basically send out a messages that will
remove userIDs from a key.  Then again, signature revocations should
be implemented as well...

Hope this helps.
