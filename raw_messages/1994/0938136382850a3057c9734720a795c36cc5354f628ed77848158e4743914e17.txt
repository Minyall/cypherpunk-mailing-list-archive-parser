     The Eudaemonic Pie by Thomas A. Bass (Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston,
1985), in chapter 6, discusses the various systems used in beating 
roulette.  It gives the names and dates of people who have beaten the
system through the use of martingales, biased wheels, and computers.  An
interesting book, highly recommended that you check it out.
