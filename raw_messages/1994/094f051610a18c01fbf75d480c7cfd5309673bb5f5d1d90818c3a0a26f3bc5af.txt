Yesyes, you're preaching to the choir.  I want information to be free
too, etc.

It just occurred to me that by tying the decryption to a time server
and sending both the timebased key and a complete algorithm to 
a general purpose engine that you might get something somewhat effective.

To give an example:

12 years ago I worked in a computer store that sold Atari computers.
I learned to program on my Atari 400, cassete, Basic, assembly, etc.

I used to have fun 'breaking' the copy protection on game floppies.
There were some sophisticated methods that a number of companies used,
but I could eventually disassemble and follow the code and patch it.
(Blue Max was the hardest I cracked: 5 stage load, several
multi-sector-with-same-number-same-track protections, and executing
code merged from two such sectors).

The one disk that I couldn't crack (and I still have it) was the ABC
Basic compiler.  The compiler was compiled with itself.  Since the
assembly was just a general purpose engine, I had to follow the
p-code/tokenized Basic all over the place.  I could never keep track
of it long enough to solve it.

If an algorithm is only good for a perticular copy of a document and
only for a short time, the theoretical possibility of cracking it
becomes harder.

I want to explore what aspects can be solved and what can't.

Obviously you can always take a picture of the screen, possibly
capture data in the window/operating system, etc.  But, with
a modifed X, unmodified OS, etc., how close can you get.

Unless each document uses it's own key and randomly selected
algorithm(s) and needs online access.

Of course, that's always a problem, unless things are priced per use
so that it's more attractive to pay.

Of course, I didn't say it was necessary...  Just musing how effective
it would be.

I agree.

Come on guys, I don't post that much, but you need to crank up your
Devil's Advocate detectors.  Geesh, doesn't anyone like a good
argument anymore?  :-()
