I heard last night the the 3rd Battalion of the 12th Special Forces is 
at Moffett, and that they wanted to modify a building to allow repelling
practice.

I personally can't think of any reason for an elite fighting force to
be stationed in an area of urban sprawl.

Has anyone noticed any other elite forces being located in high population
areas?
