	I don't quite understand exactly what your server does, but
there exists a server which provides anonymity by leeching off a
standard server.

	For example, a user desiring anonymity would do:

/server irc.caltech.edu

and then

/server anon.irc.host portnumber

	And if there is one of the anon servers running on that
portnumber then the person appears on the irc completely
identity-protected.
