The way I read it, he was concerned about including the hacked versions
under the "PGP" banner. With this, I agree. PGP and prz will always
be inseparable, and I sure wouldn't want someone to take something of
mine, change it into something I didn't like, and keep my name on it.
As a matter of respect and decency for anyone's work (and especially
prz's), a separate and distinct identity should accompany the changes.
