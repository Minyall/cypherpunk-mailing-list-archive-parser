   I don't see the point in forcing everyone to patch their binaries or
   recompile from source - does anyone else? Bidzos & Co. are certainly smart
   enough to anticipate this step. What's the catch?

I'd guess that it was a face-saving negotiating point.  RSA was
screwed to the wall because MIT has fair use on the PKP patents since
the invention was performed there.  The restrictions on the fair use
are so broad as to be meaningless.  So they threw him a bone...
