Man, when I got this post, I just about fell off my chair laughing.

No, that's a 'kraken'. :D

No, it's 'Kragen' rot13'ed, with a 'c' added to the end. :D

So?  Are you suggesting that being 200 miles away rather than 1000
miles away makes it easier to get a fake account?

Well, you see, I associate with people who think in the ways she is
accustomed to thinking, and I can see the beauty in them.  I suspect
that most of the cypherpunks don't.

No, I've been on the list as to1sittler@apsicc.aps.edu, xentrac@(I
can't remember).unm.edu, and here, since right before clipper broke.
This doesn't, of course, prevent me from being LD.  But I'm not.

Eric Hughes might remember me.  In fact, he might even give me the
"most abusive unsubscribe message" award. *sheepish look*.

LD thinks I'm Eric Hughes.  If you like, I could email you a bunch of
messages I exchanged with him one midnight.

Gee.  I've never been accused of being Larry Detweiler before. :D
