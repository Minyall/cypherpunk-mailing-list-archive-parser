I just pick a sentence and use either the first letter of each word or the
last.  If I pick a verse of a song that makes it easy to remember.

If you're willing to chance a little less security of the phrase, pick one
from a book or CD you have near your terminal - I have four or five hundred
paperbacks within 10 feet of my terminal.  It is very easy to remember "book x,
chapter 5 paragraphs 8 through 12."  If you feel paranoid, add 1 letter to each
of the letters derived from your special phrase or some similar modifying
function.
