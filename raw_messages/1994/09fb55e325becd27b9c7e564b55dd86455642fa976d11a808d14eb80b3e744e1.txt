What I was discussing are "pre-paid" calling cards.  You can buy Western 
Union cards at any Western Union representative office.  AT&T cards are 
available at AT&T Phone Stores.  Other brands are also available .  I  
recently saw another such card being advertised in the camara section of Pay 
Less Drugs.  I also mentioned another brand (Telekey) in one of my "Norman 
French" articles in MONDO 2000 last year.  Their phone number is (800) 
776-5424.

You buy them with cash.  They each represent a pre-set number of minutes 
in an already established account.

They can be used from any phone, but since you have to call an 800 number 
to use them, some record of your calling number may be captured by ANI 
(Automatic Number Identification) and kept by the card company.
