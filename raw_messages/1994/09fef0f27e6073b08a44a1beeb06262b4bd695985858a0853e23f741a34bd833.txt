   Yeah and since when has this country been so easy to quit and find a new 
   job with the same relative pay???? Do you think it's that easy??? Uh I 
   don't think so.. duh huh... I can't even get a summer job working at a 
   computer store and I'm very computer literate for my age. 

Did I SAY that it would be easy?  But nobody will stop you from
quitting a JOB.  A government may well try to stop a citizen of its
country from leaving.  That's my point.
