1.	I'm not a fan of key registration

2.	If it were forced down my throat, I want to make sure that
	the escrow agents can form a list of people being tapped so that
	they can detect abuses and possibly notify those tapped that
	they've been compromised.  They can't do that without either an
	ID of the equipment owner or some communciations/routing path
	which can map from equipment ID to my addr/phone/e-mail (to
	notify me).

	In other words, I want to see this hypothetical escrow agent
	(or one of the many) as someone protecting my rights against the
	interests of a tapping agency.
