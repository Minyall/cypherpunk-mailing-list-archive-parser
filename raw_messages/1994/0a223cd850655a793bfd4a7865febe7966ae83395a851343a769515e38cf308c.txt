This must be deliberate misinformation.  It is relatively easy to
make two explosive lenses that are exactly alike.  It is extremely
difficult to make two explosive lenses that differ by a precisely
known and constant amount.

The security in a nuclear weapon could certainly be defeated by
physically ripping out any encryption electronics and replacing
them with electronics with known and simple behavior.
