Have you seen the proposals for an encryption option for TELNET?  There 
are at least two proposals.  The first is by David Borman dated April 
1990 and the second by Lawrence Brown and Gilje Jaatun dated December 
1991.  Borman's proposal focuses on the possibility of encryption of 
passwords only.  Unfortunately I don't have a pointer to an electronic 
copy of these proposals -- perhaps someone else on this list has?

I am currently working on a project which requires encrypted TELNET.  We 
will be encrypting *all* transmitted data to protect sensitive 
information -- not just passwords.  Does anybody know the current status 
of standardization of an encryption option for TELNET?
