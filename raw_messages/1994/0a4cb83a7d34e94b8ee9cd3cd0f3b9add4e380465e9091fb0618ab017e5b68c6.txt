The IRS made bearer bonds illegal about ten years ago.  It seems
people were using them to evade income tax.  I believe they are
forbidden within the United States and U.S. citizens are forbidden to
own them at all anywhere.

Bearer bonds are still widely used in Europe.  They are liked because
they simplify payment and bookkeeping - nobody has to go through a
transfer agent to exchange them.  Problems with theft and fraud appear
to be manageable.

There was an interesting case a few years ago when somebody tried to
sell stock in the United States which was convertible to bearer bonds.
Is it legal for a U.S. citizen to hold the stock if she or he does not
convert it into a bearer bond?  I don't know what the court decided,
but the fact that the case was brought makes me think the authorities
are pretty touchy on this issue.

But, there might be some legal variant of the idea.
