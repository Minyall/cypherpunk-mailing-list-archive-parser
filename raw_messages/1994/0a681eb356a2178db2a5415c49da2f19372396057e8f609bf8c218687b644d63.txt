Any number of persons had mentioned the use of a SoundBlaster board for
use in a secure voice application for PCs.

In the February 17, 1994 issue of EDN, there is an article entitled 
'Speech-synthesis and -recognition chips personalize consumer products'
by John Gallant, Tecnical Editor, starting on P. 27.

There is a company mentioned, ESS Technology, Fremont CA, (510)226-1088,
that produces two Sound Blaster register level compatible chips, the
ESS488 (without music synthesis) and ESS1488 (with music synthesis).
The ESS1488 will run on 3.3 or 5 volt Vdd, and appears to be intended
for portable computer applications.  Cost per ESS1488 is $18 (presumeably
in quantity).
