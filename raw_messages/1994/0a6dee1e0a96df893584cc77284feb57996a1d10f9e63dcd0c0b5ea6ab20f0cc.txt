[following up on the above message of mine earlier....]

Romana has asked me to pass along the following:

  In this month's issue of Photo/Electric Imaging,  Stego is featured as an
  ideal product for "watermarking" digital images.  A commerical photographer
  pointed out the article to me.   This magazine is available at major camera
  stores such as Ewert's in San Jose - I haven't  dropped by to pick up my
  own copy yet. I was polite but icy to Mondo folks when they inquired about
  Stego, sent them the same info that I send everyone else, but pointed out the
  exceedingly poor research they had done for _Mondo's Guide To The New Edge_,
    and expressed a hope that my product would not be similarly treated.
