According to the Toronto Globe and Mail, Sat. November 26/94 edition, we
now have another politician to lobby online.

Ontario Premier Bob Rae has publicly advised that his Internet address is
premier@gov.on.ca

I'm sure that all  citizens of the Internet will welcome Premier Rae and his
efforts to bring Ontario online and into the 21st century.

And I'm equally sure the cypherpunk anonymous remailer system will get used
more frequently.....:>
