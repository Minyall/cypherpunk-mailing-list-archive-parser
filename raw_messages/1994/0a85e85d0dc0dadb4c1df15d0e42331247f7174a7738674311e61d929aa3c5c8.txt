========

We need 'nyms with electronic reputations, and true electronic cash to
protect the "real" us from things like CompuTrace (not to mention the
USPS practice of selling to junk mailers whatever info you give them on
address change cards).

The alternative is yet another law...

I don't know whether to applaud the House bill, or curse.  Anyone have
the bill number?
