	Hmm.. this would allow us to prove that THE LIST thinks he's
who he says he is.. or who THE LIST tells us he is.. Now, I am not
paranoid against THE LIST, but I suggest that THE PEOPLE should
not filter THEIR thoughts.  What of censorship [on an aside, is there
a censor apprenticeship?  Why the 'ship?']!?  If you must censor.. 
censor your own messages with filters running on your own machine..
maybe even publish your filter list to the net so we can all understand
each other.  Remember that there will always be a percentage of noise
in any public forum.. there is no average without these outliers.  
For a group SO interested in RANDOM numbers, some people sure do want
to organize everything.  TTFN.
