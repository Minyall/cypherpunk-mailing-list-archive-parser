Confront them with annihilation,
and they will then survive;
plunge them into a deadly situation,
and they will then live.

When people fall into danger,
they are then able to strive for victory.

Crypto defies fascism when it is widespread and solid in the citizenry.
If enslavement is the ability to stifle speech, crypto is the liberator.

I think the dismissal of the NSA is premature.
I think the rumors of the NSA's death are greatly exaggerated.
I think the focus on the NSA in this group over looks more dangerous threats.

Crypto helps, but it's not the end all.
Why ask for trouble on the assumption that the intelligence agencies are 
fighting a losing battle?  Especially when the assumption is dubious.  
Digitel and Clipper could turn the tide very quickly.

Perhaps a more public NSA and FBI could be more dangerous to liberty than 
hidden ones?  It's certainly much easier to apply influence in public 
than in secret and behind the scenes.

I'm not sure how much the NSA needs to adapt here.  I'm not sure those 
who would resist centralism and regulation WANT the NSA to adapt.  
Considering the way in which AT&T fell into line I wonder how poorly the 
NSA, and the administration, are doing.

If anyone doubts that the administration and more importantly, the 
Congress, still finds use for intelligence agencies try to get a copy of 
today's M&L news hour.  (4/28/94)



Foreknowledge cannot be gotten from ghosts and spirits,
cannot be had by analogy,
cannot be found out by calculation.

It must be obtained from people,
people who know the conditions of the enemy.
