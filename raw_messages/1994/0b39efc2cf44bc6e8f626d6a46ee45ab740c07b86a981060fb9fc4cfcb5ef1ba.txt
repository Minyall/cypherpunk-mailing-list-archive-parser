More to the point, if anyone out there happens to be a Mac programmer, are
you joining the MCIP to create a street smart interface? And if not, why
not?

:-)

Our main concern is ITAR and we are getting legal advice from a team of
lawyers, well versed in such matters.

MacPGP2.6 will indeed arrive, but it will be the same old beast. We will
likely use it as our short-term crypto engine. MacPGP2.6 is a dead end
though. PGP3.0 will be turned into a Mac system Manager, adding new
routines to the Toolbox. There will also be an Apple Events Linker with a
nice interface (to replace MacPGP2.3/MacPGP2.6) for normal programmers and
script writers to use. A system-wide menu will get your girlfriends to use
PGP with you, FINALLY :-). Drag-and-Drop and "Vaults" for the Finder
(thought the Menu could also act on Finder selections, but that's another
hack since you guys at Apple wont tell us how to get that info, not to
mention how to put up a system-wide menu!).

Whoever wants to see what we're up to ftp to ftp.netcom.com in /pub/mcip,
and grab MCIP.pictures. There's a bunch of project literature there
including a list archive and list of members.

I heard about MacPGP2.3aV1.1 appearing on ftp.netcom.com in /pub/mpj/...
but I can't find it in Europe yet. I mailed Christoph about where he put
it. He says he's updating it and will release source, but I heard that in a
copy of mail one of our members had with him. No word on the existing
source being available overseas, which is rather odd, since it came out of
Germany.
