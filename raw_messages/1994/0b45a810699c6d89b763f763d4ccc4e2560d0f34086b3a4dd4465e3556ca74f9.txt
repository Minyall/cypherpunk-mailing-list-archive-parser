"And Now, For Something Completely Different"

I wish all subject fields in msg headers had two parts:

   1. the THREAD begin referred to.
   2. the SUBJECT of that particular msg.

That way, I might be able to follow some of these discussions better. Sure,
I can hear you saying it right now: "Jeeze, Dave, dontchaknow MIME can do
that?" Sure, but we all know that's beside the Real Issue. We on this list
once, looong ago, experimented with META: prefixes to do this, but no one
here (or anywhere, to be fair) seems disciplined enough to stick to this.

I don't have any proposal anymore. I gave up on trying to fix the world a
long time ago. I just struggle along with everyone else and occasionally
whine a bit to my Congressperson. No that's a lie: I'm MAD as hell and I'm
not gonna take it anymore! Yeah! That's it!
