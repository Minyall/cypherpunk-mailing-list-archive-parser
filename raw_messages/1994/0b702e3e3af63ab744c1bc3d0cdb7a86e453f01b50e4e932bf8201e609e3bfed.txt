So if a majority of your neighbors voted to have you executed and your 
property divided among them, then that would be OK by you, yes?  After 
all, you say that "the majority can't be wrong".

The problem here, as illustrated by the quote from 'A Man for All 
Seasons' is that rights must be maintained and enforced *especially* when 
it is difficult to do so. If the government is allowed to violate rights 
"because they have no other option", then such violation becomes routine, 
and soon no right exists. It's rather like being pregnant.
