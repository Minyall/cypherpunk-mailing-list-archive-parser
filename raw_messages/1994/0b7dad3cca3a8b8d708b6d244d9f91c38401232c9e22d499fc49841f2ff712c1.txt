   Maybe a telephony sort can answer this authoritatively, but I think
   the phone company's logs record this information even for flat-rate
   local calls.  If not, you can do almost anything with access to a
   modern switch...

The #5ESS running version 5E8 can log, as a matter of course, the last
sixteen numbers dialed on a phone line.  But as you note, it's all
software.
