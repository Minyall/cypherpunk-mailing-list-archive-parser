I have an amusing note to add to this.  I was talking to a co-worker this 
week about the clipper articles I had been forwarding him.  I told him 
that I thought we would soon have a media saturated incident concerning 
some form of criminal or terrorists.  

The criminal/terrorists would either 
a) get caught, and the feds will claim this couldn't have happened if their
   communications had been encrypted. 
b) a terrorist plot will succeed, and an after the fact investigation will
   show that the terrorists had been under surveilance, but the plot
   wasn't uncovered because of encryption.

Looks like it was A.  At least he doesn't think I'm a complete paranoid 
anymore.
