Eric and Perry have repeatedly used this method -
not only attacking a straw man, but lying outright
that their opponent has *explicitly* proclaimed
the straw man.

I am thoroughly sick of this dishonest debating
tactic.

If someone genuinely believe his opponent assumes
or implies something that is obviously false he
should say "implies" or "assumes"

To say "claims" or "states" is to say something completely
different.

One may be a reasonable inference, as I inferred
that Chomsky sought to justify mass murder and
brutal terror.   The other is a lie.
