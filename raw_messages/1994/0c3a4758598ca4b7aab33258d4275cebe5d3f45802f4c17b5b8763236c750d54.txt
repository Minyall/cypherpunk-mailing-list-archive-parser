Why not just use an encrypted partition. I guess then it is a problem of
not being persuaded to reveal the key. What laws/rights does the user have 
as to revealing the key ? And if the user says "I forget"  what would be 
likely response ? 

How many users would hold tight, from cases I have heard they usually give
in when the stakes are raised.

A while back a local BBS system was investigated, it was amazing to find
that the police had little knowledge of the software (MSDOS and OS/2 - Remote
Acess RA and Front Door) and hardware being used. Apparently the sysop had
the system setup so that he could quickly delete the drives FAT and do random
zeroing of the drives. Although it wasn't performed as they weren't even 
familar with hidden (attrib) directories or using non-printable dir names.
Essentially they relied on information from the sysop to carry out the 
investigation.
