Besides, law abiding citizens should have nothing to hide, right?  So
why should they object?

I think the plan is that, although everyone is allowed to hide things 
from each other, they are not to be allowed to hide themselves from 
their Saviours or thwart the mechanisms which have been implemented to 
identify questionable behavior in times of uncertainty, fear & paranoia.
