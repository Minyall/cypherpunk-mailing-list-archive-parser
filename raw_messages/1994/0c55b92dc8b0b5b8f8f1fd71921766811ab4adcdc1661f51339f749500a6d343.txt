Anyone know the phone number of the cypherpunks list owner?

I have tried for weeks to remove my duplicate email address
entries from the list - probably placed there as a result
of the email list scroggings of late... so far I
have not gotten any response from:

  majordomo@toad.com (reply indicates request forwarded to
		cypherpunks-approval@toad.com)
  hughes@toad.com
  hughes@ah.com

Any advice would be appreciated... thank you.
