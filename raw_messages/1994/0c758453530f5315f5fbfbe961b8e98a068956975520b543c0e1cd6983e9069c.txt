Since it appears that I helped to start this thread, let me do what
I can to finish it.

Responding to some facetiae posted by David Merriman, I suggested:

> Very good.  If I could offer one minor change, how 'bout:

>         Dorothy Denning?  Clip 'er!


Which prompted Phil Karn to inquire:

> Uh, how come we can't stick to attacking the message, rather than the
> messenger?


To which Ed Carp replied:

> Because in this case, the messenger is an integral part of the message.


This kind of parallels my thinking when I offered that
mostly-off-the-cuff suggestion.  I thought David had hit upon a
clever turn of phrase -- a slogan of exhortation to cypherpunks
to truncate Dr. Denning's *influence*.  I did not intend an ad
hominem attack, nor did I expect something that would fit on a
bumpersticker to substitute for rational debate.

As Phil Karn observed elsewhere:

> Dorothy Denning may

Quite right.  Granted, Dr. Denning has lost her credibility with
certain elements of "the crypto community."  Unfortunately, those
folks are not the decision-makers who'll decide the fate of
proposals such as Clipper.  She remains a valuable tool to those
in government who want to advance such agendas.

As Ed Carp commented:

But what better way to blunt her effectiveness as an advocate
than to demostrate the folly of that which she so wholeheartedly
advocates?

Still, as Tim May reminded us:

He is, of course, correct.  And this whole thread has become
a bit of a tempest in a teapot.  I apologize for my part in
what I'm sure many regard as an improper consumption of
bandwidth.
