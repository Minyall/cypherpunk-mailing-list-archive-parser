   Yea, cool stuff, especially if the fax doesen't shrink the transmitted 
   picture :-)  

Shamir's comment on this at his talk at MIT was that the accuracy of a
fax machine in the horizontal direction was much better than the
accuracy in the vertical direction.  If the visually encrypted
document is a text file, you can adjust it so that it's correctly
registered for a few lines, read those lines, slide the key
transparancy by a small fraction of an inch, read the next few lines,
and repeat until you're done with the message.
