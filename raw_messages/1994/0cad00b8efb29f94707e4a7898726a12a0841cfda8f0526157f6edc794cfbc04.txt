Actually, I can think of one major use.  If I encrypt my personal
files, I might want my heirs to be able to recover them after my
death.  For example, I might keep my electronically-encrypted will in
escrow, such that upon my death the keys can be obtained and the
document opened.

This does not mean that I implicitly trust the government to escrow my
keys.  However it does mean that there are legitimate uses for
escrowed technology.  I just think that the government shouldn't be in
charge of it, and that citizens have the right to choose the level of
privacy and security that they desire for themselves.

Just to quickly change the topic, and answer someone's question for
earlier today or yesterday (sorry, I've been really hosed and haven't
had a chance to really delve into the flurry of email that I've
received recently)...  Not everyone on this list is an anarchist.  For
example, I do not consider myself an arachist.  I think some
leadership is needed, since not everyone is capable of being a leader,
and I wouldn't trust just anyone to make decisions for me.  I'm on
this list because I value electronic privacy and encryption
technologies, and I believe that the power of encryption will better
enable the common man to hold his (or her) privacy in the electronic
information world.

Anyways, enough spewing.  Enjoy!
