      We are in a time window now. In a few years at most, remailers &
   lists like Cypherpunks & newsgroups like Sci.crypt may be outlawed.

Outlawed where?  In every jurisdiction in the world?

I would prefer to deal with this situation when it appears likely to
happen and concentrate on achievable results now.  Focusing on the
harder problems of greater repression will prevent useful progress
from being made.
