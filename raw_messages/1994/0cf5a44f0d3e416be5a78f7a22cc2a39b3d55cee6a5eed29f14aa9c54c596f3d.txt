	So:  US users can legally use PGP 2.5.  Foreign users
	can also use PGP 2.5 until the US decides to kidnap them.
	As far as I know there are no laws against sending
	encrypted traffic across the border.  Where lies the
	problem?

With people like me who commute from the UK to the US regularly and
don't particularly look forward to a strip-search and a flashlight
up the butt every visit. (Unless the customs officer is *very* cute...)

This is why I specifically don't want a copy of 2.5/2.6... - and I
can't see any need for it anyway.
