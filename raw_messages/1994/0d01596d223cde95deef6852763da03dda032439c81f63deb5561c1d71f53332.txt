there was a mass unsubscribing, probably from nalbandian.

so it is very likely that you did nothing whatever and 
that no one is pissed off at you.

eric wouldn't unsubscribe you without telling you why it
was happening and asking you to stop whatever it was that
was causing to be frustrated.
