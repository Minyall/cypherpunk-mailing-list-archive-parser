I would suspect because your copy of metamail, which elm's MIME handling
requires, isn't configured correctly.  It works fine for me in elm, and in
Eudora.  If you don't like the way elm calls out to metamail, you can set
the NOMETAMAIL environmental variable (under csh, "setenv NOMETAMAIL"), and
elm will show the messages without calling metamail (which means you lose
MIME capabilities, but if that's what you want....)

The optimal answer is a better MIME reader, but......
