Since when can the government patent its work? I thought that works
produced by government agencies could not be copyrighted or patented.

In any case, they cannot refuse to license a patent, so this isn't
real protection anyway. (The hope behind people patenting things they
may release in the future is to make it commercially less attractive,
not to utterly prevent use.)
