I enjoyed Doug's clear statement on the implications of crypto anarchy on 
society. It should be compulsory reading for all newbies so that they don't
get worried next time Larry Detweiler comes bouncing in raving about EVIL LIES
MURDER and pseudospoofing.

I'd like to point out, however, that crypto anarchy poses no threat whatsoever
to personal or corporate relationships based on physical or other concrete 
identity (truenames). It just makes these relationships _voluntary_ - no one's
_forcing_ you to be anonymous.
