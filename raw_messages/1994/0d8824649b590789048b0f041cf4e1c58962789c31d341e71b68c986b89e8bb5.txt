What worries me is the people who should be on our side who might say;"hey
If Rush is against it it must be good!"  Here's to hoping they have more 
sense than that, but Ihave to admit that if I hear Rush come out on one 
side of an issue I know nothing about, I look at the other side first.

BTW, is there a way to make this whole list anonymous, like having the 
reflector strip the headers or something?  Just curious.
