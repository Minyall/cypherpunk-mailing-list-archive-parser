     Might it be that El Creepo is a _subscriber_ here? If he were, he
could get a list of addresses that people actually _post_ from. That
covers cases like Roy's. Methinks the C'Punks have a Bug in our midsts.
Since C'Punks Write Code, C'Punks also Debug Code, and this Bug needs to
be Squashed. :-)
