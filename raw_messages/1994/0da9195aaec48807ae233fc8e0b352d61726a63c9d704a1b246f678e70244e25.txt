	I seem to have a bit of a problem--

	There's about 4 different public keys with my name on them,
and I only use of them these days. I don't have the secret keys for
the unused keys-- they've been retired to the great bit bit bucket in
the sky..
	Is there some way I can get these keys off the servers?
