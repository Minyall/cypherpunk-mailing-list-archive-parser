"Check the existence" is only used by amateurs.

A typical gimmick, one that I wrote, is get information from the
hardware, mangle it, put it on the stack, and execute it.   And
there are loads of tricks like that that can seriously obfuscate 
code.

No software protection scheme is unbreakable, but it is easy
to make a protection scheme that is not worth breaking. 

Of course the inconvenience to the user may well be such that
it is not worth protecting, either.
