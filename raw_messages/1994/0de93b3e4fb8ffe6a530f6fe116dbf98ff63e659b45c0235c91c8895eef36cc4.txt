Hello,
	I'm interested in what is currently available to protect ones privacy
in terms of encryption and how one goes about obtaining materials.
I also would like to know if this is an organized effort is which outside
programmers can contribute, if so how does one participate? How does one stays
 out of trouble with the powers that be when engaging in such activities, or do
I give the powers that be too much credit? Is there a mailing list or news 
letter available?


thanks
