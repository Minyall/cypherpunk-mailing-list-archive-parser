	I need 2.5/2.6 because I would like to officially &
unofficially encourage users at the hospital where I work to use PGP.
I could not do that when there were possible patent violations hanging
over it.  With new versions without the legal cloud, I will be able to
use PGP for buisness as well as personal use.  I consider that to be a
major enough win that I was in the process of trying to get several
thousand dollars authorized to pay Viacrypt for a 'lab-wide' license
that would have covered all the machines I manage.  With 2.5
available, we can spend that money on some disks.  :)

Politics.  From the greek "poly," meaning many, and ticks, a small,
annoying bloodsucker.
