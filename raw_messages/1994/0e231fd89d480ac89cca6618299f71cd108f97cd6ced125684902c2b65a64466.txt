I know that Majordom will allow you to create a private list.  The list 
admin must add new subscriptions, but users are able to remove themselves 
without admin intervention.  Of course, MD has the problem in that if the 
person requests unsubscription from a different address than they are at, 
it will choke with a 'Subscription not found'.

Also, you can set the list to be completely closed so that persons who 
aren't subscribed cannot post, but that does eliminate remailers from 
contributing.

I don't know off-hand what type of software this list is based on, so 
this is probably all irrelevant.
