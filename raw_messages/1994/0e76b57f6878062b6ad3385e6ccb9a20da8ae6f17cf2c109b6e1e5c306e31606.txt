I sincerely doubt that such a system would be designed or implemented
before the turn of the century.  All one needs to do is take a look at the
PEM key certification authority clusterfuck to see just how difficult it
can be to implment something like this.

The additional benefits that adding encryption to telnet offer is that the
telnet protocol is used in more areas than telnet.  Many programs and
protocols use the telnet system for control channels and other bits so that
a significant change to telnet can have ramifications beyond just the
obvious ones...
