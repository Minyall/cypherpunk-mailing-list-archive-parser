I've recently been asked if there are any differences in key generation 
techniques between US and non-US encryption programs.

For that matter, are there any *basic* differences between foreign and 
domestic encryption algorithms? (IDEA, LUC, etc..?)

I know the question is worded poorly; I'm wondering if there *is* a 
difference (I haven't ever assumed there was).

This is very important and I need a response by midafternoon. :l
