Somebody (who can speak up if he wants to) sent me this advance
program...looks like deja vu all over again.

I've elided all the talks other than those of interest to this debate.

Actually, all the other papers deal with the same ball of wax...it
looks like some serious discussions about "the legitimate needs of law
enforcement" and whatnot have *already occurred*. My guess is that key
escrow is already part of the New World Order (not to sound like a
conspiracy theorist) and that's why the export folks are making
comments to software companies about key escrow.

One big happy police state.
