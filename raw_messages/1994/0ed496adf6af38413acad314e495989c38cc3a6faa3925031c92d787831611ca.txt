Weekly magazines are displayed on newstands for more than one day and are
labeled with the end of their expected display period so that potential
customers will not think that they are out of date. Similarly, people who
have subscriptions should receive the magazine before the date on the
cover. I guess news is like milk: You get it before the expiration date
that's printed on the label.
