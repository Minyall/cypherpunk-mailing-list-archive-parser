I didn't mean to oversell the degree to which the scheme deters
multiple spending.  It doesn't prevent multiple spending.  It
merely breaks the anonymity of the perpetrator if two or more
people he has transacted the same note with break their own
anonymity and voluntarily cooperate with the bank.

There is nothing to prevent you from making N copies of your
floppy, spending each one, and hopping the next plane to
Argentina.  Sad but true.

In the real world, there would have to be some sort of limit on
the number of times such a spoofed transaction could propagate
before being cleared with the central bank, much like
restrictions on multiple-party checks today.  Merchant
cooperation would also be necessary.  Probably easy to get with
the corner store than with the local cocaine dealer.

This is really all I had in mind.  Again, double spending is
discouraged but not prevented.  If you are leaving town and never
returning, you can go on a shopping spree.
