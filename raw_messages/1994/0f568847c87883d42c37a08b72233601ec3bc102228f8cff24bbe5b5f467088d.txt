Yeah, I'll try to play with the math this weekend or something;
actually, Charlie Merritt posted some formulas...

Hm.... I don't think you reduce the keyspace all that much.  The
restriction on e (and d) is they must be relatively prime to phi(n),
and if n = p q = (2p' + 1) (2q' + 1) then phi(n) = 4p'q', in which
case e (and d) can't be 2, 4, p', q', 2p', 2q', 4p', 4q', or 4p'q', a
total of 9 numbers out of the total possible.  I don't remember the
prime number theorem off hand (prime distribution), but for big
numbers the chances of stumbling on the correct d is essentially the
same as just guessing the factors of n in the first place.

There are other RSA artifacts: for example, a message may encrypt to
itself.  But you can minimize this (down to a max of 9 messages if
memory serves) by good choices for p and q.

So, choose good primes :)

Besides, an attacker hopefully won't have any information on the
primes you chose and will be forced to do a brute force search anyway.
