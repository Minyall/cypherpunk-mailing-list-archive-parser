IR scans can be *so* easily messed up that I'm amazed anyone is seriously
suggesting this.  A facial scan can be messed up by downing a cold drink.
Downing a hot drink.  Ambient temperature.  Sweating.  Sucking an ice cube,
though, is one of the easiest.  Or just running it across your forehead and
cheeks.  Even a hat can mess one up as far as recognition purposes go.
