I'm surprised there hasn't been more mention of Ray Cromwell's new
remailer proposal....it seems to have some featrues to increase
robustness and security and to really be a step toward a
"second-generation remailer." Having used Ray's software for the
Extropians list (though I no longer get that list), I look forward to
trying out this new system.

The proof is in the pudding, I guess, so we'll all await the beta
release of this new software. However, a few comments on what has been
described so far might be helpful to Ray.
