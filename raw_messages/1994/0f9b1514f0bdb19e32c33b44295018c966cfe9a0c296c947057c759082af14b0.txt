Many people seem to think I dislike the views of other Cypherpunks.
Not so.

In fact, I find many posters to be refreshingly direct and clear. For example,
I find the view of Jim Hart to be clear, concise, and almost always
on-target.

I've moved him into the category of "must read," along with the other
dozen or so authors here whose work seems consistently of high
quality.
