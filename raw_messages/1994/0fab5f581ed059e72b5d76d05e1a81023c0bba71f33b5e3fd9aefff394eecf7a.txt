I was just sorting through my backlog of paper mail after returning from
a 3-week trip.  I found an envelope sent to me via United Parcel Service
from George Washington University.  Addressed to Philip Zimmermann,
Boulder Software Engineering, at my address.

On the back of the outside of the envelope was a scrawled note,
"UPS sorters love PGP".

:-)
