Few note how much the world has changed since the 1930s, however.  In order
to be able to pay its secret police and welfare clients, the US government
has to borrow about $12 Billion a *day* (averaging National Debt financing
over time).  In addition, the economy is depedent on quite a bit of domestic
and foreign investment.  A totalitarian takeover here would make financing
this debt very difficult and cause capital outflows on a scale never before
seen in human history.

As James Carvil (sp?) (Slick Willie's campaign manager) says - "When I die,
I want to be reincarnated as the Bond Market so everyone would be afraid of me."
