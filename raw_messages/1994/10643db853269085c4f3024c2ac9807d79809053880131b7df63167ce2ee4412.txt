I'm sure this is the case in law, but to take an analogy,
this is like banning employees from *receiving* private telephone
calls. (Email has zero marginal cost to most institutions, as
does a telephone connection). While I am sure there are a few
employers who do ban staff from taking calls at work, I'd
think of them in the "Gradgrind and Gradgrind plc" class and
not expect them to keep their staff long. In fact, I know of few
employers who in practice object to reasonable use of the
phones to *make* personal calls. (The government is an exception,
although the UK defence ministry just worked out that 25% or
so of their phone bill was to private numbers, which may herald a 
crackdown).
