Yeah, I agree.  It always seemed like a tremendous kludge to me.

But anyway...In case my point was misunderstood, I should clarify.  I was
not trying to enforce conservative/liberal distinctions, which (like most
people on this list) I think are fairly meaningless.  The world is much
more complicated than that; though there are minor real differences,
supposed distinctions between "conservatives" and "liberals" are for the
most part an illusion--part of the "spectacle," to use Situationist jargon.
I responded the way I did to John Kreznar's post precisely because it
looked identical to standard Republican-style leftist-baiting, which I
unfortunately see too much of every day on the net.  John cleared this up
in personal email.  Apologies if I misunderstood or misconstrued what he
was saying.
