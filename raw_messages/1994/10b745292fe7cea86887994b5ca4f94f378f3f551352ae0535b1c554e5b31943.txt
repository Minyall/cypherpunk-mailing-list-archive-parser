Only if you're trying to share the port with other functions,
like, ummm, modems, which you'll probably want at about the same
time you want your random number generator.  But if you've got a 
spare slot to put a random number generator in, you could just as well
put *it* in the spare slot, and save $20 or whatever the current price
difference between internal and external modems is.  Except for
laptops, where slots are generally not available (except PCMCIA),
