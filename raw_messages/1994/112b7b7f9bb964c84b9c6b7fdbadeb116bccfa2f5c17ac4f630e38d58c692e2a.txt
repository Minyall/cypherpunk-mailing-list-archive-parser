Yes. John Ioannidis has gotten the code up to 24mbit/sec on
SparcStation IIs.

A 50 Mhz '486 shouldn't be that far off a SparcStation if you are
operating in the right mode...

You don't have to get very obfuscated, but moving the swap in line,
doing a bit of unrolling and playing some games with word operations
can get you pretty far...
