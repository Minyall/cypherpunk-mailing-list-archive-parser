What!? You're going to tell me that a man with your obvious intelligence

The aliens(Skree-nok as they're called) are being kept hostage in order
to prompt their government into transferring technology to the evil NSA
in order to help it.  The Clipper chip was just a tidbit of the power

PGP and the aliens want a sacrifice of 2^10 virgins for this.
