According to what I learned in our "Managers and the Law" class, in
California, for something to constitute "sexual harassment" it must satisfy
the following criteria:

It must be unwelcome (in the eyes of the complainant).
It must be offensive (again, in the eyes of the complainant).
It must be sexual in nature.

Period.

I don't make the news, I just report it.
