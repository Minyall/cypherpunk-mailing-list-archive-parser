For the "book disadvantaged" among us, I saw a reference today to the
California civil code online.  It is at:
http://www.law.indiana.edu/codes/ca/codes.html.  The form of this URL
suggests that other states might be there, too, but I didn't look.
This is a very nice presentation, structured with each section in a
separate page, and a nice table of contents.  I was browsing the
commercial code which has lot sof interesting info on commercial paper
and other subjects of interest with regard to digital cash.
