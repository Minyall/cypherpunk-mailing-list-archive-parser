I was just cleaning up my office, throwing out a bunch of vendor
literature from a recent unixexpo, when a flyer for a product called
"MpScan" from an outfit called "CyberSoft" caught my eye.

This product, as advertised, "automatically searches outgoing email
for company classified material".  Aside from being configurable
to do stuff like block mail to certain addresses, it also " ...uses
the powerful, user-tested CVDL scanning language..." and can generate
"...reports which  can be used to look for unusual changes in
Email usage...". A "version 2" promises "many more feaures using
an AI engine".

All this can be yours for only $49,000 per mail server, or $200,000
per site license.  You get free upgrades until the end of 1997.
