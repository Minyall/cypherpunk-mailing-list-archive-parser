FWIW, my vote would be "autonag" first.

Sure.  I'm not sure the message would get through as you're framing it,
though.  People don't react well to messages that are put too strongly...
a gentle, gradual approach is more likely to get through.  "Cypherpunks
grok the importance of digital signatures" is the message you want to
get through, not "Eric wants to punish people who don't use digital
signatures," no?

Somebody here suggests: "I think he should send everyone who uses digital
signatures a cookie.  A big chocolate chip cookie."  It is understood
that delivery might be a problem.

I can offer habaneros.  It's not clear whether that would be a stick or
a carrot.
