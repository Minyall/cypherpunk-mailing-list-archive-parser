Dear Jason,

I don't think you are neccissarily correct about making an archive of the 
usenet. You may be correct, but I don't believe this point has been 
litigated yet. Furthermore, just because something is forwarded and 
something is archived I don't believe is expressly covered in copyright 
law. Others could argue that postings by their very nature, when posted 
become "public domain", and thus not copyrightable. I practice law, but 
am not a copyright/trademark specialist. Also, as was posted earlier 
someone is already making an archive of the usenet. See earlier postings. 
Finally what is the tangible difference between storing usenet postings 
on a hard disk for an indefinite time, or on a cd-rom, or a cd that is 
re-writable, or tape or any other storage device? Not very much I would 
argue.
