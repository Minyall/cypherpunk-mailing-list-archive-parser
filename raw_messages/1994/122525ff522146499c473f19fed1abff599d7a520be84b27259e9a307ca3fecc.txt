You are correct that in extremely weird cases you are screwed. Such
cases are nearly IMPOSSIBLE to produce in practice. Anyone out there
want to claim that DES and IDEA are inverses? I'll bet a lot that they
aren't. Although in THEORY you are correct, in PRACTICE
superencipherment wins.

Again, you have to do something startling stupid. Ordinary use won't
let this happen.
