What's my legal position if I buy a 'munition' in NY and walk out of the US?
What's my legal position if I ftp PGP from a US site?

Who's violated ITAR? If I have, and it's proved, anything they can do? I don't
suppose India, or any other government for that matter, will extradite someone
for getting something out of the US that can't harm them.

Can non-US citizens file CJ (or FOIA) requests?
