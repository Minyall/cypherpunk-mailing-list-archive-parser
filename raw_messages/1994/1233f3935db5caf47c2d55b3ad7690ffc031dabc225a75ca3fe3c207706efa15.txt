   That's part of it, but the more important binding created by a
   signature is the binding between the userid and the real person.
   Without that binding, the binding between the key and the userid is
   useless.

Nonsense.  You're assuming that the real person wishes to carry their
reputation over onto their key/userid combination.  Perhaps they wish
to establish a separate reputation for it?  And once they've
established that reputation, they wish to change keys?  Might you not
sign such a new key?
