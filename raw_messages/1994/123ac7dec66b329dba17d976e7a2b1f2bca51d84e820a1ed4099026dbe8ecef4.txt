It cannot be done. There is no way to prove that you didn't transfer
some cryptographic credential. The only way to know that you are you
is to check your credentials against unforgeable physical
characteristics. All such characteristics can be used to identify you.

On the other hand, I'll point out that a pharmacist has never asked me
for ID.
