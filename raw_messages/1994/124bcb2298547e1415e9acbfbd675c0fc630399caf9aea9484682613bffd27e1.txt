	Well considering that in IRC you dont have all the neat stuff you 
can do in a MOO, like some people explained with the rows and "speaking 
sticks" ideas.  IRC is very cheap, free, but it is also rather minimal in 
my opinion.

	Well, yes, it's alot easier to get the MOO client, then it would 
be to get the IRC client and compile it on a low quota account wiht 
sysops that dont like IRC at all.  I have tried it before with limited 
succes, and I dont plan on doing it again considering the status that the 
sysops have put it under here.

	My point simply was that MOOs IMO lend themselves to more of a 
virtual reality feel, than IRC does.   I have been on IRC and to follow 
multiple threads on it, and to have a meaninglful structure to the 
discussion, is very difficult IMO.
