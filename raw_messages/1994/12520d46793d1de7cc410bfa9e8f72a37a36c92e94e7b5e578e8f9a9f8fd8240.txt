In Applied Cryptography (at 8.2.5) Bruce Schneier says:
 
"What about encrypting a block once with algorithm A and key K-a, and
then again with algorythm B and key K-b?  Aside from being susceptable
to ... meet-in-the-middle attacks, there is no guarantee that the two
algorythms will work together to increase security.  There may be
subtle interactions between the two algorithms which actually
*decrease* security."
 
Wait.  If applying a different algorithm with an unrelated key might
decrease security, then the TLAs could themselves apply another
algorithm with their own unrelated key as an analysis technique, no?
 
Kent's Hypothosis: Superencrypting different algorithms with unrelated
keys can never weaken non-trivial algorithms.
 
Stacking DES on top of IDEA on top of Ceasar can be no worse than the
strongest of the the set--assuming the keys are unrelated and the
attempted security is not through obscurity and the algorithms are not
so confused as to be each other's analysis.
