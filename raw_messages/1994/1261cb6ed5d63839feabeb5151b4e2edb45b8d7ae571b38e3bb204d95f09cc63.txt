In looking over the FV docs, I found the following interesting tidbit.

----------------------
* YOU shall retain computer data of  all  sales  for  at  least
three  years  from  the date of the transaction. In the event
you are not able to store such information, you  may  contact
infohaus-info@fv.com to make storage arrangements.
----------------------

Interpretation is left to the reader.
