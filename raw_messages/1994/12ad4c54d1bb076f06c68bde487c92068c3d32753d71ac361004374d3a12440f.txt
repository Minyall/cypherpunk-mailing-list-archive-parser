	If it really is public key, and if the keys really are quite short,
	then its probably really *not* secure.  Remember than a 129-digit
	(~425 bit) RSA key was broken in 8 months!  A 384-bit RSA key is
	therefore not secure!

And if the NSA have a million-processor supercomputer, make that a couple
of hours.  Thank goodness it doesn't scale with bigger keylengths!
