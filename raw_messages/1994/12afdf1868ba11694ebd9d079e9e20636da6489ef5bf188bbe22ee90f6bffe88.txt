I'm not sure the point of this entropy calculation.  For the case n =
L/2+1, t=1, it seems to me that the RSA-encrypted session key (sk^e mod n)
is never going to have the high bit set, so with K such messages it should
be possible to tell that something is going on with probability 1 - 2^-K.

If the session key is chosen from [0,L), still the encrypted session
key m = sd^e mod n will be uniform in [0,n).  I don't quite follow here
how exactly we go from something uniform in [0,n) to something uniform in
[0,L), if that is what Eric is proposing.
