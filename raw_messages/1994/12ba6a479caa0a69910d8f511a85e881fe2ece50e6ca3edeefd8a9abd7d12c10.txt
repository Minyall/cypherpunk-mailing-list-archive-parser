   How do you pick the random section in the first place? Oh, I see, we
   use a random number generator!

This has probably been discussed before, but has anyone built a little
device that amplifies the white noise from a transistor junction, and
converts it into serial data?  You could easily build a self-powered
dongle that sits on an RS-232 port and continuously spits out truly
random bytes.

I could probably sell them for $25 if I could sell more than a hundred
of them.  Is there a market for true random number generators?
