To add to Duncan's comments, quantum cryptography involves the
relation between _expertise_ in cryptography and _verbosity_ in
talking about it. The more someone knows, the less they talk, and the
less someone knows, the more they talk.

Expertise x Verbosity = d, where d is of course Detweiler's Constant.

At least this is how I learned it in Crypto 101.

Uncertainly,
