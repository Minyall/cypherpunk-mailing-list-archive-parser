It was first claimed that if (2^n-2)/n was an integer, then n was
prime.  That's false.

561 is the first Carmichael number.  If you replace 2 by any other
number relatively prime to 561, then the congruence still holds.  (The
second Carmichael number is 1729, if I remember right.)  It was
recently proven that there are infinitely many Carmichael numbers, and
that the density of Carmichael numbers is at least x^c, where c is
about .1.
