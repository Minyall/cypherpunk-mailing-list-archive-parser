Somewhat, yes.  As the aesthetics are important to me (which is why
I avoid MIME as a rule), I'll avoid doing a MIME-compliant solution
until MIME is integrated better with MUAs.  Which in practice means
that until it's part of emacs/vm, since that's what I use.  

I'm not currently concerned that the separation be computer-parsable,
as long as it's human-parsable.
