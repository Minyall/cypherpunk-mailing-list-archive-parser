Anonymity.  Digital Cash, in theory, works like Federal Reserve Notes.
Financial transactions can be carried out between individuals with out
a bank as an intermediary.  Therefore, there is no record of the
transaction.  One doesn't have to smear one's fingerprints all over
cyberspace to buy a used bicycle for their child or pay off a Super
Bowl bet.
