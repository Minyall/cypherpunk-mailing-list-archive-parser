Thanks for pointing this out. I wasn't aware of the fact that pgp
encrypting is not deterministic in the sense that encrypting the same
message with the same public key need not result in the same output.

I guess that makes my whole suggestion pointless.

P.S. Pardon my ignorance: Doesn't this scheme you describe above make
the random generator the most attackable part of pgp encryption,
thereby sidestepping the whole RSA stuff?
