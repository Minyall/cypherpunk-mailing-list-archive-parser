I'm not so sure.  The code was released under the GPL.  The names PGP, 
Pretty Good Privacy, and Phil's Pretty Good Software were not.  

People can make anything they want out of the code, as long as they 
also release it under the GPL and call it something else.

Doesn't seem like a major artistic limitation.
