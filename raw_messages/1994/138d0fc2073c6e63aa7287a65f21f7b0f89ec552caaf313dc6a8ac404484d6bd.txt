A judge admonished the police in Radnor, Pa., for pretending a Xerox
copy machine was a lie detector. Officials had placed a metal
colander on the head of a suspect and attached the colander to the
copier with metal wires. In the copy machine was a typewritten
message: "He's lying."

Each time investigators received answers they didn't like, they pushed
the copy button and out popped the message, "He's lying." Apparently
convinced the machine was accurate, the suspect confessed.
