Is there any evidence to link this anxxxx person to the "tuna 
fish" spam?  Given the fact that by doing a "who cypherpunks" 
will yield anyone, including various TLAs a list of potential 
"troublemakers" (by their standards), might this subscriber 
merely be trying to protect his real identity from prying eyes?  
Actually, I had thought of doing so myself, but didn't want to 
over-burden Julf's server with such a high volume of mail, plus 
having the mesages get cut off whenever a dashed line was 
encountered.

FWIW, other list servers have a "set conceal" option which, upon 
request, keeps a person's address from becoming public through 
the "who" command.
