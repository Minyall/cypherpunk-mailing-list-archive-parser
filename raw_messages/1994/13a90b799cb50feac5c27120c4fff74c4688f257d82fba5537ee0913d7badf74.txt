Dan Marner:

|    I would appreciate any pointers to documents, source code or
| programs that deal with using cryptographic techniques to detect
| or prevent modification of executable code. I am looking for

| modifications at run time.

| includes the signature as part of the file. Is this possible with
| any of the common algorithms?

	Tripwire will run as a seperate UNIX process to detect changes
to things that you define.  Most people who use it use it to watch
systems security.  We also use it to watch some software thats being
run through an FDA trial period; we have to document that it has not
changed at any point during the trial.

	Tripwire can be found in cert.org:pub/tools/tripwire.
