	"When the national health care system decides that your beer
is bad for you, they won't make beer illegal, they'll just raise your
insurance rates.  And because you can't protect your privacy they'll
know exactly how much beer you buy."

Substitute your favorite commodity above, such as motorcycle helmets,
condoms, greasy food, cigarettes, or pronography.
