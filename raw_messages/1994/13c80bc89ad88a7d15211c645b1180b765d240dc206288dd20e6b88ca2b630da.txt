OK, so I want to enable the recieving of articles in conjunction with a 
censorship service.  I guess the way to do this is a sig. of the article 
number, as this is the most copact way I can think of.  Does anyone have 
some good ideas for the sig. method?  I was thinking about the government 
one, so as to render patents moot.  

The other problem is coming up with a standard format so that 
newsreaders(for unix, at least 6, for dos, mac, etc) can be easily 
modified.  Anyone have some interest in this?

Lets get the tools of crypto out there in advance.
