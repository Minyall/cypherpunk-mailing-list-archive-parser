	Wrong. If you are using a uranium fuelled bomb, then you are
right. As long as you thump together two barely sub-critical masses, it
will go boom. However, if you try this with plutonium, it will fizzle.
In the time that it takes for a standard gun type triggering mechanism
to operate, the plutonium will become critical, and then release most of
it's energy harmlessly, instead of going super-critical. This is the
reason for using fast-triggering bomb geometries.
