There are no restrictions on importing crypto into Australia, there are
some on export (hardware only) due to COCOM. 

ObBtw, I recently queried our Attorney-General's department on this
topic, along with, inter alia, questions relating to whether Clipper
like systems are of interest to authorities in Australia. The reply,
the AG's Security Division, was that `I understand that encryption is
not an issue' -- but he acknowledged they'd been following the US
controversy.

I'm still waiting for some replies back from another Government Dept
and have a few other avenues to chase up, when I do I'll make available
the information (if this particular geographic oddity is of interest
to anyone ?).

Matthew.
