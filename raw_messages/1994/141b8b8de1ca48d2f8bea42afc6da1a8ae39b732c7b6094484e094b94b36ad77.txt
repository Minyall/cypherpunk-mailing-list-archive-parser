Today, I spoke with Bob Brown, editor of SOF.  He just got back from a 
six-week trip out of the country, so he was fairly fried.  Nevertheless, 
he seemed interested in the concept and asked me to send him a short note 
about my proposed article so he and his staff could kick it around.

I wrote up a one-pager which I will mail tomorrow.  I'll follow up next 
week if I haven't heard from him.

My article will focus is Clipper and PGP, but, I repeat, who the hell do
you think reads SOF?  The correct answer is:  a few professional military
freelancers (mercs), cops and enlisted military types (wannabees) plus a
smattering of TLA folks.  Those care the demographics, friend.
