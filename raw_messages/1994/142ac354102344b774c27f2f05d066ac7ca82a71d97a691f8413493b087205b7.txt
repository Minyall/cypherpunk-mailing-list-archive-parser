But it _doesn't_ quack like a duck; it hoots like a loon.  Credit cards
aren't fungible like cash, they aren't anonymous like cash*, they don't
operate like cash from the cardholder's point of view, and they don't
operate like cash from the merchant's point of view.

If you write a check, instant or otherwise, to provide funds to your
favorite political candidate's campaign committee, and that check is too
big, then the election watchdogs start barking.  If you pass a satchel
full of cash along to the campaign, the watchdogs sleep through the
night undisturbed.  Checks are not cash; there are important practical
purpose for which they differ profoundly.

*I don't see any reason why a credit card couldn't be anonymized, with
some kind of "Julf-style" bank account and an any-bearer-gets-to-use-this
card.  People might want some kind of PIN protection if they're
concerned about losing the card.  But the banks haven't chosen to offer
such a thing, and they just aren't available.
