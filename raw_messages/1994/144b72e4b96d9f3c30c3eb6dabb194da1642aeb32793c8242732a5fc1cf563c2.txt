yep, you're right (like i'm surprised or something, judging from your handle)
pgp won't recognize it if you don't have it on your keyring.  i do work from
a sun and play at home on a linux system.  i have too many keys at home to
make my play testing easy and i got caught in that trap.  it's just too easy
to add a login and start playing with pgp in a simulated multi-user
environment that doesn't have the pitfalls of the real world.
