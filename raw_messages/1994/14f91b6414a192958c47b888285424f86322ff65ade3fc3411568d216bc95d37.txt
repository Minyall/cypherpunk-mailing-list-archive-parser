  Is anyone living in Marin or SF planning to go down to the Cypherpunks
meeting this afternoon.    If so,  I would like a ride.   Please
Email me or phone me at 415-381-5847.    If not,   then is anyone
planning to go to "Kindness" this evening.    I would at least like
to go to that...

John D.
