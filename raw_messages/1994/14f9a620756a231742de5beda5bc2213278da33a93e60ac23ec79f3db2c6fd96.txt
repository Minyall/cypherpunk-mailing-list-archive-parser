I must confess that I, too, let the initial wave of interest in 
Tacky Tokens pass me by, and I find myself without any - and without
any memory of where one gets them. I assume that once upon a time,
they were available from the bank for free ..?

So .. does anyone want to own up to having any? What do you want in
exchange for them? Can/will the bank operator reveal how many tokens
have been distributed, and how many transactions are processed per
day?

Are people interested enough in data havens or postage-based remailers
that they'd actually use them?

(And, re data havens - AT&T plans to offer "virtual storage areas" 
and archival storage as part of its "PersonaLink" online service
allegedly to be introduced this summer. While AT&T may not be 
privacy-friendly, if this works it will set both technical and economic
examples for other, more pro-privacy, services.)
