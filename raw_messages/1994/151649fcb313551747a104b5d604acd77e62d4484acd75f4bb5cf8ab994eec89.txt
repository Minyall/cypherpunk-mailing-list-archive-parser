If you really want to test NSA.  Encrypt some crypto code
with pgp in an overseas public key(IE: non-us) then email the
code to someone out of the us.  This way you will find out 1 of 2
things.
       1.  That pgp is unbreakable by the NSA
          - Rsa with fairly log keys take so much work the nsa
            cant crack it with huge computers.  This is a good
            thing

          - Idea, even though it is new, is a secure algorithm
            for the above reasons

          - You wont get in trouble as you are only sending
            random bits out of the country not code

       2.  PGP is BREAKABLE by the NSA (OUCH!)
          - You get in deep shit!


      or

       3. PGP is breakable by the NSA but they dont tell anyone! (HMMM)

	  - Well this would be an interesting one!

	  - Since they are the ones that imposed the ITAR rule in the
            first place (them or the us gov) they have a prob!  If
            they knew you were exporting crypto because they cracked
            pgp they could not convict you as that would imply they cracked
            pgp and they would tell the whole world what they can &
            cannot crack.  It would be a big bummer for RSA and IDEA
	    but at least we`d know!
