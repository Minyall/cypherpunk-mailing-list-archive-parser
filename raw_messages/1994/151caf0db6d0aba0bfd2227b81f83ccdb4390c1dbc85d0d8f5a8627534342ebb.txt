	Regarding the list going down again:  I was just informed that CERT
	has issued a warning about a security hole in majordomo.  Anyone have
	any info on this?

Yes.  The list owner will if he's on the majordomo list.  He's presumably
upgraded his copy of majordomo about a week ago.  If he hasn't, he should.

PS Was a 22 line message for 3 lines of content really necessary?
