My understanding is that NSC plans to release a Tessera version for
the federal market and a DES version for the rest of us.  This is probably
reasonable - the federal (defense message system) Tessera market is pretty
big.  I don't know if they actually got the federal contract; I seem
to recal hearing last week that the DoD contract for Tessera cards went to
someone else, but I don't remember who.

BTW, I've been playing with a prototype Tessera card for the last couple
of weeks; cute little thing.  Comments to follow shortly...
