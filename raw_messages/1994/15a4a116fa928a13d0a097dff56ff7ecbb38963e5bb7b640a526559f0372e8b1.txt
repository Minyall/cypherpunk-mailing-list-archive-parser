This is the infamous "CERT Monitoring Warning Meme".  Essentially,
it doesn't mean that your administrators *are* going to monitor you,
it just means that you've been warned, so it's not illegal under
ECPA to do it if they feel like, because you consented by using the system
knowing it was one of the terms for use.  Unfortunately, there's no
very good way to implement "Authorized users will not be monitored 
but unauthorized users cracking in will be", which is the real intent
of most people putting up the warning - any system which could implement
that could have kept the crackers off in the first place....
