The point that is being missed is that if a method arrises to crack a n-bit
key there is sufficient reason to believe that it can be used to crack a m-bit
key, where m>n. I suspect that when the algorithm is worked out that it will
NOT be bit length dependant. Also remember where most crypto folks get their 
funding from...Uncle Sam or his kin.
