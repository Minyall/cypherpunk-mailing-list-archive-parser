   I've
   pointed this out before -- unfortunately, the list maintainers don't
   have time to do it. Maybe someone could volunteer to do the change?
   You'd have to talk to Eric Hughes about how to do the work.

Hugh Daniel (hugh@toad.com) is the one who maintains the mailing list
software on toad.com.  Hugh is very busy, so don't pester him if you
don't have something constructive.

For the record, and to prevent future misunderstandings, I don't have
root on toad.com.

Eric
