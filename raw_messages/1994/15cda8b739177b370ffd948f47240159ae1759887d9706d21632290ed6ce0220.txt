Better people make a better world.  A committee should be
formed to develop specifications describing a good person.  The committee
could then launch a program to guide society to a future where everyone
met or exceeded the recommended specifications.

Better yet, why not build your own!

With the growing field of robotics & nanotechnology, you could just 
grow your own version of the perfect citizen (all in your own image of 
virtue&morality). There would be no objections, then, to "frequent 
quality assurance testing to guarantee rapid convergence to the desired 
goals.  [Automatons] who did not meet the specifications would be 
[rewired into] the program."

And there would be no protests or rants regarding privacy, since there 
would be no need, since everyone would be alike and predictable in 
their "values" & "ambitions".
