[Even though I'm no longer on the list, I will continue to forward talk
announcements on crypto-related topics to the list... as long as no one
objects.  As always, if you need more information about this seminar, please

>
>In this talk we consider a new type of cryptographic scheme, which
>encodes visual information (printed text, handwritten notes, pictures,
>etc) in a perfectly secure way which can be decoded directly by the
>human visual system without any cryptographic computations or knowhow.
>We extend it into a visual variant of the k out of n secret sharing
>problem, and analyse the combinatorial aspects of such codes.
>
>Joint work with Moni Naor.

>Host: Ron Rivest
