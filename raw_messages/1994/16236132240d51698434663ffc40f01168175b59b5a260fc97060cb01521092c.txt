	 and I digress wildly:

	 Mid-November, 1988, after the great Morris Worm Stomp[1], a bunch of
	 people who'd helped hunt the Worm were invited to the NCSC[2] to give
	 talks at a "Post-Mortem", as it were. The MIT and Berkeley crowds had
	 the most real technical data on it[3], though at least one of the
	 government labs had done a fair job at decompiling it.

	 The relevant part was that while the NCSC didn't have much useful info
	 on the Worm itself[4] they had *categorized* it, and among their
	 spiffy color slides, they had a "taxonomy" slide which surprised me by
	 including Brunner's worm. The NCSC seems to officially credit Brunner
	 as the first literature reference to the idea...

Personally, I give the credit to David Gerrold, in ``When Harlie Was One''.
Here's a netnews posting of mine that explains my reasoning.
