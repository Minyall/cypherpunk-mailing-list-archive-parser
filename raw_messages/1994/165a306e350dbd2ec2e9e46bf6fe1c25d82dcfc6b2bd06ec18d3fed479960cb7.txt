I don't think this will apply since we are talking about a criminal case
not a civil one. Child custody is a civil issue unless the child is being
harmed and then the acts are criminal. I suspect that no judge or other
body will set a limitation in the case of a criminal case unless the
imprisonment extends past the statute of limitations (if there is one).

Side Note:

Perhaps somebody who archives the list should take this and earlier talk
on the topic of self-incrimination and such and submit them to a law 
journal...?
