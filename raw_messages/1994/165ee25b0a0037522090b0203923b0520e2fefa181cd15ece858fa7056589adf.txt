The rotor machine is harder to crack, and both are relatively easy.  As it
happens, the chaos-based one is the one I just posted about, broken shortly
after it was posted with very small ciphertext-only.  The rotor machine is
broken with a program called cbw (Crypt-Breaker's Workbench), available
all over the net and findable with Archie.  It's straightforward, but
I understand you need to work a bit at it, and it helps to have known
plaintext.  I haven't used it myself, and would welcome insight from people
who have.  The NSA version of the crypt (1) man page had an entry under
bugs as follows:

BUGS
     Uses a Hagelin encryption algorithm.
