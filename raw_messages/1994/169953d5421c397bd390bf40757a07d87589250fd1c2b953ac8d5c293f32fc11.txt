Woops, found this in my archives. Almost a week old, forever in net time.

I did mention something about possibly doing a cypherpunks area in the
Metaverse MOO. I was largely trying to convince someone else to do it.

I have done absolutely nothing on this topic.

ExI Freegate Virtual Branch, yes. A little work on Cafe Flesh, guilty, but
no work on any cypunks game/environment.

I doubt the value of spending much time on a cypherpunk "game" anyway. It's
not like we had to introduce an internet game to the public before they
started to notice it. If someone wants to do it, go for it. It won't
register highly in my priority list, tho.

TTFN
