But is this really true?  If a seller is using the pseudonym just to
defend himself against uninvited third parties such as tax collectors,
it would seem that accumulation of a dossier would be useless as long as
the physical seller can't be found.  What would be gained by
transferring the credential (the evidence of the seller's marketable
skills or whatever he's selling) to a new pseudonym?  I assume that the
seller receives payment by some anonymous method, perhaps electronic
cash.  Am I missing something?
