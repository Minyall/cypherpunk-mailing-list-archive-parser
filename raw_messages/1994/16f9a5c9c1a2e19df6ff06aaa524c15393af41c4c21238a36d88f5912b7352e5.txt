I can see the advertisement for Cosmopolitan magazine...

  "I was talking to very buff beach volley ball player on my Clipper phone. 
   (He's just a friend, really!) We talked about the strength of
   the Malibu sun, what to do when sand gets in your sun block and
   whether California roll sushi was really invented there. Then
   I tossed in some  Navy blue words that will make
   those NSA spooks blush coral red. I'm just a flirt... but I guess you
   could say, I'm that COSMOPOLITAN girl."
