I take it you mean recompile the binary every time?  Because you'd
need to have source around to recompile it from, and the attacker
could modify that source even more easily than he or she could hack
the binary.  The idea is to make tampering with the binary detectable.

Ultimately, the aim is to make it too difficult to break and thus cause
most people to give up.  I am pretty much certain that to make such
a system perfectly secure under these conditions is impossible.  What I
am aiming for, I suppose, is to make sure that there are no trivial attacks
which could compromise security.  If you've got a system admin who is
willing and capable of hacking exec in the kernel, then it's time to
move systems. :)
