I'll consider doing this after a whole bunch more stuff is developed,
like checking for digital signatures on posts and delaying those
without them.

We're now running majordomo for the list, so if these features get
added to the standard majordomo distribution, we could more easily
deploy them.  That's a hint, since I have higher priority things to
work on.
