There was supposed to be an exemption for temporary export of
cryptography by US citizens for personal use overseas. At least it was
announced last spring by Martha Harris at the State Dept.

There's some confusion about whether the exemption ever actually took
effect; the current consensus appears to be that it has not. So I
guess you still have to go through the formality.
