This is a reply to Sgt. Harlow's message about Banyan Vines:

Of all the methods the military uses, they are all jammable by
one means or another given enough effort, right?

There's no totally non-blockable means of communication available
to the military or civilian sectors, is there?

Trying to get back on topic,
