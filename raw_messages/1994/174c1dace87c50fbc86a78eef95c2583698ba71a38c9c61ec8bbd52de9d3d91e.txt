As Tim mentions, lots of people have talked about doing this, but few
actually have.  Nevertheless, the device is still needed and no one
has done it.

I estimate you could sell 500 at $50 each within four months if there
were PGP support for it.  And I'll give you advertising space on the
archive site.

Real random numbers should be a standard part of every computer.
