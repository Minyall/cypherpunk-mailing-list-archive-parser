There are three different problems here:
- Doing secure programs without the RSAREF implementation of RSA;
  this has US patent license difficulties unless you buy their stuff.
- Doing secure programs without the RSA algorithm - other public-key
  methods are available, such as Diffie-Hellman, though RSA has
  a lot of technical advantages for many applications.
  PKP/RSADSI own patents that expire in 1997 that they claim cover
  the whole field of public-key crypto, and nobody's challenged the
  breadth of those claims in court.
- Doing secure programs without public-key algorithms at all -
  you *can* use secret-key algorithms to do security, as long as you're 
  willing to do key distribution by some usable but inconvenient method,
  and security systems like Kerberos can do this.  But Public-Key 
  variants solve a lot of the technical difficulties and make 
  implementations much easier.
