Hal Finney brought up the problem of securely wiping files stored
on a "compressed" disk a la Stacker, DoublesSpace, or (in my case)
SuperStor.

I have modified (my copy of) PGP so that the wipe function uses
pseudo-random data rather than zeroes to over-write files.  This
change -should- appear in the next release of PGP.  It's a fairly
simple change. I'll supply source diff's on request.
