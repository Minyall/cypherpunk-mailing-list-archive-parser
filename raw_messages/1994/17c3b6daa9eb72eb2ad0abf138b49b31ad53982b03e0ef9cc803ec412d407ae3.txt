The article contains a serious inaccuracy -- it credits Adleman with
having invented the term "Computer Virus", when, in fact, it was
probably John Brunner in his novel "The Shockwave Rider" over ten
years earlier. It also inaccurately credits one of his students with
developing the first one as a test, when in fact they existed for a
long time before.
