I have recently started exchanging e-mail with the Technology Writer  
for the Dallas Morning News (Tom Steinert-Threlkeld).  He is  
interested in new angles for Clipper/Tessera articles.  


He is currently looking for opinions on whether Tessera (or a  
sibling) will be/could be used in the U.S. Card mentioned in  
yesterday's RISK column.

If you have anything you would like to say about this, send it to me.   
I will collect the replies and forward them to Tom.  Indicate in your  
reply if you want me to withhold your name/eaddr.
