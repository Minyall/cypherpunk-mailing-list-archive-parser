Go to it, then. I'm not jaded, just well-aware that most of what is
now floating around the suddenly-trendy idea of the Digital
Superduperway is little more than hype.

Misplaced zeal, confusing tangential developments with real progress.
Much like libertarians assuming the space program is something they
should somehow be working on.

Pizza Hut is merely taking orders a slightly different way. Nothing
more, and nothing to build on. In fact, working with them would of
course slow down real efforts, as one got stuck in the cheesy workings
of an encrusted bureaucracy.

But don't let me discourage any others from putting on a chef's hat,
slicing up some pepperoni, and helping them get "on-line."
