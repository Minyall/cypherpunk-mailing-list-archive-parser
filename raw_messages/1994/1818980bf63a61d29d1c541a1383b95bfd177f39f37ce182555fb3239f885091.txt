Hmm.  I had thought about using "valuable," but that seemed too ambiguous.  
"Negotiable" maybe?

It's not entirely a fiat value; in effect, it's backed by the strength of the 
economy.  The difference between a ruble and a dollar was not the fiat value 
(they were the same, as I remember), but in the fact that it was a lot easier 
to exchange dollars for real assets.

For the record, I think that going off the gold standard was a bad idea, but 
growing up in the days of double-digit inflation probably gave me a biased 
opinion of floating currency.

I didn't say that the government had to be the agent of such an exchange.
I can buy real assets with my dollars, but not with Confederate dollars.
While it has been somewhat eroded since the start of the Drug War, dollars are 
still exchangable for real assets, even though the government is no longer 
backing them directly.

Little plastic tokens that are accepted more places than the government's 
paper and metal ones.  If it quacks like a duck...

Exactly.  On the other hand, with real-time clearing (which the Internet
*does* provide the ability to do, with ever-increasing capacity), you can 
construct something that acts like an "instant check", which is close enough 
to cash for most practical purposes.
