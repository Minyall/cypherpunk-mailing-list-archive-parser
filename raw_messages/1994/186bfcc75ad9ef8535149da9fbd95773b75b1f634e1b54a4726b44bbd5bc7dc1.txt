Who says that your attacker is your admin?

Is anybody here who ever checked  the source of the gcc compiler?

Why not modify the gcc to make it compile specific crypto
software (e.g. pgp) wrong, smuggling in any weakness?

Everyone checks the pgp signatures after receiving a new
version (do you?). Who checks the gcc ? Who checks the SunOS-cc ?

If the government wants to attack software like pgp it would be
easier to modify compilers than modifying the crypto sources.

Why not building keyboards with 4MByte RAM ? Let him use any OS he wants to
use. Read out the keyboard at night by room-cleaning staff or by any program
able to communicate in a network.
