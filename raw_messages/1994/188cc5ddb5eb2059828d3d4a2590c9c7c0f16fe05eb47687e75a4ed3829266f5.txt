I've tested this further - like you I can't seem to verify the press
release using RIPEM Mac. However, I did find someone with the RIPEM 1.2
software installed and it does verify with that software.

I've sent a copy to Ray Lau, the author of RIPEM Mac, as I know that he is
working on incorporating the features of RIPEM 1.2 in the next version of
RIPEM Mac.
