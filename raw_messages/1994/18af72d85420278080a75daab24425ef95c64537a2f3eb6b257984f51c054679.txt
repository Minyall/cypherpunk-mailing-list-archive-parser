Scratch the scratch.  I thought I'd made an error in my entropy
expression, but I hadn't.  More confusion to follow, no doubt.  I hope
it just won't be mine.

I kept thinking that the location of the minimum entropy was wrong.
I worked out some examples with real numbers to prove to myself that
my intuition about the location of the minimum entropy was incorrect.
Intuition about entropy is difficult to develop, and I still don't
completely have all of it.  A word to the wise.
