My complaint about Netscape is that you guys haven't been reading
about what others have done. I understand your desire to get things
done quickly, but you are making assumptions about whats out there and
what works that aren't warranted.

Certainly. SSL would also require software for all those platforms --
its no different in this regard.

Privacy and authentication are also provided by IPSP. However, IPSP
provides all sorts of advantages -- immunity from traffic analysis, no
requirement to change the way an application operates to start using
it, protection of the entire IP stack (not just TCP sockets), very
minimal changes required to applications that want to use the
information provided by the IPSP layer for authentication (and no need
to change your read or write calls or anything), etc, etc, etc.
