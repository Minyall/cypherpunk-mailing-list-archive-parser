The _event_ is not an urban legend.  (The signature hypothesis 
could be).  Check the Chattanooga papers (late '92 or early '93).  
A copier was ...uh... relocated to a residence.  I doubt that 
the manufacturer was invited to make service calls.  

The secret service was involved because of what was being copied.

It could just be that the SS (funny coincidence of initials) is 
very good at its job, but I wonder.
