Subject: Signature Stripping a Bad Idea

Reasons why attempts to automatically strip signatures a bad idea:

* Breaks the assumpton that remailers are not reaching in and
twiddling internals of a message.

* Maybe a signature is _desired_ at some point.

* Can lead to various problems, especially if implemented badly.

We've had this debate before, and the consensus was that treating a
remailed block as inviolate is a "win."

Certainly anyone can announce this "feature" as a service, sort of a
"Dummie's Remailer." Like censor services (that screen your mail),
such things are easily imaginable, but should never become the norm,
and should never be mandated.
