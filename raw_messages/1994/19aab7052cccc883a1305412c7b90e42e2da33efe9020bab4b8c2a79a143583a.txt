Thanks for the hot fucking tip, Sparky.  What was your first clue?
I suggest you not only learn to live with it, you learn to compete at
their level.  You can ftp my Psychological Warfare Primer for Online
Activists at ftp.eff.org

You have the right to free speech, and you have the right to dissent.

Use it or loose it slick.   Imagine some spook taking a shit in a public
restroom.  They're human.  And they fuck up regular as well.
