Yes, and if you had quoted my entire message you would get my point.  
Since electronic cash is not legal tender -- just a way of transfering 
legal tender -- a clearing system which administrates the "real flow of 
money" must exist so that participants can exchange their "transfer 
tokens" to "real" cash.
