True...  But a simple radio transciever is much cheaper and easier to
build than a laser system or sophisticated meteor bounce hardware.  It
might be possible to use a highly focused beam from a LED instead of a
laser.  Unfortunantly, there is still the problem with the beam getting
blocked...

About how far can one transmit with 250mw?

Now, how many cypherpunks do you know that would send unencrypted data
over the aitwaves???  Not many.

I know there isn't much respect for the law, but I don't want to make an
obvious ass of myself.

Seems like more trouble than it's worth...  certainly not a convienient
e-mail system.
