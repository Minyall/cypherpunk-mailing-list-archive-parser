The same as "desire for safety from thugs" and "NRA-Nut".
I don't subscribe to the theory that I need to have a gun
to keep myself safe, and I am antigun, but such as the US
is now, I can see myself buying one under some ocnditions
and being first in line to hand it over when they are
finally outlawed. But I don't need a flak jacket, grenades,
a bullet prrof car, etc. 

I may need crypto to keep my privacy, even though I believe
in theory that it shouldn't be nessessary, but I don't need
all the other bullshit (sorry if I'm stepping on anyone)
'cyber-survivalist' indicates.
