There are probably a fair number of obscure ones. Two that I know aren't
often talked about are:

DCA - Defense Communications Agency - responsible for DoD communication,
MilNet, STU-III encrypted phones, and assorted odds and ends.

DIA - Defense Intellegence Agency - DoD's own personal CIA.
