I agree with Tim on this.  There's no way I'm going to leave PGP on
poly's machines with the key right there for anyone who manages to
hack into photon or prism (and yes, it has happened) to set up a fake
pgp asking for the passphrase to my key.

I usually dial in to poly, I don't have (yet) a unix box on the net
to make signing easy.  Until the DOS or Mac versions of PGP include
a built in terminal and mailer...
