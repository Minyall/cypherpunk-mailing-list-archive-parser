I've been talking to Sergey behind the scenes, and I think I understand 
what our miscommunication was: he is proposing this type of technique 
ONLY for removable-type media, e.g. floppies. 


To store this type of data on your harddrive would be to dedicate your
harddrive to stego. This was my argument all along; what we failed to
connect on was the fact that only floppies are involved. With floppies,
every write *can* be controlled and the data would be relatively safe (and
obscure, for that matter). 


This correction is being posted to the list because his original post 
said nothing about removable media.
