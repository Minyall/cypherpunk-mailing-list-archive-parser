*******************
FBI HUNT FOR HACKER
        Kevin Mitnick is wanted by the FBI for suspicion of software and
data theft from leading telecom manufacturers and service providers. Among
his victims have been MCI and Digital Equipment. An ex-convict, Mitnick was
described by one judge as having an "addiction problem" with computers,
similar to a drug or gambling addiction. During a six-month treatment
program he was prohibited from touching a computer or a modem, but the
treatment seems to have failed, and one detective says: "I've always
considered him dangerous. I had to go underground. If he targets you, he
can make your life miserable." (New York Times 7/4/94 A1)
**************************

Years ago I read a 'hacker-book' that had a long section about the
activities of Mr Mitnick in the 80's ('Zero' something?). I no nothing
of his present doings. Some questions:

Is Mr Mitnick a dangerous selfish criminal egomaniac whom every good guy
immediately should turn over to the FBI if identified?

Or/and is Mr Mitnick the closest live equivalent of the hero in
'Shockwave Rider'?
