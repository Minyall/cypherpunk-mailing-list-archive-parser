ANNOUNCEMENT
============

This month's Bay Area Cypherpunks Meeting will be held this Saturday,
December 10th, from 12 noon until 6 pm in Silicon Graphics Cafe Iris
(same cypher time, same cypher channel...).

The topic for this month's discussions is:

			Technical Cryptography

We have three speakers planned. 

Susan Langford will speak on Cryptanalysis of DES and Other Block
Cyphers.  She will be speaking generally on the subject, and will
discuss her work on Differential Linear Cryptanalysis of DES.  Susan
is working with Martin Hellman at Stanford University.

Raph Levien will present  ``The Security of Cypher Block Chaining'', a
paper from Crypto '94 by Mihir Bellare, Joe Kilian, and Phillip
Rogaway.  Raph is working to infect all mail user agents with PGP.

Eric Hughes will present ``Towards the Equivalence of Breaking the
Diffie-Hellman Protocol and Computing Discrete Logarithms'', a paper
from Crypto '94 by Ueli M. Maurer.  Eric has been active in the
Cypherpunks movement for several years now.

Additional speakers are of course welcome.  Discussions of
implementations of crypto systems are welcome also.  Please contact me
(ktk@sgi.com or ktk@syzygy.com) asap if you are interested in
speaking.  Presentations need not be long.

Suggestions for dinner are welcome.

DIRECTIONS:

  Silicon Graphics, Inc.
  Building 5 (SGI Cafeteria)
  2025 North Shoreline Boulevard
  Mountain View, CA

From 101 take Shoreline East.  This is towards Shoreline Amphitheatre.
It's also "logical east", and points more north that east.  (That is,
it's east with respect to 101 North, which points west near the exit.)
If you're coming in on 101 South, you'll cross over the bridge.

Continue on Shoreline and go past a whole bunch of other SGI
buildings.  Turn right onto Steirlin Court at the big red metal
sculpture.  There will be even more SGI buildings surrounding
you--take note of the building numbers.  Go almost to the end of this
street.  Building 5 is on the right.
