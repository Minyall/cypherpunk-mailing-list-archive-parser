Looking at some old cypherpunks mail from Tim May:

>Enjoy finding and reading these. But your first priority should be to
>get the Loompanics catalog...other books may spark your interest more.
>I think the catalog is still $5 (well worth it), unless you order
>another book first, as described below.

I thought it might be worth pointing out that most of their catalog is
now online as:

       gopher://gopher.well.sf.ca.us/00/Business/catalog.asc

And you can send mail to them at:

       loompanx@pt.olympus.net
