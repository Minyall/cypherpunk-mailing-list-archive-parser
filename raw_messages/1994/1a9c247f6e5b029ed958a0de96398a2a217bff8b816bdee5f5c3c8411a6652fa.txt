Nothing.  Just like I can obtain your check info (by getting you to write me
a check) and forging a physical check using DTP technology (Forbes cover
story of several years ago).  You can disavow the check though and demand a
credit from your bank.  

If you don't complain, the transfer stands.  If you do, you get your money
back. 

I don't think they ever passed the Uniform Commercial Code proposal that
would have made checks just like electronic payments where you are liable
for $50 if you don't make a timely report of the problem.  Traditionally,
you *never* had to challange a check and you could get all of your money
back if the bank paid a check on a "forged drawer's signature."
