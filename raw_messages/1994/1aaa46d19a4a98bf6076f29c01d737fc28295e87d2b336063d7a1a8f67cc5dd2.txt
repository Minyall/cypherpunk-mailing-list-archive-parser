CBS Evening News just reported that Clinton has "tenatively signed off"
on a National ID card recommended to him by a commission on immigration 
reform. The obstensive reason for the card is for employment and immigration. 
Each card will contain a name, photo, mag stripe with info and a "verified 
SSN." It was supported by Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming, a long-time 
supporter of id cards. Gov. Pete Wilson of California has apparently offered 
to make California a test-bed for the proposal.  The proposal was opposed by 
Xavier Beccera, a Congressman from California.  A previous effort to impose a 
national id card was rejected by Congress in 1986.

EPIC is working with Privacy International to investigate this report. PI has 
led successful campaigns aginst national id cards in Australia, New Zealand, 
and the Phillipines. 
  
In Australia, the PI-led campaign led to the dissolution of both houses of 
the federal Parliament in 1987 after hundrends of thousands marched in 
protest. The Australian campaign brought together groups from all parts of 
the political spectrum from the Communist Party to the Libertarian Alliance, 
farmers and conservation groups, rock stars, academics, large businesses such 
as banks and mining corporations, but the overwhelming support came from the 
public who created the biggest civil protest in Australian history.
