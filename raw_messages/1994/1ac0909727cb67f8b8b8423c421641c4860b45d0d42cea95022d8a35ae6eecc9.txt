srctran@world.std.com (Gregory Aharonian): [on Internet Patent News Service]
	Scientist uses DNA sequences to solve Hamiltonian path problem of
	combinatorial mathematics, a precursor of the PTO's headache of
	including biotechnology in it software prior art searches. Think
	of Hopfield's paper on using neural nets for the traveling salesman
	problem to predict where DNA computing will end up.

Uhh! This was in one of Greg's 'random list of story titles' - he's yet to
provide details. As Hopfield didn't really 'solve' the TS problem, but made
it easier to solve a class of maps, this may not mean that there will be any
significant effect upon Cypherpunk tech based on NP-hard graph problems (such 
as Zero Knowledge proofs) - but it would be interesting to know _what_ it's 
all about.
