	Well starting sometime this summer I'm going to start selling shell
accounts, and I don't plan on spending much time verifying that there is a
TrueName associated with any given account. All I will care is that I get
my money and that the account isn't used to violate any security. I'll only
have a 14.4 analog connection to the net at first but as time goes on I'll
get a faster link. (As people pay me..) (If I get a report that the account
has been abused, I probably just shut it off with no refund.. I'll develop
a more specific policy when the time comes.)
	It's not exactly what you wanted, but it's privacy.
