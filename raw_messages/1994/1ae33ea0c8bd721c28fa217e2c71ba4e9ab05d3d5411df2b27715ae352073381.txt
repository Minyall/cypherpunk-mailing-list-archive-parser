Thats naive. They knew about differential cryptanalysis, and likely
linear and related key attacks, twenty years before the open
literature did. The notion that there is nothing else that they have
up their sleeves doesn't ring true.

The NSA has a large budget, and lots of extremely smart people.

Ahem. It is painfully obvious from the few bits and pieces of
information we glean to this day from repeated study of DES that they
know far, far more than we do about how to attack conventional
ciphers. It is unlikely that they haven't applied any of their skill
to public key techniques. There is no evidence that NSA cryptographers
aren't at least as smart as the ones out in the field, and they have a
tremendous head start and lots of practical experience that none of us
have.
