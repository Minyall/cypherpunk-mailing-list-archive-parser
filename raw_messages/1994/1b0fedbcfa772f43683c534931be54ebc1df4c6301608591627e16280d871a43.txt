While public housing projects may not be on the CP agenda, the confict between
a mob-like majority willing, in order 'to reduce crime,' to impinge on the 
rights of minorities with different opinions is *definitely* something to 
discuss here. If enough criminals start using PGP, there may well be similar
pressure in favour of Clipper.
