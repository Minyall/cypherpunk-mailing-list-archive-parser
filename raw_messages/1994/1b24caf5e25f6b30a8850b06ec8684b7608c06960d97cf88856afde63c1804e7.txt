I'm finding the thread interesting and educational, apart from my
suspicion it's about to turn into a flamewar about who [doesn't] want
to bet $10K to back a particular position. 

I seem to remember the list being about "technological defenses for
privacy", or some such - money laundering (e.g., anonymized transactions)
seems close enough for me.

If the Extropians' list is dry these days, perhaps some commerce-oriented
Cypherpunks ought to sell them a copy of this thread.
