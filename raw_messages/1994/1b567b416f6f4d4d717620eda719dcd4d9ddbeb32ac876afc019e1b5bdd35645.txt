You don't HAVE to transmit the modulus in the clear. Its often
worthwhile to use D-H for key exchange even if both sides know the
other's RSA public keys. Why? Because then the keys used for
conventional session encryption need not be compromised for historical
traffic even if the RSA keys are later compromised.
