Gee, Wayne, it isn't like this is some sort of super-secret underground
hack/phreak conspiracy list.  If you want to set up a conspiracy, try a
more hostile version of majordomo.

I've got a security clearance, and sometimes I work with classified
material.  I'm also the editor of The Cryptogram's "Cipher Exchange"
column, I'm a reasonably noisy opponent of escrowed encryption, an
enthusiastic amateur cryptanalyst, and a user of both licensed and
unlicensed PGP.  And have contributed money to Phil's defense fund.  And I
write code, including the first DES code that was put in the public domain
and exported (although I didn't export it myself...).

If you have a proposed litmus test for cypherpunk membership, let's hear it.
Personally, I welcome the participation of people who have a clue, no matter
who they work for or with.
