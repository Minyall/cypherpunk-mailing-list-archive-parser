My local Bell in (810) has a free system called "touch-4."  It's just a 
voicemail system but it has airline schedules and the cheapest rates if 
you give it a destination and a date.  You need to listen to a couple 
commercials but it's a free call for me.  I don't know if any of this 
information is on the net.
