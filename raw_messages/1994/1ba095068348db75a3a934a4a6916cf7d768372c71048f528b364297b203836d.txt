Sorry to hit the whole list with this, but 2 out of the 3 recipients
to his message bounced my mail (jpp@jpplap (Jay Prime Positive) does
not work, and "la-cypherpunks@toad.com" is apparently not the name of
the LA Cypherpunks discussion list.

Since several of you have asked about an LA meeting, here's my
message.

(I'm just guessing that "la-cypherpunks@toad.com" is the right
address; if not, could someone forward or respond to the correct
list?)

I'll be in Hermosa Beach visiting my brother from Friday to Monday,
and would (as I have said before) be interested in attending an
LA-Cypherpunks meeting, presumably on Saturday the 21st. Others have
contacted me about this, but I've told them to watch for the
organizers to announce such a meeting.

Jay PP has said he'd be willing to host a meeting. The moral on these
things, in my experience, is not to wait for some kind of Grand
Consensus, there being no voting or debating goint on. As they say,
"just do it."

Assuming it's on a Saturday, and is not too far away, I'll be there.
("Too far away" might be Riverside, for example.)

Even a small gathering (several people) could be useful...perhaps more
useful than the mega-meetings of 40 or more people we usually have in
the Bay Area.

I hope to hear from you folks.
