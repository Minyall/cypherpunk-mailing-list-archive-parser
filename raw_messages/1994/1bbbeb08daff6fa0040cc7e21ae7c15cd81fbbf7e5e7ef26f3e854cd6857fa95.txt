Could not the operating systems' IO driver be used for the interface
to the parallel port be used as the interface to the RNG?

The hack has support for a device which can be accessed thru
an IO driver that returns one random byte for each byte read.
(RANDDRIVER).

Would this be adequate for such a device, or would special
code be required? Is the IO driver for the parallel port
that comes with MS-DOS OK for this purpose?

Has anyone out there built such a device?
