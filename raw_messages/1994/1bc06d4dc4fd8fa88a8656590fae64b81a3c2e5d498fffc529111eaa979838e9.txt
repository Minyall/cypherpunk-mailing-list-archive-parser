What application do you have in mind? Are you starting a currency
exchange, gambling server, or something similarly interesting? If
you need code written, be more specific. With the new 1.1 autoclient,
you should not need any code. The autoclient can be run by a script.
It takes all input from stdin and the command line. Never give up
more than 50% of the profits from anything!

P.S. Have you considered suing Stu Baker for stealing your sig and
using it in his propaganda?
