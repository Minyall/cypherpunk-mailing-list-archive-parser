I want a pose something for everyone as a new technology. I have no idea 
if it has been dreamed up before or if it's possible to do...  Here goes:
Most people communicate by modems if they're accessing the internet from 
home unless they're rich or just have the right connections (no pun 
intended). Anyway, could one create a new line of modems that could 
effectively and efficiently variate modem speeds to disuade people from 
trying to pick up any modem transmissions by say a local telephone 
company inorder to keep them from synchronzing data speeds. I know modems 
sometimes lose some speed, but for the most part they transmit at stable 
rates.. Am I completely paranoid about this or am I just going off the 
wall???    I was just reading this article about Telco Snooping that my 
friend forwarded to me off the NirvanNet...
 
I'll put it up here if no one has seen it...
