Today I used the catalyst@netcom.com remailer to send an anonymous
contribution to a list.  They're raising hell about anonymity in their
list, but that's beside the point.  The message also showed up on a
seperate beta test list.  I assume this was done manually by 
<mcstout@netcom.com> bouncing the message to the other list, since he
is the sigular person on the planet subscribed to both lists.  mcstout
has been a quite vocal detractor of my catalyst contributions to the
other list.  I thus strongly suspect manual sabotage.  There was no
flaw in the Request-Remailing-To: adress.

Could someone please confirm that this was not a quirck of the remailer?
