The same is true if all those transmitters used DES without key escrow --
and, if wireless and cellular phones were to decrypt when they came off
the air, there would be no loss of FBI wiretap ability.

Today I mailed a formal proposal to that effect (scrap Clipper; replace it
with regular DES over the air and clear otherwise; reform the export laws)
to NIST with cc: to DERD (at her suggestion).
