  On behalf of the folks at BayMOO, I'd be delighted to invite the 
cypherpunks back for a second virtual meeting.  Our first session on 
February 9 gave a taste of what's possible.  Another session, with a 
cleanly organized agenda, could work even better. There are a number of 
cypherpunks with named accounts at BayMOO already, and new accounts can 
be handled in a day by writing to blast@crl.com (blast is also on the list).
As someone indicated, MOOs work best with clients like Tinyfugue, though 
it is possible to do all right with raw telnet (especially if you have 
com software, like Microphone, that gives you a text buffer for 
composition before you send your words out into the virtual room).
  There are several options for organization for whoever will be putting 
the session together. There are:
  -- large rooms that can be moderated (speaker queues, separate rows for 
private conversations, etc.);
  -- smaller rooms for sessions with 2-10 people;
  -- mindspeak channels for folks who want to attend a meeting and 
discuss other issues on a channel at the same time
  -- virtual videotaping or autologging of the proceedings.
  The key to success, though, as the last meeting clearly indicated, is 
an agenda with clearly specified topics and time-certain beginnings and 
endings.  Moderators to make sure that speakers cleave to the stated 
topic seem best for large meetings; smaller groups can, if they like, let 
the conversations develop with their own internal momentum.
   Just let me or blast know if the idea of a second virtual meeting at 
BayMOO appeals to you, and we'll make the arrangements.
