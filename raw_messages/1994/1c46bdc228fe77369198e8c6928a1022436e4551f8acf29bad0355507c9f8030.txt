this is a mesg that appeared in the may/june 1993 InfoSECURITY NEWS 
"Legal Beat" column.  it is supposedly recommended by the U.S. Justice 
Department to avoid violation of the ECPA.

i got this info from the docs that came with UltraSHIELD, a security 
program for Macintoshes.

the warning also 'showed up' one day on this acct which i found a bit 
disturbing but then realized where it came from after getting the mac 
security program.


oh, i suppose i should say who the hell i am.
