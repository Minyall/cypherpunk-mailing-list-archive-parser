   What an amazing difference between Dennings.
   What a great idea for the NSA were to become allies and start 
   working for us, instead of for 'them'.
   The perception of it (NSA) would change in everyone's eyes; 
   even pencil-toting nerds could learn to like them.

I ran into an NSA policy office person at CRYPTO'94 and suggested to him
that the NSA should set up a WWW page from the crypto museum -- and also
post occasionally to sci.crypt from some nsa.gov host.  He was very open
to the first idea but not to the second.  (problem apparently with the
standard disclaimer not being good enough for them. :-)
