	Obscuring things can be a useful part of a security system for
an organization.  The phrase "security through obscurity" refers to
systems which are all smoke and mirrors.  Good security comes from
reinforced concrete.  If you add smoke and mirrors in front of
concrete, you don't decrease your security.  Unless, of course, you
can't see whats coming becuse of all the smoke.
