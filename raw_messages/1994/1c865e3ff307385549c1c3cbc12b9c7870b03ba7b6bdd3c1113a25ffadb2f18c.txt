Hello Raph,

	I just saw your bi-monthly posting about the remailers. I'd like
to point out that jpunix supports a feature not mentioned in your
message/finger mechanism. Jpunix.com also supports the ability to have
messages encrypted to the recipient by the remailer itself. This will
protect cleartext messages sent back to the sender via reply blocks. By
adding

Encrypt-Key: yourkey

to the header list for jpunix.com, jpunix will encrypt anything following 
a ** on a line by itself with that key.
