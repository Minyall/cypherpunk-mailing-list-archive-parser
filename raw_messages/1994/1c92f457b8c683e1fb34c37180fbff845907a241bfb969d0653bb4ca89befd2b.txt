I am looking for the sources about the general aspects of the
hackers. I am writing an article for a Korean journal <The
Database World>.
I am writing about the origins, the history, the developments,
the new trends, and its impact on the industry, etc.
Pla
Please send me an e-mail if you know any good sources.
Thanks in advance.
