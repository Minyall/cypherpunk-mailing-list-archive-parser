I tend to. I usually only look at diffs between successive versions.

In any case, the point is more about the capacity to examine the
sources more than anything. Even if one has not personally examined
them, the fact that others may examine them is a deterrent to
tampering at the release level. I don't believe in releasing
cryptography or other security software without sources.
