No *wonder* I've seen 66 messages since midnight.

Can't explain jarthur's apparent tendency to introduce random delays.
Maybe the messages are cooling their heels on the VMS gateway -- it's
been delaying incoming mail the past few days.  I'm not inclined to
worry about it, since it helps to muddle traffic analysis a bit.
