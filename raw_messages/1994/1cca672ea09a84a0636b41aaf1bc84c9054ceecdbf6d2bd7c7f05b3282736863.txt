I agree that panic is uncalled for, but I don't agree that he will
probably do nothing.  Eventually, Mr. Templeton or someone in a
similar position is certain to "do something"; this is an inevitable
result of the clash between traditional (since the 16th century,
anyway) views of copyright and what "we" think of the
meaning(lessness) of copyright in an online digital world.

Put yourself in his place.  Mr. Templeton's attitude makes perfect
sense.  The entire fabric of his business is based upon
state-supported protection of the "property" that's his stock in
trade.  I would think very little of him as a businessperson were he
to simple roll over and give up.

Indeed, it might actually be advantageous for the "something" to
happen sooner rather than later; clumsy attacks on freedom of
electronic communication could backfire, resulting in favorable (to
e-freedom) judgements that would stand as precedent later on.
