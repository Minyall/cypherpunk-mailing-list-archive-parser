There are a number or real reasons.  Maybe you got coerced into
signing they key, or you think that maybe the key was signed
incorrectly, or maybe that person no longer uses that email address,
because they lost the account, or that maybe you don't believe that
the binding of key to userID is valid for any number of reasons.

That is why signature revocations should exist.  Comments?
