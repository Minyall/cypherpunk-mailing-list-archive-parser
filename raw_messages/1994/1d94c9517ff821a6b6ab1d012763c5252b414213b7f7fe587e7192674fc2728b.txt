I would like to get some cypherpunk t-shirts. So far, I've heard of
the "Big Brother inside" and "Cypherpunk Criminal" ones. If anybody
has any information about these, I'd appreciate it. From what I hear,
there is a fair amount of pent-up demand for the "Big Brother inside"
one.

For those who are interested, I have a Web page for net-related
t-shirts at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~raph/tshirt.html

Thanks in advance,

Raph
