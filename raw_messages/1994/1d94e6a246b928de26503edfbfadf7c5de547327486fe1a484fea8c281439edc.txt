I'm not going to install remailer software that would allow this
because it'd make it even easier to post messages under someone 
else's name. I think that's rude and I'm not going to help other
people do it. I think it's fine for people to refuse to identify
themselves or to identify themselves with multiple names, but
I don't like people using other folks' names, esp. in text-based
media where the notionis of "identity" and "author" are awfully
slippery in the first place.

(Yes, I am aware that it's trivial to forge messages, and that
widespread use of digital signatures would make the From: line
essentially meaningless.)
