     They know that they have deep pockets. AT&T has some of the deepest
pockets in the country, and could out-money PKP/RSA in yesterday's
heartbeat. PKP fights little guys... that's all they've HAD to fight, so
far. Now that they have a real opponent, who can meet (and surpass) their
level of gameplaying, it'll be interesting to see what happens.
