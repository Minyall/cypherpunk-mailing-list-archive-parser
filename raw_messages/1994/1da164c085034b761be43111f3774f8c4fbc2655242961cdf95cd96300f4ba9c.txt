Responding to msg by Michael D. Crawford:

. . .  if a street gang felt the cops were  thumping their 
members with unwarranted enthusiasm, the gang could purchase  a 
case of cameras at the local Price Club, and everyone could 
carry them to  photograph the cops.
...............................................................

The first thing I imagined on reading this, was numbers of  
young blacks in the ghetto carrying on their shoulders - not 
boom boxes, but camcorders.

But next I multiplied and elaborated and exaggerated the idea 
of everyone protecting themselves by any and all surveillance 
devices possible and available, and came up with this vision of 
a society where membership required that everyone be amenable 
to being recorded on contact with anyone and their cat.   

"Of course, I respect you   -   I just don't *trust* you."
