  Although I have not implemented PGP on my OS/2 drive yet, I don't see 
it as a problem.  I run many DOS/FAT apps on my system that work well 
under HPFS.  After all, you are just issuing a file open command, and 
then a series of reads, nothing the system can't handle.

  The only place I see a problem is with file names.  If you haven't 
modified the source, and compiled it will a decent OS/2 compiler, then it 
will only work with 8.3 names.

  Good luck.  Let me know if you have any problems.  In the mean time, 
I'll be installing it here.
