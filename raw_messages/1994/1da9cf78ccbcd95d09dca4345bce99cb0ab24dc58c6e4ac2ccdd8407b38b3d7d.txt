A good idea (or at least not a "bad" one).  

While I agree that CPSR, EFF and company should be supported in their 
fight, too often has the cry been heard, "It's not OUR task, leave it 
to the professionals."  PZ was willing to put it ALL on the line.  
[ ASIDE: I am assuming that simply being ON this mailing list is 
sufficient to get you _On_File_. ]  We can NOT allow the likes of 
Dr.'s Sternlight and Denning to dictate public opinion.  Adding 
our (Respectable, Considerable, Informed, etc.) voice can only help.

It's time to take the field....

Four of the "top ten" reasons to support Jim's proposal:

10) It's voluntary.
 9) It's too late for many of us (to preserve a low profile) anyway.
 8) The public *NEEDS* to be educated about Crypto-Privacy!!!!!
 7) It will teach them to spell Cypherpunks.

(Look out Stu!  The "geeks" are educated, politically aware, respected
entrepreneurs, financially successful and *ACTIVE*.)
