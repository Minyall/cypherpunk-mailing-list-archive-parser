Brokaw's producer just interviewed me via email and will call in the AM.
Good night to watch NBC News tomorrow.  The woman in LA I talked to 
tonight got a hell of an education.  When she thanked me for it, I told
her it was part of my job to educate as an EFF member, and I credited
cypherpunks with a lot of my education.

Don't give up yet.  When the American public finds out they got fucked
out of their right to privacy 4 Feburary and nobody even bothered to 
ask them about it, I think they're going to be really PISSED.
