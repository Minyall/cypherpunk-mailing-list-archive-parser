Re: forcing text only...

Welp, you can simply modify the sources for it yourself to do this.

First, check to see if the character you've read is a control.  If it is
leave it alone and don't encrypt it.  Then if it's an alphanumeric character,
take the random number you've just read and do a binary AND operation on it
with a number less than 31.  Say 31 should suffice.

This should do the trick for what you want... But you should know that it will
kill the fuck out any security you might have ever had.

The best solution is to first ZIP up the file you want to XSPLIT, then use
XSPLIT on it, and feed the outputs of XSPLIT to something like UUENCODE...
