Clearly you have not read the application note in the documentation
that came with PGP.  The appnote clearly states:

>         There is a better way of doing this in PGP 2.2, which is an
> environment variable called "PGPPASSFD".  If this is set, it means
> that the FIRST thing PGP will do is read the pass phrase from this
> file descriptor.  So, for example, one can set PGPPASSFD to "0"
> (zero), and then PGP will read the pass phrase from stdin as the first
> thing.
