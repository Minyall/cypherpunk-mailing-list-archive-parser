On the local news this morning (Washington DC) there was a clip
with Sen. John Warner expressing his displeasure with how the
"intelligence community" has hidden the money for a massive
construction effort to house the NRO. The land was bought and
permits were applied for under the guise of a development for
Rockwell International. There will probably be a follow-up story in 
this morning's Washington Post.
