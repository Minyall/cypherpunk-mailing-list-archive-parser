The reason for this is that people can usually get a hint; there's been no
need for a formal standard, because when someone does something irritating
several people shout, and the person has (with a couple of wild exceptions)
quit the irritating behavior.

You don't seem as far around the bend as either of the wild exceptions that
come to mind (Detweiler and that weird fellow that raved for about two weeks
two months ago) so I'm guessing you wouldn't want to be lumped in with them.
But by continuing to defend what obviously irritated a half dozen people,
with plenty more like me agreeing but unwilling to join in the fray to 
compound the problem, that's what you're courting.
