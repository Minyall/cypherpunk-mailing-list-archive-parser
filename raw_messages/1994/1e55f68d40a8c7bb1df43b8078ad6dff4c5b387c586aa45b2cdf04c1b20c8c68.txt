Why, Grahamy, thanks so much for that mail!  I submitted my key to the
key servers over a year ago and this is the first piece I received.
And a juicy little message it was, too... you naughty boy!  But I'm
flattered, really.

Oh, and sorry about putting that key up and ruining all your plans.
But I'm sure it will all work out for the best.  These things always
do, you know!

Polyanna
