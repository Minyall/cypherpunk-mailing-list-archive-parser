I have been trying to get mixmaster running on FreeBSD and Linux, and I
suspect that the problem lies with PGPTools. Has anyone been able to
compile PGPTools for those platforms? If so, could you tell be what
compiler settings you used? It would also be nice to see if your source
code matches what I am using. Many thanks all. As soon as I have mixmaster
running on Linux and FreeBSD I will start distributing it (it already works
on SPARCs).
