Hey all!

Can someone help me out as to how to get the pgp-related stuff off  
csn.org?
Unfortunately I don't have real ftp, only ftp through the  
ftp-mail-server.
I have grabbed the README.MPJ file and immediately sent an ftp  
request to get files from the ever-changing I_will_not_export/???  
directory, but get back a "no such directory". 

How often does the directory name change? Am I just not going to be  
able to get them through ftp-mail requests?

Thanks,
   Dan
