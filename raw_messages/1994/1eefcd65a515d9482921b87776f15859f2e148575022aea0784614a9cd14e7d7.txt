C'punks,

Carl Ellison wondered:

    To what extent is gov't a home for bullies and to what
    extent is it the collective defense against bullies ...?
    How do we turn it from the first to the second?

As I see it, it's always a home for bullies masquerading as a
collective defense.  Sometimes it actually it actually has to
perform its advertised defense function.  Like naked quarks,
purely defensive governments cannot exist.  They are bipolar by
nature, with some poles (i.e., the bullying part) being "more
equal than others."
