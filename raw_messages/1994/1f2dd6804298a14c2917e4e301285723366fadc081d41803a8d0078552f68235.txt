-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

PGP can now be nicely integrated with the excellent offline
news/mail package, Yarn.  You can now, at the touch of a key,
encrypt an out-going note, sign an out-going note/post and
decrypt/verify incoming notes/posts.

Yarn (stable beta version .64) can be retrieved by ftp from
oak.oakland.edu:/pub/msdos/offline/yarn-064.zip (as well as
mirrors and other sites).  Yarn imports news/mail in the SOUP
format.

(I am quite pleased with this combination.)

Thanks to the author, Chin Huang.

Cort.
