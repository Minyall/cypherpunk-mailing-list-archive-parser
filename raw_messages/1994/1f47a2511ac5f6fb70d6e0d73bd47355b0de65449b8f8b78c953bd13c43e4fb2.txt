There's a pub here in the Bay Area that serves habanero burgers every
Thursday.  When you order one, they make you sign a release (and
they're serious about it).  I had a bite of one of the things once.
Dissolved my kidney stones and made my nose bleed.  I had to turn to
my friend and ask if my lips were still on my face.
