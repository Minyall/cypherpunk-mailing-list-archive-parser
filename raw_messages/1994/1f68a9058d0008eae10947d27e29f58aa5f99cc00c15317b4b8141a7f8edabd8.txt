   I disagree: In the U. S. we have real repression. Current real total
taxation is approx. 45%. I believe the serfs of Europe only paid a
small amount above 1/12 of their production to their lords. That's a
little in excess of 8.3% We revolted against English rule for taxation
that was tiny compared to current burden.

   Also, we are currently starving out Iraq, Cuba, & Haiti with embargoes
as well as doing other atrocities. Our State is currently systematically
ending our freedoms & is developing Hell weapons in Black Labs for
domestic use. To say that we're ok because other oppressors are worse
than ours is slave talk.
