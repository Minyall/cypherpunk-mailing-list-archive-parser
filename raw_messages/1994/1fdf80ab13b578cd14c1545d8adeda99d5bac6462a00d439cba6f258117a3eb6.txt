Quite true.

But the technology has not achieved the critical mass that you
need for most software producers to support it properly.

Sun does not support it, Microsoft screws it up royally last
time I looked.

Thus mime is, as Tim earlier complained, bleeding edge.

Netscape is leading edge.

Obviously mime is the right solution for Email in the
long run.

Equally obviously, none of the tools that I prefer to
use, on any of the systems that I have connected to
the internet, handle mime in a way that I am willing
to tolerate.
