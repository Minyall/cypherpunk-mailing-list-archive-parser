	I was in a BEST store yesterday, and attempted to pay by check.  They 
asked for ID to verify the check and when I handed them my military ID, they  
asked for my driver's license instead.  I gave them my driver's license and 
they used it and the magnetic strip on the back of it to verify my check.  I 
noticed on their computer screen that it had all of my info, as in birthdate, 
address, driver's license number, the routing number for the bank I am with, 
and my checking account number.  They also have notices up that say they 
index everything by your phone number.  I asked them what they were using all 
of this information for, and they said for their marketing purposes.  I was 
so ticked off that I took back the check, went to an ATM, pulled out cash, 
and went back and purchased the item with cash.  I had to buy the item there, 
because nowhere else in the local area did they have the item.  Just 
something to keep in mind.
