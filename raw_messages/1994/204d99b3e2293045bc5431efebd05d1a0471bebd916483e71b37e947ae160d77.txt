I am especially interested in the "strange attractors" aspect of chaos
theory.  A good article on strange attractors appeared in Scientific
American in the early/mid '80s.  (Mail/post me if you want me to look up
the issue.)  Douglas Hofstadter was the author (of Godel, Escher, Bach...
an awesome book!).

Strange attractors use feedback to "lock in".  I have used strange
attractors to find special points in n-dimensional spaces.

It may be far-fetched, but strange attractors or some similar
statistical/experimental method may be the means by which large
numbers are factored some day....
