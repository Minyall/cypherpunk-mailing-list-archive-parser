You can't get rid of anonymity such as this without also getting rid
of pseudonymity.  The first use of a pseudonym is as good as
anonymous, because it has no past history.  If the user of this
pseudonym never again uses the name, then it has no future history.
A one-time pseudonym is an anonym.

An arbitrary string of letters only become a name if it is presented
as a name and if it has persistence.  Identity is a persistence
through time of a source, be that a source of speech or a source of
action.  Without persistence there is no identity, but rather only
unconnected assertions in a formal (and sterile) symbolic system.
