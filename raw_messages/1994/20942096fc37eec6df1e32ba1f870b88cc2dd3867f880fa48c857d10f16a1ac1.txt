   Ah, but that does make some sense. You see, Stac bought MS-DOS from
   Microsoft, and had to adhere to Microsoft's shrink wrap agreement.

Whether or not a shrink wrap agreement is valid is a further issue
here as well.  Taking something apart that lots of people have is, or
at least should be, a fair use.
