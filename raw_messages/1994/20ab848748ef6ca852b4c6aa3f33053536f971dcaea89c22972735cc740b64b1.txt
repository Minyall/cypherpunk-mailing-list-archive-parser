I just noticed that my semi-off-topic mail hit the Cypherpunks list.
Sorry about that --- I was aiming for Aron only.

Please take all of it as opinion.  Had I meant to send it to cypherpunks
or any other public place, it would have been written with more "facts"
to back up the assertions.

Damn, so much for trying to be inconspicuous on the list. :-)

Regards,
Loren
