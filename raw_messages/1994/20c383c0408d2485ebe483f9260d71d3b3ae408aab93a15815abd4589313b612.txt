YOUR LETTER DATED: February 12, 1994

REQUEST FOR COMMODITY JURISDICTION DETERMINATION FOR: "Applied
Cryptography" Cryptographic Book by Bruce Schneier

Your commodity jurisdiction (CJ) request was referred to the
Departments of Commerce and Defense for their review and
recommendations. As a result, the Department of State has
determined that the referenced commodity is not subject to the
licensing jurisdiction of the Department of State since the item is
in the public domain. However, this ruling covers only the subject
book and not the two source code disks that the book references and
that are available from the author.

Should you require further assistance on this matter, please contact
Maj. Gary Oncale at (703) 875-5655.

					Sincerely,

					[signed]
