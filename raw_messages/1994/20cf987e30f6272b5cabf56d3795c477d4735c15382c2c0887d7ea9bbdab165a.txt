I was reading Hawking's _Black Holes & Baby Universes_ and an interesting
question struck me:  If a Grand Unified Theory exists, would it not 
prove P=NP to be true?
 
My Armchair Cosmologist's (TM) reasoning goes something like this:  If
a GUT exists, and that GUT is proven to be true (making it the Grand
Unified Law, I suppose), any behaviour we believe to be non-deterministic
really isn't: it obeys the GUL.  So P=NP must be true, since NP is
an artifact our pre-GUL way of looking at things.
 
Am I way off base here?  Can anyone with more knowledge in this area
than I tell me if I'm right, wrong, or somewhere in between?  Many
thanks,
 
Ken
