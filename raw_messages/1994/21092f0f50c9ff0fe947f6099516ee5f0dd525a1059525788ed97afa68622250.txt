   They [The NSA] also had a comment that they considered Blaze's
   findings to be mostly irrelevant, as the only people who would use
   it would be persons who *didn't* trust the escrow system, but *did*
   trust the algorithm...

OOOooooo.  I think this means one had better use superencryption of
one kind or another with Clipper at all times.  Pardon me if this
is redundant, but has anybody done any differential analysis of, say,
DES (or 3DES) under Clipper, to see if it weakens?
