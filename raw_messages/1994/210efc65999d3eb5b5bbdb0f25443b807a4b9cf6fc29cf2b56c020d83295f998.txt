I wish everyone who voted either Republican or Democrat instead of
Libertarian because they didn't want their vote to be wasted would take a
moment to consider how their vote would have meant any less if they had
voted for Andre Marrou and Nancy Lord in '92.

Also, those who do not vote because they feel it just encourages the
bastards should consider voting Libertarian next time.

And those who voted for Perot as a protest, why not vote for freedom
next time?
