50 days on 12 HP9735 = 600 days on a single HP9735
The 735 has a pretty fast Mflop rating (compared to Sun, IBM, SGI, PC, and
Macs).  Using a comparable breaker on the average machine, it is going
to take two years to "break the scheme".
That leaves two years to create stronger/tighter strategies.
