I finally got around to downloading and reading the remailer stuff from  
the cypherpunks ftp site*.  I could have saved myself some embarrassment  
if I had read it before posting my "original" SASE idea.  The file

     pub/cypherpunks/remailer/hals.instructions

describes a mechanism that is basically a simplified SASE.

Oh well...
