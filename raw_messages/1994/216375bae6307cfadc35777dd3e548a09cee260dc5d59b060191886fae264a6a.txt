Anybody catch Hillary's press conference?  She argued that she didn't answer
questions about Whitewater at first because she believed strongly in a "zone"
of privacy. 

Now, if a public figure has a zone of privacy, what does a private citizen 
have?

I'd been off the list for a while - hope this isn't a repeat.
