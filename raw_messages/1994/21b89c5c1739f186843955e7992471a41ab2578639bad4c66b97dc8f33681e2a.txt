As far as I know, nobody has made any purely "secure mosaic" sales yet;
 If you're talking about me, our only current system is mail-based.  [And
 also if so, don't worry -- two of the three of us have over 8 years
 net experience... we're not going anywhere.]

By the way, if at all possible, both to forward our own financial goals
 *and* our political goals (the latter of which is well within bound of
 what is accepted as "cypherpunk," I believe), Bibliobytes is going to try
 to provide free support to anyone for getting PGP running (no hooks
 attached).

Volunteers to help with this would be greatly appreciated -- how about it?
 Are y'all willing to put your money where your mouth is, and hand-hold
 clueless users to get them up and running with PGP?  Minimal skills required,
 past basic literacy and the ability to give simple instructions.  This
 could help to truly give freedom to the masses -- people who don't
 necessarily know where to find an FAQ or even know what one is.  People
 who automatically flame *@aol.com need not apply.

Anybody interested, send mail to "pgp-volunteer@bb.com" and I'll set up
 the list.
