I've revised my opinion: It's not close to useless, it's worse than
 useless.

Two things people seem not to be getting:

	1. Including the fingerprint with a signed message is much less
		pointless.  This was distributing the fingerprint *with
		the public key*.  That's bogus. However, even were
		this a signed message rather than a key...

	2. Encouraging people to trust the included ASCII fingerprint is
		a Bad Thing.  Why not just include these fingerprint
		things and not bother with this confusing, patented
		RSA stuff?  Much easier that way.

Great.  Here's the Betsi key, with the fingerprint included for those
 who don't want to use PGP to do the computation.
