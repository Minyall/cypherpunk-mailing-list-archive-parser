Eric can turn the list on and off at will. By my lights, that gives
him control, and thus a proprietary interest, i.e. the list is his
property. You may be correct that it would be foolish of him to annoy
people, just as if you have houseguests it is foolish to suddenly say
"if you want to stay in this house you have to pierce your genitals
NOW!". It is none the less his right to annoy people if he wants to,
however, just as it is your right to demand anything of your
houseguests as a condition of their remaining in your home. They, of
course, are under no obligation to decide to remain....
