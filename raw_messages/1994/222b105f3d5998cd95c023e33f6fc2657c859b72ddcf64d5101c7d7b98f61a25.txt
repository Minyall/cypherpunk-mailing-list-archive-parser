BZZZT! Read the code...

MD5Init(&md5buf);
MD5Update(&md5buf,pass1,strlen(pass1));
MD5Final(key,&md5buf);

for(k=0;k<PASS_ITER;k++) {
  MD5Init(&md5buf);
  MD5Update(&md5buf,key,16);                           | Hmmm?!?
  MD5Update(&md5buf,pass1,strlen(pass1));   <----------| I wonder what
  MD5Final(key,&md5buf);                               | that line does?
  }

Notice that the passphrase is included in each of the hashings.
How can MD5(passphrase+16-byte hash) have lower entropy than
MD5(passphrase)? The iteration just makes it slower to crack pass-
phrases. Version 1.0, which used a single MD5, could be attacked
at the rate of 1000 per second on a PC.
