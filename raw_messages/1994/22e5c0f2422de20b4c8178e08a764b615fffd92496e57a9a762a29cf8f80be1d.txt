Dork, you really ought to read the List for a bit longer than the
short time you say you have before throwing around insults about
"fetishes" and how we have a lot of explaining to do.

This applies to everyone, not just to Dork:

- try to read the List for several weeks before jumping in

- to see what the topics are, what's apparently been beaten to death
so many times before, and so forth

There are a lot of bright folks on this List, including
cryptographers, mathematicians, and even journalists (!), and
dismissing points of view as "fetishes" is not all that useful or
welcome.

If Dork sticks around, he'll understand that many of us have no
problems whatsoever with multiplication of nyms, but that we are also
very aware of the disruptive effects nyms can sometimes have. Many of
us believe solutions to this exist, and that the governments of the
world don't have to be involved.

So, cool your jets, Dork39.

Oh well. *PLONK*
