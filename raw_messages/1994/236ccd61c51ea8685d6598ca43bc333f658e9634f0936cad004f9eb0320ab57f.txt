Honestly, I wouldn't know. However, if you read FAQ's carefully as they are
posted to (amongst others) news.answers, there are some which mention CRAM, an
acronym used by Detweiler referring to a service he has for folks who don't
wish to be bothered to handle anything except the content of their FAQ.

In the blur with which those FAQ's end he always mentions his current email
address, and lately that has been tmp@netcom.com.
