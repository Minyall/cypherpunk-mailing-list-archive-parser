I seem to remember that the USPTO provides full texts of patents for $3...
Anyway, those who plan to perform many such services at $149 might consider
purchasing the 10-CDROM database for $5,000 (?)

Also, you can WWW to
wais://town.hall.org:210/patent 
for full WAIS searches in real time for keywords. I'm not sure whether 
Town Hall has old patents (possibly only for the current year); but is does
have many relating to electronic cash, cryptography, signatures and so on.

(Note: most of these are software patents, not applicable outside the USA. An
average of 80 software patents a week were issued in the first quarter of 1994.)

The home page (http://town.hall.org) connects to many other services, including
the SEC EDGAR documents.
