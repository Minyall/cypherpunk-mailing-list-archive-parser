    Last night noting an absence of list mail I pinged and found
    toad.com live but got no response (then) from majordomo on a
    "who cypherpunks" query. Tried first at 00:30 then again at
    02:00.  Netcom allowed the responses to be received at 04:49
    within two seconds of each other!  I append the headers to
    document this amazing disservice.

    Since 47 of the 530 cypherpunks are netcom users, I think
    the rest of the list should understand the difficulties we
    face in getting posts in any timely fashion.  It does make
    discourse difficult.
