The jarthur remailer is presently down because of a twit who blitzed
much of Caltech and JPL with a car-repair ad.  A Caltech postmaster
has advised me that he has moved on to using rebma.  Remailer admins
who don't need this kind of hassle may wish to block messages with
"BARKEV'S AUTO CENTER" in the body.
