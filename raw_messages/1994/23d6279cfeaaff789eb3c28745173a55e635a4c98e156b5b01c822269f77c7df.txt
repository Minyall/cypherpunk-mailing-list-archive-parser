Graham, you mispelled the name of the remailer, in this case.  The
correct address is remailer@rebma.mn.org, not remailer@remba.mn.org.

(Sorry about the poor name for the machine; this is a pretty common error
for people sending mail to my home machine.  I originally named it back when
there wasn't any such thing as domain naming, and I needed a world-unique name
for the UUCP project.  "Rebma" was the only placename from Zelazny's "Amber"
series that wasn't already in-use at the time.  It SEEMED like a good idea, 
then.)
