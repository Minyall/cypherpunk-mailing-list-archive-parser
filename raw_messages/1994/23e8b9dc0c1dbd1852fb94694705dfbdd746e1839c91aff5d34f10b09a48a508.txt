Of course you haven't seen such a thing. If factoring RSA keys
requires exponential time, such an algorithm is obviously not
possible. Were it possible, you could factor in time proportional to
the the number of bits in the key. Anyone who had such a function
would either be famous or wouldn't be talking.
