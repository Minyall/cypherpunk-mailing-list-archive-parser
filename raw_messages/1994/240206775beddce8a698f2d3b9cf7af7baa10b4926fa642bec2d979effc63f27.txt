>>No.  Schneier is a start, but the source papers...

Speaking of Schneier, I have an upbeat note.

I ordered his book, when it first came out, from the local Borders book
store.  When I went to pick it up, they told me that if I decided to buy it
I could not return it, since it was not a book that they would otherwise
stock.

Today I was there checking out the computer books, and they had a copy on
the shelf, so I guess it was in enough demand that they decided to stock it.
