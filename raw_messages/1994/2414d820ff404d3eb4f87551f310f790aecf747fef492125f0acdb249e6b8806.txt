Perhaps the context is relevant.  Chaitin's `omega', for example, is
Kolmogorov random (too bad!).  (Omega is the sum over all x of m(x),
where m(x) is the Solomonoff-Levin distribution.)

This is an informal argument, using an informal definition of
randomness.  Presumably in this discussion we could standardize
on Kolmogorov randomness, to which definition Berry's paradox
does not apply.
