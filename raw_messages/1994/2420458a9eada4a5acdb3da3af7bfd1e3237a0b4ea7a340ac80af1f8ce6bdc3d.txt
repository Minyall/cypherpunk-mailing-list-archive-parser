I've been using magic money, the digital cash implementation. I have a 
few requests that maybe you could think about.

1) any hope for a macintosh version anytime soon? I've had a number of 
requests for it...

2) it seems possible to write a routine to report on the banks' current 
money supply; It'd be useful for me, anyhow. Using the info in elist.dat 
and dlist.dat and spent.dat I think it'd be trivial. Is it?

more later..
