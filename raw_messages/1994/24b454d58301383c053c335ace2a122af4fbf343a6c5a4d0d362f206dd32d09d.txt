There's been a lot of discussion lately about trying to make stego files
not have any identifying marks, so that usage of stego would be
indistinguishiable from noise.  A more effective option might be to
insert obvious (or somewhat obvious) stego messages in lots of graphics.
 Take every graphic file you own and hide something in it with a stego
program.  Put PGP messages in them (even including the obvious ----
BEGIN PGP MESSAGE ---- headers).  Or a BBS ad.  Or just cute little
messages.  Then distribute the files that way.  Hopefully, people will
take these images and pass them on without ever knowing there was stuff
in them.  If enuff people do this, graphics will become so "polluted"
with stego messages that your truly secret PGP messages will be hidden
in plain sight along with all the other graphic files full of stuff, and
won't stand out.  Plus, you could plausably deny having put it there,
claiming that it must have been that way when you got it, and that you
didn't know it was there.
