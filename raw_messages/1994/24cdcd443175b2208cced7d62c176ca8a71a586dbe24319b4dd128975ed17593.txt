I don't agree. Apart from the IP address crunch that already poses a problem 
for the IETF, I don't see why DC-Nets should be limited to specially allocated
addresses. DC-Nets should be implemented a layer over protocols such as IP,
or as extensions to them. It should be possible for _anyone_, regardless of 
IP address (officially allocated DC-Net number) to connect with _any_ others
on a DCN, with some software or other interfacing.
