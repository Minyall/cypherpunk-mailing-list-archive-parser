Very cool.  I wasn't aware that such a splitting program already existed,
although XSPLIT is different than shade in that you need all the parts to
put the file back together and if you miss a part, you don't have anything.

Also, XSPLIT will produce N files of the same size as the original file you
feed it.

What exactly is SHADE useful for?  Distributing a file where some of it can get
damaged?  Some software RAID implementation?  Can it be used for encryption?
