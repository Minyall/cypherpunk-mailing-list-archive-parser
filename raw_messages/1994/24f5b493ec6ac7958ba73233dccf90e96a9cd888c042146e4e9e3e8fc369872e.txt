At the location:
http://pmip.maricopa.edu/crypt/cypherpunks/Cypherpunks.src
is the location of all the Cypherpunks' posts with index. I can
get to this place by placing a "www" in front of this instruction.
However, then, their are no "hyper" keys to push. Some key words are
listed but I don't know how to use them to get info..
Anyone familiar with www & got some answers?.
                                    Yours Truly,
                                    Gary Jeffers
