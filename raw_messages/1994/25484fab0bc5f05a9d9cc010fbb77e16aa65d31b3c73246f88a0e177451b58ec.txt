A quote from an illustration:

A Xerox technology, known as glyphs, would enable paper 
business documents to carry thousands of characters of 
information hidden in unobtrusive gray patterns that can appear 
as backgrounds or shading patterns.  Glyphs could be used for 
encoding machine-readable data onto paper documents.
