The list software seems to be having problems again.  I sent the below
post to the list three times, and it never got sent out.  But since
another post from me just showed up, maybe it's working now...  (Let me
know if you got more than one copy, because I sure didn't.)

hehe...  This didn't come from my site tho.  It looks like a clever port
25 hack.  However, the return address is valid.

I suppose this points out another problem with the US export laws:  How
can you know where a message came from?  As the above example shows,
there is really no way to know where the person you're communicating
with is.  In other words, you can't not break the US export laws.  All
you have is someone's word that they are in the US or not, but you
really can't know for sure.  Something to mention in your letters to
Rep. Cantwell.

Cute...  using part of your encrypted address as a handle?  I never
thought of doing that... hmm...
