*New* appearance?  Do you mean to say you've been here before?
As L. Detweiler, as an12070, as tmp@netcom?

But anyway, you're right.  A new e-mail address is a chance for a
new beginning.  I suggested something like this to you when you
showed up as tmp@netcom.com, in fact.  But you didn't exactly hold
up your end of the game.  This time, I'm not willing to cut you as
much slack.  Your "BIG COLLISION" announcement and the probably-yours
"WE ARE BLAMELESS AT NETCOM" slander don't encourage me, either.
You're piling up some lousy karma for future incarnations...
