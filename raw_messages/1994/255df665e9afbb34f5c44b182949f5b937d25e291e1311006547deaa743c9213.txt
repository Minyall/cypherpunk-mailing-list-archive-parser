Since my last news bulletin I have been able to verify that the
fix to the FPART utility, FPART13D.ZIP is now available on csn.org.

Also file SECDR13E.ZIP is release 1.3d with the updated FPART files.

The configureation of csn.org has changed somewhat:

Anonymous ftp for csn.org has been moved to ftp.csn.net. There isn't
any "pub" directory any more, so cd directly to mpj.  get README
or README.MPJ to the console and then cd to the directory name indicated.

then cd to secdrv.  The files are

- -rw-r--r--  1 5420         12461 May 26 20:51 fpart13d.zip
- -rw-r--r--  1 5420        115287 May 26 14:37 secdr13e.zip
