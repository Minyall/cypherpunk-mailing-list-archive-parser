I gathered some list statistics for the subscriber base as of
Thursday, February 3, 1994, 12:00 noon.

657 subscription addresses total. 49 contain the string 'cypher' and
are suspected gateways, either to individuals or large groups, so the
exact amount is extremely hard to pin down.

Here are the subscribers, broken down by top-level domain

If anybody knows for sure where SI and EE are, I'd love to know.  My
list of ISO country codes is a little old.

share, at least.
