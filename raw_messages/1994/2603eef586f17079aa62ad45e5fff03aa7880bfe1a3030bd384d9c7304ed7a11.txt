Duhh.  Reading a little further, I find that Kable can be reached at
+44 171 410 9046.  I called and there's a two-tier pricing policy for
the report: about L40 (that's a fancy "pounds sterling" sign) for
public sector & university purchases, and about L200 for
private-sector purchases.

They can't do credit cards, ironically enough.
