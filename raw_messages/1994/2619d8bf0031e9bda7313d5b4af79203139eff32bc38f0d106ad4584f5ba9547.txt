C'punks,

I seem to recall a thread on the origin of the term "tempest" with regard 
to electromagnetic emissions.  Several people thought it was an acronym 
and various phrases were offered.  

I found a story I don't think was mentioned.  It's in an article from 
/Full Disclosure/, #26.  The article, "Hi-Tech Fraud," is by James E. 
Carter of Bank Security.  The relevant part says:

	... Is there a real danger because of EME?

	Well, I have known about EME for over thirty years and back
	then our government was so concerned the subject was classified.
	Our government gave EME the name "Tempest."  When this issue
	was brought up before a congressional committee, the statement
	was made, "it sounds like a tempest in a teapot."  So thereafter
	the name Tempest was adopted, so the story goes.

Sounds plausible.
