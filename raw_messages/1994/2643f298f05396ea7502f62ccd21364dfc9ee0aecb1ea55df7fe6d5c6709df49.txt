There's a difference.  docmaster.ncsc.mil gives guest accounts to all sorts
of private security consultants -- perhaps to dilute/mask any NSA presence.
Everyone I've talked to from dockmaster has been non-NSA.

would be taken as an official statement from the NSA (remember the alleged
loose cannon who tried to tell the IEEE not to have an international
meeting on crypto?).
