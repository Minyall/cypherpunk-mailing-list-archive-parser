Has anyone else given thought to "Guerrilla Remailers?" Basically someone
obtains an account on one of the freenets or similar free account, sets up
a remailer and lets it sit for a while. (Until telnet and/or phone logs
are overwritten) After this time frame the address of the remailer is
posted. The remailer then would be used until it is shut down by the Powers
that be. The account would be set up under a bogus name etc. This would
make the remailer the ideal candidate for the last hop in a remailer chain.
(After all if they can't find Juanna DuBone or Jack Mehoff they can't apply
any pressure to them or hold them responsible. It seems to me the extent of
pressure in this case would be just to shut down the remailer) Just keep a
few ahead and keep leap frogging, as one is shut down another is put on line.
