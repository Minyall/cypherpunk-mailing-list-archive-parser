	Or leave the binary on a floppy (assuming you can access
floppies, or some other removable media.)  The problem reduces pretty
quickly to a variant of trusting trust.  root can hack the kernel, the
math libraries, your shell, or several other points to make life
difficult.  Can you go through a set of steps so convoluted as to
catch this?  Probably.  But in all likelyhood, its easier to get a
personal machine on which to store private files.
