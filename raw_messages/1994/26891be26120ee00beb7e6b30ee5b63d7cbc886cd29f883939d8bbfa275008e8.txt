"I'd be very interested in which course (or some other undefined course 
I didn't think of) that the anarchists feel would be reasonable..."

I would have considered the nature of the situation - of what it means 
to have one's words/pseudonymous email image reconfigured by someone 
whom everyone else on the net pretty much ignores, whose attacks 
increasingly deteriorate, whose rants are laughable, who argues in 
circles, and who replies to himself in public email.

I would have addressed the circumstance in psychological, rather than 
legal, terms.
Gingerly & carefully, as to a wild beast in the jungle, or to a fool on 
the highway.
