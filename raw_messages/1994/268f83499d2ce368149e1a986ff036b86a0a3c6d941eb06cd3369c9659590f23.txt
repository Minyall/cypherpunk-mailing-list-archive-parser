I wrote up a short "test bed" for Dining Cryptographers over IRC (Internet
Relay Chat).  The implementation is not secure, as it uses PRIVMSGs to
exchange flips between neighbors, but some good soul with a bit of time
could go in and add DES encryption to them. 

The client allows for anonymous roundtable discussion between clients on 
a single IRC channel.  The key-sharing graph is a ring, so it only takes 
two to collude to find what a particular person is sending, but that can 
be expanded also.  There is no collision detection, but it is usually 
pretty obvious (i.e. if you send something and don't get it back, you 
know a collision happened).

I also included a paper which has some discussion and references to 
making the DC implementation better, including things like protection 
against attacks coming from the IRC server itself, protection against 
someone sending stuff all the time disallowing service, etc.

This has all been put in the cypherpunks ftp incoming directory.
