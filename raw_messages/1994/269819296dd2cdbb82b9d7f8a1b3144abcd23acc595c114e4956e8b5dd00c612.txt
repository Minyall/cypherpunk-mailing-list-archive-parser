Oh, it's worse than that. Try it out and you'll find that Norton Partition
gets 56 bits from 64 by throwing away the _low_ bit in each of the eight
characters of your password. 

Worse still, Norton Partition includes a block of data
at the beginning of the disk partition you create, which encrypts your
password with an xor cipher. I haven't had time to work out the complete
mapping as of yet, but change one bit in your password, and one bit
in the header block changes. This goes beyond a poor implementation and
into the territory of a deliberate back door.

Damned irresponsible.
