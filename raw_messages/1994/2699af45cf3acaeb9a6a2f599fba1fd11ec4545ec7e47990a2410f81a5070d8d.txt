Indeed, but I think Axel Boldt deserves commendation for thinking
about remailer security and looking in detail (though not enough, as
two posters have noted) at the possible attacks that may be used for
traffic analysis.

Generally, it makes sense to ask if an attacker can make any
correlations between incoming and outgoing messages. In this case,
where PGP is using a random session key, it looks like no correlation
can be made (except for message length and timing correlatins, which
we've discussed before, vis-a-vis message padding and latency).

This list is sometimes harsh on points raised, but I think we're far
less flamish than the Usenet groups in general. 

So, don't give up!
