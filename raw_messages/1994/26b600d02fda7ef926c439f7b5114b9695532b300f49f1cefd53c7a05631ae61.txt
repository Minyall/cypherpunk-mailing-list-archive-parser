   If I my e-note instructed the bank to deposit some funds into a numbered 
account of my supplier, then I have no proof that that transaction was 
actually going to supplier X.  Remember, one of the requirements by 
cypherpunks is to mask (if desired) where money is going.  Even if I used 
the supplier's name on the e-note instructions, how could I prove that the 
name on the note and said supplier are the same?  The only thing I could 
have PROOF of is that I spent N ammount of money.
