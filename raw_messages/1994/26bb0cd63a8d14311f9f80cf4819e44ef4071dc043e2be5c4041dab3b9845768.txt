Online systems are also guaranteed anonymous. The whole point of
offline transactions is just to eliminate the need to be online, which
can be inconvenient -- as an example, if you are trying to buy
something on a streetcorner or otherwise away from telecom. In the
future, this will not be so much of a problem. For the moment its
quite interesting.
