No, I think the MTCR is like ITAR: it restricts who may export what.
The MTCR is the rationale behind why we don't export rocket engines to
countries like Pakistan who are believed to be developing IRBMs. Of
course, some dual-use technology probably slips through, just as it
has with ITAR and COCOM.

All of the strategic arms reduction treaties include a provision for
telemetry monitoring, but I didn't think "ordinary" satellite launches
were covered. Especially in the case of commanding; you really don't
want J. Random Hacker to reorient the attitude or orbit of your
comsat.
