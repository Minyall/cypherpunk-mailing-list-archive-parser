Hello from Cypherella!

Thanks for your interest in Stego. I have prepared this note
to answer most of the questions I've been asked about Stego.

1. Where is Stego?
Stego was moved from the /Recent directory to the
compression utilities directory '/cmp' in the info-mac
directory at sumex-aim@stanford.edu. You can download the
Mac version from there.

2. Is a PC,DOS,MSDOS version coming?
I have not been developing one, for lack of suitable
hardware. Fortunately, bart.simpson@glib.org, has developed
a PC version that operates on TIF files, and Colin James
Maroney informed me that he's made a PC verson that operates
on GIF files. He is shag@oregon.uoregon.edu. I haven't tried
either of these; I hope they're useful.

3. How can I get a copy of Stego by mail?
Send a check or postal money order for US$15 and your
address to:

Romana Machado c/o
Paradigm Shift Research
19672 Stevens Creek Blvd Suite 127
