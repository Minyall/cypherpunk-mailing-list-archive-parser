i disagree.  thats exactly what the keyservers are for!  there is
absolutely no reason to flood mailboxes with your key, especially
when anyone who is really interested in verifying your signature 
can get your get from the keyserver _once_, which is all that is
necessary.

if i already have your key, i dont _want_ to see it again!
