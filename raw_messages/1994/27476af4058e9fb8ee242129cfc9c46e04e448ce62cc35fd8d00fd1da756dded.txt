	After reading my post on "real logic" I realized that I may come of
as saying "Germany is screwed up".. I don't feel this way.. and even if I did
I have no evidence to support it.. I was merely using the points that
TAZ supplied.. maybe some of you knew that.. but I just thought I'd clear
it up so I don't get flamed by every German on the list.. TTFN!
