Does anyone here have any thoughts as to whether Clipper enables traffic
analysis or tracing more easy than it normally is under Switching System
7? The reason I ask is, I have this sense that one reason the government
likes Clipper is that the Law Enforcement Access Field enables agents
to draw inferences about who's talking to whom and what they're saying,
even without decrypting the actual communications.

What do you think?
