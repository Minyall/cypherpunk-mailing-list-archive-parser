No!  Who's going to keep track of all these ID's?  Who'se going to
get access to the database?  Who's to stop "them" from changing their
minds one day and making it such that I need to key in my ID to watch
broadcasts from political fringe groups?

Sorry.  I realize that in some sense things today on cable hover in
the balance; my interest in this group stems from a desire to see the
Great Global Net of the future be one based on the premise that
anonymity has great value.
