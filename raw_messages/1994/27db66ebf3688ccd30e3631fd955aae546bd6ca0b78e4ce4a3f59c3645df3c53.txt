C'punks,

American law differs from all other English-derived law in that in the US,
truth is a defense against charges of libel or slander.  Furthermore,
American law is generally more "free speech" oriented with regard to what
would otherwise be considered libel or slander.  I don't know how this
would have played in the States, but I'm not surprised that an Australian
court found for the plaintiff.
