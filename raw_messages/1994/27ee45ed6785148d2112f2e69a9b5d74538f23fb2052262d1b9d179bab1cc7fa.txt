While I understandand and can relate to much of what has been written 
about the problems of message volume, and general static, I can't help feeling 
that something would be lost if moderation were put in place. 

What is distressing about much of what is written in the press about the
net is the attitude and viewpoint from which it is written. It is 
invariably a round up of the usual deviant suspects and and places 
an emphasis on any negative aspects of the net that can be found. This 
viewpoint and coverage can only bring regulation all the sooner.

This list however has always seemed to represent the attitude that a little 
anarchy is a good thing, in opposition to so much of the coverage one sees.

It has its problems, but the benefits are what keep everyone tuned in.
I would prefer the occasional reminder that "Cypherpunks write code",
to a censor by another name.
