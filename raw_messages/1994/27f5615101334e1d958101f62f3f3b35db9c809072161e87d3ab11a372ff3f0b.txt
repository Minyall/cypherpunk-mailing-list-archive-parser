The real problem to be solved is this: given a set of input messages,
and a set of output messages which represent decryptions of the input
ones (along with perhaps a bit of extra processing), make it impossible
to tell which output messages go with which input ones.  Clearly, if the
messages are of widely disparate sizes, and output messages are similar
size to input messages, that won't do.  That is where the idea of padding,
and of standardized messages sizes, comes from.
