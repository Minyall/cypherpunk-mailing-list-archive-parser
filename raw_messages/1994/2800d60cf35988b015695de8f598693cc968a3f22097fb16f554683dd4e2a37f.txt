I seem to remember reading somewhere that using PGP to encrypt a message
for multiple recipients (in the same output file) somehow made 
cryptanalysis easier, but I don't seem to recall the rationale behind that 
concern.  Can somebody comment on that.

Also, concerning the PGP 2.3a/2.6/2.6ui controversy, is the only "problem" 
with 2.6 the fact that after 9/1/94 it will start reporting an incompatible 
version number that will make its output unreadable by older versions?  If 
so, and if source code is available, why couldn't the date checking routine 
be located in the source code and simply commented out, then the whole 
thing recompiled?
