  The real problem is the same sort of problem that one has to face in all
  public spaces.  If an individual is allowed to speak, they may be abusive.
  If they are not allowed to speak, the state is being abusive.  Usenet is
  a public space.  Sure, people have attempted to moderate parts of it, but
  all they've really done is split off from the public space to form private
  spaces which have restrictive policies on content.

  Co-operation amongst remailer operators won't solve this problem either.
  If any one site lets Larry use a remailer, then he's free to abuse the
  system.  Like open terminal servers, a few may survive the purge, but
  the abuses tend to consolidate the opinion of the many against the
  idea of the service.

  First of all, I'd like to see remailer servers running on a well-known
  port.  That way, anyone could stick up a remailer, provided they had
  access to a C compiler.  There would be no cabal of remailer operators, 
  because everyone would have the possiblity of being a remailer.  Also,
  an isolated remailer isn't useless.  It doesn't provide perfect anonymity,
  especially since it may be doing logging.  But, remember, when the entire
  chain is as strong as it's strongest link, the chain doesn't necessarily
  need to be more than one link long.

  So then you end up with a situation where the potential abusers are writing
  subject lines which don't match the contents.  In general, you're going to
  have a hard time trying to prevent certain subjects from getting out,
  especially if you plan on automating this function.

  Actually, I don't believe that it's better.  I think that the base
  functionality of remailers should be standardized, so that they can 
  all interoperate, but I don't think that forcing the operators into
  a cabal is at all helpfull.

  I think you're right.  He wanted to know if Hal could be trusted to not
  give in when the "abuse" became unbearable.  Hal, apparently, couldn't.

  I understand that Hal has to do what he feels is right.  However, if all
  remailer operators are going to cave when faced with an "abuser" who they
  don't agree with, then there will be no anonymity for anyone.

  What ever happened to "I hate what you say, but I will fight to the death
  for your right to say it?"

  How long will it be before we get to the point where certain "contents" are
  considered off-limits?  

  Everyone needs to be able to run a remailer.  How else will you be able to
  trust the remailer operator?
