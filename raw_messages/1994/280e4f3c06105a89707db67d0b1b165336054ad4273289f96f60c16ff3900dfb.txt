     Like the use of PGP, this may be due to the different tools in
use.  I read email using the vm package for emacs.  While I was on the
extropians list I found it very convenient to reply to the first
message of a topic I was not interested in, modify the address, and
enter the simple ::exclude message.  Other tools and environments
could make this more difficult.

     Good point.
