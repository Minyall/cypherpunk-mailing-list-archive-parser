Well, lets see if this address works. I tried all of the gateways listed in
the cyphernomicon and all of my messages to
alt.security.keydist@whatever.gateway either bounced or vanished into the
vast cyberspace void. I was going to do it the hard way. The problem is I
can't throw extra info into the header to route the messages through a
remailer. Hmmm...worse comes to worse I probably could make procmail do
it...something to ponder.
