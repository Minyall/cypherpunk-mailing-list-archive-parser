I've watched enough TV in my day to realize that if PGP had been
broken, they sure as heck wouldn't tell anybody about it.  The only
reason to make such an implication is to prevent people from using it.

Note that doubling the key size from 1024 to 2048 bits is also
probably a ruse, since it dramatically increases computation time (I
think).  1024 bits are a lot of bits as it is.
