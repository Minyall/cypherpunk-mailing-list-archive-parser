That's interesting that it works that way on your system. I have premail
installed here as /usr/lib/sendmail and I still have a ~/.premailrc that
premail reads. I have aliases installed in my own ~/.premailrc that allows
my messages to be automatically encrypted to the recipients in tha alias
list. Are you SURE yours doesn't operate this way also?
