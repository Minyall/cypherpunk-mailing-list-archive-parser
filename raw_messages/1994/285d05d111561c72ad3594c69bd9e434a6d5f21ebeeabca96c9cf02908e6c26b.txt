I've finished implementing the GNU mp library in perl of which I've 
already extended to work with an Object Relational Database. All this 
together gives me very fast access to numbers in the order of 8192
digets in base 36, geesh I have no clue as to how many base 10 digits that 
is but I feel that its proabably enough to play with some digital cash
prototypes...

So those that want to start formulating some REAL implementations of 
protocols of digital cash I'm offering to run the "virtual bank" and 
implement the server side protocols. I'd like to see how some of these 
theries realy work in practice, yes I'd encourage double spending as soon 
as we can get some apps up to accept whatever we decide upon for the 
cash protocol. I'd like to see if all the discussions about digital cash
can realy work!!!

would anyone else like to put their (virtual) money where their mouth
(or keyboard) is ?
