I'm sure I'll get corrected if I'm wrong, since my only claim to HAM 
knowledge is a couple of freinds and attendance at countless midwest 
HAM-fests...

  I believe a HAM license allows you to transmit on certain semi-publicly 
allocated frequency ranges.  Companies encrypting their satalite 
uplink/downlink have paid for an exclusive license for that particular 
frequency, and can therefore scramble transmissions to protect their 
commercial interest.

  So, do I get flamed now?
