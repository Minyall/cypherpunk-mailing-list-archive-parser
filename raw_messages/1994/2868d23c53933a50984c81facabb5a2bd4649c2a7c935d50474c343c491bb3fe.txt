As I recall, Matthew Gream just posted the results of several months
of investigation into Australia's crypto laws, which is probably the
most definitive summary available to date.  It is a superb piece of
work, but the thread died swiftly.

I also posted a summary of SENECA in sci.crypt (compiled with the help of DSD),
which is the Australian government classified DES replacement, and there
were were no followups there either.

One can only presume from all this that the interest is not really there.

I suspect, unfortunately, that you're right.  It's like taking cooking
tips from Lucretia Borger (sp?).
