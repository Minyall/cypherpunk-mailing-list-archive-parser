     I agree. Don't all monitors generate slightly (italicized) different
frequencies of EM radiation, even on the scan freq? If they do, then it
shouldn't be TOO hard to filter it out. Wouldn't a noise generator, if on
the correct scan frequency, or, if on the right EM rad. frequency, cause
problems for the monitor? It's just conjecture, but does anyone more
knowledgeable know the answers?
