Somebody has been repeatedly (probably by a script) trying to remail
through me to "remail@infinity.hip.berkeley.edu", which bounces back
to me (unknown user).  If it's somebody on this list, could you stop?
Otherwise I'll have to have something grep for it so I can source-
block the sender, and I don't really want to get into looking at
incoming traffic.
