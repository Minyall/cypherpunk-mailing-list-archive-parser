I used to be on the Oceania mailing list.  From what I can tell,
these guys are serious.  I must admit, I was taken with the idea.
Trade a few pairs of Levis for a Soviet warship and live in
international waters.  This design would have taken one or two
torpedoes.  About the time I left, they were thinking of floating
concrete domes in the Sargasso sea.
