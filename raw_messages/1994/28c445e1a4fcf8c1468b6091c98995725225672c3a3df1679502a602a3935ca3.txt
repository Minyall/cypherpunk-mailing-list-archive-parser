Actually, this should be "about PGP [possibly] infringing on
patents"..  He made a PGP key, but when the patent issues came up, he
destroyed everything.  Now that 2.6 is out and santified by all
parties concerned, he has created a new key, which is on the
keyservers!

Just thought I'd clear the air a little it (I hope)
