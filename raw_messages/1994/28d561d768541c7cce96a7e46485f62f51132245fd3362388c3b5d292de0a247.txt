There are much more recent drafts, Steve -- the telnet authentication
option is now RFC1409, as of early last year, and the encryption draft
is dated April 1993 -- see the nearest internet drafts mirror for a
copy. Your recollection of the desire to merge authentication and
encryption is correct -- to my knowledge, the new Cray telnet is an
implementation of the currently circulated draft (which was also
written at Cray).
