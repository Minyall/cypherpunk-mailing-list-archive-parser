: 	I myself have a Linux system at home, all set up with PGP and 
: rather secure from outside thrats since it is unconnected from the net 
: except for when I dial-up.  I was wondering what strategies some people 
: use in order to make it easier to write and respond to mail.  I dont feel 
: like writing a message at home, encrypting it and then U/Ling it to my 
: acount and mailing it. Is there another wya to use PGP on my mail account 
: wihtout severely reducng mysecurity? I know the Sysop can read my secring 
: etc.. at any time and can also intercept my passkey for my secring, BUT I 
: would still like to perhaps use a low security key from my Unix account 
: and then have a high security key on my home system that is very safe.  
: The problem is, figuring out which message goes to where and all.  Could 
: someone with extnsive knowledge of PGP use on a Unix system help me out 
: here>?
