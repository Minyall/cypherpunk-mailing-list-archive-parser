In general, scienter/mens rea requirements mean that you must have intended
a particular action (or failure to act) - the question is about your 
understanding of the facts of a particular situation, not the legal status
of a particular situation. Given your example, it's illegal to drive
across the border, knowing your pickup contains ammunition - whether or
not you believe your actions are legal. It's not illegal to drive across
the border with a box full of ammunition if you thought you were carrying
a box full of clothes.

The old saw "ignorance of the law is no excuse" is basically accurate.
Good-faith reliance on legal advice from competent counsel won't even
save you. (but it might get you a malpractice judgement/settlement).
