The news software is explicitly designed to allow remote hosts to
request articles from each other.  Article numbers are never reused --
I can just use a nasty hierarchical storage system to keep all the
news articles I ever receive online.  So, how can you reconcile the
existance of the news software with your quaint notions? Are you
claiming that CNews and INN break the law? Are you claiming usenet is
illegal or something?

Maybe you are struggling because there is no reasonable way to make
the distinction?

Well, you can now sue all the people who back up their home
directories nightly to optical disk. I believe all the folks at Bell
Labs who use Plan-9 are now in violation of your "copyright".
