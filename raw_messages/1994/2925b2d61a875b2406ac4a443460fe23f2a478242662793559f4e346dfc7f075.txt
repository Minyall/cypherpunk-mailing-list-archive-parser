People:

I would really like Mondo 2000 to review my book.  Suppsedly my editor
has been talking to someone there (if I had more details I would supply
them) but they are reluctant to do the review.  I remember some of you
people at the meeting in Jan had some connection with the magazine.  Any
suggestions on who I should talk to?
