Hasn't someone come up with a name for this like "Entropy of the data is 30 
days" or... "the half-life of the data is 15 days".  This is a critical 
value when looking at it from a military point of view.  If you can't decode 
enemy plan for attack before a certain date/time then the info is 
useless....
