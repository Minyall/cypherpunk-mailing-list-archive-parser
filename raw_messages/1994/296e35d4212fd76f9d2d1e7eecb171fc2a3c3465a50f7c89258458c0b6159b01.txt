| Nope, it's da truth. :-)  I'm not doing this out of paranoia.  I'm

	When the police state arrives, doing any of the thigns
mentioned here will be cause for arrest.  If you didn't have anything
to hide, you'd be cooperating with the police, and writing all your
mail on post cards.

	If you want to hide, build deep underground, preferably in
hard, mineral bearing rock, like the bottom of a mine shaft.  Most of
the means of survelience in use rely on thin walls, windows, or easy
access for black bagging.  Of course, make sure you have plenty of
food and water, and multiple lines of communication out.  Also, old
mine shafts have been known to collapse when the BATF is around.

	Fighting a police state is much easier before it arrives.
