I heard on the news this morning that the White House had informally 
agreed with Bobby Inman's decision to pull his name from consideration 
for the Secretary of Defense, but wouldn't have any comment until it 
was formalized.  No explanation of reasons.

I guess the CypherPunk lobbyists earned their pay this month <g>.  
Perhaps some folks didn't like the idea of a career military type 
taking over what is usually considered a civilian post?
