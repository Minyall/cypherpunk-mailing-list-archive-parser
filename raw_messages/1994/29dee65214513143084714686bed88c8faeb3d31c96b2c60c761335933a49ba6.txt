Libertarions and c*punks are the first to take advantage of new communication
technologies. Until the authorities catch on, that is... When authorities
grow aware of the power of technology for Control, Surveillance and 
Big Brother Watching, they behave repressively, whether in the US, or China:

Reuters news clip from The Asian Age:

BEIJING, Feb 16: Police have cracked into China's largest group of ham-radio
hackers and sent three ringleaders to labour camp for "creating chaos in the
airwaves," the official China Business Times said on Wednesday.
   The group, dubbed "Radio Air Salon" ands based in Henan province, surfed 
through radio channels interrupting regular broadcasts with their own 
conversations and illegally listening in on restricted frequencies, the 
newspaper said.
   "The use of technical equipment to create chaos in the airwaves and 
_interfere with social order_ is a new type of illegal activity," the newspaper 
said. It said police caught 61 members of the group, which had efectively taken 
over 27 radio channels.
   "At present they are all being punished, with three of the backbone elements
undergoing _RE-EDUCATION THROUGH LABOUR_," the newspaper said.

Well, perhaps the NSA won't euphemistically "re-educate you through labour,"
but...
