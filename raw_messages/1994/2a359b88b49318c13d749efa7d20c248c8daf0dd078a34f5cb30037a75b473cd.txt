Intel in bed with the government over Clipper? While Intel may own
10-20% of VLSI Technology Inc. (VTI), it is VTI that is manufacturing
the MYK-78 and related chips for Mykotronx.

A year ago, I talked to the guy who hired me into Intel in 1974, Craig
Barrett (who is about to take over Andy Grove's job as President), and
informed him of VTI's crummy role in the Clipper deal. I suggested to
him that any Intel involvement in Clipper would not help Intel's image
amongst computer types. Craig was uncommunicative on this--I got the
impression he had no idea what I was talking about. 

This doesn't mean Intel is not involved, of course, but surely the
main culprits are Mykotronx, VTI, and AT&T. Intel gets enough bad
press as it is not to be further tarred with the brush of Clipper.
