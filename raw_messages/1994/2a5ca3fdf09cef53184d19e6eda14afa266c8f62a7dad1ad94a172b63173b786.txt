My original response was concerning an algorithm "good enough to withstand 
an opponent who has full documentation of your algorithms and methods lots 
of funds, and everything except your keys."

That opponent may, concievably, be the NSA or another person/organisation 
with access to similar resources.  The consensus seems to point to such 
an opponent as being one who could mount the "strongest possible attack".

It may not be practical to consider such a general danger when designing 
particular encryption schemes; but, it is likewise impractical to make 
sweeping generalizations concerning a given scheme's invulnerability.
