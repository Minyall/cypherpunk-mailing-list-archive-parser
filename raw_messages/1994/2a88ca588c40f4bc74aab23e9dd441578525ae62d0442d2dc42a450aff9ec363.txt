: 24 bits gives us 16,777,216 unique ID's. 32 bits gives us 4,294,967,296.
: Are there really over 17 million PGP'ers out there, or is my math-impaired

It's the old "birthday paradox" game.  If you're generating numbers at
random within a certain range, how many numbers do you have to generate
before you have a probability >= 0.5 of generating two the same?

Do it first for range = 0..2^24-1 and then for range = 0..2^32-1 ...
