     I've been researching this and related topics (offshore
corporations, non-U.S. banks, mail drops, etc.) and I have many ideas
and questions I'd like to discuss.  Is this an appropriate mailing
list or does a superior venue exist?  Is there enough interest for a
new list?  Are there any commercial providers that run electronic
mailing lists (if so, how costly are they)?
