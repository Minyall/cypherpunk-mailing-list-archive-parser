The danger stems not from the radiation effects of the alpha
exposure, which are not significant, but from the fact that
continuous long term internal exposure will eventually cause your
cells to undergo malignant transformation.  This may take several
decades, but it will kill you just as surely in the end.

With regard to this risk, internal contamination with even a
billionth of a gram of plutonium is something to worry about.

Some believe, for instance, that a good part of the risk of lung
cancer from smoking comes from inhaling alpha-emitting isotopes
of polonium and other elements that are concentrated by the
tobacco plant.  I don't know enough about this theory to agree or
disagree with it, but it has been around for a number of years.
