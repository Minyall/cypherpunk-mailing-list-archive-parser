The "bug" looks like a deliberate design decision to me.  Everything from
the "--- BEGIN PGP" line to the first blank line is ignored, and is not
considered part of the signed message.  There's a comment in the source
code (file armor.c in the versions I checked), saying "Skip header after
BEGIN line".
