I discovered today at the Cypherpunks meeting what happened to the
posts of my paper I made to the list. 

I converted the FrameMaker version of a paper (to be presented in Monte
Carlo in early February) to plain text, with attempts to clean up most
of the non-standard ASCII stuff.

This paper was 43K in length, and I posted it, figuring most of you
could handle it (save it, dump it, etc.). So I posted it on Wednesday.
It didn't appear. So I tried again on Friday. Still nothing...and no
bounce messages, no nothing.

Well, Eric told me today that all messages above some size (40K, he
recalls) are routed to a mailbox for manual processing. He hasn't
checked it recently, so....

I hate to put files in my ftp account, as Netcom's ftp site is grossly
overcrowed and nearly all attempts to access it fail. (Netcommies are
roadkill on the I-way.))

But it is there, at ftp.netcom.com, in pub/tc/tcmay.

(Full address for direct access is: /ftp/pub/tc/tcmay.
