Since postmaster@lance.colostate.edu will not aid us in
requesting L. Detweiler <ld231782@longs.lance.colostate.edu>
to behave I guess we will have to start cc'ing (and forward
out prevous emailings) to

	postmater@colostate.edu

    as well as:

	Julian Kateley  <KATELEY@COLOSTATE.EDU>
	(303) 491-5778
    and 
	Stew McPherson  <STEW@YUMA.ACNS.COLOSTATE.EDU>
	(303) 491-7214

    being that they are the Administrative and Technical Contact 
    for the Domain Name COLOSTATE.EDU
