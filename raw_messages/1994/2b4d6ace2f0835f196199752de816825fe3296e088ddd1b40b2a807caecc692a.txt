	On M/N reordering schemes: A relatively simple way to avoid
the unlucky message sitting in the queue problem would be to store a
timestamped, ordered list of messages waiting to go.  When a new
message comes in, one is randomly selected to be sent out.  The list
is then examined to find messages older than H hours.  The entries for
those messages are then duplicated & reinserted into the list, thus
increasing the chances that a message thats been sitting around for a
while will be randomly selected. (As there are multiple pointers to
it, and only single pointers to new messages.)
