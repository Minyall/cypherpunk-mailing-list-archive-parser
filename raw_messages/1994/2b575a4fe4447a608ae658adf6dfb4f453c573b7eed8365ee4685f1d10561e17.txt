Project Guttenberg has only books that are in the public domain e.g.  
very old books. I suspect that Bruce Schneier (and the publisher)  
would like people to buy Applied Cryptography. I found it to be worth  
the price.

Does anyone know if Project Guttenberg(or anyone else) has electronic  
books
such as applied cryptography?
Thanks,
