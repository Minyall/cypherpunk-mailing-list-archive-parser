   Any chance a digital-audio recording of the could be made available 
   (similiar to Internet Talk Radio)?  I'd like to hear what Tim has to say, 
   but I don't have a Bay around me. :-)

Tellya what, I'll inquire of the ITR guys if they'd take a tape and
put it out.  Best we can do, until the MBone has enough capacity for a
continuous KFJC feed.
