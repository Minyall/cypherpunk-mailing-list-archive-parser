Basically, you have now combined a mutual fund with a currency, which
causes great trouble for anyone who would like to use the one without
the other.

Its true that transaction costs are often paid for implicitly by banks
lowering the interest that they pay you. However, thats a different
question.

I'd like to emphasize that Digicash is a TRANSACTION MECHANISM.
Digital cash is NOT a currency. There is no need to invent a new kind
of money -- there are already too many for the world's good as it is.
Digicash can admittedly be used to transfer shares in cattle farms as
easily as Dollars, but far more groceries take Dollars.
