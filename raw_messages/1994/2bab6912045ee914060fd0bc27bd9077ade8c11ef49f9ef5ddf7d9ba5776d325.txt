The NY Times today reports on "the first retail transaction on 
the Internet using a readily available version of powerful data 
encryption software designed to guarantee privacy."

Quotes:

card number," said Daniel M. Kohn, the 21-year-old chief 
executive of the Net Market Company of Nashua, N.H.

"I think it's an important step in pioneering this work, but 
later on we'll probably see more exciting things in the way of

cyberspace, the same way dollars have value in the real world, 
except that they have the properties of anonymity, privacy, and 
untraceability.  Many details remained to be worked out, Mr. 
Zimmermann said.
