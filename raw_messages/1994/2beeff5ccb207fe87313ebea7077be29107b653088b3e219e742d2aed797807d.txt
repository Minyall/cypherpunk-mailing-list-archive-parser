Not to denegrate either of those individuals, but the "original" work
on public choice economics was worth a Nobel Prize some years ago to
Buchannan (sp?). Its only been recently that the ideas have been
popularized by others. The concepts are more or less inherent in the
work of the Austrian school economists as well, so I suppose one
should credit Mises, Hayek, and the rest...
