I found this in sci.crypt, its by Peter Shore, the mathematician
who caused the resent excitement by finding a way to program a
quantum computer to factor numbers AND find discrete logarithms
in polynomial time. I realize nobody has even made a quantum
logic element yet, much less a working computer but the
implications are breathtaking.

 I should try clearing up some of the misconceptions that are
multiplying on sci.crypt on quantum computers.  So far, the only
things quantum computers are known to do in polynomial time that
cannot be done on regular computers are a few contrived-looking
problems, factoring, and discrete logarithms.  In the original
mention of quantum computers, Feynman suggested they be used for
simulating quantum mechanics, and this is probably another case
they do better than regular computers.  Quantum computers can be
simulated by ordinary computers, but doing so (as far as we
know) entails an exponential factor in increased computation
time, so factoring via simulating a quantum computer will be
much slower than trial division (and you probably thought that
was the slowest algorithm possible for factoring (-: ).  Quantum
computing can be accomplished by the action of Schrodinger's
equation on a (somewhat complicated) Hamiltonian, where the
number of bits of precision for needed for the Hamiltonian is at
most logarithmic in the length of the computation, so it's not
cheating by using exponentially many bits.
