   [re: a constant current consumption chip]

   I fail to see how this would increase cryptographic potential.  However, 
   it would seem to mask the device's EMR.  

One of the largest sources of radiated signal goes out the power
supply.  Some of the really high security chips, evidently, double
every gate for constant current draw.
