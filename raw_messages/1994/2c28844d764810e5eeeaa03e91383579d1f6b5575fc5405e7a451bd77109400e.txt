The ammo used by the A-10 chain gun uses a depleted uranium core that is
designed to defeat Chobam and other types of reactive armor. It is also 
used in F-14, F-15, F-16, and F-18's that are tasked with ground attack
missions where active armor tanks are expected to be encountered. The ammo
was specificaly developed for use in the late 70's for use against Soviet
T-72's in a Fulda Gap scenario.

I know of no ammo that uses anything other than brass or steel (in the 
case of mini-guns and other motor driven guns) for the case. The reason
that the Uranium is used is because of its high density.
