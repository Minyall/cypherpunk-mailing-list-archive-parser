Subject: IETF proposed standard for mime/PEM integration
Message-ID: <9412061824.AA19008@webster.imsi.com>
MIME-Version: 1.0

The IETF PEM working group has just decided to move the current
proposal for a security multiparts extension to MIME forward to draft
standard status.

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR CYPHERPUNKS: a standard should soon exist for
proper integration of encryption and signature programs and
email. This will make for easier interoperation between PGP and mail
user agents in the fairly near term.

Details are available in the security multiparts draft, available for
ftp from your nearest RFC repository's internet drafts subdirectory.
