Tim May's Cyphernomicon is available (on an experimental basis) from
<http://apocalypse.org/pub/u/nelson/bin.cgi/cyphernomicon>.  This is based on
an old version of his document.  I'll update it within a day or so
(ftp.netcom.com is too busy).  The document is used unchanged -- a
gateway program converts it on the fly.

His outline form is preserved.  I think you'll like the way it's
presented.  I know it still has problems.  I just got this working.
It's nearly 2 AM.  If I'm to have any hope of making it to midnight
tomorrow, I'd better get some sleep tonight!
