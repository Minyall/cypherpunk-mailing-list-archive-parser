It's also possible that they're not doing a direct cryptanalytic
attack.  They might be using technical or human means to compromise
the key distribution, for example, or they might just have bugged
somebody's phone.  But, yeah, the bottom line is that they were able
to read Russian military communications, which is a substantial
achievement.

The lack of decent theoretical underpinnings for most cryptosystems
is rather worrisome.
