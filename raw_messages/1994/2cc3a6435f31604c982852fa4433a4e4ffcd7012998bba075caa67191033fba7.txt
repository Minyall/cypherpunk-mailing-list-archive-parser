Could someone explain to me the difference, if any, between the
"USACM" and the panel of luminaries who put out the "Codes, Keys, and
Conflicts" paper?

The paper was downright bland in tone, while the one-page USACM
position in the press release is clearly hostile towards the EES.

Who is the USACM?  How big is it, who can join, and who has?
