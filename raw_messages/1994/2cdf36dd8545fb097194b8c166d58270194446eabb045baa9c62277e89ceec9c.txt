Carlos claimed to be a political terrorist, not a simple mercenary -
to be motivated by moral considerations.  This claim was probably
a simple lie, but true or false, if he had claimed to be a simple
hitman for hire, he would have been out of business fast.

Large scale, well organized illegal gambling does exist, and
operates smoothly on a basis of trust.

No large scale murder for hire organizations exist, and such
operations as do exist operate very erraticly because of
extreme distrust and treachery.

Morality is more than just game theory.  It is game theory plus
our methods for categorizing acts in terms that we can apply
game theory to.

Honoring an illegal bet has much in common with speaking the
truth, paying ones debts, and honoring a contract.  

Honoring a murder for hire contract, whether by the murderer
or the payer, has little in common with these things.
