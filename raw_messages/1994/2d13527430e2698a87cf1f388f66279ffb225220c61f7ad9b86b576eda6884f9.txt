This is a false dichotomy -- there are far more possibilities than
that. I pillory you not for being non-public but for being
non-intelligent. You could have bothered to read the literature and
designed something useful given an understanding of what came before
(your naive notion that somehow IPSP might require router
modifications would have been dispelled had you bothered to spend the
half hour needed to read and understand the proposals) or you could
have gone to the IETF and gotten everything done very fast if you'd
bothered to use the system right. As it stands you come off looking
like ignorant blunderers.
