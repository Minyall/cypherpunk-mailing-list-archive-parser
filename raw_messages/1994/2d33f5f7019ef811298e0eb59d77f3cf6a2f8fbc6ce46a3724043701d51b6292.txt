Yeah, "snooping" indeed!  According to Federal Computer Week, 
July 11, 1994:

   The hacker attacks have reached such a scale over the past 
few months
   "that on any give day DOD literally does not have control of 
five or
   six of its computer systems; the hackers do," one former 
government
   official said.
