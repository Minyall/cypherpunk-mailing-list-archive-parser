Several universities are taking steps to limit student and faculty
access to the Internet. Carnegie-Mellon U. is limiting access to a
number of newsgroups--and has said that students who attempt to
circumvent the restrictions by using gopher and such, will be
disciplined. McGill U., in Canada, is revising its code of behavior to
allow random searches of student files, limits on access, etc.

These moves are being widely discussed elsewhere, so I won't here.

My point here is to note a major new set of opportunities to
publicize the use of PGP and remailers. Students at these afflicted
universities can be given help in circumventing the new rules.

Here's an example (not posted by me):

McGill students seem resigned to the fact that the administration will
soon take away their electronic privacy by unilaterally changing
the student code.

Some are now advocating the widespread use of PGP and anonymous remailers.
A Web page will be created to allow non-experts easy form-based access.

... oh yeah, I bet in January we'll hear that PGP and anonymous email
are prohibited on McGill computers.  ;-(
