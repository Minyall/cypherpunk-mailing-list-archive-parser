I just tried it again and your remailer needs to be added to the
"Very fast" list! Not sure what happended the first time. By
"Very fast" I mean I get something back in less than a minute or two.
By "Way too slow." I mean I just never really saw it come back. I would
classify anon.penet.fi as "Way too slow" as I cannot even cooperate
on a mailing list with its upwards of 6-24 hour delays.

That leaves,
      1  nowhere@bsu-cs.bsu.edu <-[Way too slow.]
      1  remail@tamsun.tamu.edu <-[Way too slow.]

I'm still waiting and waiting and.... I tried these again, with no typos,
and it's been 45 minutes. Gary checked these for the FAQ so they must
work. Could be certain sites are down along the way. I have some OLD
logs of my playing with these, and at least once they got a "fast"
rating.

The problem is, I'm new to these remailers so if one fails ONCE I
don't know what to think.

P.S. I still need a perl (or whatever) script to output ten variables
containing a random assortment of remailer addresses. These need to
be csh environmental variables. This is only because I have a little
commands file that uses such variables. I know if I knew perl I could
whip this up in 5 minutes, so could somebody spend 5 and post this,
and tell me how to run it. Thanks.
