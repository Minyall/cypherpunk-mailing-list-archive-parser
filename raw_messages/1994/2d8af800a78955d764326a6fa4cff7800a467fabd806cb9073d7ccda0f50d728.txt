For those who believe "the NSA can do ANYTHING" or some such, an
article in the New York Times claims the annual black budget now seems
to be hovering around $28 Billion per year, for ALL secret government
work. All the spy planes, CIA bribes, etc, come out of that pool. Its
a lot of money, but not enough to pay for really outlandish things,
like disk drives the size of Seattle to store exhaustive listings of
all possible DES encryptions.
