Well, I'd say that the right to use whatever means available to shield
communication from eavedropping is as natural as any other.  It's not
a "right" to be free from attempts to eavesdrop, however.

If the FBI tries to tap my phone, then laws may (or may not) be
violated but no natural rights have.  If, however, I am prosecuted for
attempting to encase my information in a cryptographic strongbox
without providing the FBI the key, then I indeed see that as a
transgression against my natural rights as a person.
