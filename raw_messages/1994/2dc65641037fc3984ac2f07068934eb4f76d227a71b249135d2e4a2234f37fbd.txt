It was once said that (and I quote -very- loosely) "The price of liberty is
eternal vigilance", therefore, 'bad government' is probably not a result of
some kind of evil or malicious people, but just people who do not guard
their rights.  Obviously, there will be people in a society who will do
their best to protect their rights, but I speak of "people" as a society as
a whole, and therefore, if the isolated persons who stand up for their
rights are unable to make an impression on society at large, they will also
be subject to this 'bad government'.

Government will continually encroach upon its citizens' rights if the
people do not stand up for their liberties - therefore, if the citizens do
not protect their liberties, the liberties will be lost, and the people
will be responsible for this loss of liberty.
