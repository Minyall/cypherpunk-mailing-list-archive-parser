-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

   A file has appeared here called PGP26A.ZIP.  The readme file claims
this version "fixes all known bugs" in the 2.6 version.  I'm very 
suspicious.

  The file does not contain any viruses that I can detect, or have any
obvious functionality problems.  

  The pgp.exe file is signed by the key 
"Rebellious Guerrilla <rebel@f26.n374.z1.fidonet.org>".
Source files are not included.

  The rebel key is not signed by any other keys.

  Does anyone here have any info on this "release"?

  Thanks, Dave Hodgins.
