	It is possible to use the blind anonymous server running on
admin@omega.c2.org to create an identity for which posts are made to
pools. You would merely have to create a path which goes to
remailer@soda and from there the path should direct remailer@soda to
post to the pool.
	In time remail@c2.org will be able to post to newsgroups. At
this time remail@c2.org *does* have news capability, but outside
newsgroups (only a few local groups and mail->news gateways are
active) are not working yet on the Community ConneXion system.
