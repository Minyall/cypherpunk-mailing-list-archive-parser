Snicker, snicker.  What planet are *you* living on? :-)
The only reason it's sci._crypt_ is because that's what 90% of the
flame-fests get started on.  I'd guesstimate that only 1 posting in 100 is
actually about crypto, or some directly crypto-related matter.  The rest of
it is S*****light vs. The World name-calling and character assassinations.
