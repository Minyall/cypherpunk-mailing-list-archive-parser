And we will go through it again and again and again until the ones who
don't like MIME wake up to the fact that MIME is essential for todays and
tomorrows email messages, namely solid email encryption that doesn't
require much user intervention. Regardless what machine you use and what
part of the net you live on.

I agree it shouldn't take dozens of messages to get people to accept that.
I have no idea why anyone who followed these threads still won't accept
that MIME is a Good Thing and that MIME capable mailers (no mailers that
claim to be MIME capable and aren't) are a Good Thing as well.

But we have. And everytime we do, someone out there says:

"But my mailer doens't even handle todays MIME'd messages right. So it
won't do tomorrows either."

Why do you think this tread keeps comming back?
