here are some other ideas to consider in addition to or instead of the
20k limit:
 * require encryption for incoming messages.
 * require that the sender, the receiver, or both be a known remailer
   address.  at least one other remailer has to be involved.
 * impose a 20k limit on message unless they are received from a known
   remailer and sent to a known remailer.
