A compiler can recognize one specific piece of code or a few 
specific peices of code and do something perverse.  It cannot 
recognize functionally equivalent code, this
being a high order artificial intelligence problem.

Thus if someone used a perverted compiler to develop, debug, and
enhance the targe code, he would immediately discover the compiler
was perverted.
