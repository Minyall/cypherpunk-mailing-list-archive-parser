The "canary trap" is also called "barium" (coined by the KGB). Tagging
is sometimes useful, but can be found by XORing two or more
copies.

Sure, courts have interfered with contracts. Some of these
interferences I even agree with, slightly (while I'm mostly an

and reputatable (though anonymous) escrow agents will make such
contracts enforceable by other means.
