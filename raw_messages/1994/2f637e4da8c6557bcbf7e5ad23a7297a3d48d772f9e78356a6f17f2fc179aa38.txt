	I finally have a safe system to recieve mail on where I am the 
admin so I am wondering if there is a way i can automate PGP signing and 
decrypting and crypting mail with PINE, now with PINE I can choose emacs 
as my alternate editor and jump into emacs, and then use perhaps a PGP 
interface for Emacs then.  But the emacs macros would have to allow me to 
specify the save name, or keep it the same as the tmp file PINE assigns 
for outgoing compositions when I crypt them.  

Also since PINE is MIMI supporting, is their MIMI support for PGP stuff yet?

I am sorry I am so behind on this shit, it's just that I only marginally 
bothered to keep up with the interface stuff for Unix machines since I 
never had a machine that I could safely work from to sign outgoing mail 
and posts.

thanx
