Used to be that Universities were bastions of free thought and discussion.
Guess not nowadays, if this E-Mail to me earlier today is any indication:

	Mark,
	   I am a Student at Memorial University of Newfoundland, and I 
have recently been censored and had my postings to newsgroups aborted.  I 
received a message from our system administrator that the messages(of a 
political nature) were not appropriate.  I was wondering if I could use 
PGP to get past them?  I have read some about PGP, but I am still kind of 
in the dark as to how it works and what it can do.  Any info you could 
provide me would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance,
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maybe he was posting some stuff that contravened university policy...shrug.
But with the recent events at McGill University in Montreal, I'm prepared
to give him the benefit of the doubt.

The first step was to provide him with the instructions to the the xs4all
remailer. If he figures that is what he needs (more importantly....if he
isn't scared off!) then I'll give him the list of the other remailers
and mail him a copy of PGP.

Who knows? Maybe all he needs is anon.penet.fi :>
