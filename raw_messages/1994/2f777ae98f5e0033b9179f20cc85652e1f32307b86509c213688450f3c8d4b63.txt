I suspect significant problems implementing a law that criminalizes
crypto.  The government currently spends $billions per year trying to
eliminate illegal drugs, to very little effect.  Drugs should be
easier to eliminate than crypto since phys-obs can't be copied ad
infinitum as bits can.

There's also the matter of recognizing crypto in use.  A program that
transforms its input so that the output can be converted back to the
input but has maximum entropy is a good compression program and might
also be an encryption program.  If a TLA taps my phone and finds a
mysterious bit sequence, how can they distinguish reliably and cheaply
between an encrypted conversation and a download of
emacs-19.22.tar.gz?

I don't claim *they* can't try to outlaw crypto, and I certainly don't
claim they can't kill millions in the effort, but I *do* claim that
eliminating crypto is a very hard problem.
