I'm just glad you are not a politician.

If all you are concerned with is "Material differnce", then you think 
it's perfectly ok for me to sell you a good copy of a magazine?  By your 
"logic" (loosely used), you had to pay for the copy, and you had to pay 
for the original, so what's the difference?  The difference is the WILL 
AND PERMISSION of the author!  As the author of this message, I willingly 
placed it within the net.  I HAVE NOT, NOR WILL NOT, GIVE FREE PERMISSION 
TO A CD-ROM PUBLISHING HOUSE TO PUBLISH MY WORK.

The basis of copyright law is the protection of the author's rights.  One 
of these rights is the choice of distribution.

Perhaps you should try writing for money sometime.  You might actually 
appreciate what you seem to be trying to tear apart.
