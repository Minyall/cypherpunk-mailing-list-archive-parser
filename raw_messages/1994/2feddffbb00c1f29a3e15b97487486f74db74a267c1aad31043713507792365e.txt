While I believe you are correct that remailers are not currently secure 
against the kind of assets a government would use against them, this was 
not my point.  The benchmark we all seem to use in evaluating the 
security of any of the new crypto/cypherpunk technologies are the 
government abilities.  How strong is a remailer one asks?  Immediately a 
slew of answers as to how the government could penetrate the system 
come out.  (See above)  Then, immediately following, come suggestions to 
defeat these methods.  The key effort is to defeat the worst case 
technology and the best funded attacker.  Is this not a basic axiom of 
cypherpunks, and cryptography in general?  I would argue so.  The fact 
that remailers may or may not be able to withstand government level 
attacks is academic.  The point is they are designed increasingly so.  
The point is not if we are 75% there, or 100% there, but that the 
perception will be that the goal is to make them entirely secure.  Only 
programs like the Clipper program do otherwise.  The entire POINT is to 
have the most secure system possible.

Do cypherpunks intentionally cripple their software now?

How long was I gone?

Are good for perhaps, but the theory, the practice will always appear to 
be anti-authoritarian.  In my eyes this is a GOOD thing, in the context 
of criminal offense, and how the process is likely to be seen by a court....

Apples and oranges.  The current capabilities and the design goal are two 
different things.  You know as well as I that all this will boil down to 
the words: "Defendant attempted to use used a computer remailer to mask 
his transactions from authorities.  Detective Blow was successful in 
defeating the defendants efforts and presents the evidence before us today."

As for this material being used in court for intent purposes, since when 
has censorship been a policy here.  Are we now in the business of 
watching what we say in order not to step on too many toes?

Are there not thousands of messages with the words "But if the NSA can do 
X, shouldn't we try Y" on this list?  How will these look?
