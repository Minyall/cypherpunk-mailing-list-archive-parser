This sounds to me rather like saying:
"If the American public gets burned by accepting Skipjack as the crypto 
standard, perhaps they'll take the time to learn about real encryption."

I prefer the version where the American public doesn't get burned in the first
place. If Clipper has to be adopted before the public will learn about real
encryption, why are we bothering to try to promote it now ?  Shouldn't we be
backing Clipper wholeheartedly, to teach 'em a lesson ?

I have ideals, yes. My deepest condolences if you don't have any.
