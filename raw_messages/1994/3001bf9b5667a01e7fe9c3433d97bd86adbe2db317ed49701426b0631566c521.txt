	Depends on whats going to be protected.  Medical records,
trade secrets, stuff like that, you want to stay private for at least
150-200 years, until all the participants are dead.  Most stuff I
encrypt?  50-100 years would cover it, but I expect the cost of
decrypting will drop durring that time due to algorithmic
improvements.

	I prefer to waste a few seconds encrypting well, rather than
encrypting poorly.  My time is not so valuable that I gain much from
the seconds saved in a 384 bit key.

Politics.  From the greek "poly," meaning many, and ticks, a small,
annoying bloodsucker.
