I don't know about you guys, but if the FBI comes through the front door
over this NSA manual, this piece of shit I use for a UNIX terminal goes
out the back door and off the roof into the alley >;)

We're stripped down to the bare minimum for combat here at Outlaws on the
Electronic Frontier.  My personal secretary has full run of my accounts-
(he writes the shell scripts), but he doesn't know my private key pass
phrase.  I guess that makes me impossible to impersonate, eh?
