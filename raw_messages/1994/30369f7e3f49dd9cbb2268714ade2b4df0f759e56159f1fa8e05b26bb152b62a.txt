That sounds like my code. That feature seemed like a good thing to do
at the time. Then I learned about differential cryptanalysis. No, you
cannot strengthen DES in this way, and in fact you could actually
weaken it unless you are sure to use 128 completely random bytes for
your key.

Mainly to sabotage the performance of DES software implementations.
Even back then the government knew it was much easier to control
the dissemination of hardware than software.
