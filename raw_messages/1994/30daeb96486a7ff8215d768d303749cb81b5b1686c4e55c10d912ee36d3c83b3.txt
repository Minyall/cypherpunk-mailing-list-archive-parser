So it will produce readable messages before Sept 1, 1994? Then there must
be an if somewhere in the program to check the date. That should be fix-
able with a patch of a few bytes to the object code. The best way to
uncripple it would be to distribute a small .exe program which patches
your version of PGP in place. Also include the source for the .exe
so nobody thinks it does anything evil. We are being divided and conquered.
If PGP 2.6 succeeds, our goal of a worldwide strong crypto standard is dead.
This needs to be stopped.
