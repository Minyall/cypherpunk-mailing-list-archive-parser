I'm back in agreement with James Donald (Chomsky is spinning).

More that just making crypto look stupid, a game to be played, this
whole "toad will only check that the _form_ of crypto is sort of
present" (caveat: this is short-hand for the case presented) defeats
the whole purpose of user-to-user verfication.

I'm interested in systems which actually allow me to _really verify_
sigs if I have to (not often, I hope, and expect), not get a casual
comment from another system/user that it "appears" that a sig is
attached.

I wasn't kidding earlier today (apologies that I'm reading the later
mail first, as I just got home) when I argued that toad messages ought
to be signed. That is, all traffic from toad. 

If sigs are to be compelled (Note to Eric on a point he made earlier:
a compelled sig is one which is compulsory if a post is not to be
bounced, as per Eric's message about delaying and then eventually
bouncing unsigned messages), which I consider unwise, then such sigs
should *actually be checked*, with the resulting checked messages then
signed by toad/Eric/Hugh/John/whatever.

Anything less than this is actually counterproductive, as it fosters
a non-Cypherpunkish view of placing trust in others to do what
technology allows one to do directly.
