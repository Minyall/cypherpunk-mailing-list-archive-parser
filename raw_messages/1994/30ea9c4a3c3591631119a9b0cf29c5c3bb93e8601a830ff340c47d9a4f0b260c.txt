You continue to confuse (deliberately?) a community with the place it meets.
"List" is being used in two senses -- and you continue to interpret it only
as the instance of majordomo on toad.com.  That's a worthless interpretation
as nobody disputes that Eric controls that agent.

As far as I'm concerned, if a message has gone out to every address on
the "cypherpunks" list, I don't give a shit whether or not it went through
toad.com first: it went to cypherpunks.
