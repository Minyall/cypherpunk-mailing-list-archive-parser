It may be difficult to reproduce some magnetic cards because the 
recording pattern is not purely left to right.  Some cards take more of 
an approach like the VHS system, where every frame (or byte) is recorded 
in diagonal stripes across the surface:

         / / / / / / / / 

	instead of

	 - - - - - - - -
