To make it simpler for those compiling/distributing material, like
Ray did for PC Expo, I usually attach this copyright notice to my articles:

As you can see, it makes it clear that you do _not_ have to ask my permission
to redistribute the articles as long as you follow the conditions. Of course,
I do like to know where it has appeared, and courtesy demands that you inform
me, but you don't _have_ to, and you can do it any time even after its usage.
