The behavior of the Branch Davidians towards their children is well
documented, both by child welfare workers in Texas and by sworn
testimony of former members.  

"I've lived in Texas and therefore none of this is true..." is neither 
relevant, accurate, nor compelling.

The Branch Davidians were proclaimed "cleared" of charges of child 
abuse by Texas authorities in the presense of physical evidence which
would have been considered abuse in most other states.  

Declaring that one has lived in Texas does not change any of this, nor
does it change the well-documented statistics on corporal punishment in
the Texas public school system, in which Texas is the nation's leader.
