Fine. Widespread implementation of SSL doesn't exist, either. You can
probably deploy IPSP to the bulk of your customers just as fast. The
effort is no different, and the results are better.

Now, maybe I'm wrong -- but how would you guys know, not having even
examined the literature?

Since you didn't bother to even examine the other alternatives, I'd
say you were ignorant. Since you refused to listen when this was
pointed out, I'd say you were arrogant.
