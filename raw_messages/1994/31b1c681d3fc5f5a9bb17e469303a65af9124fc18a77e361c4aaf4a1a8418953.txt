  This is uncalled for.  Xenon has consistently admitted that he isn't a
  programmer and that he isn't *able* to write cryptography software.  
  In no way does that make his criticism any less valid.  Rather than wasting
  time flaming him (I know, you just flamed a little), perhaps *you* should
  write the code Xenon wants... or perhaps *I* should...

  That's like telling someone who can't read that they shouldn't criticize
  the technique that you are using to teach them to read until they have
  tried to develop their own technique to teach reading...

  Remember, no matter *how* the criticism is couched, the *real* criticism is
  that PGP doesn't have random block output mode...  All of the other verbage
  in which it was couched isn't relevant or important...  looking past the
  manner in which the complaint is presented and attempting to fix the problem
  which was the cause of the complaint is the key to good product maintainence.

  Let's help PGP become a product...
