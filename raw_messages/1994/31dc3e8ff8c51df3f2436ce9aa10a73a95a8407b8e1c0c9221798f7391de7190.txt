What are the "rules of the PGP Web of Trust"?

I've seen a couple of "BlackNet" public keys on the MIT Key Server,
and I doubt rather strongly that the creators of BlackNet(s)
identified himself or herself (or itself, even).

Tying public keys to physical persons is _one_ approach, but not the
only one. If fact, for a lot of intended uses of public key crypto,
multiple keys will be generated and discarded. Granted, they won't
necessarily ever appear on any of the main keyservers, but they might.

The "web of trust" models how we pass on advice, introduce others with
our recommendations, etc., but it is not a very formal thing.
