Of course it qualifies. No matter how a key gets broken, its
broken. The point is that if a function exists which will tell you if
a given number is larger than the RSA private key, that function can
be used as a factoring algorithm.

No, what it means is that you would have to break most of number
theory, and common sense, before having to worry about such a
function. The risk of exploding in the vacuum caused by all of the
molecules in the air of this room suddenly moving to the far corner is
far higher than the chance of such a function existing.
