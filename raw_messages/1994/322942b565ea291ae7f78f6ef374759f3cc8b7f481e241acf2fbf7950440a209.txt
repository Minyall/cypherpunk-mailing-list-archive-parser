Widespread acceptance of IPSP may well make SSL irrelevant.
I do not believe that anyone at Netscape is claiming otherwise.

Nonetheless, widespread implementation of IPSP simply does not exist
at this time.  We need a solution for our customers _today_.  SSL is
one working solution to the problem of link security.  By publishing
our specification of SSL we are inviting others to share in our work,
or criticize us for being foolish.

I do not believe that we are either arrogant nor ignorant in creating SSL.
The market will, of course, help decide.
