No.  

Again, the only way that MD5 can keep the entropy of a string is for 
every single 128 bit string to map itself onto a unique 128 bit string, 
for if two 128 bit strings produce the same output, then you loose entropy.

The question is, when md5 is restricted to 128 bit values, does it loose 
entropy, and if so how much?  As much as a random mapping?  if so, the 
1024 bit itteration in secure drive HARMS security.

Roger.
