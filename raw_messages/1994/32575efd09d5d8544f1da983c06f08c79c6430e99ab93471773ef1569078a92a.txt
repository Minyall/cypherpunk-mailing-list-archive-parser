Yes, I think you are right.  I think you can set your proxy to
site.org:8080 or whatever and clients will use the specified port
number.  This is at least true of lynx, and I think they all use pretty
much the same conventions on this.

So I was mistaken in saying that you would need root privileges to set up
your own proxy.  And I don't see that it would be much of a security
hole in that it would be no more privileged than the user who ran it.
Most security concerns come because httpd is running as a privileged
process, I think.  An http redirector shouldn't be much more trouble than
a remailer, although the user who is running it would want some assurance
that his own files wouldn't be threatened.
