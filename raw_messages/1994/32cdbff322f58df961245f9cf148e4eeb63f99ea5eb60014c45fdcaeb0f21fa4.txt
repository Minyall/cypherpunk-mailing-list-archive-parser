Hi everyone,

at the moment the mails for this thread are
coming faster than I am able to write. It's
0.30 a.m. in Germany and I will go home now.

At the moment I have 5 mails in the box which
should be answered in my opinion, but [6 mails now]
I will continue tomorrow.

Sleep well and have a good night all you Cypherpunks

Hadmut :-)

[7 mails now]
