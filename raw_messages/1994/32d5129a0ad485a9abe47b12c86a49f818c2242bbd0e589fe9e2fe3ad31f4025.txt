     I must admit that I'm disappointed.  I figured people on this
list would assume good faith on the part of other list members until
it was demonstrated otherwise.

     I read your entire post.  You advocate using the government to
force people to behave as you see fit.  I pointed out that the
services you want could be offered without the need for more
legislation.

     The cable and telephone companies _offer_ these services.  You

     And on the Department of Internet Connectivity and Hiding Erotic

     What's wrong with leaving the sysops free to protect themselves
as they see fit?
