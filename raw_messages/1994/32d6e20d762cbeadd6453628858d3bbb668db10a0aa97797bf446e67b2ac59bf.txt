I just read a paper that might apply to this type of backdoor; it was by
someone at RSA, with the title "..RSA's trapdoor can be broken". I'll 
look the article up when I get home. Basically, it argued that the smaller 
keyspace generation approach used above would be detectable. 

I think it might be generally applicable. I'll look it up again.
