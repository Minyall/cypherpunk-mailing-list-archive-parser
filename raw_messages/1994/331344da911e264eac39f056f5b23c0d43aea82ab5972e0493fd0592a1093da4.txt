The idea of a disinformation campaign to oppose Clipper really bothers me.   
Isn't the true about Clipper damning enough?  Lying about Clipper seems like  
moral and ethical surrender.  I agree that lying can produce favorable results,  
but I'm not willing to stoop to that level.  If the anti-Clipper people (and I  
count myself one of them) can't defeat Clipper with the truth, this tells me  
the world is so fucked up it deserves Clipper and Capstone in every machine on  
the planet.
