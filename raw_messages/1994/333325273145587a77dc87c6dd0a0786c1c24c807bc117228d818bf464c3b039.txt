Thank you all for welcoming me to the cypherpunks meeting last weekend.
I enjoyed myself, and will attend again if our schedules ever match.

Following are two files.  The first is the latest errata for my book,
and the second is the index.  I am trying to get permission to publish
the bibliography electronically.

Cheers,
Bruce
