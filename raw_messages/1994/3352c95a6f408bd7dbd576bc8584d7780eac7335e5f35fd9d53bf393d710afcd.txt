No. I said that, and I was referring to the case where you have a particular
stegonographic technique such as pixel modulation, it could be an idea to
place an encrypted header using something like IDEA in CFB that not only
encrypts a signature but an identifier so as to know which program actually
did the stego, and hence be able to demodulate with that particular 
technique. Therefore if you had seperate programs, each could interoperate.

Even though the essense of stego is to not know a message is hidden in a
particular medium, whenever specific software comes out to do certain stego
(jpegs etc), I can see NSA spooks adding it onto their short list of s/ware
to run across any pictures they get. Stego becomes sort of pseudo-Stego and
loses a certain amount of gain it once had (of course, if all you do is
Stego an encrypted file without any structure, it'll be safe).

My 5c.
