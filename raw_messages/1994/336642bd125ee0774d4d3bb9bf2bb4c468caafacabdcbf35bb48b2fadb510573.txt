Well, if by swIPe you mean the standards-track IP security protocol,
quite a bit.  I'm not going to the next IETF meeting (perry?, phil?)
but I understand that swIPe and friends have mutated into something
that is very close to becoming an RFC.  Key management is another
story, with no general agreement as to what the requirements even are.
My own feeling is that more experience is needed with network-layer
security in general before the problems and tradeoffs of key managment
in heterogeneous networks will emerge with any clarity.

If you mean swIPe, the protocol described in Ioannidis and Blaze's
draft RFC of last December, not much.  There's an implementation
floating around (I think on the ucb ftp server), but I don't know
of anyone who's actively deploying it outside of closed systems.

Now would is a very good time to play with this stuff, particularly with
an eye toward understanding what the key management requirements are.
Right now the future internet cryptographic security architecture is wide
open, but that window is starting to close.
