If you don't need high-bandwidth randomness, there are several good
PRNG, but none of them run fast.  See the chapter on PRNG's in
"Cryptology and Computational Number Theory".  

You, Erich von Hollander, should just go talk to Manuel Blum, who's on
the faculty at Cal.  He's the second Blum of the Blum-Blum-Shub
generator.
