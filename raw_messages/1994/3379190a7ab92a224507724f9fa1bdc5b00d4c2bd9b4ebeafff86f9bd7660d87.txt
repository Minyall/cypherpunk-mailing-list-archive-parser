  It appears that the correct URL is
      http://pmip.maricopa.edu/crypt/cypherpunks/Cypherpunks.src which
I think is a WAIS document. Since I don't--to jump on the stranger's
bandwagon--grok WAIS, I do not know how one makes effective use of
this.  For those wanting to know more about WAIS, ftp to think.com and
look under wais/.
