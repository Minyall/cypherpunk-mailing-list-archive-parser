    Its sort of like bringing home a rabbit for supper & everybody
    dumps on you cause it wasn't a moose.

It looked more like someone saying "Hey!  Let's have rabbit for
dinner!  Now, you there, go kill us a rabbit.  And you, over there,
start a fire.  And you..."  I realize that you think that you brought
a rabbit home, but others seem to think that you only brought a menu.
