Do you have telnet/ftp access? I believe the .su domain does have full Internet
connectivity... If you do, you should pick up PGP version 2.6ui from
ftp.dsi.unimi.it /pub/security/crypt/PGP/pgp26uix.zip

Even if you're a US citizen you can't export PGP from the US under US law, so 
don't try it from CompuServe.

If you don't have net access, the only way is to have someone split PGP into
dozens of UUENCODED parts and mail it to you. If no one else volunteers to
do this from outside the US, ask me. (Yes, I am lazy, and maybe someone's
already got a split UUENCODED PGP ;-)
