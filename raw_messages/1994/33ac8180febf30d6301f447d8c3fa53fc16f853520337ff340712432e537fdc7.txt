    Will you be covering this hearing on the important issue
    of the Clipper chip and our rights to privacy? It will be
    on March 18th, this Friday, at 10:30 am EST in Room 226 of
    the Dirksen Senate Office Building.  Hope you can tape it
    for rebroadcast if you can't cover it live.

    Please let me know your schedule as soon as possible as I
    would hate to miss it, and have lots of friends who I would
    like to advise of the time and date.
