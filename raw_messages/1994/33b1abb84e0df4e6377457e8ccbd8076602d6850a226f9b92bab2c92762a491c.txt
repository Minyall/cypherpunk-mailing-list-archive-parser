	This also depends on the type of bomb. In a two-stage fusion
bomb, you are quite correct - the tritium-deuterium/tritium fusion
reaction gives the boom. However, in a three-stage bomb, there is an
additional fission reaction, this due to the fact that the neutrons
produced by the fusion reaction have the precise energy required to
fission U-238. Since U-238 is vastly easier to obtain than enriched
U-235, there is no great problem with sticking in half a tonne of it.
Around that you can add cobalt jackets, etc, for more interesting
effects.
