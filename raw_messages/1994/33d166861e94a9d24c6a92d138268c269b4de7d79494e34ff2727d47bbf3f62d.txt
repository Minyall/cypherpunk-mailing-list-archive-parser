Markoff has a profile of Jim Bidzos on the front page of today's NYT 
business section.  "Profit and Ego in Data Security."

No death threats mentioned other than: "The government would like him not 
to exist," said Jeffrey I. Schiller, a computer manager at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has negotiated a licensing deal 
with Mr. Bidzos.
