Limbaugh does occasionally think rather than just knee-jerking,
though he does claim to broadcast with half his brain tied behind his back :-)
He's not so much anti-statist overall as he is anti-Liberal;
on positions where the rightwing is statist and the left is non-statist,
he seems to run about 50-50.  He's distinctly pro-military,
and generally pro-police, so having him come out against Clipper is
not a given (and would be less likely to have happened if Bush
had still been President when it was announced...)
But it's good that he's against it; having a bunch of dittoheads
sending mail to the whitehouse telling them to drop this nonsense
can't hurt.
