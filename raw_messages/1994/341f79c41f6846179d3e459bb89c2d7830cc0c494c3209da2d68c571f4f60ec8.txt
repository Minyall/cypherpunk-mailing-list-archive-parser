ftp cs.cmu.edu /afs/andrew.cmu.edu/usr12/mg5n/public/cypherpunks


It's a symlink to CMU's internal news directory.  You will need to get the
file cypherpunks.index to figure out the filenames.  The file also contains
some binary data for the local news software here, you will have to just
ignore that.  Not exactly the easiest way to look things up, but it works.
Messages are kept one month.
