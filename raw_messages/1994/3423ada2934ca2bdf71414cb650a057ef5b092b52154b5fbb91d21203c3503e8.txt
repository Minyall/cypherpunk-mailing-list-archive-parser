Thinking about card games & privacy/technology issues (eliminating el 
Fabuloso for a minute):

It would be interesting to see TV shows with real-life crypto 
scenarios, demonstrating the advantages of using it and how it prevents 
the bad guys ("them") from intruding upon the free movement, the 
private property, etc. of the hero-winners.   "It's just me and my code 
(and my public key. . . . and my pc....and my laser gun) against the 
world, winning against the odds....."

But it probably wouldn't be as interesting as an exotic melange of 
Iran/Iraquis, renegade biologists, casinos, blackjack, etc. (not to 
mention bikinis).
