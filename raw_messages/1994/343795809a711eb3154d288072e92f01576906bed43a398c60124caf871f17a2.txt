A slightly older version of ripem can also be found on rsa.com,
with much less complicated access (you read a readme file which
tells you the rules, and tells you to cd to a random-named directory);
you don't need to get an account there or sign anything.
It's also got RSAREF, of course, and does have the latest version of that.
I assume they'll get current RIPEM there soon, and maybe RIPEM-SIG.
