NOTE: all versions of majordomo do not permit this.  I know that for the 
majordomo lists I run, it does do some internal checking to see that the 
address that mailed the unsubscribe command matches the one in the 
subscription roles, and if it doesn't, it forwards that message to the 
majordmo-owner address to be dealt with.

BUT, you can turn off this 'feature' and have majordomo automatically 
recognize and execute all commands pertaining to that list.
