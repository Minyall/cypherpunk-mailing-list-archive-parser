First, the BlackNet piece dates from last fall, when Det was still on
the list (he asked to be removed in November or thereabouts).

Second, he may be subscribed under one of several aliases. I think
not, though.

Third, apparently someone is forwarding to him some or all of the
posts. Probably just some, would be my guess.
