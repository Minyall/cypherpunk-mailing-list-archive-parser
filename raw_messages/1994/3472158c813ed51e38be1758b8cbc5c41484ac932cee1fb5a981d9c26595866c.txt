A couple of days ago, somebody mentioned that NIST's public ftp site  
contained the FIPS for DES in text form (I think the post was in a reply  
to "Massive ITAR Violation!").  Could somebody mail me a copy of that  
post, I deleted it and now I wish I hadn't.  Also, what is the Internet  
address of NIST's ftp site?

Thanks,
