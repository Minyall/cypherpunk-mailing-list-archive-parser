Another thing to remember is that out of the DH you're going to get
somewhere in the neighborhood of 1000 - 2000 bits of secret.  Assuming
triple DES you only eat up 3*56 = 168 (you may actually use 3*64 = 192 just
to keep life simple) of these bits.  You can rekey 5-10 times without
having to re-exponentiate.
