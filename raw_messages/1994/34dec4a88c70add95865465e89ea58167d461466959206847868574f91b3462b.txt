This is a known problem in old versions, caused by this bug in fifo_destroy.  

  while(fb) {
    nfb=fb; 
    fifo_block_unlink(fb); /* Free the block */
    fb=nfb->next;          /* And then read it...oops */
    }

It's fixed like this in later versions.  
  
  while(fb) {
    nfb=fb->next;
    fifo_block_unlink(fb);
    fb=nfb;
    }

Get the latest version (10d I think) from ftp.csn.net, and download a file
called pgptlupd.zip. The update has the fixed fifo, among other things.
Don't use the earlier versions. They have bugs. Get my latest release, not
one that has been hacked by someone else.
