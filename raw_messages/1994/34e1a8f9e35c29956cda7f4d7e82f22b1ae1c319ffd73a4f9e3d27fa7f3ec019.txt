Reliability in case of disk failure.  Disk failure includes disk
seizure.

My private keys ought well to exist somewhere other than in their
usual place of residence and around that physical environs.  Likewise,
they ought to be stored somewhere other than publically known storage
locations like safe deposit boxes.

And private keys are ony the first sort of sensitive data whose loss
has extremely large consequences.

And, as Tim points out, if the data site if offshore, so much the
better.
