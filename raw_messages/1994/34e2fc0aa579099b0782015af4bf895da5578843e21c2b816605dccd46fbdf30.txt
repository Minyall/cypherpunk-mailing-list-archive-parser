GENTLEMEN,  MOST OF MEANINGFUL DISCUSSION ON THE NET HAVE BEEN BOTH
WELL THOUGHT AND INTELLECTUALLY "NON'TRIVIAL".  THE REMAILING OF 
MULTIPLE COPIES OF HIGH NOISE INFORMATION DRIBBLE WOULD CAUSE ME TO 
LOOK AT THE TRAFFIC ON THE NET AND AS : IS IT WORTH IT?
RIGHT NOW, THE NUMBER OF UNSUBSCRIBE MESSAGES LEADS ME TO BELIEVE 
THAT IT IS NOT.  IF THIS IS WHAT TOAD WANTS, SO BE IT. IF THERE IS 
AN INDIVIDUAL AMONG YOU THAT WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A CASE FOR 
CONTINUED SUBSCRIPTION, I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE SERIOUS REPLY'S.
