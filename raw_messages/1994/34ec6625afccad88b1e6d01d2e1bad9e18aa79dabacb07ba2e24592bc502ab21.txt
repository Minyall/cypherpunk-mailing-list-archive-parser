The Seattle Times' front page story (1984 + 10 years) leads into a few 
articles on pg 18 that deal with encryption/clipper/privacy. Paul Andrews 
seems to have a _few_ misconceptions about exactly what the clipper chip 
will do, but all in all it seems like a good wake-up call. 

This article is the first in a series in privacy, it says. I'm glad 
something like this made the front page.
