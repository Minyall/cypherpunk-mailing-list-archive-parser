   Has anyone tried putting ViaCrypt PGP on the HP-100?  

Yup.

   Is anyone but me crazy enough to contemplate it?  

Nope.  (I demoed it to a few people at the ISOC SNDS conference in San
Diego a month ago..).

   How abysmal is the performance?

Pretty bad, at least compared to the desktop systems I'm used to.

I hope you're patient..
