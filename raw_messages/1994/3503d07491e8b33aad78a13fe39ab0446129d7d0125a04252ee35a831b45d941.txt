In the beginning there was nothing. Then ADAM GERSTEIN, _THE_ MACGURU said:

No, you don't, and yes, it does. But I hardly see the similarity. As
you say, Morris' worm brought the net to its knees in a matter of
hours, yet no _reliable_ source has even mentioned this supposed "Good
Times" virus, let alone *seen* it.

The message itself reeks of the typical chain letter-- oh please send
this to absolutely everyone you know with email! It'll help them lots!

Yeah, whatever.
