I've only used RIPEM on AOL -- but it should be the same.

I run on a Mac, generating the armored file, and then use AOL's "paste
from file" option in the File menu to include the encrypted file in the body
of my message.

In the other direction, I have to use Select All and Copy to get it out of
AOL mail, Paste to get it into an editor.  From there I can file it and
give that file to PGP or RIPEM.

BBEDIT on the Mac has good support for RIPEM.  I wish I knew how to write
BBEDIT extensions for Mac PGP as well.  Anyone know if it's hard?
