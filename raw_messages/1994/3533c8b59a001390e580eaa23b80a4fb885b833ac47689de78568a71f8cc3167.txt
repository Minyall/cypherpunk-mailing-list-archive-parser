Split the difference: explain some of the details and such to them, and then
let them work it out.  Might help to use something like a phone bill to
point out how data is collected that could easily be used by any kind of
oppressive regime. It's my understanding (possibly in error :-) that
European nations do *not* provide the level of detail in their telephone
bills that we do here; the theory being that if who someone calls is
unknown, then it makes any effort to do a guilt-by-association and witchhunt
more difficult.
