I harbor grave doubts as to whether this is what the original poster intended.

If anyone cares to take it upon themselves to find out Mr. Nalbandian's
phone number to have a chat with him, they're certainly entitled to do so. 
I continue to feel that posting his phone number and address to the mailing
list in this fashion constitutes incitement to harassment and invasion of
privacy.
