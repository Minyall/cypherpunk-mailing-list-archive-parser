   Unless Digicash has significant problems with banks or governments that I 
   don't know about (always a possibility), 

I have a simple rule of publicity here.  If there were a bank who had
already agreed to back ecash, would it not already have been
announced?  Since no announcement of the sort has been forthcoming, I
conclude that the probability that such a backer exists right now is
low.
