Except that coding only the progression and not the actual values lessens
the usefulness of quantizing. We may have one group of remailers/users
which uses the Hughes sequence: 1, 4, 16, 64, and another group that uses
another sequence: 3, 9, 27, etc.

I'm not saying we'll ever get everybody to agree, but there are times when
it's better to converge on solid, actual numbers and not on the
more-elegant abstract progressions.

But maybe I'm misunderstanding the point here.
