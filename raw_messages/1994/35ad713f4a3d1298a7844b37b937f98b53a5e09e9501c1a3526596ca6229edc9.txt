Tower Books is offering Schneier's _Applied Cryptography_
at 20% off list.  I saw it in the Bellevue, WA, store, and the
saleperson said the sale was national.  

Everyone on this list probably has the book, but I thought
the info might be useful if you refer anyone to the book.

I don't know how long the deal will last.
