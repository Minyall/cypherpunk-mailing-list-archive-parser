Note my "may" above...none of this stuff has been tested in court.
(Not even digital signatures have yet been tested.) Common carrier
status--such as Federal Express has--has certainly not been granted to
remailers. 

It seems plausible to me that most jurors would be sympathetic to a
claim that a remailer was ignorant of what was being remailed. A bunch
of bits is a bunch of bits.

However, the actual crime may be the act of remailing itself. Not now,
but maybe someday. (Speculation: Legislation will be passed that bans
phone and packet remailers as being in contravention of the Digital
Telephony Act. A "know your customers" clause may require ID for each
packet. Lots of scenarios to consider.)
