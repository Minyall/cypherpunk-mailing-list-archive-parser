As per your request I just set up a mail robot that provides the 
remailer-list via email.  It is slaved to the finger list at berkeley and 
gets updated from it once daily.

To try it send email to remailer-list@remailer.hasp.com

If mail to remailer.hasp.com bounces try speedbumps.hasp.com
my changes to DNS may not have propagated out to the world yet.
If you reference this server please use the address 
remailer-list@remailer.hasp.com since speedbumps.hasp.com may not always 
be the host supplying this service.

If you have any questions or comments about this service just email me a 
message.
