Excellent. Now, please tell me how to determine if someone is a
subscriber. Is there a big subscriber list available somewhere for the
judge to check?

Wonderful. Now, can you please explain what the usenet transmission
mechanism is? It obviously includes magtapes. It appears to include
CD-ROMs -- they have been used to distribute newsfeeds for years
now. In theory, an NNTP site that never expires articles makes those
articles available forever via NNTP, so time is obviously not a
criterion. Usenet has always been gatewayed to email, so email isn't
excluded (indeed, CNews explicitly provides a "by email" news
distribution mechanism). So, what exactly, is NOT part of the usenet
mechanism?
