I _like_ this idea! Explicitly calling the site a "Free Speech" or
"First Amendment" site, and publishing all sorts of things could help.

I think we ought to think this out some more. 

Publishing encrypted stuff, etc.

Of course, lots of sites already publish encrypted stuff, have
PGP-encrypted files on them, etc., and the Feds have not moved to shut
them down, so it may be real hard generating a test case.

But I do like the explicit emphasis of the connection between
encyption and free speech; this is the line I use with people. To wit,
"Nobody can tell me what language I have to write or speak in."
