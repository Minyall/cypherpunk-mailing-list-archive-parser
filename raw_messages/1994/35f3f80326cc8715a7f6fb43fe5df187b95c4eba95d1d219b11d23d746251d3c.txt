Frankly, "Wayne Q. Jones" has thus far posted virtually nothing but
the flakiest junk. Certain other new members of the list (a certain
poster from armory.com in particular) also strike me as being less
than widely valued. Strikingly, these people feel gravely insulted
when one points out the fact that their posts read like random text
generators driven off of markov chains, the statistics for which were
derived from bad xeroxes handed out by drooling individuals on the
streetcorner who rave about the aliens who are remote controlling us
through our shoelaces.
