There is already an RFC on this (and indeed has been for some years);
its called "PEM", or Privacy Enhanced Mail. Thus far it's been a
complete flop. Its thought that certain modifications being proposed
right now (MIME integration, "mail style" names instead of X.500
distinguished names, and the ability to use non-hierarchical signature
certificates) may change that.
