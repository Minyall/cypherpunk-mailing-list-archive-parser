Subject: Why the second copy of "Zero Knowledge" was sent
Message-ID: <199404110635.XAA11648@mail.netcom.com>

The second copy of the "Zero Knowledge" article got posted because I
used an off-line mailer (my old post being buried in my Eudora mailer
archives which I had to search) and uploaded the article when I
downloaded my mail, thus missing Matt Thomlinson's earlier posting of
my article.

Normally I read mail with "elm," for promptness and because I'm online
reading News anyway.
