Not so: In some matters it is a very easy to make.

While I am very interested in this topic, we have drifted away from
direct relevance to the cypherpunks mailing list.

My WWW page is primarily about this and related matters.  I urge those
interested in this topic to access

ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/jamesd/index.html

For example if you have a text interface to the internet o
you could type

lynx ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/jamesd/index.html

If you have a graphical interface to the internet you could type

mosaic ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/jamesd/index.html
