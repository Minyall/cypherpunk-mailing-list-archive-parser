From Jason W Solinsky:

Are:            "They [the malls] can take away your personal 
property by 
force and they are not  governments?. . . . "

Is Not:      ". . . . .  this is the first I've heard of 
defining government by the  force it weilds."
.............................................................

Definitions, definitions.
Governments are defined according to some unknown determining 
factor, but force is recognizable immediately upon being 
threatened by  it.
  
Fighting fire with fire can be confusing, trying to decide what 
difference it makes when it all looks the same.
