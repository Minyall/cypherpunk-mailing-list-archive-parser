So, will procmail run for someone getting this mailing list via CCMail
under DOS? There are people doing that, you know.

Its one thing to write tools so people can encrypt their routine
PRIVATE mail. Its another thing to encrypt mailing lists read by
hundreds of people. The former can be adjusted on a case by case basis
-- the latter cannot.
