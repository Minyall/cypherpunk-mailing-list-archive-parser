	I believe here you are kind of describing the private channel 
(the quantum channel) though I've never heard of it described in quite 
this way.  When I refer to the Public Channel, I am referring to the 
channel that Alice and Bob talk on so that they may compare the blocks or 
bits that they have both received.  Hence, a powerful enough Eve could 
insert herself in the private channel (this is very much discussed) as 
well as the public channel (which I haven't seen addressed.)

	Many of the papers discuss Eve inserting herself in the 
private channel and impersonating Alice (to Bob), and Bob (to Alice), 
but this results in a non-correlation of the measurements when compared 
over the public channel.
	But if Eve may impersonate both people on _both_ channels it may 
be possible to dupe Alice and Bob.  I expect what is important is the 
definition of what a public channel is?  (Still haven't got access to my 
original thoughts on this, will say more later.)
