Sort of remeniscent of the push by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District,
they had the bright idea to tax people for the priveledge of parking at work
(not just in SF, but everywhere).  Back of the envelope calculations 
give a number of something like a quarter of a million "block monitorys"
to strictly enforce the idea.

The single biggest thing stopping facism from becoming rampant in this
country is manpower.  Be very wary of facism-labor-saving devices.
