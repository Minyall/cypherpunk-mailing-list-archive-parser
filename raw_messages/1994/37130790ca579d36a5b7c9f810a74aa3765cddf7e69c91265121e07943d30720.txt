Sorry I'm years behind in my list reading...

Mike, recall the precedents.  FDA burning of Reich's books in the '50s as 
"labeling for an unlawful medical device" -- the Orgone Accumulator.  
Likewise FDA seizures of Scientolgy literature in the '60s as "labeling 
for an unlawful medical device" -- E-meters.  Then there are the moves 
against vitamin literature in recent FDA raids.  I don't think the courts 
have ever faced the specific issue of regulatory censorship.

Then there's the time in the early '80s when the Consumer Products Safety 
Commission banned the "Button Book."
