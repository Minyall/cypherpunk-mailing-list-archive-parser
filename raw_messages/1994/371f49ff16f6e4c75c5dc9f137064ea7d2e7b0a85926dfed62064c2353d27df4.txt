I don't see any reason why sgt. harlow shouldn't be as welcome
as anyone else on the list. there are a large number of people
in the military, and any generalization drawn about them is
likely to be false (of course all generalizations are false, but
that is another matter). for those who enjoy paranoia, I would
point out that sgt. harlow is not the only person on this list 
with past or present military associations.
