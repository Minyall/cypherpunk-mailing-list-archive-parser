I just wanted to point out that I'm not sure this is true.

I might be wrong; I'm a total newbie here.  However, my impression
was that it is *not* known that "anything in NP is solvable in
quantum polytime (BQP)".

I think it's been shown that, relative to a random oracle, it's not
true that NP is contained in BQP.  Then again, I'm told that oracle
results are often misleading and usually not worth a bean.  <shrug>
I don't know much about this stuff. :-(

[This oracle result is mentioned in Schor's paper.]

Hopefully someone more clueful than I will explain this stuff :-)
