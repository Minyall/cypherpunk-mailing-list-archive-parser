Bad idea.  A signature, like a signet ring, must be *publicly*
associated with an identity to be useful.

Use web of trust.

Both A and B have well publicized public keys.

Each then sends the other a signed letter saying "I agree to the following
provided you also agree to the following"

First step:

A decent user interface to PGP

Zeroth step.

Chicago (Yes I know that Unix is the most holy and greatest
operating system in the world, but face it.  The chairman of
the board is *not* going to learn to use unix.)

(Windows is incapable of acting as a host, being non pre-emptive,
and therefore is a pain on the internet.)
