Can anyone give me a FTP site where MacPGP is available.  i think the Ratings idea is brilliant.

MacPGP is at nic.funet.fi and csn.org:/mpj/I_will_not_export/crypto_???????/pgp
(see /mpj/README.MPJ for export restrictions and the real characters to go in
place of ???????).

MacPGP is also on the Colorado Catacombs BBS (303-938-9654).
