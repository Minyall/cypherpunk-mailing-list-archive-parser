After reading the official announcement in "What's new with NSCA Mosaic" I
just checked out Vice President Al Gore's home page at
http://www.financenet.gov/vpgore.html

Interersting that except for the "This is the Vice President's Mosaic Home
Page" header, it is all empty. This from the man who wants to bring us the
Information superhighway.

Why can't politicians stay away from stuff they don't understand?
Because that would mean that they have to stay away from everything.

Just another anarchist,
