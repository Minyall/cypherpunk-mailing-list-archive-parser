I tend to agree with Mike here. Playing the "what if" game, had Bush
won, the Clipper thing would still be rolling along (remember that it was
started long ago, probably in the mid 80s). The arguments against it
would have a slightly different flavor, the Right would be more
mollified, and the Left would be screaming about a police state.

Perhaps more Congressional opposition to Clipper would've emerged if
Bush were Prez, but we don't know. I'm hopeful that the
Congresscritters will eventually realize that the foundations of a
police state are being laid with things like Digital Telephony
(proposed first under Bush, of course) and the 31 flavors of Clipper,
Capstone, and Tessera.

The real problem is not Republican vs. Democrat, but the concentration
of more and more economic and political power in the hands of the
State and the continual erosion of individual liberties. But you've
heard some of us talk about this before, so I'll stop.
