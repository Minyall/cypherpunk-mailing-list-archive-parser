The product of a bunch of primes plus one is not necessarily prime.  It
just contains a prime factor not in the primes multiplied together.  When
looking for a large prime number in some range of integers, it is
computationally more efficient to simply strobe upwards from some starting
point testing for primality than it is to try to generate the prime
directly using a mathematical formula.
