My responce would be why do you want to know what I information I am    
exchangeing and while we are on the topic, can I look at your corresponcance?

I suspect that this flip would shut them up quite quickly.

It is not the law enforcement but rather the legislatures impression of the
desires of the general populace that will dictate this.

If law enforcement was meant to be easy why do we have the Constitution and
such concpets as proof and probably cause?

The argument that we should do anything simply because it makes somebodies
job easier is fallacious. Our responsibilities (both personal and societal)
don't include making other peoples lives easier (it does mean not making them
harder in some cases).

When we are talking about a persons freedoms and rights I would hold that
no person or agency is entitled to trust. They must prove they are a 
paramour.
