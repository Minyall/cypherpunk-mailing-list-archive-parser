What a great move.  And I always considered FOIA requests a waste of time. 
 This will at least *really* amuse the recipients.

This raises a further thought though.  Since it is easier to FOIA federal 
records that pertain to oneself, couldn't anyone who acquires a piece of 
"Clipped" telecoms equipment file a request for his *own* keys.  I guess 
you can capture the LEEF/LEAF in encrypted form and submit a printout of 
it with your letter.

Maybe we could set up a server to help encourage people to 
generate FOIA requests.
