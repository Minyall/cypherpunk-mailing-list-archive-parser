It has been brought up on the Cypherpunks mailing list that Microsoft is
proposing to include public-key escrow as a *built-in* "function" of future
products - Chicago and Daytona have been specifically mentioned.

No, this is not correct.  It was speculation from Tim May on possible 
developments, based on his interpretation of recent events and on email 
which I sent to him.  This email was referring to the fact that his 
concerns notwithstanding,  it is not an easy thing to implement a 
privately-held key escrow system into a desktop operating system, that 
Microsoft is not talking about implementing a 'software Clipper', and 
is presently only *examining* the international ramifications of 
software key-escrow and non-escrowed strong encryption security.

Please give it this question the benefit of the doubt and postpone your 
conclusions about this until I can get an official statement, thanks.
