Whoever it is on illuminati.io.com forging mail to cslaw with a
return address of cypherpunks, kindly fuck off, and remember you're
not the only person from io.com who reads this group.  This sort of
trivial forgery is easy to track down if anyone could be bothered.

Perhaps he forgot to remove his sig file, on the other hand there is no-one
obviously called Douglas on illuminati.
