So, if the average interval is 10 minutes, that would be 6 messages per
hour or 6*24 = 144 messages a day.  Each message goes through 6 of
probably a dozen or so remailers or about half of them, so that would be
about 70 messages per remailer per day from your script.  My count above
is of messages through both the alumni and portal remailers, so that
would be about 140 from you out of around 200 or about 70% from your
script.  If you have more or less than a dozen remailers to choose from
that would affect this figure.

I really think this script is overkill at the current time.  Each message
has to be decrypted and dispatched, and this makes the remailer pretty
conspicuous.  I think the script could slow the acceptance of remailers.
In any case, I think I will ask you to take the alumni.caltech and
shell.portal remailers off of your list.
