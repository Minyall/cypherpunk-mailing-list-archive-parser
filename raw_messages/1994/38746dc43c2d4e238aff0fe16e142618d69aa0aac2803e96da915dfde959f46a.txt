Jim, I am so glad I am not as paranoid as you. It would make my life a 
very distubing and scarry place to be. I am also glad that you *are* that 
paranoid, because I wouldn't have thought of that and it's the kind of 
thing that at least needs to be _mentioned_ in any serious discussion of 
security, privacy, anonymity, etc... even if it is hard to do anything to 
deter such a determined and powerfull (hopefully imaginary) opponent.  
Next time I make an illegal puchase, I'll be sure to have my picture 
taken at an ATM 10 miles away *at the same time* as the purchase is being 
made. If 'the infamous they' attempt such a corrolation, they will 
discover proof posotive that I did *not* make said purchase!  <g>

Happy Hunting, -Chris.
