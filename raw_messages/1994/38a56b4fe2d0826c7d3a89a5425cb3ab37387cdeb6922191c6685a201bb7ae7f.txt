I dunno whether that's RC4, but RC4 is a stream cipher developed by
Rivest.  It's not patented; instead, RSADSI licenses it only as an
object module.  RC4 and RC2 (a block cipher) use variable-length
keys, and can be exported if the key length is 40 bits or less.
(Naturally, they're not very strong when used this way...)
