You don't really have a problem with that, do you?  :>)

There are no expectations placed on non-designers to come up 
with anything of any practical use to society, therefore they 
have no responsibility or liability, as no one takes them very 
seriously.

People who put up blocks to progress and improvement (not 
merely 'changes' per se) are suffering from a sense of loss of 
control over their existence, and should be sent to a hospital 
to recuperate from their psychic wounds.  (Actually, I think 
that this wouldn't become such a big problem if, for one thing, 
everyone had a clear understanding & appreciation of the 
concept of "property", what that constitutes, and what that 
means in terms of the liberty to affect things in the world 
around us.)
