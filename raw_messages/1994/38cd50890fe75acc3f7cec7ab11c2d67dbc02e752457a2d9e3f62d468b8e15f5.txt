You enjoy a measure of protection because a United States of America
person doesn't have the knee-jerk tendency to presume jurisdiction over
a person at your geographic remove that he has for person located in
North America.  A person located in North America is more at risk of
losing her freeman status by switching to 2.5 (or now 2.6), and must be
careful not to give her neighbor, who may be a United States of America
person, an excuse to invoke his government's tyranny.

It's hard for me to believe that conditions are that different for you,
or do you surrender without qualification to jurisdiction of NZ law?
