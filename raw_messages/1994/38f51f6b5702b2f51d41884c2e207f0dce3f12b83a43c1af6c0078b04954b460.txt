As do I, for what it's worth.  My plan was never to speak as a unified
voice representing all Cypherpunks but to rather give evidence that we
are not all the college-computer-nerd-woodstock-missing-hippie-wannabe-
Cipherpunks.  Only that if someone talks to the press and they say, "just
what is Cypherpunks?" they can say "Well, I have a document that explains
who we are (demographics), what we do, and why."

But there are SOME ideas 99% of us agree on... such as we don't want
to see the government self-fullfill George Orwell's prophesy.
