I won't say it's a scam, but a lot of people think it is/was. I
thought it had died some months back, when all posts (of which there
had previously been many) suddnly stopped. 

The idea of soliciting "contributions" to fund some kind of seagoing
barge, sinkable with a single torpedo (anonymous delivered, easily
enough), is crazy. 

If changes are going to occur, it won't be by collecting dribs and
drabs of small change from suckers who think they'll someday be
"living off the sea, consulting via satellite dish." (That's not a
direct quote, just my gleaning of the Oceania philosophy.)

They're out to lunch, or scam artists, or hopeless dreamers, or all of
the above. Gone to Roatan.
