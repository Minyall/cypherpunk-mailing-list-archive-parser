Is there any reason sendmail and POP shouldn't compile fairly easily for
PCs and Macs that have TCP/IP support?  If that was done, couldn't I
configure my Eudora to talk to a local sendmail and POP (TCP/IP within my
own machine) which would then do whatever fancy filtering and then talk to
the remote sendmail and POP?

Can sendmail receive mail through POP?

Or would it be easier to write an SMTP/POP intermediary from scratch?

Or, jeez, has this all been done?
