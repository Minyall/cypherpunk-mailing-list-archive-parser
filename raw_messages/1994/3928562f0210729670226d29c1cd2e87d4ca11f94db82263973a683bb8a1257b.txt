This statement betrays an enormous ignorance at the scale of Federal
involvement in retail transaction systems.  The Fed operates Fedwire,
for moving federal funds around, and also does check clearing at the
national level.  All the retail level transaction systems are in
private hands, be they ATM networks and consortia or the credit card
companies.
