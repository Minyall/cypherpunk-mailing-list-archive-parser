Some time ago I worked out the theoretical limits on spy satellite
resolution.  It's a simple exercise in optics, if you make optimistic
assumptions like no atmospheric distortion, etc. My only major
engineering assumption was that the objective mirror had to fit inside
the payload fairing of a Titan launcher, i.e., about 2 meters max. The
result, at visible wavelengths and for the slant ranges typical of spy
satellite orbits, was about 1 foot. This was completely consistent
with the leaked KH-11 photos of the Soviet aircraft carrier published
some time back in AW&ST and Deep Black.  Good, but not exactly good
enough to read poker hands, I would say.

Believe it or not, the laws of physics apply even to classified projects.
