Is it just me, or has the administration just delivered the knock-out puch?

It seems that by abandoning the Clipper proposal for a software based

to end their opposition to the fascist key escrow proposal. Cypherpunks, we
are in deep trouble.

Clinton is in the process of making internal passports aka "Universal
Health Care Card" mandatory:
"REV 13:16  And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free
and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:
REV 13:17  And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark,
or the name of the beast, or the number of his name."
