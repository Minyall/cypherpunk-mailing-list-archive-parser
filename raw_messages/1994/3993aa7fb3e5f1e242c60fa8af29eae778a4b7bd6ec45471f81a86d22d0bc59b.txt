	The research was done by Stanley Milgram in the late 60's.
(Milgram was the guy who did the 'authority experiments' where a man
in a white coat urged subjects to deliver what they thought was a high
voltage shock to a victim.)

	He handed out books of postcards, and asked that they be
delivered to someone wiht whom he was cooperating.  (An example would
be "Reverend Joe Smith in Phoenix, Arizona).  People were asked to
pass the book on to someone they felt would be able to hand it to Rev
Smith.  At each pass, people were asked to mail in a post card.  The
average for the US was 6 post cards.

	I might be able to dig out references to this if folks really
want.
