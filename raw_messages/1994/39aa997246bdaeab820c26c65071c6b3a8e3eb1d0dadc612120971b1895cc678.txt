Not entirely true...

  The rules governing amateur radio operators says that you can not
  use any secret codes or ciphers whose intent is to obscure meaning.
								  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  ASCII is a code but it is used in packet and such to convey information
  in an agreed upon format, not to obscure the meaning of the message.

  My contention is that a signature, while encrypted, is not encrypted
  to obscure the meaning.  It says it is a sig, it is a sig, and contains
  no other information that is not readily available (email addresses can
  be included, but it is retrievable with a commonly available program PGP.)

  Oh, and don't let the 2 by 3 format of my callsign mislead you.  It's my
  original callsign... I didn't want to bother with making everyone learn
  a new one.

  [If anyone has specific ham radio questions not relating to crypto,
   please feel free to write email to me.]
