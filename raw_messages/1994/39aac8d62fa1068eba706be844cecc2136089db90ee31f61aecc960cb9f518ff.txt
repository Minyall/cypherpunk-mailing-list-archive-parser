A few days delay, which is what I think we are talking about, will clearly
make following threads more difficult. And add to noise on the list,
as the content of an early-non-signed message may be repeated and
signed by someone else later on.

After netcom's recent mail mis-delivery problems, I know all too
well how hard it is to participate in discussions that
are delivered in random-appearing order. A few hours delay will be
indistinguishable to the netcom subscribers.

My experience with rules and PPLs on other lists has not impressed me.
YMMV.

Whatcha trying to do, eric, lead that anarchists?
