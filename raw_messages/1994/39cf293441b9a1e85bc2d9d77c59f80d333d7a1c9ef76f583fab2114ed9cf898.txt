The age of sexual consent in the Netherlands is 16.  However, there 
was a reform of the penal code a few years back which prohibits
prosecution between the ages of 12-16 without a formal complaint
being filed by the minor or the minor's parent or guardian.  So 
for consensual relationships with minors with enlightened parents,
the effective age is really 12.

Pornography featuring performers under age 16 is also illegal, but
only production and trafficking is criminalized, private possession 
is not.  There have been a number of recent court cases which have
set liberal precedents for child porn laws in Holland, such as the 
right of research organizations like university libraries to be exempt
from the laws.  Also, if the material doesn't show actual 
sex taking place, it is probably legal in Holland unlike the United
States, where anything vaguely "suggestive" can get you in trouble.
