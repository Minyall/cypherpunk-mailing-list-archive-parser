I downloaded the latest Netscape client and tried the https: links at
the mcom server.  When you switch to secure mode, a large dialog box
appears reminding you to check the Document Information.  But it has a
"don't show again" button and I would imagine that most people would
soon use that.

The Document Information box shows this information:

Encryption Key:  Export [40]
Name of Server:	C=US, ST=California, O=Netscape Communications Corp.,
		CN=mosaic@mcom.com
Name of Certifier: C=US, OU=Test CA, O=Netscape Communications Corp.

It would be nice if the CN field were the same as the server address.
Then the client could check it.
