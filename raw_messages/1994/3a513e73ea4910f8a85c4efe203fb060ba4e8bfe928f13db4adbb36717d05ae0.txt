I am glad to see that the 'web of trust' model is spreading. However,
I still see no reason to use ripem.

1) ripem is illegal for non-north-american users
2) ripem still uses DES
3) using ripem supports the notion that PKP holds some valid patents

The above opinions are exclusively my own. If anyone else wants them,
they can buy them from me. Easy terms can be arranged.
