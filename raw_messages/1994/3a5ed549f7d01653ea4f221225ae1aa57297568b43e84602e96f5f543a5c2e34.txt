Excerpted from a NewsBytes article with the headline "Consumer Apps For
Electronic Fingerprint Reader":

 The Microreader can take an analog picture of a finger, convert the
 analog picture into a digital code, and store that code for
 matching. [...] the Microreader is being miniaturized and the
 price is being reduced from $1,500 to "substantially less than
 $100."

The article lists a bunch of possible applications involving verification
of identity and access control, incorporation in keyboards and cellular
telephones to secure them, etc. It does not mention any time frame for when
this device would actually hit the market or when the price would drop to
that $100 figure, so take it all with a grain of salt.
