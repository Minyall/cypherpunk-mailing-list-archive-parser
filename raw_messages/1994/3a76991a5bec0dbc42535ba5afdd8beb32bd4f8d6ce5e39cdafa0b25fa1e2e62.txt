Has anyone looked at basing digi-cash on the processing power required to
handle it?

In other words, instead of basing it on real cash directly or simply setting
up a 'flat' standard (is there an accepted technical term for this?) base it
on the MIPS that are required to process it in a given time (say 1mS)? Seems
to me that this would provide a standard that was universal and verifiable by
any organization that chose to spend the effort to do it. It would also add
another layer of isolation (since the only person (sic) involved w/ real cash
is going to the be processing sight paying their electric bill).
