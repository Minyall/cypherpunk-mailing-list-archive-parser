Responding to msg by rishab:

I always thought the emphasis on this list was on 
_technological_  rather than _political_ or _legal_ or _moral_ 
means to protect privacy and  free expression - including the 
current limitations.
.......................................................

So Rishab -  do you think there's any good reason why 
governments shouldn't require the implementation of key escrow 
(GAK) (I mean, aside from what something like the US 
Constitution would have to say about it), or any good reason 
why any cypherpunk should protest it?

The key words in my inquiry are *reason why*.
