Actually, (a bird psych friend tells me) there was a variety of smart-
bomb developed in WWII that used a pigeon as its brain.  The pigeon would
be trained to peck at a building on a map, and then in the falling bomb
it would guide the bomb by pecking at a clear panel.

I don't think they were actually used, though.
