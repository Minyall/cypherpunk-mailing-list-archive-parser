Mike Duvos, how I wish I had the time to try to understand how you
reconcile these seemingly incompatible sentiments!

How can you achieve ``egalitarian societies with strong social safety
nets'' without using ``powerful centralized authority''?  As a proponent
of ``high taxes'', how can you also favor strong cryptography?  Do you
doubt that expropriating ``high taxes'' from your neighbor will be made
more difficult in a world with strong cryptography?  In view of the
natural diversity among people, how can you achieve an ``egalitarian
society'' without someone who says ``Do What We Say Or We'll Kill
You!''?
