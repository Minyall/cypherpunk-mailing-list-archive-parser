They'd be safe unless the pot got really big.

I recall hearing a radio show in which some nuclear engineer was
saying that such-and-such and incident couldn't have really gone
critical, because when that happens, it starts to glow sort of bluish
color, and you feel heat as if you were standing in front of a really
big oven.  The way it sounded, I got the impression that unintended
criticalities did happen now and then.
