   I made a bunch of cards from Avery 5371 Laser Business Cards (about twelve
   bucks for 250 cards, at most office supply stores).

A good choice for stock.  I've done stickers, but they don't work
nearly so well.

   On the back is a headline "PGP Public Key Encryption Key", followed by
   these instructions:

I'd also recommend putting you key fingerprint on the card for those
people who _can_ get your key off the Internet and who just want to
verify that it's accurate.
