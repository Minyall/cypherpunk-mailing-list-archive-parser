Well, I haven't seen the code, but some ideas I'd have for enhancements
are:
	- signatures at the end of the packets for one-time data passes
	- signature revocations
	- userID revocations
	- real database key management
	- extensions for alternative encryption and message digest algorithms
	- modularization of the code
	- a PGP library and API
	- much of the wish list Vesselin Bontchev has created
