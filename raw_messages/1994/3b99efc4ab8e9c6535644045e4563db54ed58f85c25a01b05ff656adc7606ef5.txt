How about some evidence on it? I see no reason to compare taking a key
and determining if it is too large or too small as being necessarily
equivalent to factoring a large number. I do not need to know the number
exactly to determine its relative magnitude. 

NSA doesn't say much...

I have found no evidence so far in my search for such a methodoligy, as a 
matter of fact I have found no evidence that anyone has ever even looked
at such a scheme. If you know something I haven't been able to find then
pleas enlighten me so I can move on to other more worthy things to play
with...

Thanks for the feedback...
