The main gripe most people have about CERT is that they are way
slow.  Could it be that they systematically inform some parties
before others, and that it just so happens that the public at large
is the last to know and the US intelegence community is the first?


Just another paranoid supposition...
Dont let it keep you up at night, :-)
