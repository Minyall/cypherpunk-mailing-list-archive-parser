Perhaps the saying "security through obscurity doesn't work" should be
amended to say "security that depends on the secrecy of anything that
cannot be easily changed doesn't work".

In most cases, cryptographic keys are far more easily changed than
cryptographic algorithms. That's why it's bad to rely on the secrecy
of an algorithm, but okay to rely on the secrecy of a key.
