	   I can't quite see how this would work unless the voice was run
   at a very low level relative to the data.  

I believe there are also maximum rates on the data when used with
voice (4.8 kbps?) and the modulation doesn't use echo cancellation.

With the lower bit rate you can get away with a lot, particularly with
modern DSP's.
