Something that might be relevant here is that relationship between energy and
lifetime for virtual particle generation. When a virtual particle is generated
it can have a random amount of energy. However, the larger the energy level
is the shorter its lifetime is. It is related to Plank's Constant in a 
relationship that I don't have on hand, but should be in most quantum texts.
