    Why enhance it by using another name, already in use, that refers
    to a similar*, but competing set of standards?

Well, at least in part because I think that some things about the
Privacy Enhanced Mail standard suck big time.

Do I think that I'll actually cause it to be changed simply by
stealing the acronym?  Of course not.

Do I get any pleasure from the idea that this could potentially muck
up the works a bit?  Sure.
