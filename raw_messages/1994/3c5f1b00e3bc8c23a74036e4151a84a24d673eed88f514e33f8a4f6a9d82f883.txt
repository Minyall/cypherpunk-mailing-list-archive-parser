Perhaps this is not obvious to others, so I'll be more explicity. If
you use a clipper phone at home, the cops can determine your serial
number by tapping your line. Then, if you take your phone with you
(the little portable AT&T "bump in a cord" is designed for this)
everywhere you go you are signaling where you are.
