I was a little surprised to receive the following as a response
from a "vacation" program apparently prepared by PRZ to answer his
e-mail during a temporary absence:

    In case you haven't heard, MIT is soon releasing PGP version 2.6,
    available from an FTP site at MIT, for US noncommercial users only.
    It is a nice version of PGP, with all the strength and integrity of
    PGP 2.3a, with some bug fixes and improvements.


    -Philip Zimmermann

I suppose this means he thinks (knows?) that problems inter-operating
with overseas & commercial (Viacrypt) users will be worked out.
