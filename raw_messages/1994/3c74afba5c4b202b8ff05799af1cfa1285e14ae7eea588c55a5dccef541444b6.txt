The folks in Waco hadn't committed any great crime, and would have
continued in their secluded existence for quite some time had the ATF not
seen fit to provide a catalyst.

I suppose that cyberspace, with its potential anonymity and privacy, would
be the stuff ATF nightmares are made of..  NO DOORS TO KICK DOWN, and GUNS
are PRETTY USELESS in CYBERSPACE!! :-)
