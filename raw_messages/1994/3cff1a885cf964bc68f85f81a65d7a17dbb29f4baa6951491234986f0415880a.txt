Actually a variation on this '--truncate here--' scheme might solve the
user-selected multiple-remailer scheme that we're trying to get up here.
Place the 'truncate' or '::'  line at the beginning of your message,
just after the last local header line.  Then add routing instructions
for the remailer.  Then maybe another 'truncate' message followed by
more routing instructions for the next remailer chosen.  Then a blank
line and your message.

From: [me]

END example

Each remailer would only strip off the first 'Request-Remailing-To:'
instruction in the message.  The remailer would assume that anything
following that was part of the message, until it reached the signature,
which it would truncate.  Then it would remail the new 'message' as
requested.
