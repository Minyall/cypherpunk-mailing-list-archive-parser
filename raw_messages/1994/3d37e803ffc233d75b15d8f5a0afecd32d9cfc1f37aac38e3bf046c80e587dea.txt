Ok. You all have basically defeated the stiffer fines issue.

The one issue remaining is do we want to live a life of anarchy. Do we 
want to live in total isolation? Do we want to be completely paranoid and 
be always looking over our shoulder? You tell me how we solve that 
problem. I for one do not want to touch "1984" territory, but I don't 
want to live in an anarchy either.
