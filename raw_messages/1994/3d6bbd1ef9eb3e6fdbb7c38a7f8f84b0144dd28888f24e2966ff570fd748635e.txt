Nobody asks :
  re cripple; i was told that if law enforcement cannot determine which key
  will unlock the message prior to the message actually being sent over the 
  net, the message will not be decodable is there any truth to this? 

I don't think so.  I can certainly download a message onto my disk and
decypher it at my leisure, by brute force if necessary.
