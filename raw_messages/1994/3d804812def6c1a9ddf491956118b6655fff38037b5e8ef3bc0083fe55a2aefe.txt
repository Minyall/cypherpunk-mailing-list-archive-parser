for total anon post/mail
How workable is setting up remailers with psudo-cooperation
so that when it recieves an anon mail it waits 20 or so min
and then randomly sends copies of it to 5 other remailers of which
the original reciever randomly decides which 1 of the 6 will post 
and the rest simply discard. 
  a 5 fold increase in traffic will make it harder to analize if
80% is just noise

Duct tape is like the force.  It has a light side, and a dark side, and
it holds the universe together ...
