O.k.

  This clipper chip the NSA proposes would have it's keys kep by a separate
agency ( yeah, right ). So, until they took you to court, they couldn't
really reveal that they knew what all those encrypted transmissions were.
So, encrypt with PGP or some other strong crypto, then use the clipper chip.
The only way they 'could' know what you were transmitting would be by getting
a subpoena and stuff, and then you could say , well, shucks. I forgot the
damn number. Warm up the Cray , homes..........
