The obvious and simple fix is to put code into the Majordomo
implementation to prevent the subscription of an*@anon.penet.fi (note
-- this wouldn't prevent subscriptions as na*@anon.penet.fi). I've
pointed this out before -- unfortunately, the list maintainers don't
have time to do it. Maybe someone could volunteer to do the change?
You'd have to talk to Eric Hughes about how to do the work.
