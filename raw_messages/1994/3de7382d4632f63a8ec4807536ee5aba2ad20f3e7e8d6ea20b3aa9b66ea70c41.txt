	Unless the messages are given a delivery latency of <insert random
   time>, Traffic Analysis will allow for the tracking of messages. 

For the Nth time, it's not latency, it's reordering which is important.

If you have a large enough message flow, adding latency gives you
sufficient reordering.  If your message flow is small, latency doesn't
sufficiently reorder.  Large and small here are message interval times
relative to added latency times.

Random reordering induces random added latencies.  The converse does
not always hold.
