The last US Bearer Bond issues mature in 1997. I also believe that to
collect interest, and to redeem the bond at maturity, you must give your
name and tax-id number to the paying agent. (I can check with the
department here that handles it if anyone is interested in the pertinent
OCC regs that apply)
