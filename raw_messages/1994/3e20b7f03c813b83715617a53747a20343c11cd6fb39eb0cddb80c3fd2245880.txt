In the MacPGP2.3 startup screen there appears
"... L. Detweiler....". He adapted John Norstad's
help routine for use in MacPGP. This was a vast
improvement over the documentation that came
with MacPGP2.2. You still need my "Here's How
to MacPGP!" guide though ;-).

He also wrote the "Privacy and Anonymity on
the Internet" FAQ, which is still regularly posted
to Usenet, and mentioned at the end of my Guide,
and is highly recommended reading.

Then he went koo-koo. Oh well.

I'm sure the old timers here know more about that
than I do.
