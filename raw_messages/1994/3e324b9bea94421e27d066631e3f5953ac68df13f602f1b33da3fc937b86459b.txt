Of course they aren't using Clipper, at least not for anything
sensitive.  They know better than that.  Clipper is not a secure
system.  Skipjack may be wonderful, but the whole setup totally
lacks key security.  Given their institutional paranoia, they
wouldn't touch Clipper with a 1024-bit prime.
