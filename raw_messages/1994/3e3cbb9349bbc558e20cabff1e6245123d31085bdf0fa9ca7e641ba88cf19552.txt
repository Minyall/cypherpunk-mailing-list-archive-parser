Question:
Are there in fact any remailers out there that _don't_ take
Request-Remailing-To:, but only Anon-Send-To:? That is, are there in fact
any "eric" remailers, according to Raph's criteria?

I've used at least one of the remailers that's labled as "eric" on Raph's
list, and used "Request-Remailing-To:" with it, and been succesful.  I'm
wondering if this is the case for all of them.
