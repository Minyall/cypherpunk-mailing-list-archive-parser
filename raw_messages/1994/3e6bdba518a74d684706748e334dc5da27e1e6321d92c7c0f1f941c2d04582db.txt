Just as I could not sue my parents for being dumb commies who would send me
to government schools (not that they are or did), I could not sue my parents
for using crack.  One takes one's parents as one finds them (at Common Law
in any case).

The medical care cost *can* be blamed on the government that exacts payments
for it.
