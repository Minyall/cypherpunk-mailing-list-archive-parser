Wanna bet?  All it would take is one entity to set up a service of
converting untracable digicash tokens into the appropriate tracable tokens
under the name of a pseudo-account at the service.  Now I can use my
digicash tokens for everything under the regulated system, _and_ I can use
them at digicash-only services...
