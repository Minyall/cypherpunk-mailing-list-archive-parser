Or you could remove the ability to whois the subscribers of the list.  I 
know it can be done as queernet has done that for its majordomo lists.  
At the very least, that will remove the ability to get a listing of who 
is subscribed, although I kind think it's nice to be able to see who is 
on the list.

I worry that requiring PGP or some other signature could pose problems 
for those outside the U.S., especially if MIT-PGP is apparently not 
exportable.

Another choice is to require a confirmation from the subscriber.  I run 
several LISTSERV mailing lists, and while it doesn't require confirmation 
for unsibscription (just signing up), it does keep down on the number of 
"accidental" activities.  It'd be pretty trivial to hack majordomo to 
reply to the address in the whois list (instead of the Reply-To:) and 
maintain a small database of 'pending' people.  By requiring a, say, 
six-digit code in the subject line of the confirmation, the software can 
verify that it is genuine.

As I said, LISTSERV implements something similiar as an option for 
subscribing.  Maybe even for unsubscribing (I've never checked).
