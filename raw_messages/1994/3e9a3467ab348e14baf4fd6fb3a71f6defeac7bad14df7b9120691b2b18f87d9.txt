This tale has been around for a while. Prodigy makes a huge file, over
1 MB, on your hard drive and stores information there to speed up the data
transfer. People started finding bits of their files in there. They
claimed that Prodigy was snooping into their systems. Prodigy denied it
and claimed that their software just didn't bother to clear the disk space
when it allocated it, so whatever was there, stayed there until the space
was used. They distributed a utility which would zero out that information.
Whether they were really snooping or not, who knows? If they were, they
were pretty stupid to leave clear text in the file.

Secure Drive would stop it if you weren't logged into the encrypted drive
when you ran Prodigy. Of course, if you were logged in and they knew about
Secure Drive, they could get your encryption key as well as your data...
