Hi Uni,

I found this in alt.revenge and it may have something to do with your
problem. I didn't follow all of it, but then again I don't subscribe to
alt.2600.

It's surprising to me that no one else has touched on this before; it'd
seem the natural thing for those that read 2600.  While the automated
messages are rather annoying when you are making a "legit" post, you can use
this 'service' that Cracker Buster is providing for a bit of net-revenge.

News is easy to forge - the spammer demonstrated that quite handily - and
providing a new 'From:' line to a post that points to your favorite net-
nemesis.  Some on alt.2600 are pro'ly already doing a similiar switch in
order to mis-direct the autoresponses and save themself a headache.  With a
little thought I'm sure that you could generate quite an interesting post
that will have their sysadmin suspicious quite quickly.  Just a thought...
For all of his hypocritical "goods intentions", Cracker Buster has provided
another method to cause all of that damage/destruction/evil/traffic
stoppage that he accuses us of.  *grin*

No, I wouldn't actually suggest that you mis-direct the auto-replies in a
malicious way; a couple of "legit" ideas along this line would be to
screw-up your 'From:' line so that Cracker Buster gets a mailbox full of
returned-mail-bad-address (this I *do* suggest, naturlich!) and to add
your own 'Really-From: realme@real.address.com' line with your correct
address so that ppl that _really_ want to get in touch with you can.  Some
variation on the line would be advised -- no need to make it easy for his
responder to handle.  Take a look at the headers on CB's apology post for
more ideas and suggestions.  Pro'ly need a "Sender:" line as well; I'll
know exactly after this post goes thru.
