Cypherpunks:

I note that at least one of you (who won't say who he is) wondered about
communications from this address.  This address has one very appealing
feature to me, it is company independant; that is, if I should move
around, I get to keep the address.  I started this before the acm begain
their redirection effort, so now if you wish to reach me, you can email
to peace at acm.org.  That does sound much better doesn't it?

I must echo some other sentiments that I have heard from others around
here ..  an issue that gets lost a lot on the majority of internet lists
(including PEM-DEV) where company affiliation carries a very large
amount of baggage.  Namely

I am who I am, and that's all that I am.

I'm ..Peace ..Tom
