   Mike at mpj@netcom.com put it up within a day. That was a week after
   I sent it to both Erics, 

Nik at ndw1@columbia.edu tried to send it to me through a remailer and
got the syntax wrong.  The operator of the remailer was kind enough to
send it along.

And I erased it.  I've had enough trouble with Mac distributions that
I'm only going to trust something uploaded via ftp and that has not
passed through a mail system.  YO!  Get the file README.UPLOAD and
follow the directions.
