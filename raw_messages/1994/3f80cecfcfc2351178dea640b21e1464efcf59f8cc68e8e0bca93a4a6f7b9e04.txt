Speaking of T-shirts...is the gentleman who was producing the other 
shirt (the 1984 shirt) acknowledging orders?  I sent my check, address, 
adn e-mail address, and haven't heard a peep...if he's not, that's 
fine...I was just under the impression that he was, which makes me wonder 
if Big Brother's postal minion lost my order somewhere along the way...

Sorry to address this to the whole list, but I've lost his address.
