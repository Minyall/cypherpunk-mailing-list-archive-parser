It's my term.

GAK = "Government Access to [Citizens'] Keys"

I am offended at the gov't's use of the innocent sounding "Key Escrow" to
describe GAK, so I am using GAK to refer to this practice.  That term zooms
in on the one important characteristic of what the gov't is trying to do
here.  "Key escrow", on the other hand, could be something very innocent --
an arrangement I set up with my lawyer and a bank, for example.
