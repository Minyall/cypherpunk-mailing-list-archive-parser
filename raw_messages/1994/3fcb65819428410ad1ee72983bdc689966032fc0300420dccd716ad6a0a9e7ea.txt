And they're off! Five ~45K messages each, five seconds apart.

And the winners are,

1) elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu
2) hh@pmantis.berkeley.edu
3) and 4) tied, ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu, hfinney@shell.portal.com.

And hh@soda.berkeley.edu has tripped and DIED. Yesterday hh@cicada.berkeley.edu
died and got back up again today. Looks like either CA has fallen into the
Ocean or cicada and soda aren't contenders. Comments anyone? Bets?
