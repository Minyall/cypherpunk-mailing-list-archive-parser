Public speech is not a series of public speeches, but rather one's own
words spoken openly and without shame.

Tim has answered your question admirably.  Here is part of my answer:

   "I desire a society where all may speak freely about whatever topic
they will.  I desire that all people might be able to choose to whom
they wish to speak and to whom they do not wish to speak.  I desire a
society where all people may have an assurance that their words are
directed only at those to whom they wish.  Therefore I oppose all
efforts by governments to eavesdrop and to become unwanted listeners."

You may quote me, as always, but I would rather you spoke your own
feelings.

Eric
