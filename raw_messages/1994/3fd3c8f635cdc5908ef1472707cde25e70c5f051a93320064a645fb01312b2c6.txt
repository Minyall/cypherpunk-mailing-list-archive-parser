Well, according to "An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers" by G.H.
Hardy and E.M. Wright you're correct.  They say the largest n for which
the Fermat prime F_n has been found is F_4 = 2^(2^4)+1 = 65537.  Of
course, this book was written in 1938 so the situation could have
changed since then.

F_n is known to be composite for
	7<=n<=16, n=18, 19, 21, 23, 36, 38, 39, 55, 63, 73
and others.  Not a very successful conjecture for Fermat, I suppose...
