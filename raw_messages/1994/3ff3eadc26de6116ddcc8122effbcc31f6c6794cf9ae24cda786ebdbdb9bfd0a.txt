That's interesting that they went to the effort to track you down.
Do you have any idea of how they found out about your package?  Was
that the one that started all the fooferaw on sci.crypt with PRZ
upset about someone shipping a modified version of his program?

I don't know what the legalities are of registering when you are just
doing this stuff for fun.  Talking to a lawyer will probably cost you
several hundred dollars but that may be the wisest course.  It's not
impossible that you could be charged with felony violation of the Arms
Export Control Act, with penalties up to one million dollars and ten years
in prison.  The few months I spent doing a little work on PGP in my
spare time have cost me $1000 in legal fees just to retain a lawyer and
have him keep track of the possibility of prosecution.  It's sickening,
but you can't be too careful these days.  You can certainly see where
Pr0duct Cypher and our other anonymous/pseudonymous posters are coming
from.  Good luck!
