	I think that this problem might well go back to the ease of
use problem.  I spend a lot of my time reading bad documentation.  I
really don't enjoy reading bad documentation.  I want a money
supply/remail service/mail privacy system that is as easy to use as
those things I use every day.  Or I want a strong incentive to use the
system.  For example, I do go through the hassle of using PGP to
discuss things from time to time, but not often.

	If I could buy real things with tacky tokens, I might use
them.  (Maybe someone could sell copies of Applied Crypto, or the
associated source disks, or even neat freebies (like Cray mouse pads)
as a way of generating a demand for the tokens.)

	To make it worthwhile, there need to be enough tokens in
circulation that someone saving up for something doesn't prevent other
people from saving up tokens, but at the same time, there shouldn't be
so many that they are valueless.

	Perhaps the next person selling t-shirts could offer a
discount in exchange for tokens?
