   But I agree that the idea of buying a laptop so you can use PGP at work
   is odious.  There must be a better way.

But remember, the computer you normally use at work is the property of
your employer, and they are Free to Deny You Privacy with it at work.

It remains to be seen where the chips will fall with respect to
workplace privacy generally.  Perhaps workplace email is a good
argument for wireless.
