C'punks,

I just heard on the news that 1300 IRS employees have been
disciplined for unauthorized accesses to electronically filed
income tax returns.  An IRS spokesperson said that under the
current electronic filing system, there is no way to prevent
unauthorized access, change, disclosure or loss of returns.  As
you may recall, last month the GSA told us the IRS could hand its
paper based accounts either.

I'm sure they will do much better, though, when the FBI runs the
phone system, the Post Office controls digital identity and
Hillary takes care of our health.

May you live in interesting times,
