Not sure whether you mean the RFCs or the 4.4 BSD code.  Anyway, here are
a few related RFCs:

1416  E    D. Borman, "Telnet Authentication Option", 02/01/1993. (Pages=7) 
           (Format=.txt) (Obsoletes RFC1409) 

1412  E    K. Alagappan, "Telnet Authentication : SPX", 01/27/1993. (Pages=4) 
           (Format=.txt) 

1411  E    D. Borman, "Telnet Authentication: Kerberos Version 4", 
           01/26/1993. (Pages=4) (Format=.txt) 


The text is available from ftp://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc####.txt.  Hope
it helps...
