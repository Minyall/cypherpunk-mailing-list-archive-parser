   Undersigned is non-computing, non-cyphering reporter at Boston Globe working 
on a little story on the solution of RSA129 (I believe the primes will be 
published April 23, or so).  Looking for people who loaned computer cycles for 
the project, hoping to hear why they did, what fun if any it was, and what's it 
like when they tell you to shut down...sense of loss?  Whatever
