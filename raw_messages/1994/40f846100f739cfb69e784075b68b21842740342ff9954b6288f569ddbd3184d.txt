This seems to have a tricky dependence on the tolerance.  The forger can
get a valid plaintext and signed feature vector.  So, if the tolerance 
for error is too low, you get false positives, but if it's too high, a 
forger could create something starting from the feature vector.  An
interesting CAD/CAM problem.
