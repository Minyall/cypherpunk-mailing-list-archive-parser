Pick up PGP versions 2.2 - 6, and the non-RSAREF 6ui, from ftp.dsi.unimi.it
/pub/security/crypt/PGP

Unless Australia forbids _importing_ crypto, not a crime. PGP 6 is the MIT 
RSAREF version, so someone violated ITAR to get it to Italy. Using it outside
the US and Canada also violates RSADSI's _copyrights_. PGP 6ui was released 
from the UK, and therefore does not violate ITAR. It doesn't use RSAREF, so it
doesn't violate RSADSI copyrights. If used in the US, it does violate RSADSI
_patents_.
