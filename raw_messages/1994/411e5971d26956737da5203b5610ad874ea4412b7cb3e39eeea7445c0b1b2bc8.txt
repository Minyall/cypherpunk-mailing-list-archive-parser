I've just taken a quick look at soda.berkeley.edu's remailers.
There's several of them, and if I'm now to install one of them,
what are their strengths/weaknesses? Should I choose hal's
remailer? Or maybe Nate's? Or hh-remailer? Sameer's anon-
remailer? The INDEX file doesn't say anything about what
differs one remailer from the next, just who wrote it...
Help me out, please!
