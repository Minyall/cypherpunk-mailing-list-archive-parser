Oh goody! Now we are getting a judgement call with respect to how cryptography
in general aids "the greater good".

Do you suppose the NSA makes the same call when they do routine traffic
analysis or try to bust a suspiciously (to them) encrypted message??????

Ummmm...excuse me...."the cypherpunks are an informal group of people
interested in teaching and learning about cryptography. They also
experiment with cryptography and try to put it into use"

from Applied Cryptography by Bruce Schnier....pg 445.

That to me indicates that the members of this list should be at least
remotely interested in the subject of attacks as well as defense as you
can't defend aginst something unless the method of attack has been discussed.

GROAN! (again) And how, pray tell, do we go about protecting ourselves
against others if we are not prepared to discuss what sort of attacks
may be mounted against us?????

Like I alluded to before, I bet if it was a case of someone trying to
descramble something like skipjack to try and discover something about
National Security (ours OR theirs) I bet the members of this list
would have fallen all over themselves trying to help the original poster.

I don't recall seeing too much in the waqy of condemnation of the guy that
posted RC4 to this list ..... but as soon as we see something that touches
close to home like male/female relationships, the shit hits the fan!!!!!

And in my opinion what the original poster was no different than the British
attack on "Enigma" or the American attack on "Purple".
