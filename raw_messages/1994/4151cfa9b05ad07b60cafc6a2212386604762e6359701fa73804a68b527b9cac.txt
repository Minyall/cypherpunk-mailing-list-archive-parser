    The GNU copyleft in no way prohibits any commercial use whatsoever.
    Please do not spread inaccurate rumors about copyleft.

That's a pretty big statement and it's at least partly wrong.  Does
selling something count as a commercial use?  By using "for-profit"
instead of "commercial", I meant you're not supposed to profit
directly from the software, like by selling it.  Of course it's
possible to walk the line, but you have to be careful.

The way that Lucid's Energize development environment relates to their
version of GNU Emacs is a good example of establishing where the line
is and making it clear what's being sold, "for-profit", and what's
free.
