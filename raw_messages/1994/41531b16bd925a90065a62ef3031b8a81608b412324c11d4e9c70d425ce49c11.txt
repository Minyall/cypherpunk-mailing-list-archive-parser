Well, no on at least a couple of counts:  First, my original anger was
piqued by the practice of killing _all_ traffic coming from remailers,
even when the posts were NOT anonymous.  I (and several other users who
have written to me about this issue) would frequently send perfectly
legitimate technical posts through remailers, with Reply-To: fields and
sigs attached, because the remailers afforded more header flexibility or
posting reliability.  These messages were all snuffed, simply because
they came through a remailer.  That's pure BS.

Secondly, a lot of folks do not feel easy about posting to ANY
gun-related list or group because of employer, social or other prejudice
to which they may be subjected.  If a joe.victim@anti-gun.widget.com
wants to use a simple remailer for putting a little shade on his
participation, I don't feel it's anyone else's business; "caution is not
cowardice and carelessness is not courage."  More importantly, it's
nobody else's _problem_ as long as the content of the post is not
objectionable.  Write this down:

======================================================================
_You have no more right to pass judgment on another's "need" for
anonymity than Sarah Brady has a right to pass judgment on your "need"
for a handgun.  Both are private matters of individual self-defense._
======================================================================

That's the important "value" issue here, irrespective of the technical
ones.  I am ashamed to see how many anti-anon RTKBA advocates can't see
the obvious parallels.

No, but maybe a bit parochial and in need of rethinking your definitions
of self-defense and personal freedom.
