 - You can't use your old secret key. So you have to build a new one.
   Why? I don't know. But PGP 2.5 don't recognize your pass phrase anymore.
   Maybe that new RSA algoritme is easier to crack. So they force everybody
   to create a new key...

Sure you can.  If you can't, then this is a bug and should be
reported.  (There is a known bug in the idea code that causes it to
lose on some platforms because memcpy does not deal with copying over
overlapping bodies of memory).

This bug has been fixed for 2.6!

 - A new RSA algorithm??? What's wrong with the old one???

NOT! It's the same RSA algorithm, just a different RSA engine.

I hope this helps
