	That's interesting that they went to the effort to track you down.
	Do you have any idea of how they found out about your package?  Was
	that the one that started all the fooferaw on sci.crypt with PRZ
	upset about someone shipping a modified version of his program?

I doubt very much they tracked him down.  I imagine some two-faced
back-stabbing shit on sci.crypt or cypherpunks shopped him.  I didn't
agree with his attitude over the PGP hacks either, but this sort of
in-fighting is just going too far.  I hope some FOIA someday turns
up the name of the back-stabbing bastard.  Personally I have a 
shortlist of two.
