It seems that Perry and other are flaming Netscape for doing things
their own way.

Yes, Netscape have made a lot fuckups.  But they are out there
bringing really cool crypto to the masses.

First guy on the block always does a lot of dumb fuckups.

That is what version 2.0 is for.

Yes, and all the blunders that appear in version 0.99 are
really gross incredibly stupid blunders.

We should know.  Our prerelease versions of everything we
have created have always been full of incredibly stupid
blunders.

That is the nature of programming.  Let he who is without
sin cast the first stone.
