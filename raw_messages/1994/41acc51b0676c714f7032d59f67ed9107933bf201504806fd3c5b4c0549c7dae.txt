It would be easy enough to split the message by XOR into as many
pieces as you wish.  This would be much more secure than an
every-nth-byte division, though it would increase total traffic
correspondingly.  Taking into account the non-ideality of the
remailer net, using m-of-n secret sharing would be more reliable.

It's not clear to me that this buys you much, though.  Encrypting
the message end-to-end will suffice to keep it private.  What
remailers do for you is impede traffic analysis.  Sending your
message in n pieces gives a traffic watcher n chances.
