C'punks,

John Gilmore has a hot op-ed piece in the business section of the San 
Francisco Examiner entitled, "Strong Cryptography a Must."   Lots of good 
stuff.  My favorite was, "...we want the public to see a serious debate 
about why the Constitution should be burned in order to save the country."
Gee, I'm glad John is on *our* side.
