I have just been lurking on the cypherpunks e-mail list until
I get a feel for the group dynamics, that's why I haven't
made any comments about the less-than-relevant topics and the
nasty ad hominum (?) attacks that seem to take up an extraordinary
amount of bandwidth on this list.

I thought that cypherpunks were interested in uses and practice of
encryption, but I am beginning to wonder.
