The "From" line of a news post may be any arbitrary text.  Although
most newsreaders insert truthful information, you can post anything
you like if you interface with the posting agent personally.

You can telnet to any NNTP server on the Net that does not reject
your connection and post anything you wish.  The "Path" information
should give you some idea of where the post originated.
