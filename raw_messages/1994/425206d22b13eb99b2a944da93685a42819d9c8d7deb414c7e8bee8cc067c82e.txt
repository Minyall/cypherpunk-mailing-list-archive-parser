But if you proceed "in forma pauperis" you don't need to know how to write one.

Must a person carry around a legal dictionary in order to have all the 
right terms to use just in case they are put in jail and to need to

(What shall it be:  habeas corpus? subjuciendum? forma pauperis?  I'm 
so confused.)
