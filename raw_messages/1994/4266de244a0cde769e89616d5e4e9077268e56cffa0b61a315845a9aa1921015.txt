Yes, several such projects are underway. Eric Blossom even showed a
PCB of one at a Cypherpunks meeting, using an inexpensive DSP chip.

Software-only versions, with some compromises in speech quality
probably, are also underway. Phil Zimmermann described his progress at
the last Cypherpunks meeting.

("Software-only" can mean using off-the-shelf, widely-available DSP
boards like SoundBlasters.)

And I know of at least two more such projects. Whether any will
materialize is anyone's guess.

And various hacks have already been done. NeXT users have had
voicemail for years, and certain Macs now offer something similar.
Adding encryption is not a huge obstacle.

A year ago, several Cypherpunks meeting sites around the U.S. were
linked over the Internet using DES encryption. The sound quality was
poor, for various reasons, and we turned off the DES in a matter of
minutes. Still, an encrypted audio conference call.

So such things are possible today.
