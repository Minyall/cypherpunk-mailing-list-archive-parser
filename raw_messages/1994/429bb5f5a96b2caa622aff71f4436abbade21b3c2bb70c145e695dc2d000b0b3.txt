So autonag every nym to send a public key in.

Every email has its nym checked.  No key for that nym, auto nag
Discrepant signature, flag.   No signature, autonag.

This would be actually useful.  It provides a benefit, thus
demonstrating the usefulness of crypto, and would achieve 
the goals that you desire (get us to sign our stuff) without 
making us look like seven year olds.

What you are proposing provides no benefit.  It is crypto for
the sake of crypto.  This makes us look like kids in
mighty-morphing-power-ranger suits, playing with captain
Krunch secret decoder key rings.

A check on syntax without semantics looks pathetic, in the
same way, and for the same reasons, as a captain Krunch
secret decoder ring.
