Subject: Bcc header added to my remailer
Message-ID: <1994Mar17.084341.7547@extropia.wimsey.com>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain


I have implemented the "Bcc:" header in my remailer.  It can be used
instead (or in addition) to the "Request-remailing-to:" header.  Addresses
on the "Bcc:" line will not be added to the outgoing mail headers.

The remailer is remail@extropia.wimsey.com.
