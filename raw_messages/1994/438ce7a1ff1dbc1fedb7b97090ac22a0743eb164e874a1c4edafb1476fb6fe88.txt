I liked the portrail of the wife as being a normal, easily spooked person 
out of a 50's sitcom who was thrown into a james bond world.  Call me 
stupid, but the time when she was trying to dance like a striper and fell 
down was funny.  I thought the whole idea was that this was part comedy 
about this.  I don't hear anyone screaming when arnold trips, or flexes.  

In that sence I don't agree with the statment about "all women are good 
for is..." but I can see how the portrial of a "weak" woman could be 
interpreted as that, and I LIKED the portraial. Just as I liked it in an 
analogous movie with the sex roles reversed.

This is why there was a little :-) on the end of this.
