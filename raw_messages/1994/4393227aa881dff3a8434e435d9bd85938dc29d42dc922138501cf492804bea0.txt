In Cryptosystems Journal, published by Tony S Patti, Volume 2 Number 2
is a description, circuit board layouts, parts list, etc. for Ranger
hardware RNG. It produced 6,750 bits per second into the parallel port of a
standard PC. The author says that you can build a Ranger for less than $40
worth of parts.

I have not seen any reviews of this device, but it has been arround for a
