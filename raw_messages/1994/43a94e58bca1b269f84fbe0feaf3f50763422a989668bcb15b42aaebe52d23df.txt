   One would think that anybody who would go to the expense of designing an
   encrypting FAX machine could at least afford to read the introduction to
   any beginning crypto book.

I just said this last week.  PNRG-XOR can be very secure.  If they're
using Blum-Blum-Shub, it could be secure, since there are other things
to go wrong.  If they're using a LFSR, it's not secure.

It looks like a none-too-competent technology reporter to me.
