    . . .
    
    As you may know, there's a guy on alt.privacy who has been collecting SS
    numbers for a while (a perfectly legal activity).  I will be contacting him
    to see if he would be interested in contributing the numbers that he has
    collected.

Doubtful, according to his Q&A sheet.  He will, however, trade
one-for-one.
