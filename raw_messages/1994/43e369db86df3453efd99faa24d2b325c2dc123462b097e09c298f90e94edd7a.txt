How to kill SKE?

Open offer.  For $100 I will apply for an escrowed key and get it delivered
to you (without actually posessing the key material).  I will also apply for
a key as the representative of your corp, trust, partnership, etc.  

For an additional fee I will legally change my name to yours, get a key in
that name and then change my name back.

All transactions can be completed in cash.
