   While I sympathise 100% with prz's annoyance at this hack, I should
   remind him that he *did* put pgp out under the GPL and anyone is free
   to modify it in any way they chose as long as they too release it
   under the GPL.

   He has no legal comeback (ha, there's an interesting irony about the
   author of the world's leading piece of guerilla software...) and the
   most he can do is apply peer pressure to get the guy to back down.

The GPL says nothing about what you can call a program.  Phil can
certainly require someone to call it something other than PGP.  The GPL
also requires, in section 2a, that changes be prominently marked.
