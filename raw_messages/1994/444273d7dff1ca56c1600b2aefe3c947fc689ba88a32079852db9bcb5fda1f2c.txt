I found this in the May 6 issue of Science:

        >At the same press conference where Lenstra and company announced
        >the defeat  of RSA-129,he promised a "surprise" for the next
        >factoring feat. He hinted at a new, faster algorithm- and
        >perhaps a test involving a number with quite a  few more digits
        >than 129.
      
Then I found this in the May 7 issue of Science News:

        >In a startling theoretical result that could call into question
        >any  cryptosystem based on factoring, Peter W Shore of AT&T Bell

By "easy" I presume they mean solvable in Polynomical time. I'm
not saying the writing is on the wall or anything but it might
be prudent to start thinking about Diffe-Hellman, perhaps using
elliptic curves.
