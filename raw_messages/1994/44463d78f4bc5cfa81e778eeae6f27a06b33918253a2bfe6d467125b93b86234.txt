I did some testing, and sure enough, it reads the aliases in my
~/.premailrc just fine. BUT, it does not automatically sign my
messages as I thought it should. I've double-checked and both
$config{"signuser"} and $config{"signpass"} are set correctly. Oh
well, I'll just have to try out your scripts for elm. :)
