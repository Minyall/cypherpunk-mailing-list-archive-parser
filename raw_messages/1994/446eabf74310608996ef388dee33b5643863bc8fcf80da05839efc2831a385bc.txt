Good point.  There is a related attack which Chaum pointed out in his
1981 CACM paper: the attacker intercepts and keeps a copy of an incoming
message, then later re-sends it.  This one will go to the same place and
by repeating this multiple times we can figure out where the original
message went.

If I follow this, the attack is something like, every time Alice sends
a message Bob receives one.  Observing this happening over a period of
time we conclude they are communicating.  Could this be defeated by
sending dummy messages so that Alice sends exactly 10 messages every day?
Then the fact that Bob receives messages on some day can't very well
be associated with Alice.
