I'm not a touch typist (although I am also not quite a hunt-and-peck
typist, either).  And using only about 6 fingers (well, I am counting
both thumbs in this count, and sometimes I use my other fingers as
well) I have no problems typing in my long (40-50 char) pass phrase!

However, I am a computer geek (well, I prefer to be known as a nerd,
but I have Nerd Pride, so... ;-) Anyways, I have a feeling that
Steve's testing was done with non-computer-geek-type people.  I.e.,
secretaries, managers, and high-up muckety-mucks.  Is this true,
Steve?  What was your sample space in your research?
