Please, please try to include Macintosh software.

I think often, through no fault of vigilant authors, the macintosh users
get the short end of the stick in code.

Consider including versions of Curve Encrypt, and MacPGP2.3.

I don't want to speak for the authors as for distrubution questions.

Contact Curve Software at :  kinney@bogart.colorado.edu

Curve's key:

Version: 2.3

1>  StealthPGP for the mac?
2>  More secure stego for the mac?
3>  SecureDevice for the mac?
4>  The source code for MacPGP2.3 v1.1?
5>  PGPtools for the mac?
6>  Cryptographer's Workbench for the mac?
