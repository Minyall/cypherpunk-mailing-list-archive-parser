This is a repeat of a request that I made last fall. I got no real response
then. Perhaps as the list has grown, someone will respond....


I am looking for help on a Microsoft Windows development project. I have
most of a Windows Client SMTP mail client program written, but I can't
devine how to make the Windows Communications API work with any marginal
success. I need help from someone who has written Windows communications
software.

The program is functionally equivalent to NUpop or Eudora. It is designed to
work over dialup asynchronous lines without TCP/IP. Not that I dislike
all the nice functionality tht TCP/IP provides, but because some netowrk
providers (such as George Mason University) refuse to support SLIP/PPP for
political reasons, and because other providers (Netcom for one) charge
orders of magnitude more for SLIP/PPP than for async support.

The resulting product will be user firendly, a native Windows program with
the usual buttons, icons, context sensitive help, etc. It will have PGP, and
maybe RIPEM, support built in. Automagically.

I plan to release the code to the net, and will give full credit in the
About Box, documentation, etc. for any help.

Please respond via email.

Cypherpunks write code.

Thanks
Pat
