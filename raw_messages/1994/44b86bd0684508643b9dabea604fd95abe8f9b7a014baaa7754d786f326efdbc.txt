Just build it, on any platform. The key is the RNG, not the interface, which
can be easily adapted to market demands. I take it that you don't plan to
invest millions of dollars to start up, so _which_ interface you use first
is not crucial ;-)

There have been too many "let's do this" suggestions that degenerate into a
discussion of the smallest details and disappear all together...
