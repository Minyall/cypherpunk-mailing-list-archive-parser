I took the time to contact the "office symbol" listed in the NSA
announcement. The NSAoid's name was Dennis Sysko. He was a little
nonplussed that Bruce had posted the announcement.

I was required to write a letter to them, on Intergraph letterhead,
requesting further information; after receiving it, Sysko promised to
send me an NDA that I could sign and return to get further
information.

Someone else posted in t.p.c that they'd sent in a letter and been
told that NSA would not license this technology to individuals. That
sort of echoes the argument that there are some munitions appropriate
for government but not for individuals.
