Goodness, Tim, our government would never forbid mathematics to its
citizens.  No, you simply require the appropriate licence to legally
work with the algorithms in question.  Of course, these days it's
rather difficult to get a research permit for Schedule I math -- you
generally have to work for NSA.

In response to your original question: it's a little tricky to keep
an up-to-date list of the Schedules.  What you can do is start with
the Controlled Algorithms Act of 1970, and work forwards from there.
Keep an eye on the Federal Register for recent schedulings.
