The author stated use of 8 processors and "aggressive vectorization",
or, IOW, Using the 8 processors in conjunction instead of as 8 separate
data paths, making their co-operative speed MUCH faster than
an 8X increase.

| 	Could someone explain why jumping to 8 processors knocks the
| time down by a factor of 400, instead of a factor of 8?  Is the 400

| 8?
