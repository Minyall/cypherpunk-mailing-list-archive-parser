I am trying to hunt up a copy of:

The Dining Cryptographers in the Disco:
	Unconditional Sender and Recipient Untracability with
	Computationally Secure Serviceability

by Michael Waidner and Birgit Pfitzmann


So far the only ref I have found is the abstract in Eurocrypt '89, but I
can't seem to locate a copy of the entire paper.  If anyone knows of where
I might find a copy I would appreciate it...
