...... the road to key escrow is paved with good intentions.
IMHO the developers who might actually be working on
implementations of this scheme either
	a) don't know that it _could easily_ "become part of
	   a nationally-mandated open avenue to spying,"
	b) know but don't think such developments are likely, or
	c) know and don't care.

Clearly education is a powerful antidote to cases a) and b)

You're right:
How would you make clear the connection between key escrow (per se), 
the large context of liberty to pursue software strategies to solve 
customer problems, the and the individuals who find themselves in the middle?

What would you say is the critical, key focal point between the 
existence of a system of operation, and the way it is intended to be used?

And how would you get the educational message out to those involved?
