	IP is not reliable & trustworthy.  It it was, RFC931 ident
servers would be useful. ;)  Theres source routing to make packets
appear to come from someplace else, and there is outright forgery,
which has limits, but can work quite well.

	For a good discussion of some of TCP/IP's reliability &
trustworthyness, see Steve Bellovin's paper,
research.att.com:/dist/internet_security/ipext.ps.Z

	An aside: Does anyone care to share thoughts on IPng's
security features?
