More than a year ago, there was a brief flurry of concern in the Twin
Cities about porn on the BBS'.  I actually attended a meeting with a
bunch of ops and a state senator.  It was kinda humorous... the senator
really didn't have a clue what a BBS was, and the sysops had called her
to inquire about any possible legislation.

The down side was that licensing was mentioned as the first recourse
from the state.  When we complained of the financial hit, the talk
turned to registration.  But the sense was clearly toward proactive
state control.

There was a TV crew at the meeting.  The bimbette made the state
senator look positively well-informed.  And they didn't interview
me, either.
