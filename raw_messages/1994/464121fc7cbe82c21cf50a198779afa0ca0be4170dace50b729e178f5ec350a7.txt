(Please respond to this question by private email.)
Is it possible to set up most fax/data modems to
be ready to receive calls from either fax machines or
data modems?  If so, in this mode, does it make the
beep that sets a calling fax machine going, or does
the caller have to push a button to initiate the
connection from his or her side?  Ditto for data.
Doesn't the answer side usually put out the first
beep?
