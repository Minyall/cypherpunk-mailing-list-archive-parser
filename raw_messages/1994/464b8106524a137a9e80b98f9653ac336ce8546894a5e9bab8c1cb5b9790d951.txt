Back in November, Rep Condit (D, CA) held hearings on "Implications of 
Health Care REvision on the Confidentiality of Health Records."  IE, the 
use of the 'smart card' to encode health records, as part of 
'portability' of health care.  Has anyone kept up on this?  I'm looking 
for articles, studies, monographs, rants, and screeds.

Thanks.
