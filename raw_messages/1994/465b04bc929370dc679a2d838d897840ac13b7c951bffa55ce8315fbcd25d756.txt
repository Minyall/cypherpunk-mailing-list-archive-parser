The debate between Philip Zimmermann and Clinton Brooks from NSA
has been postponed.  The debate organizers, the World Affairs Council
decided today (Tuesday) that there were not enough attendees preregistered 
to proceed with the debate at this time.  The debate had been scheduled
for Thursday, 25 August, in Thousand Oaks, California.

A major conference organized by the World Affairs Council, scheduled
for 27 October, will have the debate included in the conference.
When those plans firm up, there will be detailed announcements
with more lead time.

I'm sorry if this change in plans inconveniences anyone who planned to 
attend the debate, but I had nothing to do with their decision.
