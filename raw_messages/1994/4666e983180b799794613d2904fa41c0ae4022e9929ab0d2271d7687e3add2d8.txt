	And the sad truth is that even if you made a "Bill Of

	do this IMO.  They could write one up and go "ohhhh

	do to enforce it.  This net is multi-national,
	multi-government, and multi-cultured.  While such an idea
	may sound good, it's not going to solve any problems.

	I would like the idea of cypherpunk approved stickers for
	those sites that are discreet in their service and
	provide good acces, but what would this do? Nothing
	really except maybe make a few readers of this list go to
	those providrd if they are close enough.  I mean what
	owuld be the criteria for sucha  approval?  We are far
	from an organized group, so who would make the decisions?
	Noone really could.

	I am wondering why every statemetn revovles aroun tc may?

	never seen these complaints so I cant respond to this in
	an informed manner.

	The nasdaq in my opinion is far from a ample model for
	cyberspace.  The internet is not crying for a policy
	at all.  I dont se what prompts this notion.

	And that is my point.  Make your own locks, but DONT go

	them, yes, but dpont ry to initiate some global policy.

	Not likely.  We're out of the realm of small sandboxes,
	and into interconnected beaches 8).  and PLEASE do not
	lump Cpunks at all.  The rest of the world may try and
	regulate is, but the problewm IS that I can just add my

	and if it comes to bieng illegal to get my words out,
