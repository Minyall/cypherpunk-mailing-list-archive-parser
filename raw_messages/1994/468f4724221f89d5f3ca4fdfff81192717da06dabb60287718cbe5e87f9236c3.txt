It fooled me for the first few paragraphs, too.  It's traditional in these
spoofs to have some "tipoff", a strange date or name, at the top, but I
didn't notice anything like that.  I think it's a bit unethical to send
this kind of thing out; someone who just skimmed the first part may come
away with entirely the wrong impression.

(It was an entertaining spoof, no question, I just wish they had taken a
little more care to avoid misleading people.)
