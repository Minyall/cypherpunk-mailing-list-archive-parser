> Will a passport be issued to a non-citizen?

Do you anticipate an enduring role for passports?  What would be the
point of strong cryptography if it leaves intact institutions able to
enforce a demand for passports?  Are they not as much an invasion of
privacy as eavesdropping?  If passports continue to be of significance
in the future, wouldn't that indicate that strong cryptography has
failed to achieve its promise?
