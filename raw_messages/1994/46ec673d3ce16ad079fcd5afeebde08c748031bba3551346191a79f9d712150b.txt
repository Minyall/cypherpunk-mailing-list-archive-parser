    A very positive, technically astute discussion by William
    Stallings,  stallings@acm.org, who concludes:

    "PGP is young, strong, and coming on. It is already being widely
    used, and its growth is being fueled by the rapid growth in
    Internet use and the increasing reliance on E-mail for everything
    from legal documents to love letters.  It is already the practice
    of many people to include their PGP fingerprint in E-mail messages.
    Expect to see more of this and to see such fingerprints appearing
    in print, as one does with this article, in the future.
