Since the bomb thread won't die a seemly death I thought I'd throw in my
.00000002 megabucks.  Modern H bombs are actually fission-fusion-fission
devices. The traditional U-235 (or Pu-239) atomic bomb sets off a fusion 
reaction burning the tritium, producing alot of fast neutrons that in turn
sets off another fission explosion in the otherwise non-fissile U-238 
that is wrapped around the outside of the bomb.  More bang for the buck, 
and it gives you something to do with all that U-238 you got while 
purifying the U-235.
