IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT!!!!!

RE:  ILLEGAL USE of the name BLACKNET!

OFFENDER:  "NOBODY@SHELL.PORTAL.COM"



It has come to our attention our name The BLACKNET is being used
ILLEGALLY and MALICIOUSLY by some party or parties unknown.
Please be advised that this company/group/individual, etc. are in
no way affiliated with our BBS.

The Blacknet is a service mark registered with the Patent and
Trademark Office and steps are being taken to protect our
integrity in the online world, as well as to implement legal
action against those who have defamed our name.

I trust that those in the online world who do know us realize we
are not behind this group and if you see any further messages to
route them to us.

For those who do not know us, we hope that the next time you see
the name Blacknet it will not be associated with the disgusting
message that has been circulating around the networks.

Thank you for your attention and cooperation.

Sincerely,


Idette Vaughan for The Blacknet
