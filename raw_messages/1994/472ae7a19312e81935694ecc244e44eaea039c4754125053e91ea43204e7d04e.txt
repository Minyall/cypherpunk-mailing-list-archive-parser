Yep, you got it.  Dig a hole, crawl inside, and pull it in after you.  As
soon as you can manage it.

Personally, _I_ think the government's out to destroy this list by
recruiting a bunch of low-IQ paranoid schizophrenics, denying them their
medication, sitting 'em at terminals and giving 'em the Cypherpunks address
and the address of an anonymous remailer.  The half-wit quotient around
here is definitely on the rise.
