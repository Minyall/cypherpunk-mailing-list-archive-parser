I'm not sure what other people think of the "trustworthiness" of various
remailers, but when chaining I usually bounce it through two, AND the
first leg goes offshore to hacktic which seems superably reliable. After
that, it goes to either wimsey or ghio. Be better to hacktic and then
another Euro-mailer before going back to North America, but what other
European remailers are as reliable as hacktic?
