I have no idea why I phrased so badly: clearly, commuting makes
sense with DES and IDEA.  What I meant was "since it doesn't
make sense for compound message formats where the private keys
are encrypted in public key ciphers, as IDEA is in PGP and
DES/3DES are in RIPEM.

Serves me right for posting after being awake for so long.
