	Is this true? I am a NY state resident. I am under the impression that
altering either the bar code or the mag strip on the back of my license
would be as illegal as say changing the picture (Not that this is possible
in with the new NY licenses).  I do not know the legality behind this but
I am aware that altering a license in ANYWAY is illegal.  Although what
you are suggesting is VERY difficult to prove, it is still I would think
illegal.  Unless anyone has any legal information to the contrary....

	I would also guess that these states that have the mag strips on
their license also have fines for non-oprative strips.  If they do not, I
am sure the law will be created so enough!
