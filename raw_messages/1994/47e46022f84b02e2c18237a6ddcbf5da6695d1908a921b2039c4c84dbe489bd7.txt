This is one reason that we have not disable the 'who' command on the
toad.com majordomo server.  If you want the public not to know you're
on the cypherpunks list, get and use an alias.

There are two issues here.  I don't mind reading most mail on a shared
machine, but I'm sure as hell not going to let my private key inside
its RAM.
