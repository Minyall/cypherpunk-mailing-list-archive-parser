The format of the LEAF block is public knowledge.  Here is how it
is formed:


      [80-bit Session key Ks]   [16-bit # ]   [32-bit chip ID]

      [80-bit Unit Key    Ku]

      [80-bit.  {Ks}Ku      ]   [16b {#}Ks]   [32-bit chip ID]

      [128-bit LEAF:  {{Ks}Ku {#}Ks ID}Kf  (Kf == family key)]

Whether or not known plaintext will work is unclear, since you cannot
get {#}Ks (you really don't know what it is outside the chip) and you
also don't know what # is (it is, according to the NSA, a fixed number
in all the chips).

Hope this helps.
