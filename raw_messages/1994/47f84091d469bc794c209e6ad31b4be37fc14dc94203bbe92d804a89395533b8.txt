I exchanged email with Eric Johnson about his database a few days ago.
He has had some sort of problem and does not have the time to fix it,
so his database is down till further notice.  This is too bad, as it
was a fantastic resource.

Sometime back someone mentioned that they now had their own workstation
on the net and were willing to do something, like make it available for
the Cyperpunk Electronic Book idea.  I think it would be really good to
have a permanent archive site to make all of the cypherpunk mail
available via FTP.  If they, or someone else, have the disk space to do
this, it would be a very good thing.  Along with making the mail
directly available, a permanent archive would let mosaic pages
reference any mail.
