I disagree with this. Anonymity is what gives digital cash it's raison
d'etre, it's technological advantages over conventional schemes.

If anonymity, untraceability, and other "Chaumian" notions are only
seen as peripheral side effects, then we already _have_ "digital cash"
in the encrypted credit card systems some folks are already offering.

Without the technological approach to untraceability and anonymity,
all we have is the usual "trust". Granted, credit card numbers ought
not to be sent over unsecured channels, but fixing that is easy (with
end-to-end encryption). Trust-based systems are not the foundation for
a free society most of us are seeking.

"Digidollar" was one of the many names coined by folks on this list,
along with Cypherbucks, Digimarks, etc.
