If that's the program I wrote back in '82 called CRYPT and marketed
through the Software Toolworks and Norell Data Systems, then you should be
able to break it with crib dragging, if you know enough plaintext.  It
XORed the output of a linear feedback shift register against the text.
The documentation listed that attack under "bugs".  Depending on how you
select keys, it might be easier to brute force it against a dictionary.

If that's not the program, try giving more identification on it...
