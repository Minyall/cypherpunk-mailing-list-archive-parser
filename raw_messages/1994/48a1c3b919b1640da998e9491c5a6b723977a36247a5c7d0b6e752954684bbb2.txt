How about auto-moderation?  I came up with this idea a while back for
automatically moderating mailing lists.  Here's how it works:

A newsgroup is set up as moderated, and the posts are emailed to the 
moderator (as usual).  The "moderator" is a mail-to-news gateway that 
posts the articles if the author isn't on the disapproved list, and
also automatically cancels articles that don't have the right "approved"
header and aren't digitally signed by the moderator.

If a person becomes a nuisance, people send their votes in to the 
moderator-robot, and it tallies the votes. If within XXX days more thumbs 
down votes are received than thumbs up votes, the person is placed on the 
disapproved list.

The main advantage is, it's fast and easy to set up.  Comments?
