There MUST be some way that the LISTSERV software can be modified
so that a user can send an unsubscribe message to the -request line
for another user.

Take this Detweiler for example.  If he forgets where to send his
unsubscribe message and sends it to the list instead, someone could send
an unsubscribe message to the proper address for him. ex:

   'unsubscribe [ listname ] user@e-mail.addr'

The system would note that the name of the person sending the
unsubscribe message ( user1 ) was different from the one who was being
unsubscribed ( user2 ) , and would, after unsubscribing user2 send a
message to user2 telling him that he had been unsubscribed from the list
by user1. ex:

   'Dear user2, you have been unsubscribed from the Cypherpunks
   list by user1.  If you wish to resubscribe, send a message
   containing...'

That way, instead of the list readers bombarding the folks who send
the unsubscribe requests to the list, they could simply forward the
request to the proper place.

Now, how do we get it implemented?
