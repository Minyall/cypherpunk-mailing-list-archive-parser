Not quite. Very few, if any, Part 15 spread spectrum modems do automatic
transmitter power control, and as a result they generally run much more
power than necessary. That makes you much easier to spot. It also
pollutes the spectrum.

Even spread spectrum transmitters with tight power control (e.g, our
IS-95 cellular system) are easily detected (though not demodulated)
with simple AM scanners when you're close enough. Especially when the
mobile in question is a long way from the cell and transmitting near
full power as a result.

On the other hand, if you're not close, any particular mobile will be
drowned out by the several dozen others sharing the same channel.
