I fully encourage people to think freely, but I absolutely refuse to 
encourage people to become "Free Thinkers".  I've found that so-called
"Free Thinkers" reveal themselves to be, through their ideas and literature,
to be nothing more than narrow-minded empiricist zealots, hostile beyond
reason to religion and anything that cannot be apprehended directly
by the human senses in general.  IMHO, of course.
