Can anyone supply me with a list of remailers? I'm writing an article
for a general circulation newspaper on encryption, anonymous contact
services and privacy in the Information Age. I want to provide readers
with a list of remailing services.

Also, what is the BBS tel. number at MIT to download PGP 2.6?
