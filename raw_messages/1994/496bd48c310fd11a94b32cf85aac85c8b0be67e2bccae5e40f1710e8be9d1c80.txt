  On mandatory sigs: I personally don't fathom the
idea (as some of you do), I've always perceived 
PGP(Tm) as something I would use when I really had 
something sensitive to send a friend, or when I was 
making a public announcement to a mailing list or 
newsgroup. But to use it to sign EVERY single piece 
of mail I send to cypherpunks is asking a lot from 
me as my setup is very similar to Tim Mays', and I 
don't want to be singled out because of it! I think 
the list should proceed as it has since its 
formation, and subscribers should just sign their 
messages as they see fit. I know I'm not posting 
anything new, but considering the torrential flood 
of trash that Detweiler posted, it's not that much 
of a waste. :-)= Good evening.
