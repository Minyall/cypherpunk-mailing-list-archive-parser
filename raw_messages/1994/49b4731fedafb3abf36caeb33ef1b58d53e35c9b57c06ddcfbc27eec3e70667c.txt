The RFC doesn't specify an encryption system. Its been a while since
I've looked at the Cray code.

I don't believe the Cray implementation had a key exchange system, but
I believe that hooks for one were present in the protocol.

I believe Linux has a fairly conventional sockets library.

In any case, Jim Thompson has promised us an improved version of the
code, so I'd wait for his hacks...
