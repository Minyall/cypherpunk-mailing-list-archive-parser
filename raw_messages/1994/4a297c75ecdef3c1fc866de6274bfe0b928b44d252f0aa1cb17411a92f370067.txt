They finally got to me.  after fretting for years about how (melanin-rich)
hordes of illegal aliens were poised to steal *my* job, I've decided that
something has to be done.

The turning point came this morning while reading about the report of the
Commission on Immigration Reform.  They have proposed a brilliant idea -- a
national registry of the names and SS numbers of all *Real* Americans (as
well as those sneaky legal aliens) so that employers can (would have to)
verify that their prospective employees are legal.

Since this is such a fabulous idea, I thought that we might help out by
creating a Social Security Number Server on the nets to make valid names and
SS numbers available to *everyone*.  Nice WWW interface with forms support,
etc.  After all, since it's such a good thing to do, we should *help* the
Feds by doing more of it.

As you may know, there's a guy on alt.privacy who has been collecting SS
numbers for a while (a perfectly legal activity).  I will be contacting him
to see if he would be interested in contributing the numbers that he has
collected.

Anyone else interested contact me.

Who is among the 2% of Americans (it's actually higher) not covered by the
Social Security Act and who will be part of the 5% of Americans (again it
will be much higher) not covered by the Health Security Act.
