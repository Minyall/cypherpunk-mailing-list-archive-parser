I know the courts have never ruled in a case in point but is there any 
doubt that BBS are publications.  They are in text for the most part.  
They resemble the "Broadsides" that were a big part of public discourse 
in 1789 in the Confederacy (The US under the Articles of Confederation).

What are they, chopped liver?
