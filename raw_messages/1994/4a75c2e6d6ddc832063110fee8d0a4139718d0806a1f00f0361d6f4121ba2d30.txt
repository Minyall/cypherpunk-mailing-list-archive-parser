Anybody taken note of the ruckus about a forged posting from Bob Rae (the
premier of the Canadian province of Ontario)? Seems like some joker posted
a fake message from Rae through Hal's remailer at portal.

Now all the lame press (and some even LAMER USENET readers) are screaming foul.
I bet there will be renewed interest in the cypherpunk remailer's in the next
few days :>
