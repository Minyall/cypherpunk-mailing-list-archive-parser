These discussions on the interest of power are fascinating to me.  So
many of them do not take into account my own desires to create a
useful discussion forum, which desires bind me tighter than any law
ever could.  There are some very interesting implications of this _de
facto_ solipsism to achievement of equilibria in games with iterated
dominance.
