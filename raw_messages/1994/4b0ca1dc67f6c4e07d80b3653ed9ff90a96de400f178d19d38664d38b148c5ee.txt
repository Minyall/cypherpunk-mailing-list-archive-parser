Not long after my original post, I got a message from Dave Barnhart of
ViaCrypt. He asserted that it would be "illegal" for me to buy a
ViaCrypt license, then use PGP 2.6-based code in my own application,
and that it would violate both my RSAREF license and my MIT license on
any copies of PGP 2.6 that I was licensed to operate.

So, the short answer is I'm going to roll my own instead of using PGP
or a PGP-based tool. D-H for the initial key exchange, plus 3DES for
the actual encryption, and poof! away I go. And yes, I know D-H is
claimed by RSA's PK patents.
