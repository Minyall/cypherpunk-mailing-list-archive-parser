Voter's Telecomm Watch (Shabbir J. Safdar <shabbir@panix.com>) told me 
the vote was unanimous.  Their recent "Wiretap Watch" lists a bunch of 
Senators who voted to let it leave the committee, but none who wanted to 
kill it.  The Legi-Slate Congressional database service says only that 
it was approved by a voice vote.
