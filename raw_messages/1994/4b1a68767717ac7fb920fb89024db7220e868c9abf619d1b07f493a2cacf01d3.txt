(Don't worry, I'm not including all 500 lines of the forwarded message
here!)

Could people *please* take care on what they forward to all of us?

Kent England either is sending us a message that's stale (action was
due two days ago), or he was sending a message to Shabbir and copied
both Shabbir and all of us on it, or....

In any case, the barrage of press releases, CPSR alerts, EPIC alerts,
and EFF bulletins are beginning to resemble "MAKE.MONEY.FAST" in their
volume and shrillness ("Sign this petition! Do it today! Do it now!").

I know many solid, serious Cypherpunks who used to read and post and
who now mostly don't. I can't say I blame them.
