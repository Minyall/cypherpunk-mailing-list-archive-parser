Sorry, I've met Perry and he's real.  Unless L. Detweiler lives in New
York and works in New York and only posts from Colorado, you're barking up
the wrong tree.

I've also met Dave Mandl and he's met Perry.  (Unless of course you wish
to imply that I'm Perry and Detweiler and Dave Mandl...  But I submit that
you may be paranoid enough to make such an assumption...)
