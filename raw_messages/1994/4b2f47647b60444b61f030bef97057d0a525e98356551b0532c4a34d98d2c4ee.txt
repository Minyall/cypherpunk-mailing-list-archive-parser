Steve, did you learn anything interesting from your experiment several
months ago in which you were testing the ability of folk to type long
passwords?  I remember being surprised at how short your test passwords
were, given the nature of the experiment.  (I have no difficulty
typing 50-character pass phrases with echoing turned off.)
