	At today's talk at MIT (Morris & Unkenholz of the NSA) Morris
said several times that the escrow system had to be produced in a
hurry, on top of the Skipjack algorithim, which was designed
previously and 'sitting in a storeroom.' (boy, I'd like to FOIA that
storeroom. :)

	I didn't get a chance to ask why more time wasn't taken to
prepare the escrow system to be more robust, since there were already
a lot of political questions that these two really weren't in a
position to answer.

Politics.  From the greek "poly," meaning many, and ticks, a small,
annoying bloodsucker.
