Exactly.

This is how I see it (all numbers made up for illustration):

If Clipper/Digital Telephony are proposed by Clinton, 60% of Democrats

If Clipper/Digital Telephony are proposed by a Republican, 40% of Democrats
and 80% of Republicans will support.

The above opinions are exclusively my own. If anyone else wants them,
they can buy them from me. Easy terms can be arranged.
