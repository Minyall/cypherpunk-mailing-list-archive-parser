Do you know how easy it is to fake an address? I occasionally telnet to port 25
and talk SMTP directly, to avoid spooling, but I have to type in the address
I want the mail to appear from. There's no way of ensuring that I type in 
my real address, or _any_ real address at all for that matter.

Digitally signed voting? Only works if you restrict yourself to 'known' voters.
Net identities are very easy to fake or create.
