Is there any interest in establishing a local (Chicago area) equivalent of 
the bay area Cypherpunks which meets in physical (as opposed to cyberspace ) 
form. Topics to be addressed include issues of privacy, security, 
cryptography and ....

Anyone interested please respond to this email address. I may not get back to 
your immediately. I will be out of town 7/29 - 8/10. Oh, please pass this 
along to anyone you think would be interested.
