An off-topic aside: this is already done. Check out the NetBSD and
Linux projects sometime. NetBSD is about to release 1.0, the first
fully-working unencumbered release of bsd 4.4 for several
platforms. Linux is well known by now. I have both, they are far
superior for my needs than any MS product.
