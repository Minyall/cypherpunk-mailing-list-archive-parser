First you need to generate a key revocation for your old key
and post that to the servers.  Then just email your new key to
the server.

I think the command to revoke a key is PGP -kr <key ID>
but check the manual/help files to be sure...  I haven't had to
revoke a key yet so that's why I'm a little fuzzy.

Later... Greg Morgan
