	I myself have a Linux system at home, all set up with PGP and 
rather secure from outside thrats since it is unconnected from the net 
except for when I dial-up.  I was wondering what strategies some people 
use in order to make it easier to write and respond to mail.  I dont feel 
like writing a message at home, encrypting it and then U/Ling it to my 
acount and mailing it. Is there another wya to use PGP on my mail account 
wihtout severely reducng mysecurity? I know the Sysop can read my secring 
etc.. at any time and can also intercept my passkey for my secring, BUT I 
would still like to perhaps use a low security key from my Unix account 
and then have a high security key on my home system that is very safe.  
The problem is, figuring out which message goes to where and all.  Could 
someone with extnsive knowledge of PGP use on a Unix system help me out 
here>?
