Looks like these guys haven't noticed that Diffie-Hellman was added to
RSAREF 2.0. Even with its highly suboptimum exponentiation code, I can
generate a 1K bit key in roughly 20 seconds on a 50 Mhz 486, assuming
precomputation of the first phase of the protocol (generating a random
number and exponentiating it). That's much faster than generating a
transient RSA key pair.
