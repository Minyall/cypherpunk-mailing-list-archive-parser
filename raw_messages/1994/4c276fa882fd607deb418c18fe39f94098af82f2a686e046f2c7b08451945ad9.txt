The first what?  On 8 June 94 I sent a PGP message to ACM.ORG requesting an
account and enclosing a signed authorization to use my VISA card to set up
an account; inside the signed text I specified that I authorized charges
for one year's worth of mail forwarding.  I received a (non-PGP) receipt
the next day, and my account was active.  My message and the product were
both on the net.

If the payment in your transaction was in e$, then I don't have a
counterexample to your claim...
