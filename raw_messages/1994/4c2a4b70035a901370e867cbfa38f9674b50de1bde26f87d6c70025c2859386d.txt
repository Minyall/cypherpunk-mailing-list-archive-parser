Dear Cypherpunks,,
I have a native american activist friend, who lives near Albuquerque, and who 
is currently not connected to the net. He wishes to find information about 
net connectivity and also has concerns about privacy of electronic 
communication. Is there anyone out there who can assist? 
Thank you very much,
Mara Whitney (maraw@fs-gate.uchicago.edu)
