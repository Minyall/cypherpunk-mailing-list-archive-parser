Correct me if I'm wrong, but the "Standard Stego" package that has been 
discussed could operate like the "stealth ocean" ideas that have been 
discussed.  Some sort of hash function defines "random-like" bits to be 
accessed in a consecutive form.  These bits can be located in a hard 
drive full of digitized noise, a jpeg or gif file, a CD, or any other 
large chunk of data.  The access mechanism can be standardized.  Without 
the key string, you don't know which bits are random and which are data.
