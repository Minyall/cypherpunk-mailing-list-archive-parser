The point is that someone shouldn't NEED to revoke their key if all
they are doing is changing their email address.

What if the binding of the userID is a result of a position that you
hold... For example, I am the owner of a company and I sign people's
identifiers, saying that they are employees of mine, and possibly what
their position is.  Now say I fire someone, I want to be able to
revoke my signature since the binding is no longer valid!  But I
shouldn't need to force them to generate a new key.
