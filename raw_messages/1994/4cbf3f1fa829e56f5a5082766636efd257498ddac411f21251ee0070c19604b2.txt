Avoidance is legal, of course, so I assume evasion is what you mean.
Is taxation legalized theft or the price we pay for civilization?
 
- From an individual rights point of view, the assumed government
"social contract" is bogus because it is not voluntary. It is a
coercive monopoly, like a Mafia protection racket with a flag.
Muscle in on the TG's (Territorial Gangsters) turf at your own risk.
But might doesn't make right. Just because thugs in D.C. control
military machines, doesn't give them the right to rob and kill us.
 
Are we obliged to obey them, or should we resist evil?
 
Aside from the support of an elite or a few marginal basket cases, are
we better off with the existing system or with competing courts and
defense agents? Such a non-coercive alternative might provide order
and efficient defense against retail criminals without giving wholesale
power to a centralized gang of political tyrants.
