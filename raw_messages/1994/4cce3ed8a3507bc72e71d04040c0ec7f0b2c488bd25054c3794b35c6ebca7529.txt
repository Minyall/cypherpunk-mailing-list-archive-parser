One reasonable solution to abuse is to block the use of remailers by
potential abusers. Julf does this with his system. Remember this is
distinct from censorship -- you are not telling someone "you can't use
any system", you are telling them "you can't use my hardware to do
what you want; find someone else's hardware".
