Page 545 of Knuth's "Seminumerical Algorithms" gives a method of finding
the square root modulo a prime. It is efficient but non-trivial to program.
Incidently its worst case running time is as big as the number (actually
bigger) but its expected time is something like (nog n)^2.

My most recent errata list for Applied Cryptography does not amend page
289. I will mail you that list if you don't have it.
