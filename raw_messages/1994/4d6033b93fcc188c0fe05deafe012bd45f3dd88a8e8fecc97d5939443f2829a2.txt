Afabbro quotes someone in Finland saying, re anon.penet.fi:
>   Some users have flooded the server with hundreds and hundreds of messages.

I wonder if this could be a concerted denial-of-service attack.  Julf's
remailer has had the highest profile of any, and he certainly has his share
of enemies.  Maybe somebody figured it was easy to shove a few thousand
messages a day his way.  This makes the server slower and less convenient for
others to use, as well as putting an extra load on the trans-Atlantic links
just for anonymous messages.  It also could cost someone some money which
could be blamed on Penet.  This could be an attractive strategy for an enemy
of anonymity.
