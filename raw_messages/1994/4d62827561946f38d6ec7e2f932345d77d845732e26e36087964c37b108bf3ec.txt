A report I saw on this said the concern about the "human voice" giving
the news, especially if positive for HIV, was psychological. That is,
that HIV-positive folks would not like hearing this from a recording,
and might do something serious to themselves.

I applaud the "unconditionally untraceable" nature of the test (pay
cash for the kit, call from a payphone). Ideas like this are _good_
for society, and for us.
