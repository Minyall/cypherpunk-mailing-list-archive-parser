ONLINE FRAUD CASE SETTLED
Chase Consulting has agreed to reimburse customers who paid it
$99 for a credit repair program advertised over American Online.
The Federal Trade Commission chairman says: "The commission wants
to make it clear that advertisers on the information superhighway
will be held to the same standards as advertisers in other
media." The case represents the FTC's first legal effort to
prosecute online fraud. (Wall Street Journal 11/17/94 A4)
