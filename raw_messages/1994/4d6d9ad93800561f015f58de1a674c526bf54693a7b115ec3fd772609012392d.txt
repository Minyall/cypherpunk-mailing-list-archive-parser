Uh... I, of course, am a bona fide citizen. Was just about to announce
my new server in Frankfurt, Arkansas. But as I am having minor problems
with my system, my e-mail address currently *appears* to be in Finland.
But rest assured all stuff automatically gets rerouted to AK, and doesn't
go outside the states. By the way, do you know any service providers who
accept payments for Internet connections in rubles, caviar and vodka?
And any hints on nice real estate in the caribbean.

Oh yes,  ;-) ;-) ;-)
