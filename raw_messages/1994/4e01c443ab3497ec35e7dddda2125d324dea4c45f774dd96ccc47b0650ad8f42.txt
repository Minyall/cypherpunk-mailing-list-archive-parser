Way overkill. Remember that 2000 is not just twice as hard as 1000 --
even breakthroughs that improved factoring speed by factors of
thousands couldn't break 2000 bit keys any century soon, if ever. I'd
worry more about my key management -- before putting in even the
effort to crack a 1500 bit key they are likely to just listen in on
the emmissions from your keyboard and monitor.
