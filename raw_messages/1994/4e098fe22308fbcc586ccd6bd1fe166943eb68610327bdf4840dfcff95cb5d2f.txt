  Perhaps you just don't understand how headers work.

  Often times, the machine which originats a message puts a header 
  in that says it "recieved" it *despite* the fact that the message 
  was originated on that machine.  This happens (I believe) because
  the mail agent submits the message to sendmail for sending.  This
  causes sendmail to tag it as "recieved" despite its origin on that
  machine.

  Or, more likely, there was never a problem at pizzabox.demon.co.uk
  and the message is either not forged or the forger submitted it 
  through another mechanism.
