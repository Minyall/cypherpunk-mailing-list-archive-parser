I don't know about that, but I do know that the building is completely
TEMPEST shielded.  It was custom built for DSD 2-3 years ago, when they
moved to Canberra from Melbourne.

DSD provides both COMSEC and COMPUSEC, and is surprisingly open about
SIGINT too.  I must admit that I have found them to be surprisingly
helpful on most occasions, although they do take security VERY seriously.

Law Enforcement Advisory Committee.  That might have been my mistake,
as I once did miscall them that.

Not much, no.  They're heavily secretive, and my understanding is that
they consist of representatives of the Attorney General's department,
ASIO and the Australian Federal Police.  They were mentioned to me
in passing as one body which might have a lot of interest in controlling
domestic cryptography, and I also understand that they were involved
in the deliberations over the A5/1 and A5/2 decision (which, I am told by
Austel - Telecommunications  watchdog - was quite different to what was
reported on the Internet).  I must admit to finding myself quite irritated
that bodies like the LEAC (which are, after all, advising government on
domestic policy) are so secretive.
