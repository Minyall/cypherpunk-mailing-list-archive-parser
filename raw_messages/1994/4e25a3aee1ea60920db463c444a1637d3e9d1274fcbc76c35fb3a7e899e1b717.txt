I sometimes add them to a temporary keyring (pgp -ka file.asc testring)
and then do pgp -kvc "*" testring so I can see what I'm about to stick in
there.  I didn't bother before somebody or other (was that you, Hal?)
demonstrated that he could change the name on Phil's PGP key, and I didn't
want it polluting my <real> keyring.
