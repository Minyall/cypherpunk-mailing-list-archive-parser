1. Why was the secret service looing for stolen property?

2. This is an urban legend.  There is no "signature" on the output of 
   Canon CLC copiers.

because these copiers are so maintenance-intensive, and since Canon 
*owns* most of the CLC dealers, it would be very easy for them to check 
their s/n records when they are servicing the equipment (which needs to 
be done when the devices are moved)!

pretty exciting, huh?
