While thinking about this whole superbill thing forcing people to digital
cash I wondered about the bank that sandy et al are constructing.

Are you guys going to simply represent dollars with your digital cash
or will you attempt to create your own currency that may simply be
converted to/from dollars?

I think it should not be digital dollars.

I'd like a 250 Mhz 128 bit hybrid processor with 64 meg of 8 way interleaved
memory, a 10 megabyte per second i/o channel, two 3 gig hard disks, two dat
drives with compression, and a large diet coke.
