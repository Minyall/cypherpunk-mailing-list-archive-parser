Bear in mind that OJ himself placed a call to 911.  You sort of expect
to lose some of your privacy when you do that.

As everyone knows, when you call 911 from a landline telephone your
phone number and address are automatically displayed on the
dispatcher's console. As strongly pro-privacy as I am, I'd find it
hard to argue against this particular feature. If I called 911 in an
emergency, I'd *want* my address to show up. Especially if I was too
panicked or sick or whatever to give it over the phone.

What I don't know, and am trying to find out, is whether there are any
comparable features in the LA/Orange cellular and 911 systems that
would have displayed the caller's cell site to the 911 dispatcher, or
whether some ad-hoc telephone company help was required.

But however it was done, it worked. This does tend to undermine the
FBI's claim that they can't catch crooks using cell phone systems...
