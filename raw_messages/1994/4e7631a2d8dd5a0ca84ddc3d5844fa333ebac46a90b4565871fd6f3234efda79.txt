I see no reason to expect such a approach to work.

I understand what you are saying, what I am saying is that factoring is
not an issue. I am not factoring anything.

see comment above comment above relating to factoring...

Perry, I have been using neural networks in both software and hardware
for several years now. I am well aware of what they can and can't do.
Could we please get off this personal attack shit?....

I am interested in discussing a particular idea that I had relating to
RSA and comparing keys, not what your personal opinion of me or my idea
is. If you don't like it how about not responding to any of my posts or
putting me in your kill file....

Ad hominim attacks reflect more on  you than me...

Perry, see the above comments.
