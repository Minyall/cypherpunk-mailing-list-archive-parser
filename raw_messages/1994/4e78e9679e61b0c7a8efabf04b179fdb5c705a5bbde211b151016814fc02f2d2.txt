   Why should I trust them at all? Why should I willingy become an
   occomplice in any of their activities? I don't [want?] anyone,
   including me, being able to figure out what is going on. But more
   importantly you seem to assume that these pair of communicators are
   not trying to determine something about me with their traffice.

So you're trying to prevent the users from finding something out about
you?  What, exactly?  Trying to understand the issue here.

   By encrypting the outgoing the reciever is
   shure that it came from my re-mailer and not somebody else.

If you encrypt it with the remailer's private key, yeah.  I thought
you were saying earlier that you'd encrypt the outgoing messages with
the recipient's public key.  Did I misunderstand?
