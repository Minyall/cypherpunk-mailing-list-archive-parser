Existing physical theories show that Super Turing machines are possible
in principle though very difficult to build in practice.

Such machines will probably not be able to solve NP complete
problems though they will be able to solve some NP problems
such as factoring.

Since such machines do not operate algorithmically, they have
no relevance to the question of whether P=NP, because this
question is a question about *algorithms*.
