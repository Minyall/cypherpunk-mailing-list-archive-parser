Take the Red Line from Union station to Metro Center.
At Metro Center, take the exit that leads up into Woodward & Lothrop's.
Enter through the W&L deli, and bear left. 

Take escalators up to Washington Center atrium.
Bear right to doors into Washington center (if you're in the Hyatt, you
didn't bear right enough).
Enter the lobby (reception desk is to your left, bank of elevators
is straight ahead, and hallway takes 45 degree angle to your right).
Follow the hallway to your right. At its end is a second bank
of elevators. Take those elevators to the ninth floor.
When you get off on the ninth floor, go straight ahead past
the two receptionist stations, then bear left down a white hallway until
you come to a short staircase. Take the stairs down one flight.

You're at EFF.
