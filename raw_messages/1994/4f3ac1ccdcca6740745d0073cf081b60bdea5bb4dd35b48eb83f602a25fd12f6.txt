Because if *your* key really generates the LEAF, then they have your
ID in the LEAF, no matter if it is sent properly or not.  They might
not be able to decrypt the communications, but they still get your ID.

If you randomly generate a LEAF that works, odds are that the
decrypted value will not be your ID.  (If you could consistently
choose random blocks such that your ID appears when it is decrypted, I
would say that you have found a hole in Skipjack :-)
