I just did a diff -r between the Kerberos V telnet/telnetd/libtelnet
and the 4.4BSD version.  From 1.5 MB of source code I get 40KB of diffs.
In my book a 2% difference qualifies as basically identical.  Plus 90%
of the diffs were memcpy/bcopy changes.

I know there are nice hooks in the code for adding new encryption
and authentication modules.  I know it would be relatively easy to
add IDEA and DH.  That's why I'm asking whether anyone has already
done it.  Do you get it this time, or should I go for four?

Perry, why don't you let someone else reply this time?
