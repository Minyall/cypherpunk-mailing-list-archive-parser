    subject: BC CLIPPER CHIP RETREAT
    title: ADMINISTRATION REVERSES ITSLEF ON WIRETAPPING TECHNOLOGY
    author:  JOHN MARKOFF
    text: 

	   In an abrupt and significant reversal, the Clinton
    administration indicated Wednesday that it was willing to consider
    alternatives to its Clipper chip wiretapping technology, which has
    been widely criticized by industry executives and privacy-rights
    groups.

    ...

I'll leave it to someone else to post the entire article, but the gist
is that Gore sent a letter to Maria Cantwell saying that the
administration is willing to consider alternatives to Clipper that are
based upon nonclassified algrithms, and where the escrow agents are
not government agencies.  They still insist on an escrow system,
however.

There's a quote from Marc Rotenberg saying that the escorw requirement
is still unacceptable.
