true.

What does that have to do with the above?

Are you trying to say that things have to be digital to have noise 
imunity?  If so, you are totally wrong.  Examples abound from analog 
elctronics specifically transmission.

Sure, I never said otherwise, just that it is conceivable that some 
continum phenomina can't be described algorithmicly AT ALL.

Hmmm, argument by plutonium?  Try again.
