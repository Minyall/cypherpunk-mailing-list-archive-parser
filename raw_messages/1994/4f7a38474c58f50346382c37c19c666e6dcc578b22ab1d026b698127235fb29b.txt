A brief suggestion:  Code the progression, not the four values.  As
 time goes on (and lossy sendmails disappear), people are sending larger
 and larger messages;  it's easily conceivable that people could be
 swapping multiMB files at some point in the not too distant future
 (indeed, I do occasionally send out files that are 4-5 MB large,
 uuencoded binaries and tar files).

No point in limiting future behavior due to current usage.
