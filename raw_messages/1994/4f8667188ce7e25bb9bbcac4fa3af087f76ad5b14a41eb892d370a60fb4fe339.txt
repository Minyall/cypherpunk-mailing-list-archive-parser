     Agreed. A few people on this list have mailed me privately (thanx for
the discretion, guys!) and told me my Subject: headers were coming up as
(None). All mailing lists are gated to local newsgroups here at Eternal.
As a result, my newsreader doesn't seem to like maintaining subject
headers on mailing list mail. It's a known bug... *sigh*

     "Ok," you ask,"...what's the point?" The point is this: If I can take
the time to manually change the subject, working around an annoying bug in
my software (it'll be fixed literally RSN, BTW), everyone else can take
the time to do it right. :-)

     Agreed. Since I can't preserve the subject heading as a result of
aforementioned cyber-roach (hey, I _like_ that term!), I _have_ to make up
creative titles. So can all of you. You've shown you're smart, and by
being a 'punk, you've shown you care about privacy, crypto, and all that
other good stuff. Don't skimp on subjects. :-)

     Agreed, again. Perhaps we should change "policy" to dictate that only
members of the organization in question should forward "infograms" to the
list. Forwarded Usenet posts should be pointered and perhaps summarized.
Beyond that is wasted traffic, IMHO.

     Do you mean to imply that "Everything" and "Yes" aren't good enough
answers from 500-600 people? :-)
