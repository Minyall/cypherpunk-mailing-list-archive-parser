There are basicly two remailers at vox.hacktic.nl :

- -> a cypherpunx-style remailer with three adresses
        -) nobody
        -) remail
        -) remailer
        
- -> a anon mail back ID remailer
        -) anon
       

Sometimes you may find it conveniant to have te ability to receive
mail, but to remain anonymous for the sender. anon@vox.hacktic.nl
gives you that ability.

Here is some info:

{step 1}
send some mail to ping@vox.hacktic.nl to receive a pong and an account
ie. an0@vox.hacktic.nl

{step 2}
send your first message to anon@vox.hacktic.nl, the commands for 
remailingare similair to the cypherpunx-remailers, the only differance 
will be the sender.
 
If you send mail to remail@vox.hacktic.nl, the name that will appear in 
the FROM: line is nobody@vox.hacktic.nl. 

If you send mail to anon@vox.hacktic.nl the corresponding entry for the
adress that is sending the mail will be in the FROM: line, 
ie an0@vox.hacktic.nl so someone can contact you by sending mail to 
an0@vox.hacktic.nl. 

This mail will not be anonymised, you -will- know the sender. If you 
- -as a sender- want to remain anonymous send the mail trough a remailer
or aquire a anon account at vox.hacktic.nl and send the mail using the
anon@vox.hacktic.nl remailer.

{step 3}
make -absolutily positively- sure the header pasting tokens [::] are
the first thing you type, if you start with a blanc line, your remail
request -will- fail.

Hope this helps.
