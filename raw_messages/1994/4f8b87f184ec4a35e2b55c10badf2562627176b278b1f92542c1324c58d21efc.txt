    I think it was a high-level court ruling that essentially said
    it's perfectly ok to intentionally structure cash transfers to
    avoid the $10,000 reporting requirement.  That's all I recall.

No.  What was at issue was whether the prosecution was required and/or
able to demonstrate the defendant's intent to circumvent the reporting
requirements.  If the defendant had admitted such an intent, there
would not have been a case.
