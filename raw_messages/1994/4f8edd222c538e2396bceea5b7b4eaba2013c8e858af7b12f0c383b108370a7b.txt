   The problem comes that a natural term to use to describe this feature would
   be "key escrow".  However, the gov't has soiled that term.  Now, I need a
   new term, hopefully true to the language to describe a feature like this
   without calling up images of GAK.

"Remote Backup" seems to be OK.  Certainly backing up data is a
perfectly respectable thing.  Private keys are just more data.
