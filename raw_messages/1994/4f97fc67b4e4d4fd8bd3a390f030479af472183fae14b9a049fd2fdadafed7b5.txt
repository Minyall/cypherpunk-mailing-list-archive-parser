The May 16th newsweek has an article on comparing women and men is 
cyberspace.  It's blatantly biased, portraying men as sex-starved, 
war-mongering, unsensitive geeks, and women as the perfect example of 
what society should REALLY be.

I'm growing tired of these sensationalist articles in the popular press, 
that serve to only alienate the denizens of cyberspace and scare off the 
civilians.
