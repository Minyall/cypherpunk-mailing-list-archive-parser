By the way, just so everyone knows, I understand (based on a
conversation with Steve Kent, who should be a reliable source for
this) that Microsoft is one of the suppliers to the upcoming DMS, or

that Microsoft and several other firms are going to be the largest
purveyors of escrowed software in the world.
