In all of these cases there is a serious attempt to make sure that the
workers are not harmed by the dangerous substances involved.  I must
say that the phrase "impressive body burdens" is fairly incomprehensible.
But nevertheless, my point stands: workers are carefully protected from
the plutonium and U235 in nuclear weapons plants.  When their radiation
badges show what is considered a high level dose, this does not mean
that they have been exposed to anything like, say, the radiation from
a kilo of unshielded plutonium.

If radioactive substances are used as weapons, the intention will be
to do the maximum possible damage.  I don't think that anyone would
survive for long after exposure to, say, a suspension of plutonium
in air designed to be breathed in, perhaps as an aerosol.

To repeat my point: you say that statistical studies of workers in
nuclear weapons plants which are specifically designed to minimize
the effects of radiation show that radiation has done little harm.
Well, I should hope so.

On the other hand I say that such studies are poor criteria for
judging the effects of radiation intended to do the maximum possible
harm.  I think that this is really indisputable.
