All this bullshit doesnot state that a court order is required, rather
'legal authorization', which means the NSA for foreign intellingence
purposes without a court order.

Perhaps what is needed is statuatory protection to prevent the NSA
from eavesdropping on U.S. Citizens, communicating domestically,
without a court order.
