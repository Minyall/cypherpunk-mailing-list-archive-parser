For the record -- 1 year probation, 400 hrs community service, large
fine ($10K if I recall right.) *NO* actual jail time... it wasn't at
all clear that the vendors weren't guilty too :-)

Crypto relevance? Well, he *did* keep his files encrypted -- but they
got them in cleartext from backups that ran during times he was
working on them -- ie, human error :-) It wouldn't have helped him to
use PGP. Oh, and all the strings in the program were encrypted with
"XOR 0x81", not all that hard to crack.
