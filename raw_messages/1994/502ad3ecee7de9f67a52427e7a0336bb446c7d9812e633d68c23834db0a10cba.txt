Sandy,

I'd love to take part in a list for discussing practical ways of
assuring privacy.  I've been doing it myself for years.  How about
asking Robert Hayden to start up a specific mailing list for it?
(Some name like 'obfusc', for obfuscating database entries etc...?)
- description: 'discussions of practical real-life ways of improving
personal privacy.'

Also, you tend to mention things in dribs and drabs... in fact, didn't
you do a sort of mini privacy-101 some years ago by posting little
snippets of advice in your .sig file every post?  Do you have
any collected files with _lots_ of this stuff in it already that we
could read?

G
PS Robert, did you say you could run anonymous mailing lists or was
that someone else?  This might be a good list to kick off as an
anon list, just on principle...
