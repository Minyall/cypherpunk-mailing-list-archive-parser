I have an activist friend in SF (Mission Street Area) who needs help to set 
up email in a safe, good way. He can receive mail in, but has trouble sending 
out. He needs help in determining if there are bugs and also to create 
privacy. He doesn't have a lot of computer experience. Any suggestions/help 
would be greatly appreciated. If you email me and get no response until 
Thursday, it is because I'm out of the office and will not be able to read my 
mail until my return.
Thanks,
Mara
