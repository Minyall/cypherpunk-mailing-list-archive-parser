But this trick was said to work in Portugal sometime between the wars.
Some counterfeiters got access to the printing devices used by the
Waterlow Bank in London, the official printers of Portugese money at
the time. The Portugese economy, obviously in need of more money on the
market, prospered. (Source: verbally from a certain Mr Waterlow, grandson
of the betrayed banker, Rome 1972.)
