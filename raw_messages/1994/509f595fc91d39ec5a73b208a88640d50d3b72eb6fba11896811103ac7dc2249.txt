Yah.

I've wondered about this myself;  If one goes through the Federalist
 Papers, all the arguments made for the formation of the Republic are
 obselete (unless you believe Canada or Mexica is a real threat: I
 don't).

Many of the SF writers forecast a future where something big has grown
 out of the US to be first some sort of western (or northern) hemisphere
 giant, and then futher.  I think this is way off the mark.

I have great hopes for computer networking as a technology: There are
 those who don't realize or who deny that the social impact of this
 technology will be huge: they probably would have said that the printing
 press wouldn't have a large impact, either.
