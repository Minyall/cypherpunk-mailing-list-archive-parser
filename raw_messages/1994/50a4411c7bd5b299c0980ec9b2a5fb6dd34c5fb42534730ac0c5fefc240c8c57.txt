Start out simple, just try something like a blackjack game (good
choice since the house strategy follows simple rules) over a
network.

The house shuffles, bit commits to the shuffle, and sends you the
hash.  Then, you can begin playing, or you can try to break the system
by finding a deck with a matching hash.  After you are done, the
casino sends you the deck and you can verify that you weren't cheated.

All sorts of other stuff can be added later, like digital cash, etc.
