  Thanks to all who came to the virtual meeting.  I was very pleased with 
the whole affair -- lots of good discussion, and not as much pandemonium 
in the large meeting hall as I had feared.  The big meeting worked well 
enough to warrant another attempt, as long as it is facilitated  by 
someone deft and polite at the controls, as Teknotroll was last 
Wednesday.  But I feel that smaller  groups -- 2-10 -- work better. 
Perhaps, as Robert Hayden suggests, a sequence of time-certain meetings 
on different topics would be one way to go.
  I also want to thank the folks for their constructive suggestions. As 
several people pointed out, MOOing is a much better experience with 
clients.  The good news is that, once anyone compiles a client on a site, 
he/she can put it in the public bin, and anyone else can use it by setting 
the proper path in the their .login file. 
  Anyone who likes can write to blast@crl.com for a permanent character 
at BayMOO.  
  I hope we can stage another such gathering at BayMOO. It would be worth 
a collective mull to consider whether a MOO is a robust enough 
environment for digital cash and other financial transactions.
