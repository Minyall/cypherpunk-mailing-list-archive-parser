i'd like to know where i can find dr. dobbs.  i came up with a lot of stuff
(52 hits actually) using gopher but i'd prefer some sort of mailing list or
even better, a WWW page for it.  of course, if there is a std ftp site i'd go
for that as well.  basically, i'm easy to please.  i just want to read the
crypto articles mention by bruce.

life, you see, is not meant to be enjoyed.
