If I understand you correctly, your asserting that without _any_ prior
knowledge of the person you are communicating to, and without any form
of online checks before or during your authentication mechanism, that
you can be _sure_ you're talking to said stranger ? 

Unless there are other presumptions, I fail to see how you can be sure 
you are communicating to someone, when you don't know who they are. 
Even if you can get something akin to a pgp key with an identifier and 
be sure you are taking to the owner of _that_ identifier, but you can't 
be sure that identifier is real and/or not a forgery.

Given those circumstances, wouldn't a man in the middle relay attack be
a piece of cake ? 

Matthew.
