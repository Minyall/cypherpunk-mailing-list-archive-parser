Unicorn asked about the new MacPGP. Unicorn should ask Tim May,
who has had a copy for three days now. Or Eric Hollander who
has  had it 5 days. Or Eric Hughes who's  had it two days. Who
the fuck do I have to send this thing to to get  it  released
and mentioned? I'm done. They've got it, well the source at
least. The program, MacPGP2.3aV1.1 has been out for months.

I too have had a copy for quite some time, closely isolated
in a closed partition.

I just wanted to know that it was indeed now sourced....
