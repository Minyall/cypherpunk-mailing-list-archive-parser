Although it does seem that the government ought to be able to track
remailer traffic, is there any evidence that they are actually doing it in
the real world?  I've seen posts on usenet which would have presumably 
provoked a reaction from police, but I can't remember hearing of any 
cases in which such surveilance occured.
