From PC WEEK, Nov 21, 1994, a summary:

Bill Gates demonstrated an HTML browser/editor for MS Word 6.0. It is
called Internet Assistant. It just entered beta testing, and will be
available under the "What's New" heading of the Microsoft Home Page by
the end of December, and later it will come with the 32-bit version of
Word for WIN95. It will also include a viewer which will "display any
Word document distributed across a network."

I've read that the PGP code is not highly modular, but this is just one
more indication of an OLE document centric universal editor based loosely on
Word. I could eventually see their mail product calling most of the same
code. Has anyone considered OLE compliant PGP encrypter/decrypter objects
that would act on the contents of the document? A tool on this platform
could be the most rapid path to widespread use of encryption. Almost
everyone is able to use Word, and it comes bundled with a *lot* of new
computers. And if it is OLE compliant, it can drop inside of your favorite
OLE aware application.
