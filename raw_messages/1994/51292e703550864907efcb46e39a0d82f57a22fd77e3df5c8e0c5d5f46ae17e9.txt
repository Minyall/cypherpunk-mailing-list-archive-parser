  Using a remailer daemon on a well-known port (777, anyone?) would only
  result in defeating logging that is done via SMTP-agents like sendmail.
  It is still possible for the sysadmin on the host to do a TCP-wrapper
  log which logs the connection to the remailer from the originator.
  Again, this only provides IP address information, which makes it easy
  to hide if the originator comes from a machine like netcom or the well.

  Yes... also the remailer daemon could do opt-in monitoring of both ends
  of it's connections... Full accountability could be possible, but only
  with the complicity of everyone in the path...
