 It would seem we are missing a point about having National I.D.
cards. The rest of the world seems ready to rush in and adopt some
form of "Clipper" chips to monitor their own citizens. (There doing
it in the U.S.!) Do we really doubt they will adopt "The Card" as
well? (don't leave home without it!)

Step 2: International I.D. Cards......

 Can you say "New World Order?" Sure you can.......
