Well, it would make tracing FTP difficult, altho, at least intially,
some FTP maintainers might try to block known IP rerouters.  Of course,
if such rerouters became commonplace, it would eliminate that problem.

I think the real problem is hardware costs and availiablity.  Running a
remailer is cheap and easy (for some people).  However, running a decent
IP rerouter would require your own internet node, supported by at least
a 56K connection, if not a T1.  Very few people own or have access to
that kind of hardware.

Does anyone how much it costs to get a continuous 56K internet
connection?  What about a T1?  How easy is it to get and set up?
