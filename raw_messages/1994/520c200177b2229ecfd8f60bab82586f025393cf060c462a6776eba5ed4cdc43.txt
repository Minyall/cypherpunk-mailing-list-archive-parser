I'm new at both remailing and PGP, but having read the Cyphernomicon
(OK, skimmed it) and various other FAQs, I haven't seen this issue
addressed:

I've created a pseudonym and a PGP key pair for that pseudonym.  Now,
how do I secure signatures for my public key, given the fact that (a)
to sign it, you should be sure that it really belongs to me, and (b) I
have no intention of revealing who "me" actually is?  You can't call me
on the phone, or meet me face to face, or do any of those other
standard practices for confirming the key before signing it.  But I
sure don't want to use an unsigned, untrusted public key, since I want
to make and keep a reputation and I can't risk someone spoofing my
public key.
