	They also license Sun, who cut the modulus too low for 'secure
RPC.'  This allowed Brian LaMacchia and Andrew M. Odlyzko to
crytpanalyze secure RPC.

	Paying RSA money does not magically create a secure system for
you.  It merely licenses their patents, which can be a very solid base
on which to build.

Politics.  From the greek "poly," meaning many, and ticks, a small,
annoying bloodsucker.
