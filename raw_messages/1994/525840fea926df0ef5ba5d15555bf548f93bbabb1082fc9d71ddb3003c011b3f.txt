I've seen before, and if I breakdown and write my own software I'm
going to improve on, mailing list software that refuses to send
messages to the list that look suspicious.  Rules like:

<3 lines non-blank body, occurance of remove, me, unsubscribe, help,
subscribe, etc.

These generate a message giving details, and of course you could even
guess what the person wanted.

Looks like a necessary evolution in net software...

I typically try reasonable auto commands for a new mailing list until
I know there's a person there.
