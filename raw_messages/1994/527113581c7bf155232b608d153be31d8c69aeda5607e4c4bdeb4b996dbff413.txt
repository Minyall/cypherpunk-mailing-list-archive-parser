Eric Hughes says:  "It's a fine idea, except there's no way such a group can 
claim to represent cypherpunks at large."  

True enough -- my idea would be to say that our group is composed of folks who
happen to be Cypherpunks subscribers.  I agree that claiming to represent an
anarchy is illogical and, well, an outright untruth.
