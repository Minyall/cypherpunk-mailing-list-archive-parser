Is this a real letter? If so, where did it appear? (I don't doubt the
possibility of Almost-Supremee Judge Bork having written this, but the
absence of "when and where" undermines its credibility a bit, for me
at least.)

I agree with the sentiments, and, in fact, Cypherpunks at the Mountain
View meetings cover a range of political views and yet we mostly are
in full agreement that crypto should be unregulated.
