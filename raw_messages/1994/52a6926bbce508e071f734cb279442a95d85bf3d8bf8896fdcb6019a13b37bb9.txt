It may be too late for the East Coasters, but tonight's McNeil-Lehrer
Newshour devotes 30 minutes to the just-released book, "Special
Tasks," by Sudaplatov.

Sudaplatov was effectively head of SMERSH, which many people think was
Ian Fleming's fabrication...it was real, meaining "Death to Spies."
Soviet MVD Counterintelligence. His actual title was head of Special
Tasks, responsible for spy rings in the U.S. and Germany,
assassination of people, etc.

Important stuff! Revelations about Oppeheimer, Fermi, Bohr, and Gamov
giving assistance to the Soviets, about the death of Trotsky, and
about the sabotage of U.S. military bases.

I happened to be reading the book today in a local bookshop, and when
I got hope Harry Bartholomew, of our list, had left a message alerting
me to the McNeil-Lehrer report.

Check it out tonight, if you can. Consult your local listings. Many
stations air it at 10, others at 11 (the late airings, that is).
