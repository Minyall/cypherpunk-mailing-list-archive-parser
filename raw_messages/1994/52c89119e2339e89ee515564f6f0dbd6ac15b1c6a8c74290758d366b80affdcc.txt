SSL allows a number of choices for both algorithm and key size.
See http://home.mcom.com/info/SSL.html.

The version of Netscape you can pick up from our FTP server only
implements 40-bit RC4 -- the 40-bit part resulting from standard export
restrictions.  We have implemented and will be shipping clients and
servers with 128-bit RC4 and other configurations.
