It's something of a tribute to the success of the Cypherpunks list
that so much of the discussion about RC4 is happening here, rather
than on sci.crypt.

However, if we want the source code to get published, the discussion
probably needs to to at least be echoed in sci.crypt and similar
public fora/forums^H^H^H^H^H places.

A journalist I know has expressed frustration that more of the RC4
discussion is not going on a more public place.
