Bearer bonds are not illegal in the US.

Under the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), any
interest payments made on *new* issues of domestic bearer bonds are not
deductible as an ordinary and necessary business expense so none have been
issued since then.  At the same time, the Feds administratively stopped
issuing treasury securities in bearer form.  Old issues of government and
corporate debt in bearer form still exist and will exist and trade for 30 or
more years after 1982.  Additionally, US residents can legally buy foreign
bearer securities.
