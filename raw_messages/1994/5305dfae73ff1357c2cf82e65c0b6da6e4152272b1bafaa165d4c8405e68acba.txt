Could one set up a virtual remailer that floated around a set of news 
groups? The active remailer would pass an encrypted token to a randomly
chosen member of the set which would become the remailer for the next
interval. A compromized member of the set might then eat the token,
rendering th remailer inoperative, but maybe that could be overcome.
Although I don't have much more than a layman's grasp of cryptography
my basic thought is to consider the set of potential mailers the way
one would consider some known element in a cryptographic scheme, such
as a randomly accessed lookup table, so that if a cracker couldn't
determine the next element in the table, she couldn't determine where
the remailer would be next, either.
