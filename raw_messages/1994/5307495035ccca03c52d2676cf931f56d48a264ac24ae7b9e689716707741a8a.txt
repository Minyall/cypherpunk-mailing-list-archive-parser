I agree.

Cypherpunk, as I always understood it, was derived from the term 
'cyberpunk', which is the name of a genre of fiction dealing with 
corporate and governmental oppressive societies, where the life and 
liberties of the normal lowlife doesn't mean jack shit and the laws are 
controlled not by the people, but by those with money or power (and often 
both).  

Cypher was an interesting play on words to describe this fight.

Somehow, it seems far more appropriate than 'cryptorebel', which sounds a 
whole lot like new-age PC crap designed to make us sound more appetizing 
to the popular media.
