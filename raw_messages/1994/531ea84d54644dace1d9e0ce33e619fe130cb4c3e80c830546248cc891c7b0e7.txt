A more serious problem with the name "cryptorebel", which did not
immediately occur to me, is that crypto-whatever generally means "someone
who denies being a 'whatever' but, in fact, is one".

In the words of Inigo Montoya, "You keep using that word, but I don't think
it means what _you_ think it does".
