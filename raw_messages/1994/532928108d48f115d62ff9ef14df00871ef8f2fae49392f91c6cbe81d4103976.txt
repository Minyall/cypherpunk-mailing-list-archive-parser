I can't speak for the rest of the rant-viewers, but I don't think that's 
the real Detweiler. In fact, the guy is (almost) denying that he is the 
real Detweiler anyway. I'm sure csn.org has been flooded with complaints. 
I really don't know, though, if the messages originated at csn.org or 
not. I never checked the headers, as I know the account exists.
