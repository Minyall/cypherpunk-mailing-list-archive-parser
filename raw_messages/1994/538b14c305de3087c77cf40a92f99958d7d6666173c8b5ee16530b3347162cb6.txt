This paper was prepared for the conference ``Public Access
to the Internet,'' JFK School of Government, May 26--27 , 1993.  We
describe some of the technology and costs relevant to pricing access
to and usage of the Internet, and discuss the components of an
efficient pricing structure.  We suggest a possible smart-market
mechanism for pricing traffic on the Internet.
