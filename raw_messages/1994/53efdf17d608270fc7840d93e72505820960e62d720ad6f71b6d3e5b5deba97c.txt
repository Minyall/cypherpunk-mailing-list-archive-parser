Usenet copyrightable? I still doubt it. Of course, the only way to 
find out is to file a very expensive lawsuit. Most posters would not find 
their postings worth the expense to sue on copyright. Only a very rich 
dilletante, or someone less rich who is a fanatic on the subject is 
likely to do so.  Also, you would have a hard time answering the 
difference between charging for a usenet feed and charging for a cd-rom, 
again I see little difference except that one is more prompt in time than 
the other. But, again, my newsfeed from a BBS which might be 24 hrs 
delayed, and my netcom account which is much faster and a cd-rom differs 
only as to time removed from the original posting.
