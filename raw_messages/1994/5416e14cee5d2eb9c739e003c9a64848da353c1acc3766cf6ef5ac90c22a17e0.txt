Subject: the hh remailer on soda
Message-ID: <9404080017.AA11450@cicada.berkeley.edu>

the remailer, hh@soda.berkeley.edu, has moved slightly, and is now
remailer@soda.berkeley.edu.  everything will work the same way, and an alias
pointing from hh to remailer will exist indefinitely.

expect another change some time in a few months:  soda itself will move from
soda.berkeley.edu to soda.csua.berkeley.edu, and the remailer will move to
another machine, perhaps ftp.csua.berkeley.edu or something like that.

personal mail to me on soda can be sent to cat@soda.  a note to list
maintainers: please leave me on the cypherpunks list as hh@soda, not
cat@soda.

i would like to thank ERic (melhaff@soda) and matt (seidl@soda) and the rest
of the soda staff and the csua for creating the dedicated remailer account
and for being supportive of the remailer project.

as an aside, i am actively working on an encrypted alias remailer, which is
currently in testing, and will come on line for public use soon.
