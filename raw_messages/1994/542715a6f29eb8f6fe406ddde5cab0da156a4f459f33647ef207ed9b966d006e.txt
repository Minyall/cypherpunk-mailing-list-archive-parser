Those wishing perhaps the ultimate in Cypherpunks ease-of-use
and greatest peace of mind, may find it useful to simply delete
everything that does NOT come from one of the following email
addresses:

tcmay@netcom.com
frissell@panix.com
sandfort@crl.com

Additionally, you'll probably want to let through posts from
Hal Finney, Eric Hughes, and Bruce Schneier, but I forgot
their addresses off-hand and am much too lazy to look them up. :)

If you're using the "ELM" mailer, you can do this by creating a
file called filter-rules in your .elm directory, containing the
following text (more or less):

if (from contains "sandfort") then save "~/cypher"
if (from contains "frissell") then save "~/cypher"
if (from contains "tcmay") then save "~/cypher"
if (to contains "cypherpunks") then delete

Add additional addresses as needed, but be careful of excessive
alliteration.
