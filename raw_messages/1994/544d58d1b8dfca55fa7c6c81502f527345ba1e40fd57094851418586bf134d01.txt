It seems strange that people would be expected to trust a key to sign 
other keys, just because somebody (even Derek, whom I have a measure of 
respect for) asked them to. I trust a key to be an introducer if and when 
I am sure that a signature by that key means that the signed key belongs 
to the identity (be it "real" or a 'nym) it claims to represent. 
Authentication via Kerbie may or may not indicate this. Such a signature 
would give some information that I might use to make decisions on whether 
or not to trust the new key, but it certainly would not be trusted if it 
was the only signature. 

Happy Hunting, -Chris.
