Why should a couple of dozen people who scream because they don't get 
exactly what they want dictate to a list that is 700 long?

Lump me in where you feel justified. That classification and a dollar will
by you a cheap cup of coffee.                

If there was a vociferous return on this I would be much more responsive, but
what I see is the same small group of a dozen or so bitching and bitching and
bitching and bitching....(you get the point)

What is really funny is that they bitch about crypto stuff but seem completely
happy to blather on endlessly about pedophiles, off-shore banking, and a whole
host of other topics that are completely and uterly unrelated to "c-punks
write code".

So far I have recieved no reasoned responces to these issue, a lot of opinion
and emotionaly driven wailing has shown up in my box...
