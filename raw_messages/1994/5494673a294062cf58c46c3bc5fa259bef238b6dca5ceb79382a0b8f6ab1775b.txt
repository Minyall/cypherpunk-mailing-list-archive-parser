 i disagree. how do you know corporal punishment wont be 'appealing'
to the children, so like when they grow up they cant wait to take a 
strap to their kids and so on down the line? strapping is not a solution
to a childs problems, if you cant help a child work out his problems through
verbalization youre a pathetic parent!
