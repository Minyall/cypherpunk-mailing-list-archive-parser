It's too bad that Mosaic used Motif.  If it hadn't I think we would have
seen continued development by the rest of the community.

I'm going to make a point to see how far the tcl/tk folks got with 
their www browser and see if pgp could be grafted onto it.
(Or something along those lines.)  Any interested collaborators?

Note that part of the reason I'm interested is that it looked like
there would eventually be a Windows tk version, which would be
fantastic.  (Just looked: there is a version available for windows,
but not sure if winsock support is there yet.  Also, lots of
widgets would need to be included in the executable to make it
feasible.)

Is there an obvious reason that pgp's normal message encoding method
couldn't be used as the encryption/authentication technique?
