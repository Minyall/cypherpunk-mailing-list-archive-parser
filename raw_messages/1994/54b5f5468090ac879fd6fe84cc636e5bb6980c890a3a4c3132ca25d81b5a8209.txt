And *HE* gave the reason - he wanted go rifling through his girlfriend's
private files.  And here I was, thinking that this list was about "better
privacy through cryptography" - I must have subscribed to alt.2600 by
mistake...  Come to think of it, that's a better place for the original
query...

Read it again - he specifically wanted to sneak into his partner's files;
that is a clear invasion of privacy.  Jeeze - I thought a Yank would have
understood this...

And would you have been just as sympathetic if somebody wanted to rifle
YOUR files?

That has nothing to do with it - person A wanted advice on how to invade
person B's privacy (he presumably doesn't have the guts to just ask her).
Sorry, but privacy works both ways - she's entitled to it just as much
as anybody else.
