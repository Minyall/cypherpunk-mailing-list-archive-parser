No cause for alarm.

The way this works is that the cypherpunks list has members that are
subscribed through anon.penet.fi. If the mailing list sends the message as
you (as opposed to sending it as cypherpunks@toad.com) then it will send a
message from you to the anonymous subscriber. Because of the double-blind
feature of anon.penet.fi this will cause allocation of an ID. Hence if you
send email to this list you're likely to get an ID assigned and receive the
message from anon.penet.fi
