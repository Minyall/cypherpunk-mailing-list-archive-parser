Hi all.
I am not making this up.  In today's Weekend section of the Washington
Post, the Smithsonian has a full page ad for its Campus on the Mall.  Mixed
in with classes called "Ice Cream, Ice Cream:  Food for the Gods" and
"Learning to Love Opera" is the following:

"Intelligence and Cryptology"
"The (Berlin) wall is down and the (Iron) curtain is up.  This course peers
into the world of cryptologic intelligence and information security.  With
tour of the National Cryptologic Museum at Fort Meade.  Cosponsored with
the National Security Agency.
        (Code U323-700)  Wed, 6 pm
        July 6 -- Aug 10 (6 sessions)
        Members $76; Nonmembers $106"

Anyone interested in signing up?
Shari

"In a Time/CNN poll of 1,000 Americans conducted last week by Yankelovich
Partners, two-thirds said it was more important to protect the privacy of
phone calls than to preserve the ability of police to conduct wiretaps.
When informed about the Clipper Chip, 80% said they opposed it."
