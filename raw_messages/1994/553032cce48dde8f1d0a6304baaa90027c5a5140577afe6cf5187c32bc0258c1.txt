You can't find a reference in the library on why you can't build a
machine that cracks DES by repeatedly trying the digitized sound
tracks of porno films, either. Maybe you should try that -- who knows,
it might work.

Ahem. Perhaps you should have kept awake in school. Log base 2 of a
number just means the number of bits in it.

It is very unlikely to me that you can factor a number in time smaller
than you can square it. Thats the point I'm trying to make. Sorry to
burst your bubble. Oh, I'm sure you'll come back with some silly
comment on "what does squaring the number have to do with anything" or
some similar crud.

Oh, god. Neural networks have been invoked. As we know, neural
networks are magical. They are always the answer. After all, we have a
huge number of complex mathematical proofs out there that have been
solved with neural nets -- why, the Reiman Hypothesis was recently
proved by one, wasn't it? Or was that the exact measurement of Dan
Quayle's IQ -- its so easy to confuse them.

I tell you what, Jim. I'll pay you $10,000 if you can come up with an
algorithm that factors numbers or even just breaks RSA in O(log(n))
time or less (where n is the length of the number being factored or
the public key). I'd offer more, but it would be cruel. If you don't
know what the notation O(f(n)) means, please don't come back asking.
