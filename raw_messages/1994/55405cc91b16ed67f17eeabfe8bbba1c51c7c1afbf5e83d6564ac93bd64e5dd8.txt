Well *excuse me* for being clinically thick...

I shouldn't post after more than 20 hours w/out sleep.  You're right, 
of course.  Though the remailer and the mailing list software would
probably require some hacking to make the coupling tighter, in the
process giving both limited-use remailers (probably undesirable in
the generic case, but I can think of special uses) and access-controlled
mailing list software (definitely uses for this, as some exist).

Could you send me what you've done on this?  I think it's a desirable
feature to have, though requiring that people hack their sendmail.cfs
is not a big boost to the "popularity of package" indicator.
