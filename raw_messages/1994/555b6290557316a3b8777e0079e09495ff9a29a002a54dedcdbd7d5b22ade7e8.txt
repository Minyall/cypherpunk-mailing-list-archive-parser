The algorithm that factored RSA129 takes about exp(sqrt((log n)(log log
n))) steps.
Indeed 10^17 instructions is just about how much work was required to
factor RSA129--.
That formula gives about 10^29 for a 1024 bit number. If computers double
in speed every 18 months then they will be only 32 times as fast when the
patents expire.
