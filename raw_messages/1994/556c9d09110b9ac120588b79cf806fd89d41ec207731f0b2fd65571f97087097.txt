No need to shout, we heard you the first time.	;-)

In a system that is carrying continuous traffic, random packet delay
is functionally identical to packet reordering.

If messages are fragmented, random delays on sending packets out is
functionally identical to reordering.

More importantly, RemailerNet as described defeats traffic analysis by
more significant techniques than reordering.  Reordering is a weak
technique.  The introduction of noise, 'MIRV'ing of messages,
fragmentation of messages, random choice of packet routes, and
encyphering of all traffic are stronger techniques.
