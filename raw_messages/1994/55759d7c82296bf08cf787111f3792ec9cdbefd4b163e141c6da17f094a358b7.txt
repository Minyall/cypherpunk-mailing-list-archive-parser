The closest "applicable" definition is not the SOLE definition, it is
only definition 1 in your dictionary, and even then [I won't go into boring
detail] the dictionary meaning is wider than the narrow reading you are
trying to apply to it.

Have you never admired someone so much that that person's displeasure was
a compelling force?

Uh ... you _do_ understand that that is a silly comment, yes?  I was
illustrating some of the common uses of the word.  Linguistic arguments
are best met with linguistic replies, not political bullshit.

Your insistence that there is only one 'true' government in the United
States, and that all other governments are in some sense derivative,
does not agree with my reading of the US Constitution, but this is not
a matter that I, for one, will pursue.

Well, yes, of course.  It has quasi-governmental functions in southern
Italy.
