Congress can, in the way it words a law, specifically make it a
requirement that you knew an act was illegal. However, 99% of the
time, "ignorance is no excuse" holds.

Similarly, on some laws, the requirement of intent to commit the act
is unnecessary. Mens rea is not needed, for example, to be found
guilty of speeding -- you need merely have committed the act
regardless of whether you intended to travel at a particular speed.
