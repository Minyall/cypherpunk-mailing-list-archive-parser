Very well put.

To have someone on the "other side" who (as I hope we all acknowledge)
is quite well-informed about the technology behind the areas of public
policy we're interested in is a rather unique situation.  I consider
it valuable; in a way, it keeps us honest.

Mr. Sternlight, on the other hand, is another story...  (though I was
surprised and delighted by DS's appearance on the other high-volume
mailing list I'm on, the "Chile Heads" digest.  It seems
Mr. Sternlight has a taste for  spicy foods!)
