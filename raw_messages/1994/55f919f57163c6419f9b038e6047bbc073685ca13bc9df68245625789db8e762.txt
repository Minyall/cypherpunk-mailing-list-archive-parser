It's nice to see an intelligent & honest post from you, LD, even if I 
do disagree with you in your attitude and your methods of dealing with 
what you perceive as hypocrisy from the c'punks.

I would like to address the issues which you brought up, but I don't 
want to bother the list with my comments, as I know that many have 
already gone through these too often and you are not satisfied with 
their rebuttals.   Won't you reply to me personally, so that I may 
present a superior argument (mine).
