No need to apologize, Robert.  We all make mistakes.

Well, it is about privacy (all those microphones wouldn't have to just
listen for gunshots) and about empowering the police state.  As I see it,
Cypherpunks aren't primarily interested in crypto as an end, but rather as
a means to an end.  I'll leave the determination of what end(s) we have 
in mind.  Probably, though, they would strongly overlap with concern about 
a police state with ubiquitous microphones, and (doG forbid) automated 
machine guns.

Think about it.
