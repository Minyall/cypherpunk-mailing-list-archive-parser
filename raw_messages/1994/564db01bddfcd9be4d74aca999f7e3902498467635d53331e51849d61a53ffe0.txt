Don't worry about online vs offline transactions.  The credit card
companies are moving toward all online transactions.  A company down
in NJ called RAM Mobile Data is helping them on this.  They have base
stations in 90% of urban business areas.  The radios are fairly cheap
(even though they need an appropriate thing to plug them into) and the
per-transaction charges are about a dime.

So I would say that the important problem to solve is "how do we make
accounts anonymous?" rather than "how do we avoid double-spending?"
