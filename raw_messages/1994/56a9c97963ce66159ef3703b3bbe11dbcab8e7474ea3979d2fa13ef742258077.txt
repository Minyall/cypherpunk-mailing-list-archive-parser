But the word "warrant" appears nowhere in there.  The agencies requesting
the keys aren't required to present a warrant; they're only required to
promise that they're lawfully authorized.  And if they lie the evidence
is still admissible in court and they suffer no penalty.  And what does
"lawfully authorized" really mean?  Depending on what legislation
Congress passes, it could mean no more than "my supervisor approved it".
