   Another thing that occured to me is the thought that if there were
   an organized web or remailers, remailers could bounce messages
   between them automatically-

Yes, that could be done.  Problem is that the NSA's remailer(s) would
immediately deliver messages to the destination.  Get enough NSA
remailers, and the web wouldn't be trustable.  Now, remailers in the
web can and should feel free to randomly forward mail to other
remailers, but it's the sender who should pick the minimum chain
length, and recursively encrypt their own envelopes.
