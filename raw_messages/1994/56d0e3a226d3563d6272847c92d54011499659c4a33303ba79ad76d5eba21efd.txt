Recently someone posted reference to GI (General Instruments) getting
authority to use Clipper chips in descramblers.  One wonders about
motivation on their part.  ITAR already exempts the use of crypto
in video descramblers where the crypto cannot be used for other purposes.

DES is already used in descramblers such as the Video Cypher II, and
can be exported under commodity jurisdiction.  It is unlikely that
anyone is going to spend the money to break DES keys and redistribute
pirate authorization.  The chances of discovery are too large.

So, what is their motivation?
