If we go down the path of worrying about "psychic pain" inflicted on
others, then how can we operate in a world of failed marriages and
relationships, of hurt feelings, and of other such psychic damages?

What about the psychic trauma caused by Clipper?
You could probably make a case for that, in terms of psychological 
warfare, given the current attitudes.
