But wait!  How do we know he's telling us the truth when he says he's
allowed to lie?  I mean, if he's telling the truth, then he might be lying,
and if he's lying then either he's not allowed to lie or the courts have
not confirmed this "right."  On the other hand, if he's lying, then he
might be telling the truth --- Aw, shit.  You can't even trust the FBI
anymore!  ;)
