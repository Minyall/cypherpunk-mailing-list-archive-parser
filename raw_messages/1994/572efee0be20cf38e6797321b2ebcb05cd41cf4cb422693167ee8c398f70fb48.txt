Of course, Perry didn't write that, and the person reading his
messages obviously had an extremely weak understanding of what Perry
had suggested in his messages (which was that if you are giving
something away for free to all comers it is hard to argue economic
damages have occured in "unauthorized" distribution), so it makes
sense that the person replying would be too embarassed to use his own
name.
