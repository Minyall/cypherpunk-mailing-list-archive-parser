So send out a form letter:

   "Thank you for your interest.  At the moment we are not
    seeking beta testers with your kind of hardware.   We
    will contact you when when further news happens.
   "

I have applied three times, and received no response
whatever.

If you cannot manage a form letter, your business is unlikely
to go anywhere.   Sell or lease the patents to someone who
can manage a mailing list.

For answering their mail.  For acting in accordance with their
business plan.  For moving money from point A to point B.

Ninety percent of success is showing up on time.
