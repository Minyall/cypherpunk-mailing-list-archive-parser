Wrong.  Wayne's "1:" explanation is pure Scrooge McDuck thinking.  The
"few" do not "accumulate" capital in the sense Wayne fears (i.e., in
Scrooge McDuck's undergroung vault).  They collect it, spend it, invest
it, deposit it in the bank, whatever;  but it still keeps circulating.  If
anything, such activity expands the money supply. 

I'm not sure I (nor Wayne) know what he actually meant by his #"2:" 
assertion.  Perhaps he will elucidate.
