Is there a version of SecureDrive, or something equivalent, that
will work with a FAT partition under OS/2?  I have SecureDrive 
running under DOS with no problem.  It also works with Windoze.  
If I bring up a DOS box under OS/2, I can install it just fine, 
and it even validates my passphrase correctly.  Unfortunately, 
everything read from the encrypted partition is still garbled.

My theory is that OS/2 isn't using the same interrupts to do disk 
access, and the ones that SecureDrive hooks and intercepts.

Anyone got a solution that will work with OS/2?
