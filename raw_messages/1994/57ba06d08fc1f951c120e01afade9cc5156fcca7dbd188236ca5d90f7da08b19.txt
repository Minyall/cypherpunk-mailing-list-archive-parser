Okay, I'll go with that. I'd just like to point out that http (transport 
for documents serverd on the web) uses mime. That's how your browser 
knows something is html, or a picture of some format, or postscript. 

find a web server (pick one) and telnet to it:

% telnet my.web.server 80

enter the following line and press return *twice*
HEAD / HTTP/1.0

(you need the second line because the server is expecting a mime header 
from you - ended by a blank line).

You'll get some answer like:
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Date: Friday, 16-Dec-94 01:09:44 GMT
Server: NCSA/1.3
MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/html
Last-modified: Tuesday, 06-Dec-94 06:10:37 GMT
Content-length: 1067

That's the server's answer to your query - one mime header (the http HEAD 
request asks for info about a document).

If you have a mailer that doesn't automagically verify signatures and 
pack and unpack pgp messages it's a pain (I know tim will agree with 
this). If you have a mailer that can't pack and unpack mime then it's a 
pain too. Just because your mailer doesn't support it doesn't mean that mime 
(or email privacy !) is a bad thing.

PS: for those with macs or pcs or unix machines don't have mime. please 
take a look at mpack - might find it usefull.
