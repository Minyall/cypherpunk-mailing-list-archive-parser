Alas, due to the fact that no one else is willing to pay 
for philosophy, nearly all philosophy is government sponsored.

Unsurprisingly, nearly all government sponsored philosophy 
logically leads to the conclusion that to avoid killing 
each other, we need to be thoroughly governed, and that 
any restraints on the power of government are foolish or
wicked and selfish.
