    Most customers want more privacy, but when you think
    about it, there is not a whole hell of a lot they can do
    about it right now.  If they want to get the status and
    flexibility of a credit card, they need to give up their
    privacy....

    At this point Duncan Frissel will regail us with some
    wonderful scheme, understandable only to lawyers, that
    can be used to get credit cards under aliases, perfectly
    legal if you use a doubly nested corporate structure
    going through Aruba and the Caymans,...I won't comment
    on why most consumers have neglected that option....

Well, I imagine that is because he doesn't have a clue what he is
talking about.  In our upcoming Privacy Seminar, Duncan and I
will discuss trivially simple ways to do just the thing Mr. Hart
tells us can't be done.  And, as Duncan says, "it'll be as legal
as church on Sunday."  Tune in to the Privacy Channel, Jim, you
might actually learn something.

The Privacy Seminar will start approximately 1 September.  An
announcement giving instructions on how to sign up will be made
sometime this week.  Stay tuned.
