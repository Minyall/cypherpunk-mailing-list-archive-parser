Hi all,

For those interested there is an article in the July 94 issue of Circuit     
Cellar Ink: The Computer Applications Journal on pp. 36.

It specificaly mentions the c-punks and their position (ala Gilmore) on 
various issues of crypto and constitutional rights. Is a good article but
shallow on technical details. It is intended more as a pump primer for those
poor souls doing real-time control apps.

I would say it is worth the time to read.

Take care.
