You have to decide who that author is and what the subject is, first.
Therefore, as somebody said:

Likewise the true subject may not be apparent either.

Ratings are a means for a group in discourse to engage in a
meta-discourse about what they wish to speak and to hear.  Some form
of this is going to be necessary to support anonymity and
pseudonymity, which breaks the current social structures which hold
together the existing meta-discourse (facial expressions, body
positions, mere presence).
