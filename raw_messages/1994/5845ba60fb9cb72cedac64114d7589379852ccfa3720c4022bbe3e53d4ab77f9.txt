But tmp is only responsible for damaging the reputation of the
pseudonym "Black Unicorn".  This is not the same as damaging an
actual person by name.

If I am in a frivilous mood someday and post a tongue-in-cheek
article on alt.hamsters.duct-tape under the pseudonym "Rodent
Ravisher", I have little cause to complain that my real-life
reputation has been ruined if someone misrepresents my views.

If I am dense enough to publicly associate myself with the post,
then perhaps I shouldn't complain when the Good Christians begin
avoiding me and perhaps even hiding their hamsters when they see
me passing by.  In any case, it is certainly not the fault of the
other flamers if my career goes down the tubes.

But flaming an anonymous identity is not the same as flaming a
real-life person.  Anonymous identities allow one a little
vacation from having to be deadly serious all the time.  And an
opportunity to play Devil's Advocate with ideas that may not
necessarily be ones own.

Let's lighten up a little here.

This IS the 'real world'.
