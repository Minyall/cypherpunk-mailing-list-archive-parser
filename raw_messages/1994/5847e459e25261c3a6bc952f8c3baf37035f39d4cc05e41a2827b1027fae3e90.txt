I disagree also with posting public keys to the list, but I think
anyone who signs their messages should either have their key in the
keyservers or should at least provide information on how to get the
key along with the message. Why bother signing if your key is
not available?

Something I was wondering about is what should be done with
signatures that don't check out. For the most part it is due to a
bug in the signing/mailing procedure, rather than an actual spoof.
Is there an ettiquette for contacting the person who posted the
missigned message. Do people want to know if their sigs didn't
check out?
