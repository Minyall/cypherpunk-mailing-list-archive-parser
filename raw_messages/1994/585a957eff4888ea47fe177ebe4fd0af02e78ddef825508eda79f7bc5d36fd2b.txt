The monthly meeting of cypherpunks will be broadcast on the mbone this
saturday, july 9, from noon to 6.  The ports and ID's are as follows:

This is being advertised using sd as well.

The main topic will be discussion of Phil Karn's swIPe package, which
was announced at Usenix last month.  It allows one to set up encrypted
IP tunnels over the exisiting IP network.  

For those of you interested in attending in person, the meeting will
be held at Silicon Graphics in Cafe Iris, building 5.  To get there,
get off 101 at Shorline, and head towards the ampetheater.  Turn right
into the SGI parking lot after Charlston, and continue down to just
before the circle.  Building 5 will be on your right.

NOTE:  THE SGI PARKING LOTS ARE BEING RE-SURFACED THIS WEEKEND.  SO
YOU WILL HAVE TO PARK ON THE MAIN CAMPUS DRIVE OR ON THE CONCRETE
PARKING AREAS.
