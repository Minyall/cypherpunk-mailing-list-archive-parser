So what does the publication of the reverse engineering of RC4
mean legally? AT&T claimed trade sevret and copyright protection
over code that was pretty well known in the BSDI case...

Can RC4 still be construed as a trade secret or proprirtary to
RSADS and Bizdos or are, as I understand from previous messages,
we free to use RC4 now (ignoring the submarine patent issue)?
