Well, there _are_ plenty of drugs that neatly cause short-term memory
loss.  Xanex, I think, is one. (And there are some other really scary
drugs used in medecine, that could be used for some awfully terrifying
trips.  Pavulon, for instance, which causes total paralysis, but 
does not interfere with sensory nerve function.)  So the "...then
forget about it" part is pretty simple.
