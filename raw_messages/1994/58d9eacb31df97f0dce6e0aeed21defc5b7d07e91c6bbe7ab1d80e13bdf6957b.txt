There are businesses that are just as clueless.  I work for a mailing 
company that gets credit card orders from a telemarketing firm.  All of the 
information that I would need to commit major credit card fraud flows across 
my computer every morning.  (I actaully do the processing via computer to 
the bank.  The bank program was written in Microsoft Basic by someone in 
California.)  The company I work for wanted to print ALL of the credit card 
information on the packslips.  This means that anyone along the production 
line could have taken that information and done with it what he/she will.  
The information is not stored in any sort of encrypted form on the computer. 
 Anyone who has access to the system and the least amount of knowlege could 
get to it.

Now you know why I do not have any credit cards.
