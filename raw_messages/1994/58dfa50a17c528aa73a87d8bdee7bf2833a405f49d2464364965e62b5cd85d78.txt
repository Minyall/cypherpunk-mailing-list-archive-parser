I just obtained a copy of PGP 2.3a about 2-3 months ago and have been 
using it off and on.  I just subscribed to this list a couple of days
ago and have seen mentions of ViaCrypt PGP.  I did a little research,
and I now know what ViaCrypt PGP is.  My question is, what are the 
details surrounding the licensed RSA technology in the two.  I have 
gathered that Freeware PGP does NOT have a license, and ViaCrypt PGP 
does. ... Does this mean in any way that it is technically illegal to 
use Freeware PGP?  Or does it even matter?

Thanks
