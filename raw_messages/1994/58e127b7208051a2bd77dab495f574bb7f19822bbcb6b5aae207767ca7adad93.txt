Yes... at least one TCP/IP proxy system (socks) lets the client
receive incoming connections (the client makes a second connection to
the socks server, and the socks server informs it of the addr/port
that it's listening on; when a connection comes in to that port, the
two incoming connections are gatewayed to each other); that's how
socksified FTP works, by the way.

Things could get sticky if the server needs to make multiple
connections to the wallet at the same address (in sequence or in
series), but I'd imagine that this wouldn't be the case..
