Someone worries about magnetic strips in U.S. currency...

Yeah.  I do too.

On a slightly related topic, I know of an instance where the
Secret Service located a stolen color copier with somewhat 
greater speed than one might have expected.

Is it possible that these machines either:
(1) contain transponders
or
(2) hide a "signature" in their output  ???
