well EXCUUUUSE ME for reading /pub/cypherpunks/rants on soda.berkeley.edu,
parry metzger!!! i just don't understand how remailers can even exist in
cyberspace given that a *lot* of people like to try to yell at system
administrators to get mail censored. if people are doing this to remailer
operators, and they cave in, we are back to square one. ok, so whoever
detweiler is, he's obnoxious, but i thought that cypherpunks were against
censorship. is it `censorship is BAD-- UNLESS detweiler is involved'...
(hee, hee)

why are you guys so !@#$%^&* paranoid, anyway? what the heck did detweiler
do, anyway? if that goofy string of DEATH TO CRYPTOANARCHISTs messages was
due to him is all, then i think you guys might be overreacting just a *tad*.

--`scarlet A'

(boy, i am really paying for the particular combination of initials i picked.
do you guys really think detweiler would be stupid enough to pick something
that you leap on in a microsecond?! to bait you in front of your face?! 
i can't recall a detweiler post recently in the newsgroups, what is his last
address? i think i will write him ... quite a celebrity ... maybe he has
managed to get censored)
