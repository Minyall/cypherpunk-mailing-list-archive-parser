 Well, now that the issue of Marines on the list is settled,
perhaps the good SGT could share some non classified knowledge of
the USMC's extensive use of Banyan Vines.

 For those who didn't know, during Desert storm every Marine tank
was a Banyan server, the self healing nature of this network proved
very effective, in fact "Stormin Norman" gave it credit as one of
the three key assets we had.
