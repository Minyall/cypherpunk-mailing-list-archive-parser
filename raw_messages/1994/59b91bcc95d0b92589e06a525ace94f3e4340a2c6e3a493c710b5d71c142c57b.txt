Part of the reason I have subscribed to this list is to find out more about
the interelationships possible between barter systems and e-money.

As newbie to the list I don't want to bore anyone with well known facts
but...

Does anyone have detailed knowledge of the works of Silvio Gesell, for
example?  (He was a prominent theoretician of barter systems at the turn of
the century.)

Can anyone tell me how I can get my hands on a copy of the LET system
version of the board game "Monopoly"?
