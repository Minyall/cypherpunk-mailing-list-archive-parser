In reality there is only one "natural right", one every human is born with. 
The right to die, granted they are attempting to take this right from people
but haven't wholly succeeded yet. The rest of one's rights are granted by the 
state or self maintained (by any means neccesary). It seems we will soon be 
at this juncture.
