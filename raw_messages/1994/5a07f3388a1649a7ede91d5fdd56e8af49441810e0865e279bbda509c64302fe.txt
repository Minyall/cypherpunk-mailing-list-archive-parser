Hi,
   I grabbed a copy of the Errata sheet (1.5.9 I think) off of a newsgroup,
or maybe it was posted to the list.  Anyway, I lost the thing!!!  If anyone
(including the original poster...who I believe was Bruce Schneier himself)
could send it to me, I would be extremely happy.  Or if you feel so
inclined, post it, so I don't get bombarded with several thousand copies of
the errata sheet.
                           Thanx,
                               Brad
