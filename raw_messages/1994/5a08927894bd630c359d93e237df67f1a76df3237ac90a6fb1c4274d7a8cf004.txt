>Wide-spread use of cryptography will greatly enhance our privacy, but
>will also make court-authorized line-tapping impossible. In an effort
>to make cryptography ``compatible'' with law enforcement, the Clinton
>Administration has been advocating the use of a new encryption
>technology: the Clipper Chip.
>
>Whether cryptography should be regulated at all is an important
>question, one that should be debated at all possible levels of our
>society.  This talk, however, focuses primarily on TECHNICAL points
>that are crucial to make an informed decision. In particular, we
>address the following questions:
>
>* Does Clipper Chip really make cryptography and law enforcement
>  compatible?
>
>* Does Clipper Chip introduce unwanted and/or unforseen dangers?
> 
>* Are there better alternatives to making encryption and law
>  enforcement compatible, if this is what we want?
