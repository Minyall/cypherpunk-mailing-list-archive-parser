New York City-area cypherpunks:

Tim May has graciously agreed to be on my radio show again
this Saturday (via telephone).  We'll be talking about the
Big Brother aspects of Clipper/Capstone, and maybe a bit about
Digital Telephony if we get to it.  The vital stats:

WFMU (East Orange, NJ)
91.1 FM
Saturday, April 30, 12 noon local time (my show runs from 11 to 1).

No, I won't be taping it.

Tell all your friends.

   --Dave.
