When we engage in debates with the forces of the Dark Side, we should be
careful not to let them talk about criminals as a single class.  It bothers
me to see people on that side do bait-and-switch: talk about the evils of
major Coke importers to get people worked up then admit that the big ones
won't be affected by Clipper but 'some criminals will be'.
