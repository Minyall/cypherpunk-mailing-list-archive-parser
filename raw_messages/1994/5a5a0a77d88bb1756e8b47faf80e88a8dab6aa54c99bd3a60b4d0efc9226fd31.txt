You know Tim, I agree with you. This newfangled technology stuff is
just too hard to deal with. Multimedia email is an obvious dead
end. I'd suggest that we all move back to paper and pencil -- thats a
simple common denominator that we all are capable of managing.

In fact, we all ought to just gather about in our stone cave around
the fire and chat about this in person -- its friendlier that way.

Who still remembers telling people who thought that dealing with
the NCP to TCP transition was too hard and is suprised to note that
there are no more NCP hosts around. Who still remembers the terror in
the eyes of floundering mainframe programmers realizing that they
might have to learn something other than COBOL if they wanted to keep
working for more than minimum wage.
