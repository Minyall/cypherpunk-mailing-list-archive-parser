Ah yes, RMS's drive-by flaming...

Thus setting of one of the more amusing "My language is better than your
language" holy flame wars of the year.  Tcl/tk is here and in widespread
use, wishing it were otherwise isn't going to change reality.  The only
good thing about the entire thread was that it brought python, which does
have a bigint/mpz module built into it, to the attention of a few more
people.  Lets get back to something useful...
