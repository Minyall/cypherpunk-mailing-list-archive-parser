Abstract: Traditional approaches to introducing commerce to the Internet focus 
on using the Internet to facilitate the sale of goods and services.  However, 
these approaches require either encryption or a closed system in order to 
safeguard payment.  By restricting our focus to information commerce -- 
transactions not involving physical goods or service -- we can radically 
simplify the underlying commerce model, with extremely important consequences 
for the usability and democracy of the Internet's payment infrastructure.
