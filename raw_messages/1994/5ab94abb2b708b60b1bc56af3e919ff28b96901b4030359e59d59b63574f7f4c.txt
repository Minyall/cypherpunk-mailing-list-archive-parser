I think that because there are proportionately so very few females on 
the list who post, that the gentlemen sometimes forget themselves and 
include some "men talk".  But I haven't noticed anyone follow up on it; 
 they never carry on and on as they do about LD (a much more 
interesting topic), and it isn't long before they get back to random 
numbers, Clipper, PGP, the intricacies of money laundering, etc.
