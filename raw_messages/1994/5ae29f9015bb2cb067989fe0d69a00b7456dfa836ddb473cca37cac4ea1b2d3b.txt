Hi,

I was looking for a pgp public key
and got a message of a key server. It will be down until
pgp 2.5 is available and then it will not accept any keys
generated by a pgp lower than 2.4.

What is the reason for this? I thought the only difference
was the use of the rsaref code. There should not any difference
in the key structure. Is this the way to introduce a clipper-pgp and
make people use it?

pgp 2.5 will not be available outside USA. Where can I get a
description of the diffs of the logical functions? Perhaps I will
write a copy of this program using our local toolbox, and make
it available outside the USA.
