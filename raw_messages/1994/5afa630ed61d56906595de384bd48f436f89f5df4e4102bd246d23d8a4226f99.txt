There was quite an interesting quotation in one of the British papers
recently from Ames, the CIA spy who was caught - he said that the intelligence
infrastructure in the US was a self-serving bureaucracy. I forget the exact
wording, but it was the sort of thing you'd imagine the head of any big
organisation like that would want to say but was never in a position to
be able to - of course, now Ames can say what he likes :-)  I wonder if
he's available for interviews by the Cypherpunk Press ;-)
