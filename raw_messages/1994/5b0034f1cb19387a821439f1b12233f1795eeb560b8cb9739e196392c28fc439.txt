It's exactly this tone that I'm afraid of.  Need?  In who's opinion?  While
I might agree that children shouldn't indiscriminately be seeing
potentially disturbing material, the way that I'd state it is: "I'd like my
children to be protected from graphically violent material".  Note that it
would be *my* children that *I* want to protect.  And I have the means to
handle that.  Not that I have kids, but...

It's insidous, the ways that morals get turned into law and regulations.
