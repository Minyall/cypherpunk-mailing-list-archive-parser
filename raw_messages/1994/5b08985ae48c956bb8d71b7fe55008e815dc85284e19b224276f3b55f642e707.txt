You don't care if a listener hears the information on the modulus and
generator. It doesn't matter. You can broadcast it in the clear.

The point I was making was that if you always use the same modulus the
attacker can expend the effort to attack your modulus just once and
can then crack individual D-H sessions trivially. If you change each
time, you can't be attacked in this way.
