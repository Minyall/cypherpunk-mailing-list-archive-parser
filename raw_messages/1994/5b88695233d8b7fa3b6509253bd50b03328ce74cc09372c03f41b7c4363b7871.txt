What with all the fascinating political arguments on the list these days, 
casual observers might accuse us of having lost momentum.

Not I!  Look at the progress made this Spring.  We (and others not on the 
list) have produced not 1, not 2, but 3 encrypting file systems for DOS 
machines.  (Where are you MAC types?  I guess DOS' spastic and primitive 
file system has *some* advantages.)

These are:  Secure Drive 1.3D, Secure File System 1.0, and the new Secure 
Device 1.0(?).

I SecureDrive and SFS are stable implementations which encrypt DOS 
volumes.  Secure Device creates an encrypted file that DOS sees as a drive 
(like DoubleDisk or Stacker but without the compression).  I will try out 
Secure Device as soon as I can get into the FTP site which has been busy.

Anyone on this list with a DOS machine should have one of these running 
every day.
