This approach hadn't occurred to me; I've been following the discussion on
bogus remailer traffic from the perspective of 'How do we get the remailers
to generate/manage their own 'noise' messages'. Give me some sort of script
to run, and I'll run it on some oddball schedule if it will help. 

Things That Would Be Nice:
   1) The script, incantation, or whatever should be easy for even Unix
      novices (*blush*) to implement without assistance. (Damned if I'm
      going to call System Administration and ask for help on something
      like this! :)  )
   2) The script may need to incorporate some random element that changes
      the path through the remailers every now and then (If I *always* send
      a noise message from A to Q to X to Z, does this really help foil 
      message analysis? Serious question- I have no idea.)
   3) Some assurance that this will be a *quiet* process; that is, if one
      of the remailers barfs I don't care to have a bunch of wierd error
      messages routed to my postmaster. This may not be an issue; what I
      _don't_ know about e-mail would fill an encyclopedia.
 
In short, if you can come up with a black box for me to run that helps your
remailer traffic situation without (a) undue effort on my part and (b) undue
risk to my account id, then I'll help you out. Strike a blow for blah, blah,
and all that.
