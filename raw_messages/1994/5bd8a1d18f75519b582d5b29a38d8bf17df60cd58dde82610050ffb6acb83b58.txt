Oh, i agree.  Security of 2.6 and the agenda are probably just fine, but 
we've had no independent verification of that security, and revelations 
of the agenda, and being a paranoid cypherpunk who missed woodstock 
(sorry couldn't resist), that is an issure that very much concerns me.  
To push an UNTESTED product with an unknown background forceably to 
replace something we can trust is something I consider to be sinister.

The whole fiasco, from the day the new keyserver restrictions were 
announced, to the half-hearted neta announcement, to this new one, no not 
show a program that has been fully tests.  As if we are supposed to 
accept it just because it has the name PGP on it.  Homey don't play that.
