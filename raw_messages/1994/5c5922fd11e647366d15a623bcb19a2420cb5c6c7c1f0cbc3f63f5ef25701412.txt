I would love the purist stance, except that it is untenable. Every security
system is breakable, if enough effort, money, and professionalism are involved.
We should never kid ourselves about this. One time pads are provably secure,
but someone can still break in and physically steal your plaintext, or steal
you and bring out the rubber hoses...
If crypto does become widespread, then it will be used in situations where
the value of the key justifies considerable effort and expense to steal it,
and it will happen. There must always be a mechanism to deal with repudiation.

As to your later point about mootness, I would not be comfortable saying that
there are limits to what a court will attempt to coerce cooperation.

This is just a second private key, and no more immune to forgery or theft by
a professional.
