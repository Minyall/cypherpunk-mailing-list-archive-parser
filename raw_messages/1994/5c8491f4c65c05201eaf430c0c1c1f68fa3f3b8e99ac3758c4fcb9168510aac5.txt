I remember a story from a conference in the sixties where someone 
wanted to prove the point that it's much easier to make a recognizer 
for all voices if you're only looking for a certain word.  So he built 
a "watermelon" box.  He sits this up on the podium with him and gives 
his talk, which naturally at some point gets to...

"...a single word, for instance 'watermelon.'" *beep!*

Then later there's a Q&A period, of course...

A: Please step up to the microphone...
Q: You mean all this thing does is recognize the word "watermelon,"
   *beep!* and that it can recognize the word "watermelon" *beep!*
   no matter who says it?
A: That's right, it's an any-speaker, "watermelon" *beep!* recognizer.
Q2: Why the word... "watermelon" *beep!* exactly?
