New Yorker writer says:
   [Many clueless things, including:]
   The net poses a fundamental threat not only to the authority
   of the government, but to all authority, because it permits
   people to organize, think, and influence one another without
   any institutional supervision whatsoever. 

Oh, Dear.  We Certainly Can't Let That Happen.

Sigh.  This gentleman obviously needs to be regrooved.  Does anyone
have his net address?
