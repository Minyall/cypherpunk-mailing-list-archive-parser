Good point.  It's not widely known but in fact the US Military-Industrial 
complex is controlled by seven Freemasons who operate from a hidden 
control center in the British Virigin Islands*.  The group of seven have 
been planning World Domination for the past thirty years.  The military 
action which resulted in the overthrow of Manuel Noreiga and the ruthless 
installation of a democratically-elected government in Panama was just 
a precedent to the next step which is to slam the Voyager I and II probes 
into jupiter and ignite their on-board hydrogen bombs.  This will create a 
nucleur reaction in Jupiter's core turning it into a new Sun and bringing 
about the environmental catastrophe They** will use to enslave Earth's 
population.  And that's the _REAL_ reason They're worried about anonymous 
remailers.
