Kewl title, but alt.test alredy exists and if you create alt.w.a.s.t.e. you
announce to the entire anal retentive world that you are using Usenet to
send private encrypted messages. That will alert everyone to start scanning
alt.test too for such things and tattling on the remailer sites as being
where these things are coming from. Nobody will CARRY alt.w.a.s.t.e. if they
know that's what the group is for! Many sites don't carry alt.test even, but
they do carry misc.test, if I understand right. Nobody's going to rmgroup
alt.test or misc.test!! But you can bet they'll rmgroup alt.w.a.s.t.e.

Duh.
