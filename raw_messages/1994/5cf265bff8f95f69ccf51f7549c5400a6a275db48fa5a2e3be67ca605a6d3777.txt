| A person in the group to which I refer is ``in the US'' by the commonly
| understood geographical definition of that phrase, but has as a matter
| of conscience renounced any citizenship he may have had.  He refuses on
| principle to affirm that he is a national person, and therefore cannot
| use PGP 2.6 because such affirmation is supposed to be required in order
| to obtain PGP 2.6, and may therefore be implicit in each use of PGP 2.6.

| What version of PGP can such a person use?

2.4/2.7, from ViaCrypt.  They are licensed, without requiring the
buyer to assert that they are a US citizzen, and part of the money you
pay out is for the RSA license.
