I don't think you can strictly call it a crime, just abusive rudeness,
though if you did something like that in Detweiler-space, it might 
classify you as a Tentaculer Traitor to Humankind.
However, sufficient levels of abuse can get you kicked off systems;
though he's been posting lots of verbose human-generated messages
rather than mechanized mailbombs, which are clearly over the edge.
And he's been mailbombed directly by other rude people; don't know
if he's done it to anyone himself.
