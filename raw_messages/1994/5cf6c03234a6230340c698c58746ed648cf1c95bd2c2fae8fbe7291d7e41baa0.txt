Links to crypto are weak (maybe!) but I think this may be of interest
to some on the list:


Associated Press reported yesterday:

"A former NASA researcher has been ordered deported as a 
suspected North Korean agent following a hearing at which he was not 
allowed to see all the evidence against him.  [...]

Lee was ordered [deported]  on Friday by federal immigration Judge 
Michael Suarez, partly on the basis of classified FBI information that 
Suarez  refused to divulge to either Lee or his attorney, Herbert Gee. 
   
Lee said neither he nor his lawyer was allowed to attend the government's 
closing statements Wednesday."
