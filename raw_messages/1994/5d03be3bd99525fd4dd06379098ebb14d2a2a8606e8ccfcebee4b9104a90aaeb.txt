Actually, it's entitled "What Do I Care What Other People Think".  I'm
not sure which one I like better, however in the first book, when he
talks about hiding the door, and decribes where he put it, well, I
followed those directions and found the spot.  (Unfortunately the
house has since been renovated, so the exact room isn't the same)
