It's definitely false, at least here in NYC.  A well-known alternative
to having an unlisted phone number (a privilege that the phone company
charges extra for, the crooks) is to have your phone listed under a
different name.  So, if I'm listed in the phone book as "Nick Drake,"
I'm still listed, and so I don't get charged for being unlisted.  However,
anyone looking for D. Mandl in the phone book won't find me, so I'm
_effectively_ unlisted.  Strange but true.
