This is an approach that I haven't heard of before.  If one could
determine the numerical ordering of two different keys used to
RSA-encrypt the same piece of plaintext by examining the
ciphertext, one could easily break RSA by a binary search of the
keyspace.

Given two moduli N1 and N2, and some plaintext P, and PGP's
favorite encryption exponent, 17, you need to determine if
N1 < N2 by examining P^17 MOD N1 and P^17 MOD N2.  Although this
is only a one-bit function, it clearly depends upon P in a very
complicated way.  Since P is unknown and deliberately made random
in practical RSA implementations, I am not sure such an attack
shows much promise.  I would guess that this would be at least as
complicated as solving an RSA or discrete log problem directly.
