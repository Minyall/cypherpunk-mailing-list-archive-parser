	Wow.. that's quite a sizeable number.

	Regarding pericles.com -- I don't have anything against
mailbombing that site -- it's their own host, they pay for the disk
space and their feed right? Mailbombing them on other sites will make
it bad for the owners of the site and the other users of the site who
aren't involved with the crap. . . Should probably still stop mail
from the remailers though to avoid gettings sued.

	A class actions suit against c+s on the part of the usenet
might be a good idea. (But this is a topic for alt.net-abuse.)
