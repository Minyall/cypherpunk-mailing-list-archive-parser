Eric, 

  Can you clarify your intention for the list ? I'm a little puzzled by
the alternatives that are flying about. You initially stated an
intention to delay (eventually bounce) unsigned messages to cypherpunks
list. A couple of posts back you talked about "This is an unsigned
message" headers in messages. Are you intending to implement both of
these, one of these, or one now and the other later ? What type of
checking are you intending on signatures - just syntax or signature
verification ?

  I apologize for asking for clarification, but I've lost the signal in
amongst all this noise.

-Jon
