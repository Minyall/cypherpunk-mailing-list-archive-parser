True, but only because they haven't gotten their hands on any yet.  It is
well known in certain international arms circles that Kadaffi or Hussein
would absolutely *love* to have their own means of producing nuclear
weapons.  And they aren't alone.

I don't think so.  Most of the world's terrorists (with the exception of the
IRA and a handful of others) are recruited and trained by folks in the
Middle East.  It may be true that they have gotten more than their share of
publicity in the past, but the fact remains - the Middle East is *the*
training ground for that sort of thing, and there isn't a fundamentalist over
there who wouldn't like to shove a suitcase nuke up Bill's ass.

Haven't you heard?  America *is* THE ENEMY to a majority of the folks over
in that part of the world.  If you don't believe me, travel to that part of
the world carrying an American passport and see what happens.
