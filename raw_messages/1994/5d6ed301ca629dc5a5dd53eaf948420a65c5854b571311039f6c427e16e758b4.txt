Quotes from Chief U.S. Magistrate Judge John T. Maughmer regarding FBI
wiretaps in a case against now deceased Kansas City financier Frank Morgan:

  "...disturbing pattern of material misstatements, overstatements,
  and omissions"  in the government affidavit seeking court permission
  to wiretap Frank Morgan's office.

  "The conduct of the FBI...rises to such a level of recklessness as to
  mandate suppression" of the evidence obtained through the wiretap.

The judge's comments were included in the 9 Feb 1994 Kansas City Star.
