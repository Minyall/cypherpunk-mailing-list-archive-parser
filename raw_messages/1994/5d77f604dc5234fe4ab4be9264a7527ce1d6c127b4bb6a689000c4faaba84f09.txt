I also have found no info on it, surprises me...

I would agree with you if we talk about a single P, however I suspect
that if one looks at a sequence of P's in a message that there might
be some analysis that could be done relating to the residuals. If you
take into account the regularity (periodicity?) of english text then
it seems to me that you could make some form of 1-1 mapping of the 
P's in a cypher-text to the plain-text. 

If you have any other thoughts on it would appreciate them...
