Ah, but they already know. And so do the credit reporting companies. I
just got a "Congratulations, you have been pre-approved for a
Nonsmoker's Credit Card from Citicorpse" letter.


Actually, I'm kidding. But not by much. The amount of cross-linking is
astounding, but not once you think about the infrasructure set up to
compile the credit dossiers, the collusion with the government on
these dossiers (I've posted before about Witness Security and false
identities the credit reporting Big Three agree to falsify), etc.

Unlinkable credentials is the way to go, but there's no "constituency"
for this...Americans, and others, are oblivious to these issues.

Personally, I see no chance of changing this. This is why I put my
bets on crypto anarchy, which allows opting out of parts of the
system, rather than trying to change the ponderous course of the ship
of state.
