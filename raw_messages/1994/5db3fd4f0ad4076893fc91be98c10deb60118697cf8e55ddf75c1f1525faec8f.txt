No doubt. But what does the OS provider gain from including encryption
in the OS? At present, customers aren't demanding it. Why add SKE at
all when no one's asking for it?

Apple is able to export System 7 Pro right now because it uses 40-bit
RC2/RC4 for some limited client-server stream encryption. It won't do
file or disk encryption.

Remember that all these vendors want to sell OSes *and* to control the
future of that particular technology. I'd bet that MS At Work is where
Microsoft is most interested.

FWIW I agree with Tim: it's time to start asking the OS vendors some
hard questions. I'll volunteer to talk to Apple. Tim & Blanc Weber
seem to have good wires into Microsoft.

Bill Stewart's suggestion about shareholder resolutions is a good one,
too, for those who are shareholders of the various companies.

Finally, never forget the power of "divide & conquer"; if MS does
something unpalatable, that gives Novell, Apple, et al a reason _not_
to do that same thing.
