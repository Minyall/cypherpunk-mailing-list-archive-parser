Actually, most mailing lists are run by machines, not human beings, at 
least for routine administrative tasks.  Especially for such things as 
subscribing and unsubscribing.

I too attempted to unsubscribe a couple days ago, largely because the 
noise posts are not filtered.  There are plenty of list managing software 
packages out there, which aren't difficult to install.  I suggest anyone 
planning on running a mailing list look into them; machines were made to 
do repetitive tasks.
