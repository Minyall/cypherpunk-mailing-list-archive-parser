Thanks for introducing the useful terminology.  You're right, FV
provides counterparty anonymity but not issuer anonymity.  A useful
clarification.

No, it doesn't require an entire billing system, because it lives
entirely on the seller's machine and does nothing except the pre-billing
accumulation for a single seller.  It requires a simple database and a
nightly cron job.  The next time I have a day or two free I will
probably build such a thing and add it to the free FV software; I don't
expect it will be more than a day or two's work, if that.

Well, at 29+4% it would indeed be disingenious.  However, that's not
what we're charging -- I'd encourage you to actually read our materials.
 We're charging 29 cents plus 2%, and this includes all the charges to
the credit card networks, the banks, and our financial transaction
processors.  We are NOT operating on a big margin here.

As I said in an earlier post this morning, this *is* an option we will
probably support eventually, although I don't think it is as easy to
make crypto easy-to-use as it is to make checkboxes easy-to-use, at
least not without deeply compromising the security of the crypto system.
 Mostly, however,, we just think that it's a longer-term problem,
because we see the widespread deployment of crypto as being a
longer-term phenomenon.  -- Nathaniel
