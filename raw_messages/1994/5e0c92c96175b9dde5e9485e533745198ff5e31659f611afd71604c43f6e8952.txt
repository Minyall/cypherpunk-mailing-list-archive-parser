This is a bad idea, the computer it self will generate clocking noise which
will appear in the noise and destroy the randomness. The standard, and even
most high-end, recievers don't have the shielding to prevent this sort of
intrussion. Heck, that digital clock on your desk (and possibly your wrist if
close enough) will cause problems as well.

Only up to a point. Past a certain point and the processes will start to
roll off their energy production.
