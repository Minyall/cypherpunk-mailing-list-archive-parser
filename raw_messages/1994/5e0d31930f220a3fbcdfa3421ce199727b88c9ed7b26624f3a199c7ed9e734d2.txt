So now do we need a Cypherpunks Nym Server?  I notice that somebody
else is using my alias... ah, well.

For the record, the Diogenes who just got active on Cypherpunks isn't
me, and, as you can tell by checking corresponding signatures, I'm
the one who called attention to the 6-digit PGP ID clashes, related them
to the birthday paradox, and recommended increasing the ID length back
in April (Raise your hand if your PGP key ID is F3AF75).

It shouldn't come as a surprise: as with everything else in cyberspace,
Vernor Vinge predicted it in True Names a decade or so ago, when he
noted in passing that the protagonist Mr. Slippery downloaded a massive
chunk of bulletin board to his home machine and scanned through it for
messages to him, tossing (manually, I think) messages to the several
other Mr. Slipperys.
