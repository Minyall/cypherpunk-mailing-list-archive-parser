It appeared to me that some individual phoned up the committee.
That's cool, I thank him.  My gripe is that it was EFF* that made the
big stink to get us to send faxes in the first place.  The people who
started the stink should follow up.

* Possible "the Kent who can't keep his FLAs straight" retraction: If
it was really CPSR that publicized the need for faxes and phone calls
I will take back all the nasty things I said about EFF in this and my
last message and apply them to CPSR--or EPIC (sp?) or whomever it was.
All I know is it was not some guy on Panix who sent out the Big Call.
