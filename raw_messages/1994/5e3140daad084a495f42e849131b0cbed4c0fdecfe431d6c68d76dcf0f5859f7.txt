Oh?   All it would require is for anonymous posting services to keep
a list of the onwers of moderated newsgroups and notify the individual
moderator on a periodical basis, as to what the real e-mail address
of the anonymous poster is (and what message the posted.)

Right now many moderated groups have banned anonymous posting.
I only hope that trend continues in groups where misinformation
is very destructive (political and sci groups for instance.)
