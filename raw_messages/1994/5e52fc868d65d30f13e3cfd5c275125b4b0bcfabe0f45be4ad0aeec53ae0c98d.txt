I'm running Turbo C++ 3.0 and get "Invalid configuration file" when 
trying to load pgp.prj to compile pgp 2.6.  Anyone else try this type of 
setup to compile 2.6? I've been able to reproduce this result on multiple 
machines starting with the signed .zip file.  Anyone that can offer any
suggestions?
thanks
-Mike
