# Is there an encrypted filesystem for Linux out there? I'm speaking of 
# something like Secure File System(DOS), but for Linux. The kernel in 
# question is 1.1.59, soon to be upgraded to a later version. IDE drive, 
# ex2fs formatted file system.

I've thought about porting Matt Blaze's "cfs" to linux.
For several reasons: 

	-- because I trust his practical crypto ability more than mine
		or most anyone else's

	-- because it runs in user-level code rather than in the
		kernel -- making both installation and development
		much easier 

	-- because it's had some serious usage and refinement


Q: What is it in the "cfs" code that makes it BSD-specific?
How much work would it be to overcome that?

		thx, strick
