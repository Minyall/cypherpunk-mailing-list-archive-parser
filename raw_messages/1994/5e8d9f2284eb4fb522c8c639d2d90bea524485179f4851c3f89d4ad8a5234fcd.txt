Rather than engage in an extended debate (which is interesting I grant,
but seems to be disintegrating into an agree/disagree impasse) I say just
run the experiment and see the effects.

Requiring digital signatures will artificially create the need for better
crypto tools to make the whole process more convenient.  This should spur
progress.  Another effect - lower list participatio:; fewer posts
(crossposts from other lists, tv show reviews, personal mail sent to the
list, Chomsky arguments, etc.)
