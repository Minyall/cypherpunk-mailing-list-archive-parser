   On this site, I know that running one would get it killed, me a stern 
warning, and if I did it again, my account removed.  My goal here is 
*NOT* to piss admins off - and what good are anon-HTTPD's if they're 
being killed every 10 minutes.  What is needed is someone who will offer 
up their box, that they own or directly control, for this purpose.
