I'm looking for crypto/security/cypherpunk URL's

obviously 

ftp.csua.berkeley.edu

http://www.c2.org 

What's the proper URL for Vince Cates web-page?

Other suggestions to me by E-mail please,

My purpose for this is mostly to be able to point people I run into on 
the WWW towards info on C-punk issues and warez d00D :-) 

Cypherpunk antonym/homonym of the day
