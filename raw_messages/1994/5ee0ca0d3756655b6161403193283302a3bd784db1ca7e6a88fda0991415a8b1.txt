Well, here's my updated list:

group.name@news.demon.co.uk
group.name@news.cs.indiana.edu
group.name@bull.com
group.name@cass.ma02.bull.com
group.name@undergrad.math.uwaterloo.ca
group.name@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu
group.name@ccs.uwo.ca
group.name@julian.uwo.ca
group.name.usenet@decwrl.dec.com

I took out cs.utexas.edu; I've had a lot of trouble with that one losing
posts.  They don't bounce, and they don't get posted, they just
disappear.  After reading a lot of posts on alt.test, I found the ones
listed above.  If you know of any more, send me mail!
Also, you can use charm.magnus.ohio-state.edu, beauty.magnus, top,
bottom... they're quarks!
uwo.ca by itself doesn't work, you must use ccs or julian.

I don't know about these, unless you meant Eric/Sameer's remailer.
