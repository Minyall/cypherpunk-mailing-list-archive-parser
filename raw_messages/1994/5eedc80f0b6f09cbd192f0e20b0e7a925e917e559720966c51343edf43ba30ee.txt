"If it weren't for nitpickers, we'd all be knee-deep in nits."

OK, what I meant of course was that we could adopt the _moral stance_ that 
remailer misusers (like misbehaving boyfriends) are reprehensible, and that 
therefore we should not discuss making remailers untraceable (or breaking
Norton Encrypt) lest we inadvertantly help the Forces of Evil.

OTOH knowledge about anonymous remailers (and the fallibility of Norton 
Encrypt) is _good_ for privacy - as I said, the latter was not discussed due
to apparent technical ignorance.
