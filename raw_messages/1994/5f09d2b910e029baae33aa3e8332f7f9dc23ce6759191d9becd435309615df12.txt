As long as we're telling funny phone name stories, I had a friend who
had not only an "unlisted" number, but even if you knew the fake name,
it was also unqueryable.

	Fokkersef, Hugo

A friend of his was trying to get in touch with him from another city
and only knew the alias.  The first time he asked the information
operator for the number for "Hugo Fokkersef", he got hung up on.
After the third hang-up, he gave up.
