A couple of days ago I posted that Headline News displayed a  
"factoid" that stated US residents value privacy over police ability  
to wiretap.  With all the excitement the Time/CNN poll generated, I  
expected people on this would say hurray or something.  Nobody said  
anything.  What's the deal?
