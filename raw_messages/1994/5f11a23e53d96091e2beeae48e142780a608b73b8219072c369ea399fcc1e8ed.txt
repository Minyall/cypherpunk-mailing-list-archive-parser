    After all, almost anyplace you find the Cypherpunks list mentioned, the 
    address given is the list address, not the subscription one. We can't really
    expect people who are not necessarily very net-aware, who just happened to
    see the address in some article somewhere, to know all about mailing list
    protocol...

Especially since people who've been around for a while could easily
get frustrated by the fact that cypherpunks-request@toad.com doesn't
bounce, but doesn't result in subscript either.
