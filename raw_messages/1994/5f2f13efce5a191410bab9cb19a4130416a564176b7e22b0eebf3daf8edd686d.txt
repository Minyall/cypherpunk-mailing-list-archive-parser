i've written a steganography program for the pc.
 its called hide-and-seek and a copy is at ftp.netcom.com as either 
hideseek.zip or possibly hdsk40.zip, in /pub/qwerty

eff suggested i tell you folks and have you look at it (source is included)
if you like it, they want a copy.

i'm not subscribed to the cypherpunks list
 so you'll have to mail me to talk to me.

thanx
