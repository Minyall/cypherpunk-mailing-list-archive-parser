Now I have machine envy... (so SCSI here yet)  But maybe a generalized
product line?  SCSI and IDE, as well as parallel dongle.  Whatever kind
of port you happen to have laying about.  And not using up slots is
really a Good Thing.  My 486 is full right now, and I use all of it, so
pulling a card isn't an option.
