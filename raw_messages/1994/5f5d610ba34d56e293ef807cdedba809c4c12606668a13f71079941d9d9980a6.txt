I like to call this the "two race cars" algorithm--you start a fast car
ahead of a slow car on a single-lane track, and if the fast one runs
into the slow one it's a looped track.

Funny, just two weeks ago a coworker put a 32-bit CRC function into
the programming language I use, and I was playing with finding collisions.
(I bet a dollar there would be a non-trivial collision between CRCs of the
76,000 files on our biggest disk and lost.)

Has anyone mentioned using this sort of method to generate same-hash texts
with, say, opposite meanings?

Seems to me that even if lots of random starting points drain into
the same cycle, you've still got lots of collisions.  Either points where
the sequences join the cycle, or points where different tributaries join
each other before joining the cycle.
