 I was just wondering if the recent internet "Sniffer" alert had
anything to do with any intelligence organizations. Was it an
attempt by "friendly spies" to gain competitive intelligence? Was
it an attempt by NSA/Clipper community and their allies to make a
point? ( See! Your vulnerable! You need clipper!)
