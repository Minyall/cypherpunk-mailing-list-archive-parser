Hey guys, I just sent medusa to ftp.wimsey.bc.ca, so you don't have to
finger me if you can't or don't feel up to it.  Right now it's in the
uploads directory, but it will probably move later...

Now for the software authors in all of us, a good question:

WHAT ARE THE BEST FTP SITES TO SEND CRYPTO SOFTWARE TO?  Is
Soda being managed again for instance?
