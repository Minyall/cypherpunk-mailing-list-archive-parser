	Maybe, but one, you substantiate it yourself, and two, I did
say it is my personal feeling.  I'll expand on it slightly by pointing
to the fact that there have been potentially serious bugs in Mosiac.
Thats understandable, writing really secure software that does lots of
stuff based on potentially malicious input is a tough task.  The fact
that it is understandable does not make it acceptable.n

	Until you hire the experts mentioned below, I'll continue to
assume that your talent mix does not include said experts.
