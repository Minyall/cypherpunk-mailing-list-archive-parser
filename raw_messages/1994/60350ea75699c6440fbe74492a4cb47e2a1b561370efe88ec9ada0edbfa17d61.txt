This refers to the secure drive 1024 iterations of MD5.  Without a proof 
that md5(128bit number) is a one to one transformation, my statement 
about looseing entropy is possibly.  I don't think that it has been 
demonstrated that md5^1024 is more secure than md5.

NOBODY HAS IMPLIED THAT SUCH A PROOF, or equivilent proof, exists.

Roger.
