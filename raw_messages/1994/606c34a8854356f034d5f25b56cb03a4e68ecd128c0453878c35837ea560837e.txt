Hmm, recently I received a enourmous amount of diffs, patches and what
so ever, to make pgp 2.3(a) compatible with pgp 2.6 (har)
now were at it, there isn't really a big difference between the two versions
(as far as I can tell) and the little hack from PC does the trick nice.
However you could also do it your self, letting the VERSION_BYTE change
when september 1 1994 is passed.

We'll try to make a nice new PGP 2.3c, which will be 100% compatible with
the 2.6 version. (Bug fixes from 2.3 to 2.4 from Branko Lankester are already
applied, now the compatibility problem will be to let 2.3 know it is 2.6)
