I have another theory:  If an anXXX@anon.penet.fi address subscribes
to the mailing list, then everybody who sends mail to the list will be
given an anon alias.  (Now to wait and see whether I get allocated an
anon id from anon.penet.fi in response to this message.)

I still say that double-blinding should not be the default action of
servers like that at anon.penet.fi.  Double blinding is sometimes
useful, but one should have to request it explicitly.
