Lost revenue can be measured in more than one way.  Besides estimated 
loss of sales, it can be measured in profit earned by the defendant.  If 
an author published a story in a magazine once, and never intends to 
publish it again, this does not give you the right to sell his story 
because he wasn't going to be making money on it anywhay.

Profanity aside, that's not an entirely logical arguemnt.  There are 
plenty of free publications in the US that contain copyrighted work.  
Publishing in a "free medium" does not strip your rights.
