Mark Ludwig wrote KOH, an on-the-fly disk encryption program that is also
a virus.  It was posted recently to alt.security.pgp.  Ludwig is the author
of a number of other viruses that don't claim to be useful.

OK.  For the record, I think it's a Good Thing to have as much confidence
in lots of different frequent-version programs as I do in (say) PGP with
its signed-file protocols.
