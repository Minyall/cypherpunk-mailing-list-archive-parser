A once saw a short paper on "modular multiplication without trial
division" or some such.

The down side was that (at least for the 486 doing RSA) you didnt
seem to get any extra speed over using a straight forward
test-subtract-n-shift method.

Unfortunatly, I dont have a reference.  Sorry.
