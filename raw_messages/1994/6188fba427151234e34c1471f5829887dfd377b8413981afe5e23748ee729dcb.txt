When we needed sources of alpha particles, we cracked open smoke
detectors and took out the Americium sources.

Later, we found a supplier of "anti-static" modules, for use in air
guns used to clean wafers, each containing 10 milliCuries (!!) of
Po-210. We called this our "Kong source."

Nothing to do with crypto, except that the alphas scrambled data in
our chips.
