	I just got (snail) mail from Viacrypt announcing 2.7 for
windows.  $124.98, now shipping.  Includes a "dll for certain Key mgmt
functions" a windows shll, and 2.7 for Dos for crypto functions.

	This flyer also announces a mid-October ship date for 2.7 for
the macintosh.  Supports Apple events and Applescript.  Contains
online documentation, and will encrypt/decrypt and sign the contents
of the clipboard.  Same price.

	Viacrypt is 602 944 0773, or viacrypt@acm.org.
