There is no DNA in hair or sweat but surely in larger skin
flakes. These are mostly very dead cells though making
analysis difficult but not impossible, if lucky, with current
techniques. Corresponding hair could be used for testing
accumulated levels of recreational drugs of cource.
Fortunately there will be no remains of your crypto key
(unless you based it upon your DNA code...).
