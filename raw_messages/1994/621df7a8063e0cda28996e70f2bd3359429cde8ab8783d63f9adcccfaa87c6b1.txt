Privacy 101 - In 1944, my friend Byrt ran into this girl on the street that
he knew from his old neighborhood.  He told her where he was sleeping.  That
evening, the Geheime Staatspolizei visited Byrt and invited him to become a
guest of the German government.  One year later, elements of Patton's Third
Army rescued Byrt from his mistake of telling someone where he slept.
