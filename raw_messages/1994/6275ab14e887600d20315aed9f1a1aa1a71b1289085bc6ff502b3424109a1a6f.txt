Hey Matt, I'd be interested in a copy of your code!

Well, you do have to be careful: a large number of keys doesn't mean a
cipher is hard to break, there may be a faster method than brute
force.  For instance, those cryptograms some papers print in the
puzzle section are a simple substition cipher, with 26! keys... yet
they are also pretty much trivially breakable with enough input.
