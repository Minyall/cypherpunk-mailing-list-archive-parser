  There is an inherrent conflict between being "safe" and being "free."  If
  you want the ultimate safety, you have to give up your freedoms completely.
  If you want the ultimate freedom, you have to give up your saftey completely.
  Most Americans (and, I suspect, Germans) want some freedom and some safety.

  Less than 2% of the handguns produced and owned in the United States are
  used in crimes.  Perhaps we don't need two or three handguns per citizen...
  But, we ought to be able to have at least one handgun, one rifle and one
  fully automatic rifle per citizen...

  Sure.  Otherwise, I'm not free.

  But, is the liberty to attack someone a freedom that I cherish?  Not really.
  Would I be willing to give it up for some measure of safety in return?  Of
  course!  That's why we have laws against murder, assault and rape.

  Absolutely!  The "safety" of your freedoms, depends upon the restrictions on
  your freedoms, to a point.

  This is neither allowed in the U.S. or good.

  No.  You're free to open your own shop to sell them, or have a man standing
  on the street corner to sell them.  It's up to you.  If I own a store,
  I'm not required to carry ever publication in the U.S.  That would be an
  inane law [not that we don't already have inane laws here...]
