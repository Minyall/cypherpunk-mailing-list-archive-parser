I think that's because Knuth is rather famous.  I imagine that his 
mailbox stays rather full ;)

I don't quite see it that way - it's just easier for me to automatically 
sign my messages than not if I choose to set my mailer up that way.  If I 
want to encrypt, it's just a couple of keystrokes in elm to change my 
editor to the appropriate script.

I guess I really don't understand your objections, Tim.  True, not every 
UA is as easy as elm to change operating parameters, but it works for me.
PGP is easy and not-too-slow to use, and it integrates fairly well into 
scripts. I've been using these little scripts for months and while 
they're not quite as flexible as I'd like, they do the job - easily, 
transparently, and automatically.
