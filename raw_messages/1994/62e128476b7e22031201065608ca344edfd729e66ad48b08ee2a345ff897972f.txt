No?  I lived in Alaska for 21 years.  During this time, no less than 3
efforts were fielded to secede from the Union.  All 3 got a large
(although non-binding) number of signatures (including mine, FWIW).

Ever since the breakup of the former Soviet Union, I have wondered just
what _is_ holding the USA together.  Within our borders, I think we show
far more diversity than the former USSR had.  Yet we remain "unified",
even in the face of ever-growing erosion of citizens' rights.

I think if a few states were to secede, it would be a great wake-up
call!  The FedGov would have to react somehow.  If they aquiesced, end
of problem and we become a loosly allied group of independent republics.
(maybe... or perhaps we don't ally at all) If they retaliate with force
(which, unfortunately, I think is the more likely outcome), they will be
showing their true totalitarian stripe.

That looked like a mighty good clue to me.
