The technology of monitoring location is interesting, of course, but why
on earth would the police, who will not consent to civilian review, ever
go along with something orders of magnitude more extreme?

ObCrypto/Privacy:  I suspect there would be an immense amount of radio
traffic involved in keeping track of a substantial group of people, say,
over 1000.  I don't doubt the ability of the device(s) to transmit the
information, but the ability of the receivers to digest it all in real
time.
