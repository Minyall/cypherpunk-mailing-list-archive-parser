Eli, what I mean is, say you are using the stanza

Can we film the operation,
Is the head dead yet?
Get the widow on the set,
give us dirty laundry

as a mnemonic.

The pass phrase becomes cwftoithdygtwotsgudl
If you pick a simple modification like add 1 to the first letter, 2 the second,
3 to the third, and then repeat (123123) you get a pass phrase of
dyiuqlujgziwxqwtixen.  Throw in some numbers and you should get a decently
random pass phrase that is easy to remember.

If you're really paranoid, pick two phrases from different books and use words
from both to compute the phrase.

Hardly a major security risk if you pick something obscure.
