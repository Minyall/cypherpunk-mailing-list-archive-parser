Hmm.  It seems to me that a bunch of these characteristics you've described
seem very similar to a stock market situation.  I would use the analogy of
information as shares...  It also seems that number two is a typical zero
knowledge situation - plus the fact that if I tell you I have a piece of
code that does x - you want the code, and knowing what it does has no real
value to you, if you just want it for its functionality.

BTW, what is fungible?  I've seen this term used several times, but have no
idea what it means.

I think this is a key point - there has to be a common sponsoring agency,
a "data bank" or something that holds all the keys, and has all the info.
Making a currency isn't really the hard part here - someone could just 
encrypt a textfile that says "This is a five point cyphermark".  All that's
important is the key authentication at the bank, who will be the party who
trades it around ultimately - it's getting people to agree on it, and give it
value that's the issue...
