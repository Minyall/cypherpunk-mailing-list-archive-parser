While Eric's way of doing things works, I reccomend asking your
systems manager to look at installing procmail as the Mlocal agent.
Its easy to do, and provides everyone with procmail support without
needing a .forward.  (Procmail is a mail processing agent that allows
you to sort your mail based on criterion of your choice.)
