cp's,
matt just mentioned that remailer@soda doesn't accept "Request-Remailing-To" 
header lines (which explains why i thought it was dead) and i note that not 
all other remailers accept "Anon-Send-To:".  anarchy has it's place in 
our lives but, it would be nice to cut down on sode come in remailing and 
ping scripts.  the three close to standard headers seem to be 
"Anon-Send-To:", "Request-Remailing-To:", and "X-Anon-To:".  it would be 
more convenient :) for all remailers to either allow all three or settle 
on one standard (nfl).

thanks,
steve
