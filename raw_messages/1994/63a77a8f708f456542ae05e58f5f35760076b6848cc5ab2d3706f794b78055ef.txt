I'm not sure if you are being sarcastic here, although I don't think you
are. That seems like a slippery slope all it's own, there.  I don't like it
when someone tells me "what do you have to worry about if you aren't
breaking any laws," and I don't like it when someone says that about the
cops too.    That argument is awfully scary.
Yeah, if the cops didn't want to accept such a thing, it might be worth
calling them on their hypocrisy for applying that argument to citizens and
not to police.  But I don't think it would be wise to use the "what do you
have to worry about if you aren't breaking any laws," argument too often.
