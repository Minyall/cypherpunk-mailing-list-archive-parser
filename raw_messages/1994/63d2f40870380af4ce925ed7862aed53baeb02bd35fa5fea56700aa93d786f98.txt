This is an interesting point of discussion. The question becomes one of
determining what the protected work is. Given that it is a call-in show, the
entire show would be a protected work and its copyright would belong to the
show's creator. I do not know if you retain copyright in the small part of
the work which represents your own intellectual property (i.e. what you
say), but I suspect it could be argued that you gave your permission to
broadcast your work when you called in to begin with. It gets murkier to me
with respect to compensation from the sale of transcripts or recordings.
Mike, is there case law here?

We differ on the use of the word "honestly". In practice, enforcement is
well-nigh impossible; nonetheless, according to the letter of the law, my
words are my property to do with as I see fit. If I state that they may not
be recorded on optical media, the law requires you to honor that.
