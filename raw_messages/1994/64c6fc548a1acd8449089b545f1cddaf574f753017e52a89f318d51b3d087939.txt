Let me be brief so you can hit the "d" key quickly...      :)

Please don't go, Tim. You are a very valuable asset. Lurk if you must...
Everybody: _please_ tone down the "language," and focus, focus, focus.
Let's all try to be more diplomatic. There's value in diplomacy.
Let's continue to discuss Netscape, but NICELY. They deserve some respect.
Enough MIME stuff for now! MIME is nifty, but this is about Crypto.
Reset brain to a low-emotion state, post calmly. Let it stew before sending.
Keep this list alive, tend it like a garden. It's important.
