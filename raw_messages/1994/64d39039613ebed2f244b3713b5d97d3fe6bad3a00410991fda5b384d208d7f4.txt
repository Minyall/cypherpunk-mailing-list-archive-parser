Has anyone produced software (preferably Unix based) that provides
a public key authenticated, DES/3DES encrypted datastream over WAN
firewalls/bastions?

A typical use would be to connect transaction feeds between two data
centers in a secure, automated way over Internet.

I can't see anything conceptually difficult with it, and it seems the
PGP library could be used to create simple Unix daemons.
