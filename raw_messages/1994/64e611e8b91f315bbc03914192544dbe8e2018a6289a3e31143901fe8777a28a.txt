Just a quick note:

Blocking the sources of messages deemed offensive is a "negative
reputation" approach, easily bypassed by creating a new source name.

(And this can be done easily by using another remailer first.)

I'm not arguing for a positive rep system here, as I'm not sure how it
would work. I just wanted to the note that the solution of blocking
offending sources has limited use. (Unless the blocking propagates
back to the first-non-remailer use...require remailers to cooperate on
maintaining a black list.)
