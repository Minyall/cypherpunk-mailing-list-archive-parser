Well, the remailer@desert.xs4all.nl is BACK ! Note the CHANGE OF
ADDRESS ! I enjoyed my time in Spain, working as a DJ and
PR-person. I used the laptop only once, to look up an address....

There's also a new version of the remailer software for Waffle 1.65.
The current version is now 2.02, and it supports now "Anon-To",
"Anon-Alternate-ID" now (only in 'penet' mode), and it now uses
the SPAWNO routines by Ralf Brown to minimize memory use while
running other programs (e.g. PGP).
