Well, I finally got a chance to catch up on a lot of email that I hadn't had
time to read recently.  I had to take myriad.pc.cc.cmu.edu down for awhile.
It should be back up in a few weeks.  My alias-based remailers,
alias@alpha.c2.org and mg5n+alias@andrew.cmu.edu are still up.  c2.org has
been having network connection problems lately and some messages may have
been delayed, but to my knowledge nothing has been lost.

For those who have been asking, help files are available by sending
mail to help@alpha.c2.org, mg5n+remailer-help@andrew.cmu.edu, and a
list of remailers and mail to usenet gateways is available from
mg5n+remailers@andrew.cmu.edu
