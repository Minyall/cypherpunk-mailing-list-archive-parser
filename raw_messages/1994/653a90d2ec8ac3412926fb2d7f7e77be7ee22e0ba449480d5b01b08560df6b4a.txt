Uni: "The hinge question is what I, or you, mean by "concepts of law."

What I understand by concepts of law is "methods of coercion & constraint".

Uni: ". . . In my framework, I feel it is consistent to embrace the
constitution and its doctrine while still resisting regulation."

In my earlier statement, that "I'm not seeing the consistency in 
embracing the concepts of the law, while questioning the regulation of 
crypto through law enforcement",  I was contrasting endorsing the use 
of coercion while at the same time resisting its use.

In the framework of a lot of legislators, they would appear to embrace 
the doctrine of the Constitution while yet substituting mindless 
coercion for intelligent understanding of the intent of the 
Constitution. I don't think that it was the intent of this document to 
establish a more perfect government by those means.

What is regulation, but the threat of the use of coercion & constraint?
What is a domestic policy which does not involve regulation?
That which is being regulated must appear to require this from having a 
potential for crime, in which case isn't this why it would be 
classified as a "crime problem" needing "political attention through 
law enforcement" (from their perspective)?
