   Sounds like an application for a "challenge-response" system. But that
   would require transmission from garage unit to car unit.

   If there were syncnronized clocks then the signal could be a function of
   time so that the above replay would fail. That requires only a PRNG.

Why not generate a random number, checksum it, and sign it using a
public key?  Or is that overkill?
