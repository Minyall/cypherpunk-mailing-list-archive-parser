I don't really remmeber.  I think they ended up settling-- the guy got a 
small fine in return for a guilty plea.  But, that is just a guess!

A lot more.  Commercial licenses are expensive, and the number of
frequencies available is smaller.  Also, commercial equipment is more
expensive.  Finally, if it were on commercial freq's, then Amateur Radio
Op's couldn't use it... What would be the point?

Yes, the FCC reg's against commercial transmission only apply to amateur
radio.  If they had been using commercial freq's, it would not have
been illegal.

No, the FCC interpretation was that Amateurs have an obligation 
to make sure that all transmissions from their stations conform
to the requirements of the FCC Part 97 rules.  Broadcasting encrypted
communcations on amateur radio is itself a violation of the rules.
That's right!! the government has already banned encryption.... on
Ham Radio.
