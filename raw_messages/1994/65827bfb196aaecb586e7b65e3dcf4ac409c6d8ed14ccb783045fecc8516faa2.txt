Of course it doesn't exist yet.

Thats a simple matter of programming, not a matter of infeasability.

I'm not certain you understand the tremendous economic pressure that
taxes bring to bear.

Since such a society is unlikely to show up any time soon, I'd say
that the odds of my scenario of the future coming true exceed the odds
of your vision of the future coming true.

Well, not for long. The IETF Working Group on IP security has just
come to consensus on an IPSP protocol -- in the not that distant
future it won't be necessary to alter any applications software in
order to have it operate over an encrypted channel.

Thats not a valid analogy. There are tens of millions of people in the
underground economy right now -- in a society already highly dependant
on electronic transactions. There is no economic incentive for most
people to encrypt their talk sessions -- but there is a great economic
incentive to evade taxes.

And if my grandmother had wheels she'd be a bicycle. It isn't
happening now -- the trend is towards larger taxes, bigger government
and more repression, not less. You can't wave a wand and have your
vision implemented -- nor is there anything you could personally do
towards implementing your vision. On the other hand, the only thing
standing between my scenario and reality is someone hacking for about
six months, and some offshore banks deciding to go into the business.
