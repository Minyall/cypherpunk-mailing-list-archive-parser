But "bombes" have long had a strong connection to cryptography. Lots
of bombes at Bletchley Park.

As to what well-dressed crypto anarchists are carrying...perhaps a
copy of Schneier. Or a PGP diskette.

But since neither of those will make for a very comprehensible
graphic, perhaps the trench-coated crypto anarchist should be seated
in front of a terminal?
