What does Chomsky believe Chmosky believes?

(BTW, I must admit that Cypherpunks is the last place I expected to
 find someone who doesn't think that control over information flow is
 real power: that's the thesis that lies at the center of most of
 the Chomsky statements that have been attacked).
