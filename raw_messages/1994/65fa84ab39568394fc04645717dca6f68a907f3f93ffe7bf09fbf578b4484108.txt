Not yet.  Just a kneejerk so far.  They have decided they have the
power, though.  They have court decisions to back that up.  If 
the administration decides to "just say no" they have shown us
in the last few days that they can and will.

Easily.  By using it for the purpose of distibuting hard public keys.
Willingly or not, they have solved that problem.  :-)

are doing that just fine all by themselves.  :-)
