(flashing philosophical credentials) :-P

All this stuff about existing in mind and existing in reality reminds me of
St. Anselm's proof of the existence of god (Hettinga's Hashed Layman's
Version 1.0(tm)):

1. Conceive of perfection.
2. You have just demonstrated that perfection can exist in mind.
3. It is more perfect to exist in mind and in reality
   than to exist solely in mind.
4. Define god as perfection.
5. Therefore god exists.

Now this Midieval brainbuster was pretty much beat to death sometime in the
Enlightment, though somebody respectable in the late 19th century (Frege?)
liked it a lot...

This GUT and P=NP thing smells awfully like scholastic bickering, don't ya
think?

Just my (unmathematical) opinion...
