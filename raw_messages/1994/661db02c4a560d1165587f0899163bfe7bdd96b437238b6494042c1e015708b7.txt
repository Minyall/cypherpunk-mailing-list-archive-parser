I would like to request some reference on the use of Uranium in the casing
of a shell or round. The casing gets thrown out on the ground (by both
aircraft and tanks) when the round goes off. There is no reason to use
anything other than brass or steel for this.

As to the use in a round, the idea is like a sabot. When the ke of the shell
is conserved on impact the more massive core goes right on into the target.
          
I can find no reference any U-core round being HE or otherwise carrying a 
charge. In all cases that I am aware of and can find reference to it is simply
a KE attack on the target where the by products of the impact bounce around
inside the target grinding up whatever is in there.

Take care.
