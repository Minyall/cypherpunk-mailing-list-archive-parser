I was thinking about this as I thought about the combination of
mail->news gateways such as anon.penet.fi and news autoresponders, and
it stuck me that a denial of service attack could be based on
including a *.test newsgroup in a Reply-To: header, causing the
autoreplies to get posted back into the *.test groups.

Some of the autoresponders seem to be set up to prevent this, others
not.  I don't know if anon.penet.fi is set up to prevent this sort of
regurgitation.
