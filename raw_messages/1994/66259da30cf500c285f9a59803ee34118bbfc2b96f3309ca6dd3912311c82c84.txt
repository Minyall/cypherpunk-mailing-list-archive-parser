I could believe some sort of amazing mathematical breakthrough that
produced a factoring algorithm that was polynomial in N. The notion
that one will show up thats not merely polynomial but actually
logarithmic in N is, I would say, in the "beyond pipe dream" state. I
might believe something like that showing up someday -- stranger
things have happened -- but I have an incredible amount of trouble
believing that one exists now and has merely been overlooked by people
smart enough to find an amazing result and too stupid to know what
their result implied.
