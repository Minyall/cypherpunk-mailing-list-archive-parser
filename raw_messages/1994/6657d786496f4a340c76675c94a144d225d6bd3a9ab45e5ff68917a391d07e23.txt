I actuallly sympathize with Tim's position and Eric's
earlier comments about adopting tools as as function of
ROI. I often experience somethign similar wiht "potentially 
faster but non-deterministic time solutions," vs. "probably 
slower but deterministic time solutions." 

That said, I think that MIME, for all its implementation
difficulties, is going to be an attractor, if for no other 
reason that the fact that there is an increasing demand for 
_something_ to encapsulate all the divergent stuff that 
people want to push and pull across the net, and MIME is 
the standard for doing this. For instance, it is used to 
encasulate html, and some advocate an expansion of its use 
in conjunction with the web. 

[Note that this does not make the various cock-ups that can 
occur in conjuction with its expanding use in e-mail any less 
annoying.]

I'm also curious what James is using on his Sun, as Sun's 
mailtool (at least the version I have) is pre-MIME, but 
MIME-ish, and can choke in amusing ways on MIME messages.
