Well, I iused the "reach-back" term in a vague way, to suggest an
avenue...it may not be the correct term.

We need a system where a user, Alice, computes *something different
every time*...a conventional "challenge-response" is not good enough,
as anyone monitoring the line or having access to the logs can then
impersonate Alice. Zero knowledge interactive proof systems offer such
a thing...in fact, password schemes are one of the applications that
have been written about.

Maybe in PGP 4.0....
