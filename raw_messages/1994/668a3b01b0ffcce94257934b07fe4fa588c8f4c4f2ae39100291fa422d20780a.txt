It is my understanding that folk outside the USA can legally run PGP
versions from 2.0 to 2.3a, but cannot legally run Viacrypt 2.4 or the
RSAREF-based version 2.5, because they contain code that cannot be
exported from the USA.  Thus, it appears that the keyserver will not
accept any legally created keys from outside the USA.  I think that this
is a bad thing.
