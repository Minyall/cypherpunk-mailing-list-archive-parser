    Is there any way to make a phone call anonymously?  Caller ID can be
blocked somewhat with one of those *## numbers dialed before the call
is made.  Is there a way to route a call through a series of phone-type
remailer systems?  This would allow one to make a call that would be as
hard to trace as anonymous mail.
 
    Any ideas?

There's a 1-900 number that is supposed to do this.

Which I could remember what it was.
