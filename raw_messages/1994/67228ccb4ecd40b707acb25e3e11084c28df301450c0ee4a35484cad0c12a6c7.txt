Having read Black Unicorn,

Thank you.  Would you please critique my _Paradigms_of_Revolution?
I am prone to action on instinct.  I'm still thinking about your
questions relative to function.  For one thing, I suggest that everyone
have a refferance with the Constitution with in arms reach of their
terminals.  Its despicalbly under read by law enforcement types, and 
may give us an edge up somewhere down the road.
