Actually a better book for virus and such is:

Computer Viruses: A hi-tech disease
Ralf Burger
ISBN 1-55755-043-3

It includes source codes and working examples. Also in the near future
I will be offering a 3M compressed set of disks which contain various
Dos viruses and related code to interested parties.
