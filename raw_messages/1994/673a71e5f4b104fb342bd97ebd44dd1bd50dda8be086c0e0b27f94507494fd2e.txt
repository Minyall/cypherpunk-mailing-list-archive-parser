Good question... what exactly is a "right"?  To me, a right is something 
that cannot be removed from any citizen.  I would like to see privacy as a 
right.  However, at what point do you draw the line?  When does privacy 
interfere with someone else's rights?

Freedom of speech has never been a right.  A lot of people think it is.  But 
go out on a street corner and try to incite a riot.  See what happens.  Or 
threaten someone.  Or commit treason.  Speech is not a right.

I don't pretend to have all the answers.  But I see a lot of folks very 
mis-informed about the difference between a right and a benefit of 
citizenship.
