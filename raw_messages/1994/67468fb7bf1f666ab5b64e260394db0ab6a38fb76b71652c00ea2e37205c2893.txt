Instead of charging for information, charge for time.  You lose  
control of the information you sell, but you never lose control of  
the time you sell.  People with spare time could perform services in  
exchange for Tacky Tokens.  These Tacky Token could then be exchanged  
for services performed by other people.  What kinds of services?   
Whatever people don't have time to do themselves.
