In trying to be too terribly clever, I included a bit of ANSI commands
in my last post to the list.  At least one person has suffered grevious
harm to his telnet session as a result.

That person asks that I post instructions for recovering from so heinous
an attack.  All I can suggest is escaping to a shell and doing a 'clear'
(or, under MS-DOS, 'cls').

Sorry, folks.  I won't do that again.
