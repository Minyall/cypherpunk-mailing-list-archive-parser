You only found a single set of factors for your public key (ie 3,8 also work)
and if I had asked "is the number 6?" as my first question then I would have 
had it in 1 single guess which does *NOT* qualify as factoring your key.

the fact it is a subset of what I am talking about means that there are some
issues (and possibly an algorithm or two) that are outside of the purvue of
a discussion limited to simply factoring. The horizon has been expanded.
