Certainly, but as I recall it was "to detweil", rather than "to
detweiler", though the latter should probably be recorded as a "dialectal
variation".  Someone needs to come up with a precise definition, and I'll
submit it for the Jargon file.  I think some old posts using the term
would be of value for authenticating it.

[NB: I have a far less dim view of LD that most of you, since I've seen
him do useful work, so it's nothing personal.  The word detweil, however, is
an honest-to-goodness incidence of a new term arising in the language of
it's own accord, regardless of how anyone feels about it, so it ought to
be recorded for posterity.]
