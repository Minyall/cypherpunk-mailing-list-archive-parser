I have to say, I'm uncomfortable with this, not even _considering_ the 
ironic similarity some of the ideas brought up lately bear to LD's original 
points about True Names and reputation servers.

My point of view is that if the possibility of being spoofed is high 
enough, that should provide sufficient incentive to the the _poster_ to PGP 
sign his messages.

None of this, however, precludes offering auto-validation of signatures by 
the list software as a service to those who choose to avail themselves of 
it.

while...)
