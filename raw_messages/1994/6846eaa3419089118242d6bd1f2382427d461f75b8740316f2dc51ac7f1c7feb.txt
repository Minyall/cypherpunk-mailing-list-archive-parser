Seven years is a virtual eternity in cyberspace.

Okay...  It would prevent brute-force attacks though, wouldn't it?  It
may not prevent differential cryptanalysis, but it would be difficult to
obtain the large amount of data required for differential cryptanalysis
from just a few encrypted email addresses.  Random numbers aren't really
a problem; I have a RNG running here, continuously generating random
numbers from system usage statistics and incoming email.

P.S. What's KA9Q?
