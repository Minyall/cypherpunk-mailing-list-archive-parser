Maybe there's a book on "Privacy" out there that gives reasonably up-to-date
coverage of crypto.  I would love a book that covered all the sociopolitical
cypherpunk issues like 
   reputations and anonymity; 
   agorics and pay-per-use; 
   copyright, left and not; 
   Chaum's distinction between Identification and Authentication; 
   traceable vs. non-traceable emoney; 
   smart cards and wallets; 
   history of privacy invasion; 
   history of public-key crypto and non-government cryptology; 
   accelleration of technology that can be used for spying;
   the sorry present state of cellular phone privacy, Qualcomm's initiative;
   "digital license plates" as likely implied in various government proposals;
   etc.

Has anyone read the Michael Marotta book?
