  No, and I don't either, but now someone else can use those accounts and 
LOOK like they are you or me (or anyone else here).  Now suppose some 
twit decides to use one or more of those accounts to send threatening 
messages to the president or some other stupid thing... who are they 
going to come after, do you suppose?  NOT a nice scenario!
