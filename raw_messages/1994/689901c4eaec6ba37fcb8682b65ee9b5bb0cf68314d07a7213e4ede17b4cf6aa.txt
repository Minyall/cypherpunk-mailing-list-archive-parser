A lot of people have sent me mail in regards to my last message, wanting 
to order shirts. At this time, we can't take any new orders. We only had 
enough shirts screened to fill the orders.

If enough people are interested, we will be doing another run sometime in 
the next month or so. I will keep you updated. 

Until then, PLEASE, do not send me checks or orders.
