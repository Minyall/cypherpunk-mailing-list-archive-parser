I probably should have been more careful in explicitly listing the
"main candidates" for the Four Horsemen:

- Terrorists

- Drug Dealers

- Money Launderers

- Child Pornographers

Others may have different lists, but these are the main "threats"
suggested by most. My reference to "abortionists, abortion protestors"
was to show that _both_ sides of the issue consider the other side to be
a threat.
