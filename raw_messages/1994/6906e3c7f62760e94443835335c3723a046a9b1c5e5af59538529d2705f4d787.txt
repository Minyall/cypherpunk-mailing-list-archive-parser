The person who I planned to drive with made other arrangements.
Anyone interested, send mail to phr@netcom.com ASAP, or phone
510-843-8236.  Leaving Berkeley preferably Sunday midday,
but flexible about departure time and route.  Probably going
to take 101 all the way down for speed, but might be willing
to take highway 1 back for the view.
