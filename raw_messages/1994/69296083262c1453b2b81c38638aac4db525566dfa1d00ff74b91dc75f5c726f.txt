Some months ago there was an article in a german computer magazine about
the Microsoft Excel chiffre. If I remember well it was a simple thing:
Every byte is rotated by two (?) bits and then a 12-character password
is xored cyclic (vigenere-chiffre). The format of the file should be 
enough to do a known-plaintext-attack. Doesn't have the Microsoft word
document a lot of 0-Bytes within the first hundred bytes?
