Since the subject came up, I'll explain it to those of you who hadn't
heard of the Atlantis Project:

The Atlantis Project is a group in Las Vegas which is trying to build a
floating city in the Caribbean sea.  Their new city would be an
independant nation called Oceania.  The country would have a limited
government, and their constitution outlines many specific rights given
to the people, among them, the right to use cryptography.  You can email
them at oceania@world.std.com and ask for more info.
