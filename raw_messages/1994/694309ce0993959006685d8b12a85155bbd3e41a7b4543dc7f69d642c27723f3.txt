That was Vic Sussman, from US News and World Report. I didn't see the
Larry King Piece, but I have talked with Sussman before. He is very
old school journalist, and was asked what he thinks 'as a provider of
information services.' He gave the partyline, 'as a provider of information
services.' When I am asked about something 'as a small magazine publisher,'
for instance (one of the few things that gets me questioned like that
:), I respond as one. No publisher is gonna let people talk about touchy
issues in an official capacity- it isn't professional and cause _tons_ of
problems for no good reason. Yes, that can be used as a lame excuse,
but there are many times it isn't. 

Grove, on the other hand, has no place making statements like that,
unless Intel has a political science wing I haven't heard of.

I do agree with you on this.
