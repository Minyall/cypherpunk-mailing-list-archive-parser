There are exactly two ways to transmit a signal.  Either you are in
the digital or the analog domain. If you are in the digital domain,
you need a modem, so your device can't be cheaper than a modem. If you
are in the analog domain, you can't get good encryption short of
extremely iffy techniques. (You could, for instance, have a DES chip
putting out data that was used to control analog scramblers, but
synching up the two sides would be hard and waveform information might
be used to reconstruct the signal even without breaking the sequence.)

Given that V.32 class modems are only a couple hundred bucks, and will
soon be only a hundred bucks or so, its hard to imagine how anything
analog that was decent could be cheaper anyway.

You still need a modem. You therefore cannot be cheaper than a modem.

This would not make your machine cheaper., and anyone wanting real
security will sign their Diffie-Hellman exchanges anyway.

Can't be done without shared data, because without shared data you
have no way of even knowing who you are talking to.

Oh?
