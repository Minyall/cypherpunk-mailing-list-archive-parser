This is what would concern me.  Limbaugh seems to be big on knee-jerk
reactions.  Has he got some intelligent insights on the Clipper issue,
or is it simply another case of "Bill's fer it so I'm agin it!"  A
well-constructed argument might convince people on both sides, crying
"Hey, it's a LIBERAL idea, it MUST be bad!" is likely to lose more
support than it gains.
