If this isn't Detweiler, it's certainly someone trying to look like
him.  The quoted message demonstrates some familiarity with his
epistolary style; note also the tmp/TMP `coincidence'.  I have to
conclude that the "whoever this `detweiler' person is" opener is
disingenuous (as well as being stylistically similar to an12070's
attempts to distance himself from "his colleague" Detweiler), and that
tmp@netcom.com is probably the Blight itself.
