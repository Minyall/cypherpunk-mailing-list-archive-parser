An astonishing bit of Internet provincial fuckheadedness, I must say!
When one considers that there are _many_ other nets that gate into
Internet these days and innumerable store-and-forward host systems whose
message handling processes are _completely_ beyond the control of the
end user (even smug Cypherpunk geniuses), this attitude mystifies me.

 Uu> I recommend that you always use the wimsey (extropia) remailer as the
 Uu> first (or only) leg of a remailer chain.  It is also the only
 Uu> Cypherpunks remailer outside the USA (it's in Canada) which will make
 Uu> tracing msgs a little more difficult for USA authorities.

That remail@extropia.wimsey.com is in Canada specifically makes
communications with it fair game for NSA interception, however.
