The reason the internet standards process works so well
is because there is usually no money involved.

On this matter, there is money.

Every example I gave, where the standards setting process
failed, is because lagging players want bad standards.
It is in their financial interest.

Secondly, the Internet Standards process is itself 
a substitute for the marketplace in a non money
environment.  Netscape is working in the real
marketplace.
