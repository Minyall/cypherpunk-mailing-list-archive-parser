Obviously none of these questions are answerable:  So what?

If you are arguing that intangibles do not exist, and therefore
cannot affect real things, then this is obviously false.

No it should not be "clarified and examined" or you will wind up 
with the supreme court declaring that such and such an act should
dock your reputation thirty points, and that it is cruel and unusual
punishment for people to have their reputations docked for acts
committed more than seven years ago.

We already know what reputations are.  "Defining" them is going
to make them into meaningless nominalist hot air.

Not that similar, which is why they did not call it reputation.

Since a reputation is not a digital signature or token this is not
a sensible question.  A reputation belongs to a person identified
by signature or token.

No.

That is why corporations like to have one logo on all their products.

Life's a bitch, and then you die.

If your on line personality is selling something, it would seem highly
desirable to have dossiers built up about it.
