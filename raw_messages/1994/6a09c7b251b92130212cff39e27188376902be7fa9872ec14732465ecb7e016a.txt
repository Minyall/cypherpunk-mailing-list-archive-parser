Oh, am I stupid.  Someone mentioned having lent his Schneier to
someone.  Hmmm.  I wondered what book that would be, maybe I
would want to buy a copy.

So I charged off to look in the bibliography in Applied Cryptography.
Strange, there are some articles listed by him, but nothing seems
to fit, yet this book is so new...

In any event, I really am enjoying Applied Cryptography, by Bruce
Schneier.  You could have lent your copy of it...

-kb, the Kent who can be so slow
