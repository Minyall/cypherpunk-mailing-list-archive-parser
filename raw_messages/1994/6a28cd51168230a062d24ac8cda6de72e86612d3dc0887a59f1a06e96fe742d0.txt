In an article on clari.news.gov.usa, Sen. Patrick Leahy was mentioned
as a possible candidate for Supreme Court nomination.

From reading his comments, it would appear he's capable of thinking
critically regarding privacy and commerce issues.  Would it make
sense to encourage his nomination, where we might have an ally on
the Supreme Court, or to discourage it and leave him in charge of
the committees?

Who's likely to succeed Leahy in the telecommunications committee,
and do we know their stance on Clipper?
