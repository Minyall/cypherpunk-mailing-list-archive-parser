This is not an accurate comparison. A posting on usenet is not the same 
item as a program on HBO or the radio. In what way does my internet provider 
(netcom) have a "legal" distribution of usenet news, while a cd-rom 
provider does not? HBO has paid for the use of the programs it broadcasts 
that are produced by others, hence they have a contract between 
themselves and the owners of the copyright. No providers of usenet news 
have any agreements between themselves and the posters regarding 
copyrights. Netcom and all the other internet providers receive postings 
"free" and a cd-rom manufacturer has the same "right" to use postings as 
any other internet provider.
