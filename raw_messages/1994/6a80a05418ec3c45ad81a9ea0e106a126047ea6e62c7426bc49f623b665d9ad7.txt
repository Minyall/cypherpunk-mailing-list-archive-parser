a cellular phone that is turned on is in periodic contact with
the local antenna.  certainly the cellular provider knows what
cell a mobile phone is in; that's how calls are directed.  in
fact, anyone can monitor the paging channel to make a primitive
tracking device.  (some folks on this list know much more about
this ... perhaps they'll speak up.)
