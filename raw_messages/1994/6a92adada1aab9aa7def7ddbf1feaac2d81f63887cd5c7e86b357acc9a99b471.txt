Along with many others, Peter Wayner discusses craching DES:

I really don't understand what the concern is here.  We all
have access to crypto that is much stronger than single DES.
Anybody who is using single DES for something so important,
that it is worthwhile to spend 100 supercomputer days to
crack it, is really such an idiot that they deserve whatever
they get.
