	I've been setting up a cypherpunks WWW home page on soda.
	So far I've been linking things into the home page stuff
that's already on soda, and there's a good deal more work to be
done. If you have some of your work available on the soda ftp site, if
you want to make it available, I'd like a little bio info about
yourself, (or your psuedonymous identity).
	So if you would like to send me either HTML pages with
information or the proper URL so I can put in a link to your
information, that would be great.

	Other suggestions for links are appreciated as well.

(The cypherpunks URL is ftp://soda.berkeley.edu/pub/cypherpunks/Home.html)
