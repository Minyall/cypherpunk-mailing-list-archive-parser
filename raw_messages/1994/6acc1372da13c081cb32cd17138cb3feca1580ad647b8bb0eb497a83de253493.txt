I'm not so kind as others on this list.

I think people should live consistent with their philosophy and what 
they advocate.
Many times arguments are useless and only experience serves to convince.
I wouldn't try to convert another from their faith just because it 
would do me good.
As long as it's possible to find alternate methods of doing the same 
thing (in this case achieving privacy), I wouldn't try too hard to save 
Liberals from themselves.
I think they deserve to use Clipper.
