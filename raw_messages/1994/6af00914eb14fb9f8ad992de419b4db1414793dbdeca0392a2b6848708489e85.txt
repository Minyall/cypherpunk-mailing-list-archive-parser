If you think the Detweiler thread is bad...take a look at
"IRC: Who's harassing who?" on alt.best.of.internet, among several other
groups. There's over 200K of an absolutely hilarious netwar there, which
began as an argument on IRC and ended up with death threats, threats of
lawsuits, mail to sysadmins...
