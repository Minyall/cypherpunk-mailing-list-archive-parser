If I use your logic, a published article in a magazine becomes public domain 
because it has become available to a large number of subscribers.

Tangible difference...  Lets see...  A CD-ROM can be duplicated and sold 
for profit, and doing so with net archives violates the copyrights of any 
message author who cares to file class action or personal...  Who did you 
say had that archive, and were they selling it?
