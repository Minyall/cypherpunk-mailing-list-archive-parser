Anyone who posts (without a previously allocated ID) seems to get one. The ID's
are generated ad hoc, they're penet pseudonyms. I did a who cypherpunks to 
identify the culprit, but found this:
na97762@anon.penet.fi

As I recall, naXXX addresses are _not_ double-blinded? Maybe this used to be an
anXXX?
