Thanks to all who responded to my question.

The answer is:  csrc.ncsl.nist.gov

Also, apparently, source for DES was in Appendix A of the file  
"/pub/nistpubs/fips181.txt".  However, it was removed and replaced with  
the following:

                                                 Appendix A

This section contained a listing of the source code referenced in the
Automated Password Generator Standard.  This section is not available
in electronic form.

Complete copies of FIPS 181, including this appendix, may be purchased
in hardcopy from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS) via
mail or telephone.

I wonder if they'll ship to an address outside of the US or Canada?  I  
wonder if the people who package and mail the stuff even look at it?
