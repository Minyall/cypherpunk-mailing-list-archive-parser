I have heard from the (one of the?) author(s) of Mac Eudora, on another
list, that full support for ViaCrypt PGP will be added to the commercial
version of Eudora in the spring.  And probably PEM support too. It's
unclear to me when (if ever :(  ) this will be added to the free version of
Eudora, or if 2.6ui (the only free (although semi-legal) version of Eudora
to support applescript) will be supported to.  I still haven't figured out
if ViaCrypt MacPGP uses the same applescript suite as MacPGP 2.6ui, which
is the neccesary detail there.

I found that exciting, and thought others might be interested in hearing
it. Or at least consider this post a welcome reprive from the Mandatory
Signature Wars.
