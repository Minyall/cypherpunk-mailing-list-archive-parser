Perry (and other c'punks),

  I don't think the mechanism employed by the hacker is using "who" at 
all.  Rather, it is someone who is subscribed to the list and has a 
program which looks at the author of each message to see if it is someone 
already in their database.  If it is someone new, it automatically sends 
a message for that person into the anon service.  If not, it simply 
ignores the message.  There are LOTS of silent listeners on the list and 
it could be ANY of them.  Stoping this is not going to be easy.  I don't 
suppose Julf@penet.fi would be interested in recording the name of the 
site where all these requests are originating?  Any other ideas?
