              PGPSHELL VERSION 3.0 PROGRAM RELEASE


PGPShell, a front-end DOS program for use with Philip Zimmermann's
Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) public-key encryption software, has just
been upgraded and released as version 3.0.

PGPShell incorporates easy to use, mouse-driven menus and a unique Key
Management Screen to easily display all public key ring information in
a flash.  PGP encryption will never be the same again!  Breeze through
PGP UserID's, KeyID's, Fingerprints, E-mail addresses, Signature's,
Trust Parameter's, and PGP's Validity ratings all in one screen, at one
place, and with a single mouse-click.


PGPShell is archived as pgpshe30.zip at many Internet sites including
garbo.uwasa.fi:/pc/crypt and oak.oakland.edu:/pub/msdos/security and has
been posted to the FidoNet Software Distribution Network (SDN) and should
be on all nodes carrying SDN in a week or so.

To immediately acquire version 3.0 by modem you can call the
Hieroglyphic Voodoo Machine BBS at +1 303 443 2457 or the GrapeVine BBS at
