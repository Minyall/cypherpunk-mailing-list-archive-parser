Most compression programs add a characteristic signature to the beginning
of the compressed output file.  If a cryptanalyst guesses that you may
be compressing before encrypting, wouldn't this make his job easier?
To me, this sounds as though you're adding a known bit of "plaintext" to
the start of each message.

If you're encrypting files that you wish to store securely you could just
clip off the signature, I suppose.  But this would be unsuitable for sending
messages, because your compression program is now incompatible with everyone
else's.

Or am I missing something?
