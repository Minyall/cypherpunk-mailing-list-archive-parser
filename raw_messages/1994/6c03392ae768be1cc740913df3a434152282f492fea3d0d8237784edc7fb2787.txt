The list software that Ray Cromwell wrote for the Extropians list
does all these things.

Users can exclude [user|thread] and receive a regular ( I think
daily) list of filtered msgs. Users can also set their own mode
of receiving the list (reflected or digest), and can temporarily
unsubscribe by excluding all. About the only intervention needed
by list management is for subscribes and permanent unsubscribes,
other than general maintenance.

The list also has a security feature that when turned on only accepts
posts from addresses previously authenticated as belonging to list
members. This can still be spoofed, but at much greater difficulty
than LD has had to expend heretofore.
