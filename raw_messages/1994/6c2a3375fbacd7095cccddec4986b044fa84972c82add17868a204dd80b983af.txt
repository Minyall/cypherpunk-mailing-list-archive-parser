  A friend of mine that repaired computers said he ran across an
  old disk drive that was used in WWII.  The thing had a lever on
  the top that was to be pulled should anyone "burst in" unannounced.
  As a failsafe to protect our secrets the lever was the trigger of
  a mounted .38.  
  
  Are we "good" American citizens going to have to write failsafe boot 
  files that require a special combination of keypresses or it erases 
  the hard disk?  It would be a shame to have to protect our computers 
  from the "thought police" of not Orwell's future, but our present!

  At least opressed countries have governments that break in and take
  your computer and family because they are lowlife dictators and 
  admit it.  Here the same lowlife dictator wannabes do it in the name
  of democracy and justice! (Not that I'd like living elsewhere.)
