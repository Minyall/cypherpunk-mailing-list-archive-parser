No, we need another FLA:
TPMD: Terrorists, Pedophiles, Money-Launderers, and Drug-dealers.
 
The Treasury's IRS and Customs collectors are really concerned
that the rich will evade their fair share of taxes. We'll
accomplish something if we can discredit tax collection.
 
Billions of unregulated dollars will destabilize foreign
democracies. Corrupt regimes may enact strict bank secrecy
laws. These new evil dictators may not cooperate with income
tax investigations. Send the Marines and the ATF now!!!
 
Yes, a horde of Islamic fundamentalist, child molesting,
dope smoking, welfare chiseling tax cheaters may soon cross
our borders. There is only one way to repel this invasion.
We must give up our infantile obsession with Liberty.
 
The President's responsible leadership with the Clipper chip
and Digital Telephony will protect us from certain doom.
Let's unite under Uncle Sam's infobahn jackboot, install
Big Brother's interactive video cameras in our homes, and
embrace the new national socialist health I.D. internal
passports without complaint. Then we can be happy.
