I'd be interested in a T-shirt with the "safety in large numbers" design
that was on the back of the cypherpunks criminal shirt, but I didn't get
that shirt because of the "CRIMINAL!!" bit.  It seemed a little too shrill.

I was a criminal for years.  Lately, I've been relatively law-abiding.

How about putting the lightning bolts over the large numbers?
