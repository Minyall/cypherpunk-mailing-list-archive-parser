With a fair number of remailers down lately, I thought that I'd announce
my remailer. It's been running for a long time now, and I still haven't 
got PGP to work. The remailer is rperkins@nyx.cs.du.edu. 

No logs are kept by me of this service. Aburt, the operator does not know
about the remailer, but if he asks me to remove it, I will.
