It does.  I saw something about in Popular Science, I think.  It 
strategically placed microphones to triangulate the origin of the shots.

There aren't many sounds that are really that similar to gun shots.  For 
one thing most rounds are supersonic unlike firecrackers and car backfires.
There really is no such thing as a "silencer" outside of the movies.  
*Sound supressors* work marginally well for subsonic rounds.  They are 
pretty much useless for supersonic rounds.

Please.  This is the purest nonsense.  The microphone system only works 
well enough to get the cops to the general vacinity of the shooting.  
However the real issue is legal presumptions and liability.  Ain't gonna 
happen here pardner.
