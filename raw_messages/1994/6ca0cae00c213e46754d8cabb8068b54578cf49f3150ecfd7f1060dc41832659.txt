Did the processes get killed BECAUSE you logged off ?
Or did they get killed because you left a single process runnning in the
background for an extended period of time and an automated script killed the
job.  Why not ask the sysadmin how to setup a long computational job for a
couple of days ?  I don't think any sysadmin would have a problem with that.
Then you could find out if the jobs are killed automatically somehow.

If it turns out that it was just the process that was automatically killed
on a time interval, then you could easily write a script that would spawn a
new process and then kill the parent.
