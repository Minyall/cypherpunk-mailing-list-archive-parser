I am not a good enough cardplayer to want to play any kind of cards
for money.

however, if you implement a backgammon playing protocol (and there 
already is one in the public domain ... probably more than one) I
will not only do my best to pick it apart, but I will play anyone
else who is willing, for real (electronicized) money.
