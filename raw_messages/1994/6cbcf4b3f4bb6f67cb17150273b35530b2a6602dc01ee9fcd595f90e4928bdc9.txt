C'punks in the New York City area,

Are you interested in having a Cypherpunks physical meeting at
(aprox.) the same time as the SF Bay Area Meeting?  Is there
anyone in the area who can volunteer a venue?  Alison Armitage of
Acapulco H.E.A.T. wants to attend.

Please let me know your thoughts via private e-mail.  Please
include your phone number.

Thanks,


 S a n d y

P.S.  I lied about Alison Armitage.
