You should be able to get PGP 2.6 from either
ftp.netcom.com:/pub/mpj
or
ftp.wimsey.bc.ca:/pub/crypto/software/dist/US_or_Canada_only_XXXXXXXX/PGP/2.6

for wimsey
cd /pub/crypto/software
read the README file
if you agree to the conditions follow the instructions contained in that file.

for ftp.netcom.com
cd /pub/mpj
read the file README.MPJ
and follow the instructions.
(the version of PGP 2.6 on wimsey is an image of the version from netcom).
