That's the way it's supposed to be.  What happens in practice - not
specifically with Microsoft or McCaw [I don't want to hear from the
platoons of lawyers. ;-)] - is that the big guys run down to Washington, 
pull a few strings, make a few contributions, and ask the government 
to use its resources and force to ensure that the corporate-desired 
outcome results.

I remember when patents and copyrights were _privileges_ granted to
encourage creativity and there was no such thing as "intellectual
_property_".

I remember a time when the idea of a royalty-tax on blank tapes to 
pay for presumed copyright infringement was regarded as crazy.
