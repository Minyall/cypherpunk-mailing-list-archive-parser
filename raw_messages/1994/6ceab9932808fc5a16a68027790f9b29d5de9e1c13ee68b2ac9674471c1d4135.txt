"Ver are yur paypers?"  

I lost them.
I'm an illegal alien.  I don't have any.
I'm a foreign tourist.
I forget.
I'm homeless.
I'm an anarchist (a recognized alternative life/style) and I don't        
  believe in such things.
My dog ate them.
As a product of the public schools, I couldn't read them so I must have   
       thrown them away.
Where are your papers?
