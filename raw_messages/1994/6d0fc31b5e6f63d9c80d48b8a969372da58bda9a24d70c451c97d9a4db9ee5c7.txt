Unfortunately, for now, we only support cert's directly issued from the
imbedded CA's. One level deeper is not trustworthy in any case, unless you make
the user define trust. That requires a GUI and we haven't done that yet.

We agree, and someday this won't be a problem.

I didn't bother imbedding the RSA Unaffiliated User CA because I didn't think
server operators would use it to get certificates.
