		HOW TO READ NEWSPEAK

On Sun, 17 Jul 1994, Sue D. Nym forwarded an AP story:

Nope, it's the $20 note.  However, "money launders" prefer the more
compact C-note.  And anyone leaving the country with much cash is
presumptively a money launder, nowadays.

Read, "computer readable."

Read, "At some unspecified date, old U.S. currency will be demonetized,
devalued or recalled.  Those holding old currency will be given a short
grace period to exchange old cash for new.  When making the exchange, they
will be required to present ID and, explain why they have cash and where
they got it.  Improperly explained cash will be confiscated and the 
holder my be charged as appropriate."

Don't believe it?  What did Johnson say just before silver was removed 
from US coinage?  For bonus points, what did Nixon say two weeks before 
he closed the gold window to foreigners and devalued the dollar?  

If you know the correct way to read government pronouncements, you will 
rarely be caught off guard.
