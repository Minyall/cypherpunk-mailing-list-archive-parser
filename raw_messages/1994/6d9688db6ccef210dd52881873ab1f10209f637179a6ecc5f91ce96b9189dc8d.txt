With FLIR you have SLIR  OTH UV  LOW LIGHT  from the military (Billy boy
is itching to deploy here in the good ole USA). Remote Sensing RADAR SONAR
Stealth RADAr, Remote Imaging SYStems all kinds of goodies coming home.
TO do what..fight crime..Yeah right. I remember law and order Nixon.
  Cryptography is the least of your problems. A high tech military is
coming home and Billy wants to put them to use on our streets..>!!!
He just loves gadgets. Dissent may become passse' in America.
