   Frankly, I agree.

<gasp!>  That's a [my] change from a few years ago, eh?

   The NSA will either adapt or die -- it seems to be trying to die right
   now rather than adapt, but thats not our problem.

Cautionary note here, Perry.  People who feel that have no choices
often don't care if the only choice they see is a bad one.  Hitler
[yeah, yeah, I know] convinced the German people that all their
choices were bad, but his was best.  They killed a few people -- it
was in all the papers at the time.

What can crypto do to counteract fascism?  Especially given that
crypto will be used as an excuse for said fascism.  You could argue
that it is already, but if you'll notice, the public reasoning for
Clipper never includes "Clipper exists to displace ubiquitious public
key crypto".
