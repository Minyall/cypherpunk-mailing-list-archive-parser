Uhh, gee; given that I've seen neural networks implemented on
conventional computer systems, and as far as I know those were
perfectly functional (if slow) neural networks, I think that pretty
much proves it (as if it needed to be).

I'd say that the burden of proof is to demonstrate that there are
algorithms implementable on a neural network which are unimplementable
on a Turing machine.  That'd be a pretty significant breakthrough.

Complexity theory doesn't have anything to do with any world, macro-
or micro- or mega- or whatever.  It's mathematics.
