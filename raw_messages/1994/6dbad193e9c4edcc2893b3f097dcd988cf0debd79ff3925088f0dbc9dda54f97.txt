     Well, I don't know what it means. If you'd care to tell me, even in
mail, I'd like to know. I've been following this thread with interest, but
I don't pretend to follow this X(f(y)) notation all the time. I understand
that it means we are applying function X to the result of f(y)... Anyone
who's passed Trig or Elem. Functions does. I don't understand what
function O(x) represents.
