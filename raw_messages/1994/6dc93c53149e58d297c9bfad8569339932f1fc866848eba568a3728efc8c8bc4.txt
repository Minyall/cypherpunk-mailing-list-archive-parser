I have been informed, (by phoning the NY office) that the person to
contact at the ACM regarding amicus briefs is:

	Lillian Israel israel@acm.org

I would urge all cypherpunks who are acm members to email her, requesting
that the ACM file an amicus brief in the Schlafly V. PKP case. If we
want those patents invalidated, a strong position by the ACM as experts
on software and software patents can only help.
