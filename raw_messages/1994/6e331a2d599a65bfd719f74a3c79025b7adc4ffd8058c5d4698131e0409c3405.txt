It seems to me that Mikolaj Habryn's original posting was taken out of
context.  He made a valid point that so called un-interpretable and
un-alterable algorithms are routinely cracked by elite warez d00dz.  He
never implied that the software crackers were going to render your PGP key
insecure.

In fact, he began this thread by citing someone who was talking about using
an obscured algorithm to prevent digital cash double spending.  (ie. If you
can't get to the algorithm, you can't cheat the system.)  His comments were
on the dangers of relying on this.

That's the point.  Mikolaj was _never_ referring to cryptographic security.
He was pointing out how security through obscuring algorithms can never be
considered reliable.

Extinguishing a match with a fire-hose,
