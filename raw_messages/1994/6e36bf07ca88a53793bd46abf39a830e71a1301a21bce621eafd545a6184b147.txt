       The administration is willing to consider alternatives to
       Clipper that are based upon nonclassified algrithms, and where
       the escrow agents are not government agencies.

    Hmm.  If the escrow agent isn't a government entity, then what sort of
    coercion will they have over that agent in order to get the keys in a
    timely fashion?

My guess is that this means that a ``quasi-government corporation''
would be acceptable to the administration.  In other words, they're
willing to play word games in an attempt to placate people as long as
they get what they were after in the first place.
