Derivative securites. Usually "derived" from some base securities,
commodities, or other derivatives. Options, futures, swaps, and other
synthetic trading instruments of varying degrees of liquidity and
fungibility are all derivative instruments.

Someone who does valuation of fixed income or derivative securities
based on mathematical models. Its a bit of a fuzzy term.

Well, presumably hedging, futures and insurance markets can be used to
offset political risks.

Everyone should know a bit about the securities markets -- an educated
individual owes it to themselves to understand them.
