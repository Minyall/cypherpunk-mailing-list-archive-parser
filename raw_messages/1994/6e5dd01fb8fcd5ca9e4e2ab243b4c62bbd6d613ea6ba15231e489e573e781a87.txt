Peter,

Thanks for posting your thoughts on this.

A small note:  The NY Times article today said that NSA will 
contribute $4.2 million toward *development*, along with 
$400,000 in software-consulting services, while Cray will 
invest another $4.8 million.  Thus the overall cost, after full 
development, may be more than you assumed in your calculations 
and thus the power may be more.

But, as the story said, Cray will need more than this initial 
contract to survive, so the machine may never be completed.

John
