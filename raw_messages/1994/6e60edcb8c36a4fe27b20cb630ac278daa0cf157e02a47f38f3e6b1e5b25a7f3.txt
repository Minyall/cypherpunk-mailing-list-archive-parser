Again, not a flame, just a warning to be more careful.  I really didn't mind
in this case; however, you might be likely to find someone who would be in
others.

Granted.  However, I'm unfortunately not a developer for a mail package,
which means I can only offer you a stopgap.

However, since writing you, I did remember another resource.  There's a
commercial mailer called ZMail which is being talked about in alt.security.pgp. 
It's supposedly extensible, and Guy Berliner has written scripts for it
which put an "Encrypt" and "Decrypt" button on his mailer's toolbar.

Noticing you're from Spry, however, I may be encouraging you to use a
competitor's package.  Perhaps you could wield some influence to get the
Internet-in-a-Box developers to integrate PGP into their mailer?

Unfortuantely, no.  I got it directly from Mike Meyer.  I can send you a
copy via mail if you're interested.
