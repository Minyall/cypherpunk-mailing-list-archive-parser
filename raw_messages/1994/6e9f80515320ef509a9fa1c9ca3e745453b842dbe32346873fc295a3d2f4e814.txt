I think the victims of Mr. Sternlight's accusations of patent infringement
may have a cause of action against him for libel.  Any thoughts on this
issue from the other lawyers on this list?  Duncan?  Black Unicorn?  A 
few legal shots across the bow might help Mr. Sternlight see his crusade 
in a sterner light.
