The police can listen in LEGALLY anyway. However, illegal monitoring,
which they are used to being able to do, is becoming increasingly
difficult. Illegal monitoring increasingly requires the active
cooperation of phone company employees who may talk.

Clipper, combined with the FBI Digital Telephony bill, would eliminate
this difficulty, and in fact provide monitoring abilities to the
police that they never had before.
