	Which reminds me..

	_Full Disclosure_ is an excellent little magazine put out by
Bill Vajk, someone I knew marginally while I was living in Chicago. (I
first heard about my file at the Secret Service when Bill & Karl [my
sysadmin on the public access system in chicago (mcs.com.. plugplug)
were researching an article on Len Rose. ;-)
