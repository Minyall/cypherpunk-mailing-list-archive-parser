Has anyone heard of BlackNet? BlackNet is in the business of buying, selling,
trading, and otherwise dealing  with information in all its many forms. 

Through PGP and anonymous remailers, the folks at BlackNet plan to create a
huge black market in data: trade secrets, processes, production methods,
nanotechnology, privacy databases, and chemical manufacturing.

The only way to get in is to find a BlackNet-oriented message (one with the
BlackNet PGP key), then respond to it, using anonymous remailers and PGP. 

It might be found in <alt.extropians> or <alt.fan.davidsternlight>. If anyone
knows about this [or their address/key], please send.
