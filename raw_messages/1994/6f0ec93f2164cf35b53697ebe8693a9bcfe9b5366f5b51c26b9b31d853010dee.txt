   Is "indistinguishability" the point or "interoperability"?

Reference is not advocacy.

I was speaking of what was necessary to ensure indistinguishability.
If that is your goal, then this is directly relevant.  If not, then it
may be beside the point.

The change in version numbers seems to have two effects, both of which
I addressed.  Use these statements as they are appropriate to your
goals.

P.S. The "you" is the general "you".
