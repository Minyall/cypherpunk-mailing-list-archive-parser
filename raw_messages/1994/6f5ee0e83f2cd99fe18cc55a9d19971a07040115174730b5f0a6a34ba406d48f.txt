  I'm going to look at this in the light of past cases with reporters:  
When a judge demanded the names of informants/sources, and reporters 
declined, they got slapped with Contempt of Court charges.

  This rarely happens anymore, since reporters get some defense from the 
Bill of Rights.  But for us, in these days of cutting edge legal battles, 
we could come out on the bottom.  Had that student refused his key, they 
could have probably charged him with CofP, and kept that charge in place 
even after they had broken the key.

  "It's better not to get caught than to frustrate the feds with evidence 
they don't understand."
