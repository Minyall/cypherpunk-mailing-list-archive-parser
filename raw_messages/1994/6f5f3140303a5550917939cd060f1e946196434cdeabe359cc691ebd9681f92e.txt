That's what I mean.  "Usually" they are, but that helps a snooper to
check his guess.  Maybe it would be wise when using limited-length
session keys to use larger encryption exponents just to confound an
exhaustive search of the session key space.  I think it is surprising
if there is no limitation on encryption exponent size for these
exportable key systems, assuming that is the strategy the government is
using.
