Sure it does. Because the Supreme Court interprets the Constitution in a
way that's binding on all American government.

Take voting for example. The Constitution doesn't mention your right
to vote. The Supreme Court says your right to vote is implied by the
Constitution. Now, are you ready to assert that the Supreme Court is wrong
about this?

I thought not.
