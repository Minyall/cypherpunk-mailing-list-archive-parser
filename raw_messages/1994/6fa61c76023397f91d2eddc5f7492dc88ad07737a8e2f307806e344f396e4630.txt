I went to soda the other day, 
  and found the cypherpunk FAQ. 
I thought there are more FAQs about cypherpunks 
  the FAQ at soda is 44 bytes.
It says "When is this going to be done" 
  (or something to that effect.)
I went back to soda today, 
  and found a new directory.
mailing_list contains two files
  one of which mentions the cpunks FAQ.
The FAQ is still 44 bytes.

I saw TC May's message some weeks old,
  > but his partners in crime^H^H^H^H^H
                             ~~~~~~~~~~
I don't know what mail software he used
  but it's obvious he was trying to 
delete the word 'crime'
 I guess that ^H was not the best way ;-)
 
No, this is not my poem, it's just
  a creative editor bug (feature?)
bursting with expression. Sorry.
