Subject: REMAIL: Supported Header Lines

Somebody is bombarding my remailer with messages saying
"Anon-To: remailer@somewhere..."  Obviously someone is trying to chain 
their message through several remailers.  The problem is, my remailer 
only supports the following header formats:

X-Anon-To: user@host
Request-Remailing-To: user@host

The unsuccessful attempts show up in my inbox and it's getting annoying.  
I feel like after 50 messages, I'm allowed to say I'm annoyed!
