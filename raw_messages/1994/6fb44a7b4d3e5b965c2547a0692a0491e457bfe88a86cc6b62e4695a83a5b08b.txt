Just another release of Pretty Good PGP Shell:
 
PGS v0.99e is the bug fix for the public beta version of PGS v0.99d.
PGS is a very good shell for PGP. PGS has an advanced keyring management
system and reads keyring it selves!!! PGS is very easy to use!
PGS supports PGP versions 2.3a 2.6MIT 2.6ui.
And ViaCrypt PGP versions 2.4 and 2.7.
 
Special requirements: 80286 or up.
 
Changes: A few minor bugs where fixed. The major memory leak in the key
information section has been fixed. Because some users did have some
problem with PGS changing the color pallet a new color mode has build in
that uses standard (STD) colors. It is now possible to save the color
mode (PGS, STD (default) or MONO) in the configuration file.
