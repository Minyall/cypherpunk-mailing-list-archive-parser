I created the list remailer-operators@c2.org.

The intent of this list is so that remailer-operators who don't have
enough time to keep up with the list can keep up with remailer news
and updates, and maybe discussion.

There has been some discussion on the list about how this may have
been tried before. If it has been I must've missed it. But it was said
that in the earlier attempt it didn't work because there was no need
for such a list. In such case, the list remailer-operators will not be
used, but I have created it, so that if it may be useful, then it will
be.
