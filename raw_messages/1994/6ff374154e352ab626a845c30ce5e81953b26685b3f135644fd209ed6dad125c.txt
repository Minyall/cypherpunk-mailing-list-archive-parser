Right on.  And as Eric pointed out on May 14, ``Misallocation of
attention leads one down false trails.  Who has the excess brainpower
for that waste?''

But their power comes from their clients --- the hundred million of
our ``friends and neighbors'' who plot and scheme to wield these
agencies on their behalf.

The agencies are just, well, agents.  Remove them and their principals
will immediately erect new ones in their place.  Who are their
principals?  They are legion: Every person who solicits their services
or even just gratuitously accepts their services.

There's nothing wrong with Duncan's proposal to distinguish
``Government'' from ``government'', just so it's understood that
``Government'' includes most of the population.

Yes.  We cannot afford to misperceive it if we hope to successfully
defend ourselves against it.
