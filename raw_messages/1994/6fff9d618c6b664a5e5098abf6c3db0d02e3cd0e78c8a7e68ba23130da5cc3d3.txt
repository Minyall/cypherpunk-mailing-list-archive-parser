Eric argues simply that you can't get rid of annonymity, and he is correct in the 
strict logic of his aguement against the current technological background.

What neither of you discuss is your actual concern, which is that of having
some way to rapidly access the factual content of a message.  Instead
of addressing that problem, you rail against anonymity.  

In current discourse one often sees symbolic or subsitute issues
being discussed, so that the underlying discourd is obscured, 
ignored, and unresolved.  

Lions that stalk shadows remain hungry.
