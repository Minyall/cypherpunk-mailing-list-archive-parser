Read Ken Thompson's Turing Award lecture for why that isn't
sufficient. Its quite amusing.

Lets face it -- if you are truly paranoid, you have to carry your
machine around with you at all times and chain it to you.

Its all a question of threat model. For national security type attacks
nothing less than "chain machine to wrist" will do. For stopping a
casual attack, much less is needed. Its all in the threat model...
