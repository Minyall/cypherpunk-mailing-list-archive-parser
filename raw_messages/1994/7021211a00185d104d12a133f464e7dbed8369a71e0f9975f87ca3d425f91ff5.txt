Unless you use some sort of stego software, most encrypted stuff is 
pretty easy to figure out that it *is* encrypted.  grep " BEGIN PGP " 
message is a pretty good way to detect PGP traffic, magic numbers will 
tell you if it's a compressed file or not, etc.  It might not be 
necessary to prove what you were using to encrypt, merely proving that 
you *were* encrypting might be sufficient.

It's like the FCC: if they catch a ham sending out packets, and the FCC 
can't read them, they issue you a pink slip.  Doesn't matter what you're 
using, the meaning is obscured, and that's enough for them.
