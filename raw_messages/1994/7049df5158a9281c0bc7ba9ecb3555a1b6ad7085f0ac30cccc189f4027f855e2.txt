Hi y'all.

A client of mine has lost the password to a Microsoft Word v6
document. I've found stuff on the net to crack Wordperfect, and
pointers to stuff to crack Lotus 1-2-3, Quatro-Pro, MS Excel and
Paradox, but nothing on Microsoft Word. Does Word use real
cryptography, or does someone out there have a way to break it pretty
quickly?
