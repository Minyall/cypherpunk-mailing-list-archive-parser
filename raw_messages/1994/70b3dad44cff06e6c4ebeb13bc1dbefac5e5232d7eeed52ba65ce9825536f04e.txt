Is it just me or is toad.com delaying messages and sending them out in
random order?  For example, I noticed one post dated 18:00 EST got here
at 19:30 EST.  The next post, however, was timestamped just before noon
(with a received header confirming it was actually received by toad.com
at 11:52 PST)...  Two posts later there is one from 10:30 PST...
My last post took nearly 10 hours to appear on the list, while other
posts are getting thru almost immediately.  I hope Eric hasn't been
experimenting with his no-PGP-sig=delay software; it seems to be stuck
in a time-warp...

Now if we could only get our anonymous remailers to send messages in
this fashion we'd give the NSA a real headache trying to track the
messages. :)

Sorry to nit-pick...(I'm sure Eric has had enough problems with the list
and doesn't need any more) but I thought I was going crazy when I
started seeing responses to posts that hadn't been made yet (the person
had emailed the message to someone, CC: cypherpunks and the response
appeared on the list before the original!)
