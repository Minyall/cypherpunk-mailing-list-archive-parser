Several times people have made comments about there not being an
archive of old mail, or that it was not practical to index it.  For the
record, again, there is a database, it is indexed, and it is fast.

Eric Johnson has put one together as:

Please don't think that you used to be safe doing something illegal on
this list and that you no longer are.  That would be foolish.
