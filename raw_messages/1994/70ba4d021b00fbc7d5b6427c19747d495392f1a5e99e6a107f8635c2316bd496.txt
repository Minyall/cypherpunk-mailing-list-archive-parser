	I've written a small anonymous mail service, and it's now
available for testing. There's no security, and I'll be keeping logs,
so don't think that it's secure, in any way. It's also running on a
PPP link which isn't connected all the time, so it's rather flaky.
	(I'll set it up as a real service once I get a real link-- if
anyone else wants to do it, they're welcome to use my code.)

	How to get an anonymous account:

	Send mail to admin@infinity.hip.berkeley.edu -- include in the
message a login, a "Full Name", a choice of remailer, and an encrypted
return address block encrypted with that remailer's public key.
	I'll set it up.

	How the anonymous account works:

	Someone will send mail to
login@infinity.hip.berkeley.edu. Then the system looks up in a table
which remailer is associated with that login. It then sends out mail
to that remailer, starting with the contents of the encrypted return
address block, then a "##" and then all of the message to
login@infinity, with "Received" lines taken out.

	Thus once the message gets to the last remailer of the chain
in the encrypted return block, the ## pasts the identifying
information of the person mailing to login@infinity.hip in the header
of the message. (It *should* do that...) If the person mailing to the
infinity address would like anonymity he/she should use an anon-mailer
on his/her end.

The encrypted-return address you send me should look like:

::
Encrypted: PGP

- -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
etc.

	Make sure you include that ::/Encrypted or the remailer which
gets it won't know that it's PGP encrypted.

	Remember, this is just setup for testing. Don't use it for
real applications.
