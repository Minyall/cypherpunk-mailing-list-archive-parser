It's my personal feeling that Netscape doesn't have the right talent mix to
develop *any* Internet software, secure or not.  Although, I have to say,
I've never seen a startup that pissed off so much of the Internet industry
and user community in so short a time.  Even Apple & Microsoft agree that
Netscape is brain dead...
