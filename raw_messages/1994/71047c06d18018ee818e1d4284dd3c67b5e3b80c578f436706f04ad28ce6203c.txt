Odd, but my copy of the Constitution (w/amendments) doesn't even contain
the word "privacy," let alone any mention of a "right to privacy."  (*Damn*
these variorum editions!)  There is the Fourth Amendment, of course, but
the right to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures is not
synonymous with the right to privacy, IMO.

I believe it was in Katz v. U.S. (1967) that the Supreme Court first
enunciated the doctrine of a "reasonable expectation of privacy."  It's
interesting that it took the advent of telecommunications to bring this
issue to the fore -- Katz was a wiretapping case.  Of course,

#define IM_A_LAWYER  FALSE

And I may be wrong about all this, but it's too nice to stay inside and
confirm my facts.  :-)
