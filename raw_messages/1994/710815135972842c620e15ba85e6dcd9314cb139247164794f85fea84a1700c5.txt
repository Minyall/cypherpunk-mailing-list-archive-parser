   If this hadn't been made clear already, then hopefully this will:

	   Our intention is to support any development effort attempting
	   to implement an SSL conformant implementation. We will work with
	   you to repair the spec as needed to eliminate any errors or
	   ommisions, and help you test your implementation to ensure that
	   it interoperates with ours.

It's clear to me.  "We're going to use some security, as long as it's
called SSL and our authorship is on the document."
