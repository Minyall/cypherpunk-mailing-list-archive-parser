List members will be interted in acquiring WORKING ALONE, by Dr. Murray
Felsher (Berkle, NY) just published.  Felsher, a former professor and
former NASA and EPA headquarters scientist, left government employ (that's
quit --- not retired) without paycheck and without pension in 1980.  He
formed an aerospace consulting firm and began publishing newsletters. He
has been so engaged since then --- working alone! WORKING ALONE, now
available at your local bookstore, is comprised of 67 short (1-5 page)
pieces which detail the mindset required to undertake such a venture, and
the experiences encountered along the way...
