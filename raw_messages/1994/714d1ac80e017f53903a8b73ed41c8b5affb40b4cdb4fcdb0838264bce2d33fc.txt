This access method uses httpd, which listens at a different port (tcp 80) on
the server than ftpd.  What this *means* is that ftp is not likely to work with
this address.  Depending upon the local setup, you may/may not be able to ftp
into this site, by way of a different site mapping, and be able to root around
for the file.

However, bear in mind (you need to hack html to grok this issue) that the above
pathname is often relative, rather than absolute.  That is, the httpd daemon
knows where to look to serve you, but may hide the absolute pathname from you,
which may really be something like:
		/var/httpd/foo/foo_files
... which may itself be symlinked elsewhere.

The upshot of this is that you need to get a web browser, like Lynx (sp? I
don't use it; line mode) or xmosaic (which I use and get along with).

Hope this starts to help.
