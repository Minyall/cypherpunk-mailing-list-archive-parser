Well, I don't know if it's useful or not, but for sake of
curiousity/experimentation, I set up a random number server.  Send mail
to mg5n+random@andrew.cmu.edu and it'll spit out 256 bytes of random
data.  :)

The RNG is the same one I use for my remailer.  The random numbers are
generated from (among other things) taking a hash of a listing of the
users who are currently logged-on, so it's impossible to predict what
will come up from one minute to the next.  (Try fingering
@unix.andrew.cmu.edu)

Right.  Always crypto-launder random number files before and after
each use.  :-)

This shouldn't be too hard to do.  Considering many of the remailers
already support PGP, it shouldn't be too much work to modify the current
remailers to take a message, add a date/time, sign it with PGP, and send
it back.
