A Beta test version of OTP-PC is ready for release.

OTP-PC is a MS DOS version of the Vernam One-time pad, an 
unbreakable but somewhat clumsy cipher.

I have added several features to make the one-time pad easier to 
use.

-OTP-PC can use a large pad (codebook) for multiple messages.
 This feature is more efficient than using multiple smaller pads.

-Optional Precompression of the plain text reduces consumption of
 the pad, and masks the size of the original file.

-The portions of the pad used each session are overwritten, both on
 encoding and decoding, to prevent reuse.

-Encoded files have a 2-stage header.  The first stage, an un-
 encrypted "bootstrap", automates the decode process.  The 
 second encrypted header contains more sensitive information.

-A 32 bit CRC (stored in the encrypted header) verifies
 reconstruction of the original file.

-Automatic wiping of intermediate compressed files.

If anyone would like to volunteer to test OTP-PC, and give me any 
suggestions or bug reports, please send me a message.

Please indicate your preference for UUencode, Mime Base64, 
BinHex, or PGP ASCII Armor.

I will send you both the executable and ANSI C (Borland C++ V3.0) 
source code.
