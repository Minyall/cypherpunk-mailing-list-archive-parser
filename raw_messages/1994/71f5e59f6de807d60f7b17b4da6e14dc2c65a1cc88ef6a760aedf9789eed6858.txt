Thanks to some help, I have the Big Brother PostScript but have reduced 
its size so that it is about 1" x 1" or so (no ruler, just a guest).  
This is a perfect size for printing on stickers, letterheads, etc.

If anyone wants a copy, please drop me a line and I'll be happy to mail 
it to you.  If someone at cpsr.org wants to put it up for FTP, please 
also contact me and let me know where to upload it to (or if you want me 
to email it to you.)

[As a side note, I'm thinking of breaking into the lab some night and 
putting these stickers on all of the workstations.  Just thinking about 
it, not actually going to do it :-)]
