Now this is a good idea.   In order to successfully spoof a message, you
would have to block delivery of the spoofed message to the proxy checker
or block transmission of the proxy checker agent's warning.

If you're willing to write the code for it, I'm willing to provide the
machine on the Internet for it to run on.  It shouldn't take too much
effort, but I've already got a gazillion different pots in the fire as is
(not the least of which is getting some c'punk services up on hks.net).
