I did not mean to imply this.  Using daemons would get rid of the
_default_ loging that occurs on systems.  Changing logging from
opt-out to opt-in would make a large practical difference right now.

This was exactly my point in a previous article.  An email address
identifies both a machine and a user, where an IP connection (e.g.
telnet) only reveals the machine.  Now if the sysadmin of the
originating machine logs and shares information with the destination
machine, the user can be identified.  But again, this is an opt-in
monitoring system.
