Well, perhaps that should read _legal_ wiretaps.  At least one defense
lawyer that I'm aware of over on the Well has asserted that "anonymous
informant"'s are frequently (usually?) illegal wiretaps.  This skews
the economics enormously and simultaneously explains the true
"urgency" of this proposal and the desire for remote LE access
(originally without TPC support).  It also ties in nicely with the
denial of legal protection for violations of key escrow in the Clipper
proposal.
