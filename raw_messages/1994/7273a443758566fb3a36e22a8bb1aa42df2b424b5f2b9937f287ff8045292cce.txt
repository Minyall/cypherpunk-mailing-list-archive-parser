	It might also be nice to encrypt the connection from client to
proxy.  Otherwise, this service only protects you from the server
knowing who you are.  If you add encryption, then it begins to offer
anonymity agianst people watching the proxy.  (Assuming there are
multiple connections to the proxy.)
