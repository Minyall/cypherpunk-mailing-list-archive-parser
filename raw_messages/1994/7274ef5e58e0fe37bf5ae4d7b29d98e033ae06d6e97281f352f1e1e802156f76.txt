One possibility would be to right-justify your  text,  as  a  few
people  like  to  do,  then  to tweak the algorithm for inserting
spaces into lines to depend on the next bits of the embedded mes-
sage.  Generally, you have N spaces to insert into M word breaks.
If M divides N, you don't have any choice, but otherwise you have
N  mod  M  "leftovers"  to  distribute among M.  This would allow
several bits per line.
