Dear Rep. Cantwell,

I support HR 3627, because I strongly believe in every 
American's right to privacy. 

In our burgeoning global markets, American businesses must 
rely on secure communications to prevent industrial 
espionage. If the Clinton Administration succeeds in 
dictating that only the "Clipper Chip" can be exported, it 
will effectively strangle any other means of secure 
communications. 

In a competitive global market for technology and 
communications, I think it is crucial that American 
businesses retain the right to produce the products and 
security solutions that their customers want, free of the 
restrictions and demands of government controls and 
snooping.

Rep. Cantwell, this is not an arcane technical issue of 
export control. The freedom of Americans to be secure in 
their communications from unwarranted government intrusion 
is essential to our liberty. I think this is one of the few 
issues that both Republicans and Democrats agree upon, so I 
hope you will be able to generate bi-partisan support for 
your bill. 

Sincerely, 


M. Scott Braden
