      You have to assume that RSA isn't being run by idiots.  Either they're
      looking at closing their doors in seven years, or they've got a plan.

   I asked Jim Bidzos about this last year.  He told me they're planning
   on becoming a supplier of cryptography code and expertise.

If they had expertise, they wouldn't need patents.
