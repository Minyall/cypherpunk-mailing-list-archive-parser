Normally a URL can specify an alternate port as well (of course).  A common  
one is http://site.org:8080/dir/file.html...   This gets around setting up  
the proxy without a privileged account.  The only web browser I'm familiar  
with (OmniWeb for NeXTSTEP) also allows you to specify the port number for  
the proxy.  I was under the impression that all browsers supported alternate  
port numbers for proxies since they are commonly used for URLs...  Do Mosiac  
and Netscape allow specifying the port for proxy servers?
