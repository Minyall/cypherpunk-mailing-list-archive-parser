   Well, is this file going to be posted on Cypherpunks with a fake
signature, or will it just annoy L. Todd Masco? On my last post to
Cypherpunks, I legit. signed it with my very own military grade PGP
signature & encluded armored public key.

   Eric Hughes: It looks like this mandatory signing thing just isn't
keeping out the Riff-Raft! How about a cover charge instead?
