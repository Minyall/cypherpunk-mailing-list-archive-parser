Might it be appropriate, though, to create an alt group for that purpose?
Sort of the digital equivalent of putting "coded" messages in the personals
section of your favorite newspaper's classified section. You know--"John,
you have five days to pay up" means to meet at the Ritz for dinner next
Thursday, and "I love you, Sally" means to run for the border.

But far, far more effective digitally.

Could be especailly useful for people "in the field," considering how many
universities and other places permit Usenet posting without an account, so
long as your IP is considered local--easier to get access.
