From what Tim alludes to, I still think he is just plain wrong about how 
bad things would be on him.  He's probably getting bad advice from 
practicing lawyers who have a vested interest in having financial privacy 
"difficult" to obtain.  (More billible hours, more fees.)  For the rest 
of us who aren't retired zillionaires, though, there is plenty that can 
be done.
