I don't know how to speed this up.  Pollard rho was a cautionary tale of
how sometimes time/space tradeoffs exist.  If the main cost of double-DES
is in space but the time cost isn't that bad, then if there were such a
tradeoff it could be dangerous to use it.

Most of the time-space tradeoffs that I can think of for a basic MITM
attack like this are pretty costly.  For example, instead of trying all
the keys on both sides you could try just half the keys each time.  This
would take only half as much space but up to four times the time.  You
could also do some hashing to save space at the cost of false positives and
more time.  Again, the point is not so much that double DES is weak, but
more that if its strength is solely due to space costs that gives much
less of a good feeling than if you had an algorithm that was strong both
in space and in time.
