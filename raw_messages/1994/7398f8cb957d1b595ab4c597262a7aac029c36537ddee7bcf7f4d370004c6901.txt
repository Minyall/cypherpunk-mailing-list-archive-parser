VeriVox (Isn't VeriPhone in existence? sounds familiar)
PriVox (PriVoxy)
DOS Vox (Dome of Silence ...)
LB Vox (Little Brother Speaks, and no one can hear)
Vox/1994 (tenuous reference to conquering 1984/BB, 1994 being somewhat
	  year of public crypto, etc. Oh, nevermind. )

Private is my adjective of choice lately since laypeople
don't know what crypto is and secure seems ambiguous to me
(in laymens mindset).
