Sigh. If trying to avoid re-inventing square wheels and duplicating stuff
that has already been done is being a wet blanket, then I have to say I am
very proud to join Perry in the "pseudo-tentacle wet blanket club". One
of the major reasons I still read this list is so that I can find out when
I am wasting my time - if somebody has come up with a workable solution, and
it seems likely to gain wide acceptance, it is rather stupid of me to
hide in my magical cyberspace fairytale virtualland and write code that
no-one is going to pick up and use. But of course I am free to do so, should
I so desire...
