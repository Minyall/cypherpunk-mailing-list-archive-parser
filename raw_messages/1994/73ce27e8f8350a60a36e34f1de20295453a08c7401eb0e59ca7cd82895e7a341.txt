*** Dont most photocopiers have an automatic exposure control,
    which like cheap photo devoping printing services, uses the 
    integrated light from the WHOLE object to set the exposure.
     
    If there is an near-UV flourescent region in US bills, this would 
    interfere with photocopying by making the overall result
    too dark.

    Why not look for watermarks etc with a UV money-checking lamp
    Then cut out  (a very light red ?) UV filter to cover the offending
    region when copying.  Then paint on some UV-flouresent stuff on the
    result.   Et Voila free money!
