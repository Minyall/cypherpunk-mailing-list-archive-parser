Haven't been living in the BBS world much lately have you?  There was a monster
debate recently on Fidonet's Encryption Forum and some folks from Net 106
(Houston, TX, if I recall correctly) with some sysops in that region 
claiming that the signature was encryption and who were therefore bouncing 
things because they didn't want encrypted things on their boards.

Sigh....out in the world some *serious* education is needed.
