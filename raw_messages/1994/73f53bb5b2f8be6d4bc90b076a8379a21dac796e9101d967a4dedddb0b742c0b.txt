It depends on the server. My log files include something about every
single request made to the server. Since I am doing marketing, I can
then search through these and based on the access times, host names
and domains, document accesses, and information supplied by the users
using forms determine what changes need to be made and what follow up
is appropriate for each person.

If you want anonymity use a proxy.

I'm debuging a product that will do this. Despite an effort to write
extremely clean code, I seem to have a number of problems and I can't
say when it will be ready even for alpha testing. :(
