Try to sue for damages when your work is available for free to
millions of people. The judge will laugh in your face, copyright or
no. Damages are, after all, related to lost revenue -- if you allow
anyone who wants to see something for free in one medium, you will
have a fucking hard time to keep them from examining it in another
equivalent medium. Usenet is NOT a magazine. Failing to put a
copyright notice in your work destroys whats left of your ability to
do anything. I'm sure you can pay a lawyer to sue for you, but this
isn't exactly one anyone is going to take on contingency.
