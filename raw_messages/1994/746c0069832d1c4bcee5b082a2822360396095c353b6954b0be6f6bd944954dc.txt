Perhaps, but if the earlier post is accurate about it mapping UC to lc and 
only accepting 8 characters of password, you've gone from a 56 bit keyspace 
to a ~38 bit keyspace.  A dictionary attack is certainly feasible--I don't 
recall what speeds have been achieved for brute-forcing DES lately.
