The active remailers get periodically posted.  I forget the site
where you can request the current list.

As for keyservers, I think my list is faily out of date, but you can
try sending mail to my keyserver (pgp-public-keys@pgp.mit.edu) with a
subject of "help", and it will reply with a list of keyservers.
