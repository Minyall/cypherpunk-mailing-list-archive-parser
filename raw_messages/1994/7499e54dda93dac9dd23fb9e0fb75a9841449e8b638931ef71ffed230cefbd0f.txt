GROAN! What the hell is this list about anyway?????? I think we are losing
perspective about encryption, privacy etc etc...

Putting it quite simply, the individual was asking about how to make an attack
on an opponent. Whether that opponent is a girlfriend, spouse, competitor or
terrorist group, who cares? Lets save the sermonizing for Ann Landers...what
state the relationship is irrelevant.

The gentleman asked a question regarding a standard cryptographic problem...
how you can intercept and interpret encrypted information, either in theory
in practice. To make judgement calls is WAY out of line and a hell of a bad
precedent for this group.

I bet the poster would have gotten a more sympathetic response if he said he
had gotton his hands on a diplomatic cable....

Oh boy! Pretty soon we will have this list as "cypherpunks giving advice to
the lovelorn..."!!! Lets cut the crap, stick to the problem at hand and
offer solutions to what the participants of the list know best, namely the
the use and analysis of cryptographic problems.

Save the relationship bullshit for Masters and Johnson....

>Someone needs to give her PGP ASAP, IMHO....

Sure, from a disspassionate point of view, I agree. But I thought that the
whole point of this list was the promotion of PGP and the discussion of
the pro's and con's of encryption in general. That should include attacking
as well as defense.

Since, how can you rationally discuss defense unless you know what kind of
attack your opponents can mount against you???????
