Are there any bills being considered for congress which would remove
cryptography from the munitions umbrella ?

I think I remember this being talked about earlier on this list..has
it gone anywhere ?  (It was needed so that US companies could compete
with foreigners in this market or some such).

Obviously that ammendment is going to need further application if it
only affects export controls.
