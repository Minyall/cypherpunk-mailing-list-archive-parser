Just to give some kudos to Raph, I've used his "finger" service and
have been shocked at how _good_ it is! Seeing the uptimes, delays,
etc. is very useful in planning remailer chains.

I haven't had the time to explore his other tools, though.

Between this pinging service, and those of Matt Ghio and Sameer Parekh
(haven't checked it in a while), welcome progress has been made.
