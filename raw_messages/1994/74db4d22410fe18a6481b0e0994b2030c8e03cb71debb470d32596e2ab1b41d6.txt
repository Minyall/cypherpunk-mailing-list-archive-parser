I have uploaded to the SimTel Software Repository (available by anonymous
ftp from the primary mirror site OAK.Oakland.Edu and its mirrors):

apgp200.zip     AutoPGP: Offline e-mail encryption with PGP

AutoPGP v2.00 provides offline e-mail encryption with PGP.  It supports
XBoard and Offliner, as well as any QWK mail reader.  Encrypts, decrypts
and signs messages or part(s) of a message; inserts/extracts public keys
and ascii armoured files + much more!

Special requirements: PGP23A.ZIP.
