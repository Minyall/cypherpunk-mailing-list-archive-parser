An additional note:

I appreciate Tim's effort to compile a document we can all call our
own. In my opinion, its been a long time in coming.

Tim and I share many idealisms, including those of cryptoanarchy,
zero-tolerance and non-governmental manipulation.

Any and all remarks I make to the list are public, and believe it or
not, I understand that when I make them. One would be a fool not to 
understand the implications.

Just thought I'd toss in these few pennies...

Cheers,

- paul
