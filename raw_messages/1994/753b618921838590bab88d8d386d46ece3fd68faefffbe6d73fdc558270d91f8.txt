I know that some members of this list are in the Boston area; I'm also
wondering if any of the "names" in crypto live up here.  I'm trying to
arrange a talk (elementary level) for a group of human-interface designers I
chair and am hunting up speaker ideas.

I will be out of the office tomorrow, but will respond to emails Monday.
Thanks!

All the world's a stage and most of us are desperately unrehearsed.
