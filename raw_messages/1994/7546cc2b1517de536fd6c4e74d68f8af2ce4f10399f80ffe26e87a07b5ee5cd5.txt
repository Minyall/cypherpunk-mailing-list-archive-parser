Here's something kinda spooky.  An OSF staffer doing consulting with the
Singapore gov't was asking about how well the DCE security server scales.
They're starting a pilot program to make, from birth, every Singaporese
an entity known to their server.  Based on other questions, I gather the
DCE identity card will be used by all gov't services.
