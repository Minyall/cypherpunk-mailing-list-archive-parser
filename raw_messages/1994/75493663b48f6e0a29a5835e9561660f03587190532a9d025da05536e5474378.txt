Actually, PGP wont even do that.  If the key is not in your keyring,
it will complain about not finding it and output the de-armored
message.  If you want to add the key, you need to run it through PGP
once to de-armor it, save off the output, and then add that output
message to your keyring.

This is exactly what people should do.  People should _never_
clearsign a public key block.  If you want to sign it, sign the key
inside the keyblock.  When someone clearsigns a keyblock, they are
making two passes over it to create it, which requires you to make two
passes to read it in!
