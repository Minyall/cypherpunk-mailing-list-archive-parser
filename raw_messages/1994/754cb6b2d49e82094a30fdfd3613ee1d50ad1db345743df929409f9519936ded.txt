After seeing the post about elliptic curve encrytion (mentioning neal 
koblitz as an authority) I took the liberty of forwarding it to him and 
asking for his response as well as a good reference. Here's the response.

(I'd never heard of elliptic curve crypto. I have now.)

Matt,
   Thanks for the message.  The guy is basically correct in what he
says (except for minor inaccuracies in terminology and so on).  The
best source on this subject is the recent book: ``Elliptic Curve
Public Key Cryptosystems'' by Alfred Menezes, Kluwer Acad. Pub., 1993.
   Regards, Neal
