Mike Markley say,
"I'd be curious to see how they are going to do voice recognition on
random conversations. Unless I am very sadly out of date you need to
teach the pattern matcher individual voices."

But of course they will just collect voice samples from everyone soon,
and use them to IDENTIFY you. It'll probably be put on our US national
health care cards. Ever since I started worrying about leaving DNA on
postage stamps, I've started to think what can be done will be done.
