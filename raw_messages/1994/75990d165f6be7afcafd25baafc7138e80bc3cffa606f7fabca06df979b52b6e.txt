a friend of mine told me he was going to sell some
information to BlackNet. I don't know if he did or
not, but he ... changed ... in a strange way. his
speech patterns became different. he started 
dressing differently, and his shirt bulged in the
back, I have never seen anything quite like it
before.

his house burned down mysteriously sometime after that.

I saw him riding in tha back of a black lincoln, talking
with this guy who looked ... wrong.
