I found this in the EDUPAGE clipping service.  Does anyone have further
information?

    BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD ON DIGITAL SIGNATURES
            The Digital Signature Standard approved by the Commerce Department
    last May is in trouble. The algorithm may have a fatal flaw that would
    allow hackers to forge digital signatures needed for electronic funds
    transfers and alter supposedly secure documents. NIST (National Institute
    for Standards and Technology) claims all that's needed is a one-line fix,
    and an unfazed AT&T still plans to release a new version of its
    DSS-compatible Secretagent encryption software sometime soon. (Data
    Communications 8/94 p.11)
