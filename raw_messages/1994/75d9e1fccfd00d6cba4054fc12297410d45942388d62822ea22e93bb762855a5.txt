Yes, but Prof. Nicely found the problem because he was using FDIV when
doing something or other with large potential primes.  For most of our
crypto stuff integer is fine, but for some operations on 33- to 50-bit
integers it may be faster to use the floating point ops, since IEEE fp is
supposed to be exact for integers up to some number of bits in the 50's.
