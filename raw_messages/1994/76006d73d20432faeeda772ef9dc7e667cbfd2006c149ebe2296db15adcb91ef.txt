. . . . . someone advocating that all you need to do is just tell teens 
to say "no"
to sex before marriage, then you won't need to distribute condoms without
parental permission....

Suddenly it hit me that the same frame of mind was clearly behind the

Are you saying that they think that if the phone moderators could just 
say "no" for us, overt supervisory functions could be eliminated?
