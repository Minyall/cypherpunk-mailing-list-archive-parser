I stand corrected.  BTW- "Cypherpunks" has a ring to it the media loves
to exploit.  Maybe we should consider changing the name of the group to
bit.nerd.weenies and avoid public scrutiny ;)  Or maybe this really is
about crypto-anarchy.

The US gov't position on anarchy is someone must speak for the anarchists.
That's how they made Red Cloud the spokesperson for the Lakota tribes.  The
only person Red Cloud had the authority to speak for when he signed the
Ft. Laramie treaty of 1868 was Red Cloud, as far as the Lakota Nations were
concerned.

Just a piece of history.  The US gov't insists an anarchy conform to its
paradigm of centralized leadership and singular spokesperson.  I prefer to
think and speak for myself, thank you.
