I am accutely aware of the name duplication problem.  Even  using my
middle initial doesn't buy me much.  There are many Stephen Williams's
in most areas.  Maybe Stephen Douglas Williams is fairly unique, if
you don't count my father, but that doesn't help much.  Now if I
changed my name to Zaphod or something...

I use companies I've started, my domain, etc. to try to establish a
unique identity.
