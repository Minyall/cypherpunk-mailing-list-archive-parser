I think you are probably not thinking about how Public key systems work.  
It doesn't matter which key you use, public or private, each one reverses 
the effect of the other.  In this case what you are calling the secret 
key would really be the public key, and vice-versa.  You are just asking 
that the public key be known only among the recipients of the list.
