Heh.  I'd never contemplate such a thing.  In practice if I were
using such a scheme I'd probably stick to *.test - I was just
pointing out that Tim doesn't need to create an alt.w.a.s.t.e group
specifically for the traffic.  In fact, we *can't* create any such
group specifically for the traffic because it wouldn't be carried,
and you could trace recipients easily because all the people who
talked to each other this way would have to arrange for their own
feeds to take the group and get it from each other.

(Actually I *had* been giving serious thought to such a scheme for
an anonymous fax service I've been thinking about, but thought better
of it, because, as you say, the net would want my head for posting
100's of K's of encrypted binaries in alt.test :-) )
