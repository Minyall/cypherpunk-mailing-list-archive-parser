I thought this might be of interest to cypherpunkers.
The full title is:
Common Randomness in Information Theory and Cryptography
  - Pt. I: Secret Sharing

by Rupolph Ahlswede and Imre Csiszar in
IEEE Transactions on Information Theory V39 #4

It talks about generating a common random key at two terminals without
letting an eavesdropper obtain info about the key.
