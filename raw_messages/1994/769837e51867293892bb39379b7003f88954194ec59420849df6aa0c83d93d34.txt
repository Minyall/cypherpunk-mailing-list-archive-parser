Message length quantization is necessary for security in a remailer
network.  Right now there's not enough traffic through the remailers
to warrant more than one such quantized length.

What length should that be?

This information can be readily calculated from the length
distribution of the current messages passing through the remailers.
If only one or two remailers would instrument their devices in order
to record just lengths, that would provide the necessary data.  Any
volunteers?

My complete guess is that it's going to be around 4-5 KB.
