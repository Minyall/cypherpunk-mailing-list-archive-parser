Ok.

Indeed, a numerical simulation would be quite complex.  However, I
fail to udnerstand why you do not consider the programming of the
quantum computer to be a non-algorithm.  Clearly, if somebody can make
the quantum computer solve the NP problem, there must be some
technique of expressing the process.  If it's not an algorithm, what
do you call it?  (Hint: it is an algorithm.)

Right; it executes a different algorithm.
