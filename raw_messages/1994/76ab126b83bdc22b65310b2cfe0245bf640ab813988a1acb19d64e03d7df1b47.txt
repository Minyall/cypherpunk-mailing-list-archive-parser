I believe you are referring to Bruce Sterling's "The Hacker
Crackdown", interesting book because Sterling sympathetically presents
many sides: paranoid telco's, testosterone-poisoned adolescent
hackers, hand-wringing cops (Dr. Denning is presented in this milieu)
and (my personal favorite) the "information wants to be free"
libertarians.
