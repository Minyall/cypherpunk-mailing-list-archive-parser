I don't think "adjust[ing] on a case by case basis" is necessary.
I was suggesting just the opposite.  It obviously isn't a security
issue.  I believe it is more of a first principles issue; "Thou
shall encrypt thy communications, lest thou draw attention to thy
self, and the right be removed by thine opponents."

Oh well, since it was deleted in the first reply to my reply, let's try 
this again:

Eric Hughes wrote:

Perhaps I am misunderstanding the above (I think not; "_all_" is
fairly inclusive).  I understand your argument about routine PRIVATE
mail.  However, key exchange alone involves considerably more hassle
than what I am suggesting (and judging from the reply I got from
Eric Hughes, I gather encrypting the list is hardly a new idea)
which is this: there would be a tangible benefit from encrypting
a list like cypherpunks with a well-known, even casual grade key.
For God's sake, *especially* cypherpunks (you know, the name, power
of example and all that) If the tools need to be built for some
platform; well, "cypherpunks write code".  Pipes _are_ available
under DOS, you know.
