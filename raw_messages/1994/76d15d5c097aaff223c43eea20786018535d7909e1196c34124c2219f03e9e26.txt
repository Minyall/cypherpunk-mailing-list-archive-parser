Hi,

someone in Germany was posting a message about his friends
mail problems:

He (the friend) very often has mail contact with another
friend, but sometimes mail was lost. They found out that
normal mail always works well and pgp encrypted mail always
gets lost. 

Did anyone hear about machines which don't transport pgp
encrypted mail?
