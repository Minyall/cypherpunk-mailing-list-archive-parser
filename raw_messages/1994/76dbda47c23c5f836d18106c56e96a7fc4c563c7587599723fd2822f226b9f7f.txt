   This would suggest, though, that RC4 alone would not be allowed, only RC4
   plus RSA.

Or perhaps RC4 at 32 bits.  All these restrictions are key length
dependent.  If you have a smaller search space, you can spend more
time examinining candidates.

   Also, are there restrictions on the encryption exponent?  A 1024 bit RSA
   with a small encryption exponent would be faster to check than a 512 bit
   RSA with an arbitrary 512 bit encryption exponent.  

These are public key operations, remember.  The public exponents are
usually only a few bits long anyway, no matter what the modulus.
