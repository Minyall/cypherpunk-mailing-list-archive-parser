  This one I do not agree with though.  Who can regulate it, what are
  the penalties for violation, how can you prove I typed this, etc.

  There is a difference between a site kill file that blocks everyone
  who works at AT&T from conversing with people that work at MCI, and
  my personal kill file that says I don't want to hear from Jim Nalbandian
  or Detweiler.  

  With personal kill files they have the right to speak and I have the
  right not to listen. ;)
