In the words of Rodney King, "Can't we all just get along?"

Perry further comments:

This is likely true.  However, it does not necessarily follow
that such an algorithm will be any faster than current methods of
factoring and might very well be a good deal slower.

What you seem to be overlooking is that the function Jim
proposes, which tells the numerical order of two keys from an
examination of the results of using them, is probably an
exponential time algorithm itself as a function of keysize.

Performing such an algorithm log2(n) times does not yield an
algorithm which is O(log2(n)) in computational complexity, unless
Jim's magic function happens to be hardwired into your CPU and
executes in a constant of clock cycles regardless of its
operands.

Your fears are unfounded. :)
