The canonical reference for digital timestamping is the work of Stu
Haber and Scott Stornetta, of Bellcore. Papers presented at various
Crypto conferences. 

Their work involves having the user compute a hash of the document he
wishes to be stamped and sending the hash to them, where they merge
this hash with other hashes (and all previous hashes, via a tree
system) and then they *publish* the resultant hash in a very public
and hard-to-alter forum, such as in an ad in the Sunday New York
Times.

In their parlance, such an ad is a "widely witnessed event," and
attempts to alter all or even many copies of the newspaper would be
very difficult. (In a sense, this WWE is similar to the "beacon" term
Eric Hughes used recently in connection with timed-release crypto.)

Haber and Stornetta plan some sort of commercial operation to do this,
and, last I heard, Stornetta was moving to the Bay Area (where else?)
to get it started.

This service has not yet been tested in court, so far as I know.

The MIT server is an experiment, and is probably useful for
experimenting. But it is undoubtedly even less legally significant, of
course.
