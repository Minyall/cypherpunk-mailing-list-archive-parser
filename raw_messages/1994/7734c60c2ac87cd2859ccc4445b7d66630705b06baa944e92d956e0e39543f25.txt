Same thing happened when Coca Cola tried to change their formula:

Should we therefore conclude that Coke does not own coke?

I did not say "Eric owns the list, so there is no point
in discussing the matter."  In case you have not noticed
I have been arguing against the change.  What I implied is
that voting on it is absurd, and that arguing that Eric
is not entitled to do as he pleases is absurd.
