I see several articles on digicash, and a general bibliography.  I suspect
(from a combination of private email, the postings here, and a little testing I
did) that Harry B.'s problems had at least one foot in the fact that he was
using a version of a line-mode browser which sometimes maps temporary links
differently for different clients (e.g. Cello vs xmosaic vs whatever).
