What exactly does "non-commercial uses" mean?  I read mail through my
account here at work; if I get PGP2.6 running and send mail from
Tivoli to a friend on netcom, is that a commercial or non-commercial
use?  What if I send encrypted mail to a friend at Tivoli?

Clearly, this precludes my bundling the release with a Tivoli product,
but I don't understand how the commercial/non-commercial distinction
is formally made.
