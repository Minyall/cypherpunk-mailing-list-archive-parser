From Sandy Sandfort:

Acapulco H.E.A.T., with dubious crypto and suspect technology,  


has become an inside joke for Cypherpunks. When we watch it, we 
see things the average person misses.  This is something we 
share, and something that helps create the lighter side of 
Cypherpunk culture.

Yeah, Rishab.   
What about all that social-cyberspatial-culture philosophy 
stuff you write.  Surely you see a relation here to the 
concepts of tribal and cyberspatial society?
