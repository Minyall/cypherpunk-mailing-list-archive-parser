First question: does anybody know the full URL for detailed
information on how World Wide Web servers do logging, and
the particular kinds of connection  and transaction information
they can log, and what information they typically do log?
(I know the main Mosaic doc URLs but can't find this info).

Second question: wev'e heard about installing swIPe in the 
kernel and using it as an anonymous packet forwarder -- stripping 
off the original.  Has anybody done the analogous thing at the 
http protocol level for the World Wide Web?  That is, set up an
httped, the only purpose of which is to forward URL requests with all
originating site and username information stripped.  I would
love to use such a service.  I would even pay substantial amounts
of "Magic Money" tokens to do so, if somebody writes a convenient 
user interface to that system.   Also, if some folks are serious
about taking the lead on either of these projects, I'd be
happy to contribute my hacking skills (the typical C/Berkeley
Unix & networking, etc.) and do beta testing.
