Who decides what's good and what's crap?

Let me see if I understand.  Are you advocating that personal choice in
medical devices, food, etc., be supplanted by government dictate?

Do you understand that in many cases, a person is interested in strong
cryptography just so that she can make her own choices in such matters,
free of interference by a do-gooder who thinks he knows better than she?
That she sees crypto as a way to defend against him (e.g. by buying
``unsafe medical devices'' through BlackNet)?

``Market forces'' are just the sum of personal choices.
