: Ironic what you say, Graham.  Given the fact that the subject

: sexual intercourse, which is somewhat of a "religion to some", 
: maybe that's exactly what Nathan was asking -- for pornographers 
: to keep their "fucking religion" off the net...

Classic, a lesson in hypocrisy from Detweiler!  Larry, the day I call
for government regulation to stop decent atheist kids from being allowed
to access evil underground Christian fsp sites is the day you can start
bleating hypocrisy.

Another deliberate flame-bait from Detweiler.  Excuse me if I don't
waste my time refuting anything else he said.
