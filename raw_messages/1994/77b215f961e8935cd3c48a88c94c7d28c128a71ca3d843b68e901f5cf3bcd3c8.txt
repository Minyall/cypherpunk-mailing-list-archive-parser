| Gaining ISDN Privacy with data encryption
| by Kevin Tanzillo
| 
|Wunnava V. Subbarao, professor of electrical and computer
|engineering Florida International University (FIU), along with
|research associate Irma B. Fernandez, wrote a paper on testing and
|evaluating encryption based data security in the ISDN environment.

 I too am interested in this paper. I contacted FIU, Mr Subbarao is
out of town till the end of the month, and his research assistant
is off for a few days. (her husband had minor surgery) I left my
number and will let the list know anything I find out.

 Can anyone else help?
