--> I keep seeing pgp 2.7 in public key & sig blocks.
--> 	  Where do we get it?

2.7 is a ViaCrypt product which you have to pay royalties for, and 
last I heard they didn't include sources with their distribution. 
Anybody know if they've started sending the sources with the executables?? 
Here's their addresses and tel #'s:
