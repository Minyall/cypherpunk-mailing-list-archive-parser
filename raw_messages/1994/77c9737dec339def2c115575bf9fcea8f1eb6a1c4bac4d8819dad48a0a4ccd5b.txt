Whoever wrote this is a moron who doesn't understand the newsgroup
 creation process.  (Do I?  I'm a UVV member.)

David Lawrence, one of the US Hierarchy Coordinating Committe, already
 has absolute control over newsgroup creation as the moderator of
 news.announce.newgroups.  He occasionally uses it to stop brain-damaged
 proposals from going through.

USEnet is not a democracy, and it never has been.  Followups to
 news-newusers-questions@uunet.uu.net, please.  This has no c'punk
 content, except the desire to head off a stupid thread.
