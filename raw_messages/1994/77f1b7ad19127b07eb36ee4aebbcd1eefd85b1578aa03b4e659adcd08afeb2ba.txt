C'punks,

I just got off the phone with the Executive Editor of "Soldier of 
Fortune."  I pitched him on a Clipper/strong-encryption article.  Because 
I am such a loyal C'punk, I agreed to write a 2500 word article on spec.  
If they don't think it will interest their readers, it will be put in the 
circular file.  I'll do my best.
