For God sakes guys, I posted this problem to alt.security.pgp a MONTH
ago. macpgp2.3.cpt.hqx on soda.berkeley.edu in /pub/cypherpunks/pgp
is GZIPPED! You've got dozens of newbies going for this site since
it's listed in the PGP FAQ as having MacPGP. People ftp it with
"ascii" then download it and it dies. Please fix this. Do I have to
do EVERYTHING? Get on a plane to Berkeley, USA and break down some
doors, just to type 'mv macpgp2.3.cpt.hqx macpgp2.3.cpt.hqx.gz' and
'gunzip macpgp2.3.cpt.hqx.gz"?

Let me ask you this, in jest: How would you like it if I offered to
send anyone (including overseas) MacPGP2.3.cpt.hqx using your
"beloved remailers" (Detweiler term)? Export arms like a mad man. I'm
suprised old Larry himself didn't think of this one. Hopefully he is
no longer getting his cypherpunks feed (I don't want to give him an idea).

Cheers.
