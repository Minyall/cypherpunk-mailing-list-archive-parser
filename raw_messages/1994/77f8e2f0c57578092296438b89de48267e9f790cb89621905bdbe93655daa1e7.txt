This is exactly the same argument that corrupts the PEM certification
scheme. While hierarachical chains of command are reflexivly the first
idea in any military or bureaucratic employee, the existance of a
super-valuable "master certification certificate" that is valuable will
directly make it extremely valuable. Anything of sufficient value will
be compromised by someone willing to pay a sufficient value, break a
kneecap, etc.

Once a valuable, high level certificate is broken, then all decendant
certificates are broken. The "web of trust" is the only workable solution.
