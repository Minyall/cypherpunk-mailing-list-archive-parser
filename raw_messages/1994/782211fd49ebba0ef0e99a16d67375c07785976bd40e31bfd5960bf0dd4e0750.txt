Not surprising.  While Dining Cryptographers was vastly more relevant,
I still haven't digested it.  The Rainbow Gathering was good for an
instant response and didn't require anything resembling thought.  I'll
leave it to you to guess which one I saved.

Oh yes, and I at least felt that the Fortran code was on-topic and
saved it for study.
