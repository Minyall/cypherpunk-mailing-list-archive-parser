Then there are no rights. Can you name any "right" that has not been
taken from some citizen, sometime, under some circumstances? The state
can and will do with us, our bodies, and our minds, as it pleases. Not
because it has permission, or because it's morally justified, but
because it is willing to use force. Citizens who are unable to match
the state with equal or greater force do not lose their claim to rights
which have been ignored or trampled.

I prefer to think of rights as "something that must not be removed from
any citizen"; but even with that definition, we should be careful. Do
we want to extend it to convicted criminals during the term of their
punishments? What about to persons accused of (but not convicted of)
crimes?

I would, as well. I think it's important to assert that it *is* a right;
perhaps not as well-defined in the Constitution as I'd like. The
government may choose to pretend we do not have a right to privacy, but
that doesn't change the fact that we have one.
