Jim Bodzos of RSA has a simple plan that goes roughly like this: if you
make money off of RSA, he makes money. CompuServ pulled PGP a long time
ago, way before PRZ's lawsuit, because they were the only ones making money
off PGP in the country -- all those $$ for download fees. EFF had it in
their forum, as did several others, all were pulled.
