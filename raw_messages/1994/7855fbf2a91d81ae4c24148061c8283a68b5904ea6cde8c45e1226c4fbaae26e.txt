I can see that there may be difficult cases, but I still think that
there would be real utility in the ability to specify that a particular
piece ofmail should be re-transmitted if it does not get delivered
to the destination machine within a certain period of time.  As I said,
this would help with the implementation of cryptographic protocols that
worked via email, not to mention the many other applications.

That's one reason I like the "enabledmail" approach.  All we have to do
is persuade everyone to run a system which allows anyone on the network
to get your computer to run an arbitrary program for them.  Then everything
will be fine.  One nice thing is that enabledmail scripts can
trigger either on delivery to the dest machine, or on being read by the
recipient.  This gives even more flexibility in how you want to define
a "received" message.
