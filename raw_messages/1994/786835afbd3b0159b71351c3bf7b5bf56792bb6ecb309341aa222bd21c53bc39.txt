There is some confusion in terminology here.  The brass case is indeed
discarded when the round is fired.  Byt 'casing' he means the exterior of
the warhead.  The word 'round' is used for both the warhead+gunpowder+brass
and then for the warhead itself.  Larger artillery pieces do not use a
brass shell case at all.  The round is loaded, and then the powder is
rammed in after it.

I believe that this is true, except that the 'products of the impact' are
drops of metal and what they do is worse than grinding something up.
