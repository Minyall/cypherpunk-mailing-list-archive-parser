Mike G has been arguing that the Supreme Court's assertion makes something
the law of the land, as if it had been written into the Constitution (e.g.
voting rights).

However, Mike knows as well as anyone that the S.C. is a 4-D function and
that what is true for one location of the S.C. in
time/space/composition/subject-matter is not necessarily true for another
point in that 4-space.

EG: Blackmun has just come out asserting that he now categorically opposes
the death penalty.

Thus, it's a variable question as to what are and are not our rights, no
matter what the S.C. says.  Some day they may decide that voting is not a
right (they already don't allow convicted felons to vote).
