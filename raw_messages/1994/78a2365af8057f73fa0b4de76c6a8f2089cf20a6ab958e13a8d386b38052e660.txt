It's slighly more than a whim too, I think.  I think I recall something 
about encouraging use of *traceable* electronic funds transfer for more 
transactions is something like an official statement from one of the not 
too distant G7 meetings.

Another point not directly related to Perry's post:  This list seems to 
"know" that people *want* anonymous digital cash.  Does anybody actually 
know *how* *much* people want this?  Is Joe Common willing to pay 
something extra for this anonymity functionality?  Does anybody have 
facts about this, or is it just assumptions??  "Since we think it's good, 
everybnody must want it!"
