    It strikes me as anachronistic to worry about national ID numbers for
    privacy reasons.  With data processing of the 1950's

    . . .

    None of this requires a national ID card.

But, nothing prevents you from acting on an individual level to make
this the info gatherers job more difficult.  There is plenty of reason
to believe that effective strategies exist for keeping such data bases
inaccurate.

When such things have the force of law behind them, they are more
worrisome.  Making the info gatherers job more difficult is
potentially a harder task and even attempting to inject bogus data
could be criminally penalized.
