I've had quite a few people ask for instructions for retreiving the 
ghostmarks I promised. Good to see that more people are getting involved. 
I'm more than willing to help people get going using the magic money 
implementations. 

I've just paid the winner of the sonics/nuggets pool. I'm offering 15 more
ghostmarks to the person most closely guessing the spread of the
sonics/nuggets game 5 on saturday. (as a reference, the winner this time
was only within 14 points of the spread!) You need not have your client 
installed to enter the pool.

I have a feeling that within the next few weeks we're going to see more 
and more items available via ghostmarks/tacky tokens/bakuins. Get set up 
now so you can participate later. 

Email for info.
