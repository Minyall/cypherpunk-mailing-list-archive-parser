	Yes you can jam TEMPEST detection systems.   Since many of them
use correlation detection technology to extract weak repetitive signals
from uncorrellated hash, you had better radiate coherent garbage
rather than just lots of noise, since the processing gain of the coherence
can be rather large (tens of db or more).
