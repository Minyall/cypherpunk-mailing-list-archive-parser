Many people don't have mime mailers, and if you want to talk to them, you 
can't use mime features.  You can tell them that they're stupid not to 
have better software or accounts, but until getting PPP running is as 
easy as installing the aol client, you'll just be pissing in the wind.

Is this list supposed to convey ideas or demonstrate the latest email 
standards?  I'm not sure the two goals are compatible.
