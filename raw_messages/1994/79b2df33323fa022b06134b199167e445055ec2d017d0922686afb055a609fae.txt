Singapore offers a new, get-rich-quick oppurtunity especially for Americans.
Inspired by the case of Michael Fay, who spray-painted ("vandalized") cars and
was caned, and now, according to his agent will make $1,000,000 appearing on
talk shows, plus "at least $500,000" for pictures of his scarred buttocks, the
Singapore office of external publicity has announced special, 3-month visas for
vandalizers. The only condition - they must say, on each talk show appearance,
"But the computerized city management system is so fucking efficient!"

ObCrypto: Anyone interested in an experimental DC-Net implementation with all
the usability of tcp or ethernet?

Rishab, who is rather amused by the economics of crime

ps. what's the "Ob" in "Ob Crypto"?
