Maybe not, but if you've been paying atention you know of a great deal
of theory that support the intractability of solving certain problems
in realistic amounts of time.  Most PK cryptosystems are based on
relatively simple principles of mathematics.  It stretches the
imagination to think that the NSA somehow has solved the factoring
problem; I concede it's possible, but unlikely.

Depends on what you mean by "know", I guess.

Well, you can't tell when you've been compromised, and you have no
rigorous way of demonstrating the robustness of your obscurity.  The
real problem, however, is that you'll have a hard time convincing
anybody else to participate.

You can hide all your valuables in a really clever place and do all
sorts of really clever secret things to protect them, and that may
make you feel secure.  However, you won't be able to convince me to
entrust *my* valuables to you unless you explain to me the details of
your techniques.
