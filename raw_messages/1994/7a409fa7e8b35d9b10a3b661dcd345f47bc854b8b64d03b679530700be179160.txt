Well, when I generated my key today, it asked for 1115 random keystrokes
and the overall generation took a good 20-25 minutes on my 486-33.

As for the keyservers, I'm not sure why they wouldn't handle them. Afterall,
I had a non-standard key before and they handled that, bak in the v 2.3a
days.
