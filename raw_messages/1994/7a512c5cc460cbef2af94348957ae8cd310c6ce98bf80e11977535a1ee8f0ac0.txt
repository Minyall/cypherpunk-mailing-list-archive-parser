You know, I'm a person that rarely lies, I don't lie to aquaintances
let alone friends, but in this regard I think I have to side with Tim.
We don't have the time or money to flood the media with the truth,  this
thing has to be STOPPED by any means necessary, The truth will surface
one way or the other, It will surface when it is too late and we are all
in jail for using illegal crypto, or it will surface when Clipper is finally
derailed and the nation/industrialized world is free to be able to have
the truth known.
