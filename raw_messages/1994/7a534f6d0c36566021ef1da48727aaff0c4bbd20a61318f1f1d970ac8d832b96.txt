Sandy, 
  
 When I saw that commercial for the remote control deal with the minivan 
and that nice big luxury car I thought about someone being able to 
figurethe frequency and be able to open that door and start the engine. 
Makes you think about getting one of those systems for your car. And, I'm 
sure if someone can come up with a way to encrypt those cars, they could 
make some money. The only thing is you have to hope the person who makes 
it doesn't put a back door in the crypto and that car manufacturers won't 
try and do the Clipper Stunt themselves (ie. they put in a back door)...
