As I understand it, the remailers don't "chose" the return path, Bob (the  
sender of the original message) choses the return path when he creates the  
SASE.  All the remailers do is interpret the part of the SASE that becomes  
readable to them after decrypting the SASE portion sent to them from the  
previous hop.  If all is working, what becomes readable is the address of  
the next hop (closer to Bob) and some misc other stuff (postage, maybe,  
and perhaps another encryption key).

Am I not understanding something correctly?
