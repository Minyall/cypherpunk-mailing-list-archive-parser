Subject: Good RNG generator information available.

	Hey, cpunks! For those of you who are interested in random number 
generation, there's a great deal of discussion going on over in sci.math, 
thread name "XXX". If the articles have expired on your site, or if you 
don't have news access, mail me, and I'll send them out to everyone who 
wants one later on.

-- Just an idea... This is what I was doing with the  2600 Cellular 
Telephone article, except that my list of address get scragged along with 
my mail dir.

	[1] Your questions (off-the-wall or not) don't bother me.
	[2] I very rarely killfile people.

	No. I don't have the time or mathematical knowledge to read 
sci.math and determine whahould be forwarded to cypherpunks or not.

	[1] THe EFF forads were VERY crypto related (HR 3627), we just 
got sick of seeing 4 copies of the same article pop up.
	[2] DO you know that no-one here reads those groups? I don't, but 
considering the number of intelligent and varied people here, that's a 
dangerous assumption.

	Agreed.
