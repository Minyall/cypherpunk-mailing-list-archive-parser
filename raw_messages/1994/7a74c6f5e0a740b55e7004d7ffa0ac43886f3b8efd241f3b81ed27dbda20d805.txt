I would like to add that I have evidently been a victim of "penet
spoofing" as well, since I too received the following message from
penet:

>You have sent a message using the anonymous contact service.
>You have been allocated the code name anXXXXX
>You can be reached anonymously using the address
>anXXXXX@anon.penet.fi.

Somebody is trying to be clever and forging mail to figure out
my penet id (surprise, I don't have one, but now I do).

When I got this message, I immediately sent off in an attempt to set
my password.  I haven't heard back yet, so I don't know if it was
successful or not.  If the password set fails, then somebody has taken
over anXXXXX and I'll be mailing Julf in order to get it removed.

Whoever wants to know my penet id... I'll save you some trouble:

an4609 - my old (now expired) account elee9sf@menudo.uh.edu
an5022 - my old (now expired/locked) account barrus@tree.egr.uh.edu

Now, of course, I have a new one, which somebody has thoughtfully
started up for me.
