No doubt this will eventually be marketed as a feature you can pay
extra for... intended so people can track their spouses' movements
so they know when they're getting home, if they're stuck in a traffic
jam, etc.

Such "legitimate" uses don't really make the prospect of carrying a
device to track my every movement all that attractive, unless of course
I can turn off that feature by flicking a switch on my phone.
