Does DES (or name your favorite encryption algorithm) produce as output  
all possible cyphertexts of length L, given all possible conbinations of  
keys and plaintexts of length L?

Since there are more combinations of key and plaintext than there are  
possible cyphertexts outputs of length L, you know there must be some  
combinations of key and plaintext that produce the same cyphertext.

Just curious,
