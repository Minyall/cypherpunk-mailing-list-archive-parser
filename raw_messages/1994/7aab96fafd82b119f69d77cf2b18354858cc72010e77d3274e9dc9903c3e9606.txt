	I am interested in preserving the personal safety of me &
mine. (Loved ones, etc.) I have numerous friends involved in certain
victimless activities which are currently proscribed by our
Friends[tm] and I would like to be able to dicuss these things without
worry of having my friends incarcerated.
	To this end I have done much work showing them how to use PGP
and encouraging the use thereof. It is a *very* slow process.

	I am in the planning stages of setting up a crypto-oriented
internet-connected househould, which I hope to use to furthur the
above goals, as well as sell crypto services to the internet
community, such as anonymous remailer, a psuedonyms server, and other
various services.
