Although I'm still uncomfortable about the non-crypto user key, there is
a simple solution to the problem of executable/data transmission:

Send it as Perl, Postscript, Tcl, whatever.

Perl should be able to handle an encode (7 bit) data stream with a
program prepended.  The algorithm would be more obvious, but
technically no more secure if you disallow security-through-obscurity.

Perl is available almost everywhere, is reasonably fast, has a
comprehensive capability list, etc.

This is what I think is rough.

Perl...
