"Opening the list up"? I've been on the list since the beginning, and
anarcho-capitalist, politico-cryptologic themes have _always_ been
with us. The role and nature of government in the presence of strong
cryptography is a recurring, and important, theme.

Those who want to discuss the mathematics and engineering of
cryptology are certainly encouraged to do so, but not to stop other
threads.
