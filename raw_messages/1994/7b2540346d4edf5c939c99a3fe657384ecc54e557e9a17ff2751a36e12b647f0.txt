I've looked in the docs for the answer but it is successful in
evading me.  My question:

   I have changed my ID string from my name to my name "-1024"
   and "-512" to differentiate between the different keys I have.
   Of course, using the -ke to do this has added a "Also known
   as" to my key.  Since my name is the same in both and the 
   mentioned keysizes are all that have changed I'd like to remove
   the AKA.  Can I do this?  If so how?

	   Thanks, 
		 Jim
