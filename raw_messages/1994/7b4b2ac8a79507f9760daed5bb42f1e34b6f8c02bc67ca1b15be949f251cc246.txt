For those of you with WWW access, there is an article with much more
technical detail available from http://the-tech.mit.edu in the April
8th issue of The Tech; they also have press releases from the DA, MIT,
as well as the indictment and the response which was posted.

If the messages in the indictment, do in fact, come from the accused,
then he's got a bunch of explaining to do...
