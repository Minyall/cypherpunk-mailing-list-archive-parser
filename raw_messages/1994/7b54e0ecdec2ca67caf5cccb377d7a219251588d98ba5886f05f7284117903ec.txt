Subject: Updated Remailer List/Helpfile?

I know that an updated remailer list was just posted recently, but I
think that even since then a good number of remailers have already
bitten the dust.

Could we have a current list, and perhaps an updated helpfile posted to
cypherpunks?

Also, are there any newly listed netmail-to-news gates?  I am
particularly interested in any outside the US besides Demon.UK.

Thanks.
