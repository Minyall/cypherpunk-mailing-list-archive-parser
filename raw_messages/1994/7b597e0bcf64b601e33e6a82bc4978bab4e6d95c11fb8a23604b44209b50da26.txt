Both of these examples are flawed, because the functions used are not
universal.

Not quite right.  The class of algorithms usually considered is the class of
ALL algorithms.  It is the ENCODING of algorithms that counts.  The
correct statement is

  "...the randomness of a string can only be measured relative to the
  particular encoding of algorithms being considered."
