Sorry, but the point is being missed.

It is certainly the case that massive bigotry exists against
homosexuals and that some companies make hiring decisions that way.
However, all credible studies show that homosexuals have substantially
above average income. 

Furthermore, discrimination is dropping with time in spite of the lack
of laws.

I would say that the problem is taking care of itself.
