Wow! Maybe becuase I am just now having my first evening drink (to
paraphrase someoone who spoke about having his first morning cup of
coffee), but I find Lucky's message *dead on*.

I was starting to get my hackles up at this point, preparing to rebut
Lucky's claims, until...

...rest elided...

A fair summary of the situation. And I consider the slight benefits of
signing to not be worth the effort of changing the tools I  have
managed to get working over the past couple of years.

By the way, Rishab mentioned getting PGP integrated into Netscape (or
other Mosaic-like tools). I heartily concur, and even made an
impassioned plea for this at the last CP meeting.

Netscape and a SLIP or PPP connection is what I expect to be shifting
too as things shake out, as versions become real, etc. (I've mentioned
this before.)

Also, Netscape the company (formerly Mosaic Communications) is seeking
to hire someone to do this. A clear opportunity for a Bay Area CP to
do something good and also probably become a millionaire.

(3,000 millionaires were created by Microsoft's success, and
Mosaic-Netscape may be comparable in success.)
