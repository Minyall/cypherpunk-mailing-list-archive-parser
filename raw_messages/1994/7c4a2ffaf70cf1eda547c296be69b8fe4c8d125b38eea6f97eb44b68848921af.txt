Ever been to Singapore?  That is *exactly* the social contract into which
the Singaporeans have entered.  When I was there, I tried to give a copy
of PGP to the young man who sold and set up our computer equipment.  He
turned it down.  He told me he didn't need that kind of privacy for his
messages or files.  He couldn't understand why he would want encryption
that would keep the government from reading his data.  He seemed truly 
mystified.  It gave me the willies.
