Not so.

Writers who use computers, journalists who write directly to
electronic distribution, etc., are just as protected against
censorship or prior restraint as paper-oriented journalists are.

Any law which required, for example, writers like us to submit their
writings to some government censorship agency would of course be
struck down immediately.

(Note: "Wartime" situations may be different, which is why I fear the
term "War" in "War on Drugs," "War on Money Launderers," and "War on
Barny Bashers.")
