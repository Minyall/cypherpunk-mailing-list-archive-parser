I was on the show. It was a good presentation, a full hour, with me, Jim 
Kallstrom (FBI), Bidzos, John Droge of Mykotronx (maker of clipper), Marc 
Rotenberg, and a NIST guy, in that order I think.  The host was 
especially deft at sifting the points of disagreement and allowing both 
sides to have a say.
