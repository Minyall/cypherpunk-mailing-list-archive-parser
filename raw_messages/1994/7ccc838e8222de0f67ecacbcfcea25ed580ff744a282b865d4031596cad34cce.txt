Thanks Raph.  This is very helpful for those of us who are code 
handicapped.  This is very helpful as a general guide.  

Unfortunately, I've found that the information that it provides does not  
help me with remailer reliability.  I've seen a remailer that supposedly 
has a latency of 8 or 9 hours, actually delay 24.  

This makes your script fairly ineffectual.

You can't do diddly with bad data ...
