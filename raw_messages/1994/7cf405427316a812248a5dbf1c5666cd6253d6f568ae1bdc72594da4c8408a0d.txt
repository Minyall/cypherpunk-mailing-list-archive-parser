>> [IBM ISDN board with TI DSP, COM1 interface, 64kbps]

last november, on a trade show, i saw AVM presenting a PCMCIA card for ISDN.
it ran BTX alias Datex-J alias Minitel, so there *is* a "application for
the masses". They said to have production running till CeBit-time. sorry,
no further info.
