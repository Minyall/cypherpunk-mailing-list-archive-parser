Yes, this is a lesson history tells us. But maybe, theoretically, strong
crypto could make a change. Nested information with keys known only to
parties with legitimate interest in a specific info layer and the master
key only known to the patient and programs for self destruction (including
backups) of data no longer needed. I repeat, theoretically that is.
