It just occured to me.  Duh!  Squeemish and ossifrage were effectively
messages in time.

Sure, the NSA probably got the message sooner than the rest of us, and
the amount of time for the message to be received was grossly
mispredicted, but a whole bunch of us saw that original Scientific
American article and years later saw the contents.

Given our familiarity with the whole event I think it is pretty clear
how impractical this technique is for info time traveling.
