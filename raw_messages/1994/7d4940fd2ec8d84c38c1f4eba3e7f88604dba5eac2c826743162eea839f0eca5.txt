	I used to work at Best, and as far as I could tell it is so that 
they may send the fliers to your house.  _They_ are so dogged because the 
higher ups require each store to get so many new 'data sets', so we used 
to enter in dummy values, addresses of friends/relatives or ourselves 
multiple times.
	Somebody at the Corp level knew I'm sure, but it kept the 
managers off the sales/register people's backs.
