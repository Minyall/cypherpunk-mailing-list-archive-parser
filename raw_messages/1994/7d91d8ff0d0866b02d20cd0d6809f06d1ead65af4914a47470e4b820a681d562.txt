I've come up with a little .GIF (16K) that equates the U.S. ID card
proposal to 1939 Germany (Germany 1939 on top, Star of David under; below
that USA 1994, with guesstimate of what a US ID card might look like
underneath).
I'm hesitant to post it here, so is there an FTP site I can leave it for
those who might like to have a look at it?  Or would the cypherpunks FTP
site be acceptable?

Thanks.
