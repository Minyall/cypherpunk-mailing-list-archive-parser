Isn't this really just a special case of the more general problem of
deciding which keys on a public key ring you're willing to trust?
Perhaps your mailer script should automatically encrypt only when a
keyid is found with a signature trail that you trust.

I do see a signature for that key from Miron Cuperman. Perhaps
you'd want to modify your trust parameters for him...
