Absolutely.  We certainly welcome any level of comments and criticism
about the SSL protocol and our implementation, and we're recruiting
for one or two more security experts to join us -- we'll be doing quite a bit
of more advanced crypto over the next couple years, if all goes well.
If anyone's interested, please drop me a note.

(I should have sent info on what we're doing to this list sooner, btw --
I can only plead being busy as hell for the last 6 months trying to
get the company up and running.)

They're certainly helping us, reviewing our proposals, etc.
