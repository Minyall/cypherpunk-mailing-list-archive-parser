I've sent a few messages to the E-Cash address.  Never got so much as
an autoreply filled with propaganda.  My conclusion is that E-Cash
for regular folks is going to remain tantalizing vaporware for a long
while to come.

I wish them luck, but I'm not going to hold my breath waiting for the
authentication problems and lack of client availability to get fixed.
(Don't know what I'm referring to?  Just poke around on the E-Cash
web site...)
