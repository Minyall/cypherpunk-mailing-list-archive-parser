I guess in theory GSM is the most secure. Only in practice its not. Many of the
signals from GSM calls can and in some places (e.g. where I live in NZ) go via
analogue repeaters so the call can still be heard of scanners....

Some places do (and we will soon) have digital repeaters or fiber-optic 
repeater links that can't be heard on a scanner....

If someone does really want to listen in on your calls though, they can even
with it being encrypted. The encryption is believe to be a crippled version
of A5 and many people claim to have made devices (usually be re-programming
and hack GSM phones themselves) to decrypt the messages anyway....

Hope this helps...
