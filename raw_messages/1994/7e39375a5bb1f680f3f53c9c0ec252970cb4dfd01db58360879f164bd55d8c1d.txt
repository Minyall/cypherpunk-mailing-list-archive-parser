I don't see this as a real worry. Once the use of RSA is legal worldwide, it
is fairly easy to just yank the RSAREF code and drop in functionally
equivalent, but legally unencumbered, code.  Or, everyone in the US/Canada
could just copy the compatable code from abroad.

they can buy them from me. Easy terms can be arranged.
