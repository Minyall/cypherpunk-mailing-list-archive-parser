There was a long article in April 11, 1994 Forbes: "AUCTIONING THE
AIRWAYS", by George Gilder". It had a supprising amount of technical
information about a new technology similar to spread spectrum. The article
has a "too cheep to meter" flavor that I do not agree with but it does
present some interesting information and ideas.
