Yes, but any set of messages sent under a particular key are 
linked for purposes of traffic analysis. You would need to hand
out (potentially) a key per message, or stacks of keys. At
which point, you're doing something very similar to what I 
suggested. I personally think that it would be easier to manage
fewer keys and use something very simple (like a large random
number) for message tagging, but this is just me.
