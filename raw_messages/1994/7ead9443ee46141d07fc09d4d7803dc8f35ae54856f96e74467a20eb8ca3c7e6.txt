Ok a few things.  To help me, and possibly others, understand this.

(Replace the word "YOU", with your name if you think you understand the 
rating system...)
You want two lists: (of sorts)
  1.  Current list, as is, anything in -> everyone out.
  2.  Rated List, anything in -> filtering/rating -> out.

Now my question is, who's going to spend the time dealing with this.  And 
how are you going to disallow stuffing the ballot, as we all know about 
spoofing.  And who's actually going to spend the time wading through all 
the Cypherpunk mail, and rating it all?

Are you planning on letter the general readers of "list 1" rate articles, 
and then people who subscribe to "list 2" will get anything that passes a 
certain "rating level" (or other criteria)?

Are we looking for something that you run the articles through, and it 
will spit out a "reading level" like most PC word-processors.  Then you 
could ask for just the articles that have <15 misspellings, and a reading 
level above 11th grade...

Pardon me if this isn't quite what some people seem to have in mind, but 
this just looks like electronic version of filling out forms in 
triplicate.
