I was in a hurry and misread something to be supporting something else
that I had misremembered.  I apologize for not being more careful and
I continue to concede the point that NP completeness is defined in
terms of NTMs rather than NFAs.

FWIW, what I misread was a blurb near the front of Formal Languages
and Finite Automata (I'm guessing at the title, the book is no longer
near by) H&U simply described the input to the machine as a tape.
