A 100+ years ago the anarchists (Kropotkin et al) were ousted from the
mainstream socialist movement (Marx et al) mainly because they opposed
strong government. Some years later came a decade of freak murders of 
several heads of state and other prominent persons by disillusioned
anarchists. The image of anarchist = mad assassin has stayed in public
mind ever since and will most probably not change in the near future.
The original anarchists (tm) strongly denounced not only capitalism
but private ownership of everything but your most intimate belongings
(and perhaps your house, this was discussed a lot). There are still
(dis)organized remnants of the traditional anarchistic movement around,
at least in Europe. All this makes the term anarcho-capitalism rather
difficult to interpret. Crypto-anarchy, if not more of a joke, might
share a similar fate and forever associate to mad/criminal hacking
instead of liberty by cipher.

This is true for a literal interpretation of the word, freed of recent
historical ballast. Or perhaps my knowledge of the English language is
failing me. There might be a big difference between anarchy and anarchism.
Anyway, in spite of interpretational difficulties, I welcome the rebirth of
anarchism, the political passion of my youth, through strong crypto.
