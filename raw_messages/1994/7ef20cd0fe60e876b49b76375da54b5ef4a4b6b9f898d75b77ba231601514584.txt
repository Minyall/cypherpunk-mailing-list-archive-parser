I've look a little at using something similiar to Julf's double-blind 
system integrated with majordomo along with an encrypted database of 
addresses.

The user would send mail to listname@sitename, and then be matched to a 
pseudonym and it would be then sent out as pseudonym@sitename to the 
subscribers of the list.  Any mail back to pseudonym@sitename would be 
directed back to the real person and mail replied back to 
listname@sitename would be delivered as a pseudonymed name as well.

The database that matches the pseudonym to the real person would be 
encrypted to prevent prying eyes (although it does increase the overhead 
requred to decrypt the name).  I also looked at using a system that did 
not rely on human input for the keys or passphrases, using a 
machine-generated randomly garbled key phrase or some such.  An 
administrator could get physical access to the key, but without knowing 
the phrase they have a job ahead of them.

Unfortunately, lack of programming experience and time has forced me to 
push it way back on the agenda.
