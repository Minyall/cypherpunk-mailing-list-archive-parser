Here is a possible way to set up a data haven using FTP, instad of
mailing your stuff.

Term is a program that allow you to set up pseudo-SLIP between two
boxes.  It also allows one to redirect ports.

If it would be possible to redirect say port 10000 on box A to the
ftp port of box B, then one could FTP to box A and that would be
for all intents and purposes an "anon remailer" for box B.

This could be chained as well... port A on Box A to port B on box B
to port C on box C to ftp on the target box.

This is a very rough idea.  Authication is still a problem.

Possibly have the files in a directory that is readable, writable,
but not "ls"-able, and the files PGP encrypted, or put them in
incoming, and the server encrypts them with the owner's PGP key, and
renames the file.

- -- Just some rough ideas from one that is awake much too late.
