	So: if we get HR 3627 out of the House Select Committee on 
Intelligence intact, what's the next step? If the resolution passes the 
House, does there have to be a Senate debate as well?

	And, of course, will there be a live broadcast of the vote on CNN 
so we can watch it like we did with NAFTA? ;-)
