Although the concept of "text viruses" seems a bit far fetched to some
people, there these lovely toys known as ANSI bombs. Essentially they work
in a similar method to the some techniques used in the sendmail bug, but
they are MS-DOS specific, they will use embedded ANSI codes to run programs
as the files is viewed... anyone know what will happen if deltree /XXX
(where XXX represents an unpublished string of characters) is run from the
root directory of a DOS hard disk? Its gone, quickly. Sure the files can be
undeleted, but undeleting a whole disk is tricky business...

Maybe Good Times is a hoax, but ANSI bombs exist and using a DOS ANSI text
viewer will surely be a foolish thing to do on any downloaded text file...

If anyone feels the need for proof I collected a few a while back, but
really don't see the need to post them...heh heh.

PS: Please no comments about superiority of MACs or LINUX boxs because they
are immune to ANSI boms...that ought to be clear enough...
