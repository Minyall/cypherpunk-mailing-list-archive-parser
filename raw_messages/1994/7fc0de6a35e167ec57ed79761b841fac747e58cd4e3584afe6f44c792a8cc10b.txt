Analog computers have very different behaviors than
digital computers. I believe that it is possible to
find the longest path in a graph merely by building
a string model of it which takes O(n) time. This
is rusty.

Some guys have also build an analog machine that can
solve 3SAT problems in linear time. They surmise, though,
that the machine must be built with precision that is
exponential in the number of terms. I.e. it won't work. 

I would assume that any QM machines will _not_ be 
exclusively digital. This is the easiest programming
model, but someone may come up with a better one.
