The main problem with this is size and access.  I am actuall talking 
about a system where there is no moderation, or moderation does not stop 
the flow of information, but only modifies what you want to look at.  
This could also be used as a service to help people pick out usefull 
technical articles.

You need to be able to get the article lists from ftp, mail, modem, or 
newsgroup, so that people can pay or not pay.

Basically, this is support for meta-information.
