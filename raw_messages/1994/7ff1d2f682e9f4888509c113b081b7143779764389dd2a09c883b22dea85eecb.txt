All sounds great, but there is one problem - Ida has to download the
file, uudecode it and run it.  I don't see how that's any easier than
downloading it and running pgp...  If Ida is computer-illiterate and
can't download a file and decrypt it with pgp, it wouldn't be reasonable
to expect her to download it and run uudecode.

I think you may have a good idea here, but it's not really ideal for
cryptography.  As Thomas Edison was fond of saying, just because
something doesn't do what you want doesn't mean it's useless.  Perhaps
you should consider the project from a different approach - such as for
self-extracting graphical email.  I know a lot of people who would like
to be able to doodle graphical images in their email, as well as a lot
of hardware hackers that would like to draw circuit diagrams and such. 
Seems like self-extracting graphical email would be ideal for these
purposes.  And of course, you would want to protect it with crypto too.
:)
