Ah, I knew of the GSSAPI's existence but hadn't realized that its scope
included what I wanted.  I'll read the draft on the internic and see
if it does what I want.  If so, the next logical step is to wrap RSAREF
in it and to make a PGPish-wraparound.

I'd certainly be up to the former;  Would anybody else be interested in
ponying up their time and effort for the PGP instance?  (The draft
is ftpable from ftp.internic.net,
/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-cat-gssv2-00.txt)
