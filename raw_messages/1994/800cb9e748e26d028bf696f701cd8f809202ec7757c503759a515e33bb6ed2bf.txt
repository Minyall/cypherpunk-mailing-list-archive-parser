Current art is fairly close to making components whose interaction
requires a full quantum description.

To make a quantum computer from such components requires that
that the components be orders of magnitude faster and more
reversible.

Presently known quantum algorithms cannot tolerate the loss of 
a single quantum of energy, as this will introduce
vacuum noise into the data.

The longer the algorithm takes, the less energy there
is in a single quantum of energy, thus the components
for any long quantum algorithm, such as factoring a 1024 bit
number, must be very fast indeed (near infrared frequencies)
and extraordinarily efficient (fully reversible classical,
non quantum computation.)

Although quantum computers are interesting and important,
they have no immediate practical relevance to cryptography.

Error tolerant algorithms could change the picture substantially,
but they would still require components far beyond current
art.
