The IV is session-dependent, and both ends generate it.
We don't know where in the LEAF the chipid is, but if they
use a fixed format and don't do a key-dependent permutation of the LEAF bits,

it shouldn't be hard to figure out (unless the checksum comes first
and they use a block-chaining encryption, in which case you know you lose.)

That would let you create rogue LEAFs with known users' chipids,
which would be interesting - does anyone want to make 65536 calls to
clipperphone@whitehouse.gov :-) ?  (Yeah, it's not quite that simple.)
(If you do need a lot of data, cellphones are a good source,
since the cellphone operators' chipids are likely to be wellknown, 
though rapidly tapped.)

Paranoid-speculation-mode: Of course, if you can forge LEAFs with
their chipid, they can forge LEAFs with yours, which could be used
to manufacture interesting evidence....
