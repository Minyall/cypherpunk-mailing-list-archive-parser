@ Recently someone posted reference to GI (General Instruments) getting
@ authority to use Clipper chips in descramblers.  One wonders about
@ motivation on their part.  ITAR already exempts the use of crypto
@ in video descramblers where the crypto cannot be used for other purposes.

@ So, what is their motivation?

As I have long predicted, clipper has a likely chance of going into
every cable converter/set-top box. That's 65 million homes and that would
make clipper the defacto encrypt/decrypt system in the world.

Cable systems need strong cypto to prevent not only theft of their
services but to product the transactional data of their customers. (e.g,
to hide what you are ordering on pay per view, your credit card numbers,
etc,) and when they offer voice services they will also need to encrypt
your voice....

This is really big brother in your living room, your bedroom, and if
you have a TV there, you bathroom..... kitchen, den, workstop and
..... well you get the point.
