I got PGP because of the comments by Freeh and I wanted to start 'showing
the flag'.  It was inconveniet doing it right while using reading mail/news
on-line so I settled for just adding the "PGP key available" to my sig.

Then along comes Eric with the idea of signing the posts to cypherpunks.
All right, it's a good idea so I'll spend the time necessary to set up
PGP support with the off-line reader called YARN.  Now, been there done that.

Funny thing is, last night I actually had a valid reason to send something
that I wanted to make sure didn't get read along the way ($ involved).  I
had all the pieces, they were in place, they worked.  And due to time
constraints, I wouldn't have been able to do it, if everything hadn't
been ready.

So, thanks Eric.
