What I would like to see is low-level digital signatures on the level of IP
or AX.25.  IP is doable, I would think.  There's swIPe, and amateur packet
drivers for Linux, but to get people to really use it, you'd need to put it
in the software or hardware they use, like KA9Q (Hi Phil) for IP, and
AX.25.  Would it be possible to fit this into AX.25?  I don't recall that
much about the protocol, and all my packet reference materials are about
300 miles away.
