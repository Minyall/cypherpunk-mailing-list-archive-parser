Our enemies are industriously corrupting the language in order
to make the ideas of liberty inexpressible.   In particular
they are seeking to make the concepts behind the declaration
of independence and the bill of rights unspeakably and therefore,
they hope, unthinkable.

Thus it is often necessary to do a lengthy exegesis, in order
to explain what they are really saying -- see for example
certain recent flame wars.
