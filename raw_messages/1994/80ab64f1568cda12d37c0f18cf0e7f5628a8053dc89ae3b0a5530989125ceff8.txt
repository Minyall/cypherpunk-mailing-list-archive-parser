| If it really is public key, and if the keys really are quite short,

The 129 digit key was broken in 8 calendar months and not 8 CPU months, 
correct? If so then for most purposes a 129 digit key is more than 
adequate. If you are faxing a contract to someone then if the deal 
isn't signed in 8 months the odds are that information about it will 
leak from a different source than your fax. If I had information that I 
wanted to be secure for several years than I would consider using many 
more digits than 129.

As to Windows for Workgroups 3.11, I don't know anything about the 
security features that are included.
