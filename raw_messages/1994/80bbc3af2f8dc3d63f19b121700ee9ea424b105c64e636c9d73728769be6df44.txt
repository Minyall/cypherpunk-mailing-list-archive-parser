Fellow C'punks:

I was wondering if anyone knew of software that
does decryption of weakly encrypted messages,
i.e., similar to ROT13, but perhaps ROT(x) where
0<x<26?  Or maybe a bit more sophisticated, but
not even at the single DES level?

Also...anyone know of any histogram software?
i.e., I input a file, it counts how many
letters of each type, and outputs it in a
table and/or a graph?

If not, I'll have to (horrors!) write code!

Kindest regards,

Dave
