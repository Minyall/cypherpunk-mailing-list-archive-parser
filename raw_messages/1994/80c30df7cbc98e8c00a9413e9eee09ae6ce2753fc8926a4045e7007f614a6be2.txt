It is not a legal requirement.  It is an administrative requirement of the
USPS.  They threaten to withhold delivery of mail addressed to people at
mail receiving services for whom there is no form on file.  In practice
they don't enforce this requirement and as long as a mail receiving
service files "enough" forms, all mail is delivered.

Even without a cooperating mail receiving service, it is trivial to open
a box using "employment ID" printed up in Word for Windows.  They don't
check closely.

Privacy 101:  Since anyone in the land of the free and the home of the
brave can start a business or a school without permission, anyone can
issue his own "employment ID" or "school ID."  Kids - try this at home.
