I wonder about this.

A friend had a Motorola handset he was using with our (Telecom) AMPS
service. When in stand-by mode, it polls the closest cell to determine
link quality and whether any slots are available for use.

When we were on holiday a few months ago, we stayed in a little seaside
town (ie. a small cell) and I can remember eating and noticing the
phone switch to `no service' for a few minutes, presumably as the cell
was fully loaded. While travelling through a National Park the
following day, in the middle of nowhere effectively, the same thing
happened as we went out of network range for a couple of hours.

The question is whether this polling includes the handset identifying
itself to the cell.

Matthew.
