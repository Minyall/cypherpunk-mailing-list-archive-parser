 about this meeting you all are having. once you have had the meeting
 will those of us that are un able to attend for one reason or
 another, be able to find out what went on??? ie a sort of points
 made at he meeting and other general info, in a post to this list.
 i would love to be there. but i don't have access to the irc.
 and my computer time is whenever i get the chance.
 thanks
