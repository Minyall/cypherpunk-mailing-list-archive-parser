And yet again:

Attention - Steven Levy - The most common use of crypto from the dawn of 
time to the present has been to protect commercial information.  There 
were always more traders than governors and they had more need to read or 
count.  Writing was a commercial invention and coding is just another form 
of writing.

How much are we paying these guys department:

Attention - Jim Kallstrom, Fibbie - who argues (correctly) that strong 
crypto is just the same thing as if a criminal gang could build an 
unbreakable fortress in the Bronx and stash Polly Klass inside and the 
government could do nothing...

If the bad guys have an unbreakable wall, the *victims* have an 
unbreakable wall too.  The criminals gain nothing.  They are, in fact, 
worse off since it becomes *harder* to 'break the close.'

There'll be more I'm sure.
