I was just mulling over the assertion that Clipper would be a
"voluntary" standard, and I thought of an analogy.  At best (i.e.,
assuming the Government's not lying, which is sort of like assuming
smoking doesn't cause lung cancer), Clipper would be a voluntary
standard in much the same sense that VHS videocassettes are now a
voluntary standard.  If you don't like it, you can always get Beta.
Of course, good luck renting videos, exchanging tapes with your
friends, buying blank tapes, etc.

Note: I haven't read everything about this controversy that's come
across this list, so if it turns out that I've independently
reinvented this, then sorry for wasting your time.
