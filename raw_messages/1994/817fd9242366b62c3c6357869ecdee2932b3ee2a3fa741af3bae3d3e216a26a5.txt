Perry, please do *not* reveal more about this method. You are
"blowing" my new method. The soundtrack to "Debbie Does Fort Meade" is
apparently the "back door" to DES.

Riemann's Extenuating Continuation Hypothesis was actually proved with
"fractal analysis" and "genetic programming" techniques, both of which
are much more trendy than outdated charlatanism like "neural nets"
(Intel just cancelled its Ni10000 neural net chip, presumably to more
into fuzzy logic and quantum disambiguation...can aptical foddering be
the Next Big Thing?).
