At least at my site, it runs on the server that would otherwise be
putting your mail into your spool file.  I think that this means that
you should build a Sun executable.

Also, you realize that your .forward will now be increasing the load
on your server machine which could make your local sysadmins unhappy.
It's also possible to use a combination of cron, lockfile and formail
to cause your procmailing to be done on your own machine.
