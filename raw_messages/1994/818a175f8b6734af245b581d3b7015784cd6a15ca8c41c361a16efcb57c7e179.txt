Gee, thanks for leting me play, do I get a consolation prize?:-)

Let me think, I still don't see any proof that this does not loose 
entropy, and it could, as if the two parts are not independent of each other.

As soon as you start making a feedback machene, you have no guarentee 
that this is a maximal unless there is no state that is imediatly 
preceeded by two other states.

Simply throwing a lot of stuff at a password is no substitute for a proof 
that the transformation does not loose entropy, which is available if you 
use an encryption algorithim for the last 1023 transformations, and a 
hash function only for the first one.

Sorry to be a pain.

Roger.
