I have to admit that I have broken your fair use copyright notice
inadvertantly.

I have stored an image of your message in the ram on my system which is not a
part of inet or usenet nor involved in any way with the transmission to other
nodes of such stored material.

Berne works great for paper, audio recordings, movies, etc. It does not work
for networked information transmission.
