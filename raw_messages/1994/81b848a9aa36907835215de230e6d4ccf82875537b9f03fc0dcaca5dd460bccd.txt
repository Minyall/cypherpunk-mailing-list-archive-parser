Actually Mike, I am apolitical, however to sensationalize a story for 
profit, ie, OJ Simpson, is wrong before the trail occurs.  It not only 
changes the course of justice and history, but also impairs the public's 
views and objectivity, and the right to trail by a jury of unbiased peers.
The media are not interested in the truth just profits and sensationalism.

What is rightist-leftist media?

Dave
