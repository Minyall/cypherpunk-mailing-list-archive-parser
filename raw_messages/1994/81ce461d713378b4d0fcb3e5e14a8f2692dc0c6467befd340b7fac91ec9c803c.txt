To further answer myself...

Note that we have had telephones for more than 100 years without any
licensing of telephones in this country.  In fact, the telephone companies
were prohibited from denying service save on a number of narrow grounds.
And that was in a much tighter regulatory environment than seems destined to
exist in the future.
