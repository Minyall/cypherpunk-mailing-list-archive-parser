A less prurient article on youngsters use of online services 
appeared in The New York Times today.  Titled "In Cyberspace, 
and Talking to Strangers", by Felicity Barringer.

Barringer states:  "... there are precious few people who have 
been parents in the computer age.  In matters electronic, the 
children rule."

After recounting concern for her son's safety during a few 
mildly racy incidents online, she concludes that he will learn 
to cope with whatever comes up.  And that after giving him "his 
electronic safety pointers, it's time to let him go".
