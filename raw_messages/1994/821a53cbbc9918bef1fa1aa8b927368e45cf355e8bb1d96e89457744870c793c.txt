*** Hmm
  
    The wavelength of IR is longer than that of visible light, so objects
    that appear diffuse/ matt optically may appear shiny/clear in IR.

    As I understand it, high-power military IR targetting lasers 
    being pre-flight tested at airfields have caused nasty eye-accidents
    because of the unexpectedly high reflectivity of concrete walls etc
