I'd like to apologize for stating that the post made by Graham Toal
<gtoal@pizzabox.demon.co.uk> was a forgery.  It has now come to my
attention that it was not.

Graham Toal had always posted from <gtoal@an-teallach.com> until today,
when he suddenly posted from: "gtoal@gtoal.com"
<gtoal@pizzabox.demon.co.uk>, talking about a racist post by TC May that
I had never seen, and asking to be removed from the list.  Naturally, I
got suspicious.

I still don't know what's going on with the email address switching, but
I guess the recent events on cypherpunks have made me a bit overly
paranoid.  Hopefully, I haven't made a complete fool out of myself over
this misunderstanding.

I guess we have another good reason to sign with PGP...
