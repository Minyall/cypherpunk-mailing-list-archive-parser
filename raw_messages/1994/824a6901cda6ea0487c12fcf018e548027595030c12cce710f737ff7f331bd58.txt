And one way to do this that fits in with my original post is via a 
pager-delivered instruction.  Prior to seizure/theft, you would make an 
arrangement with an offshore "escrow agent."  After seizure you would 
send your computer the instruction that says, "encrypt my disk with the 
escrow agents public key."  After that, only the escrow agent could 
decrypt your disk.  Of course, the escrow agent would only do that when 
conditions you had stipulated were in effect.
