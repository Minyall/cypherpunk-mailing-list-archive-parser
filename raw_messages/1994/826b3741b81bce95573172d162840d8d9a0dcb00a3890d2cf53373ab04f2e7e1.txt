Well, gee, perhaps the commercialization of the Ext list is as much
responsible for the end of the shakeout period than the use of clever
list software.

Since it's traditional to push the analogy to ridicule: I'd be more
than happy to run a "$10,000 or 100 Tacky Tokens per year" mailing
list. I'm guessing that I'll see very few debates on my list about the
fairness of the system.

Is intelligence alone a panacea? or is harsh economic reality really
the motivating factor on the Ext list? I've seen a hundred posts in
the last few days about the awful, horrible pay-per-byte services that
doom the free Internet, but it doesn't change the fact that I'll think
twice about paying two cents for the privilege of saying my two cents.
