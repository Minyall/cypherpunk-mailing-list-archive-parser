          TERRORIST FORTRESS SLEUTH REMAILERS & FORTRESS LISTS

   Todd Masco makes a good point about sleuth remailers. For the last
two issues of the CEB in chapter 7. Current problems in crypt, I have
pointed out the need for them. I invented the name FORTRESS REMAILERS
to describe them. I also invented the term FORTRESS MAILING LIST as
well.

   We are in a time window now. In a few years at most, remailers &
lists like Cypherpunks & newsgroups like Sci.crypt may be outlawed.
We may then have two of our most important communications tools taken
away from us in our development of electronic communications privacy
tools. Some will infer from this that if they want secure Internet
communications, then they had better start writing in a hurry. The
State has not consolidated its power enough yet to take away these
"privileges". When they do, these will seem like the good old
careless days of privacy building & possibly even seem like an historic
anomaly. Privacy Freedom Fighters of the future may feel very grateful
to today's Cypherpunks for writing FORTRESS remailers, lists, &
newsgroups so that may continue their work.

   ON THE MATTER OF SECURITY THRU OBSCURITY
   I think that the idea of security thru obscurity is much like having
a strong crypt system that is handicapped by allowing only one password.
The method is limited from becoming popular due to the fact that
popularity would likely disclose the key & then make the system         s
dangerous & useless. Possibly, disastrous to all using it. Due to that
reason, FORTRESS REMAILERS & FORTRESS LISTS & NEWSGROUPS would have to
avoid security thru obscurity.

   It is hard to figure out how to do a FORTRESS remailer or list.
Possibly, a WAN using radio communications as a starting point?
                                                SPECULATIVELY Yours,
                                                Gary Jeffers
