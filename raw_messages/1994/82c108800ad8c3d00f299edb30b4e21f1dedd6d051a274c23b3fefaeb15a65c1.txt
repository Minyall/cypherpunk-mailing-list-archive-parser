I think someone sent me an encrypted message, but I deleted it
by 's Message?', 'd', 'q'. Unfortunately FUCKING UNIX just said
"Message?": No match, but I didn't see that till too late and
now the message is gone. Oh why oh why didn't I use the Mac
Clipboard instead :-( ? Is there any way to get it back? I
have an idea of who it might be so I'll send him too.
