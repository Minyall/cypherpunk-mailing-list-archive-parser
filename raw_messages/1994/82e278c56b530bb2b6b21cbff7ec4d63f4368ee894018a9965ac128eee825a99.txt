   Infact, the birthday paradox just about garantees
   that the number is less than E1*E2*E3.

After thinking about it some more, I think I would like to rephrase
that.  I don't think 2^k is nearly close enough to ((2^k)!)^(1/2) for
me to say 'garantee'.  But, it is possible for E1*E2*E3 to excede the
number of permutations of the e1( e2( e3( x ))) system.
