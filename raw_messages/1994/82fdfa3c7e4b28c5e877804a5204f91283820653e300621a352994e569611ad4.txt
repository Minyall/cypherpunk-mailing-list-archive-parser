I don't think so.  I've bought Western Union calling cards and nobody 
asked for anything but the money.  Every other similar card I've heard 
about was the same way.

Now what could have happened is that they traced the call to the vendor,
and *their* records were traced back.  Since you call an 800 number to
access the system, the ANI (Automatic Number Identification) would have
picked up the number from which the call was made.  I'm still not
convinced, however, because I doubt the vendor companies would keep that
information for very long--if at all.
