    Perry and I are talking about the algormithm (If it exists) being
    O(log_2(n)).  That is, "log base 2 of n".  This means that the
    time taken is proportional to the log to the base two of the
    number of keys.

Actually, for a brief moment there, I thought that Jim choate might
have a partial clue, i. e. that he was pointing out that O(log2 n) is
equivalent to O(ln n), O(log10 n), or whatever base you want.
