An example of use of anonymous servers:

There is a newsgroup called alt.sexual.abuse.recovery [among others], a
healing forum for survivors of sexual abuse/assault [often childhood
sexual abuse], their significant others, and other support people.  For
obvious reasons, for many there is a need for anonymity [many of those who
post would be killed VERY quickly if their true location/identity were
discovered]. 

There is also an irc channel, #**** <name deleted> which is used by
"asarians" for "live" discussions of many issues, ranging from very
serious survivor issues to having electronic snowball fights.  Again, for
many, anonymity is VERY important. 

So yes, there ARE some very legitimate uses for anonymous servers, 
whether irc or email or netnews posting...


If you want any further info, please ask.
