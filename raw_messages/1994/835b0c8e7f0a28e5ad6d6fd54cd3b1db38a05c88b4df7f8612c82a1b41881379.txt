I'm going to take this opportunity to find out how many of your are in NYC
or will be in NYC for PC-Expo?  I just got a flyer today announcing it.  Since
I noticed that Stevens Miller's phone number is in the 212 area code I might
call him and see if he'd be interested in lending a hand with giving out
free secure crypto software at PcExpo...  I bounced this idea around before,
and now it's time to actually work on it. :-)

Who can join in and for which days?  All we have to do is hand out free
cypherpunk disks to people entering/leaving PCExpo and maybe some flyers
along with the disks.  They'll think its some sort of promo, and they'll
be quite correct.  I'll be a Cypherpunks promo.
