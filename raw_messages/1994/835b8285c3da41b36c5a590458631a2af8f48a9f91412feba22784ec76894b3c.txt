When quark theory was invented, it didn't change the conservation of
mass-energy.  When quantum computers are invented, it won't change the
fact that they're still Turing machines.  If it does, that's a
revolution; I'm not waiting.

A single tape Turing machine has the same computational
ability--though not the speed--of a multitape Turing machine, of a
multihead Turing machine, of a multihead multitape Turing machine, of
a register machine, of single/multiple instruction single/multiple
data multiple register machine, of the lambda calculus, of recursive
function theory, and of pretty much every other rich computational
system every invented.  If you still don't agree, I can only steer you
to pretty much any first year formal logic textbook.
