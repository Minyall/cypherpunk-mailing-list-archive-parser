Mr. Bates lukewarm acknowlegement that the First Ammendment
protects such discussions hardly mitigates his other inaccuracies
and in any case, is not at odds with my statement above.

No.  He was just attempting to convince the numerous readers of
the Wall Street Journal that Usenet has a "child porn newsgroup"
filled with the stuff and accessible to everyone on the net.
Once this incorrect notion is sold to the American public, new
laws will follow of their own accord, without need of any further
help from Mr. Bates.
