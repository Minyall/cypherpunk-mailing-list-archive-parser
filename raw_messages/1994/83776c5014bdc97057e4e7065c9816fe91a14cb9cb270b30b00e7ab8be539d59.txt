I just want, in a short message, let you know that there exist some
satisfied ecash testers (the system itself and the support when we
set-up our digishop and our plain customers cyberwallets).
  The only thing I could eventually complain about is that I even received
a second (unsollicited) account Id and password to retrieve ecash
software because of a bug in the requests management :-)
