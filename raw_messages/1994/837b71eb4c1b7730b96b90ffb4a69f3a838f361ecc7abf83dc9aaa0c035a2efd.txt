Remember that a "modem" such as we are used to is a much more complex
device (at least the firmware, and you do pay for that :-) than what is
required for simply modulating and demodulating a fixed rate, framed
bit stream.

Today's modem chip sets invariably have a general purpose microprocessor
to do all the Hayes type stuff and a DSP to do the actual bit stream
modulation/demodulation (and digital filtering and echo cancelation,
etc.) where my device can be the DSP alone and requires no RS232 ports
or the like.  This will result in a saving.  In short, what is
required for a voice-only device such as I am initially thinking about
is a subset of what is required for a computer modem.


Peace,
