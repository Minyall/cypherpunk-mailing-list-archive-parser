  Thanks for the overview of www proxies. One correction--nntp is the
network news (USENET) transport protocol, http is the hypertext (www)
transport protocol. Upon first reading, I was confused about how news
admins could become ``remailer operators of the web''. If you really
did mean to use ``nntp'', then I'm still confused.
