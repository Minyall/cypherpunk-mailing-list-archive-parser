Picking any fixed sig marker is likely to cause problems -- notice
how often anon.penet.fi messages show up truncated due to a line of
hyphens.  A more flexible possibility: allow an X-Sig-Marker: header,
which specifies a pattern/regexp to strip after.  Actually, the
sig marker line itself should be stripped as well, in case it
contains identifying information.

I don't see the problem you're guarding against.  Could you explain?
Seems that sig elision needs to be done once, by the first hop, and
then you're home free.
