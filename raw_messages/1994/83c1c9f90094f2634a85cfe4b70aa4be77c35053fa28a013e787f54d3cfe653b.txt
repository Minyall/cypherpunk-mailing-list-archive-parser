Hey.  You.

Have you sent your letter of support to Rep. Cantwell yet?

It's now even easier than ever!

Just reply to this very message with your reasons for supporting the
bill (it's to allow export of crypto software, dummy), and your mail
will be automagically sent to the correct EFF address with the right
subject line.

(And don't include this message, OK?)

For the full text of the bill, see any of the following:
