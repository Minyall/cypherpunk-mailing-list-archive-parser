On sci.crypt on Feb 23, I posted (from world.std.com) a description
of a variant on my favorite

	des|tran|des|tran|des

with the inner DES rotating through N different keys, one block each.
(This is no sweat, if you have S/W DES.)  The result is a *huge* amount of
key material to be derived by cryptanalysis.

I also posted the keyless tran.

I won't pad this list with a re-post.
