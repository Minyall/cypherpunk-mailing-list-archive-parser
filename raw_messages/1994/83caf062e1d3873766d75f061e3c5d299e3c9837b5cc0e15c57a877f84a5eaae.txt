[various people speculated about legality of a company requiring your SSN]

There's a Social Security Number FAQ posted regularly on alt.privacy, and
also available from the usual usenet FAQ sites. It says that government
agencies in the U.S. have restrictions regarding asking for and using your
SSN, but private sector organizations do not. There's a lot more detail,
but I don't need to repeat it here.
