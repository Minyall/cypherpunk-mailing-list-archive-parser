   I have recieved a pair of similar messages; I found it quite 
irritating.  The message is apparently from rcalasso@netcom.com, with 
pointers to ghoast@gnu.ai.mit.edu.

   Yes.  It irritates the shit out of me, to put it bluntly.  I didn't 
post anything remotely insecure, but how am I to know that my admins will 
even read the text of my message?  I don't want my account-space 
searched, even though I'm not worried about anything being found - it's a 
matter of principle.

   Addresses are above.
