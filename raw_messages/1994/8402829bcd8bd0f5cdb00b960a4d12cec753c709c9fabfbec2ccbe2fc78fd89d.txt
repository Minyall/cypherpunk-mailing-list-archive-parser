As I've pointed out before, MIT PGP 2.6 _is_ outside the US. I'll list just
one site:

ftp.dsi.unimi.it /pub/security/crypt/PGP/pgp26.zip

Anyway, lucky non-US users can use the better PGP 2.6ui based on the original
code which is faster than MIT PGP's RSAREF. contact mathew@mantis.co.uk

ftp.dsi.unimi.it /pub/security/crypt/PGP/pgp26ui*
