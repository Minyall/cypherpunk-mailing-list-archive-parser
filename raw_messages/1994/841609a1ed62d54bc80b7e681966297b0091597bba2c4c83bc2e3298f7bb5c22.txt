It is with deep regret that I inform you all that the digested version of 
the list is no longer available.

The machine that the digested version was running from was removed from 
the network due to a power-ploy by faculty and administration in computer 
services and the computer science department.

It is my hope that in about two weeks when school officially resumes, I 
will be able to get the machine restored.  At that point, I will attempt 
to recoordinate with Eric to get the digested list set back up.

I apologize.
