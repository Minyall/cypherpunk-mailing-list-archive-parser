The SSL Protocol

The SSL protocol has been submitted to the W3O working group on security
for consideration as part of a general security approach for the Web, and
we are actively working within the W3O and with many of its member entities
on establishing open security standards for the net.

This protocol specification was last revised on November 29th, 1994. Recent
changes include:
        a fundamental correction to the client-certificate authentication
            protocol,
        the removal of the username/password messages,
        corrections in some of the cryptographic terminology,
        the addition of a MAC to the messages [see section 1.2],
        the allowance for different kinds of message digest algorithms.

Status of this Memo

       This RFC specifies a security protocol for the Internet community,
and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements. Distribution of
this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

       This document specifies the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, a
security protocol that provides privacy over the Internet. The protocol
allows client/server applications to communicate in a way that cannot be
eavesdropped. Server's are always authenticated and clients are optionally
authenticated.
