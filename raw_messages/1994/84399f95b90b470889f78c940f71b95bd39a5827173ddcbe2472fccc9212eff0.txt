For top of the line crypto, you are absolutely correct. For a learning
resource, I disagree.

The concept of testing a RNG's stabilty and operating characteristics
is something which is directly crypto related. Much more so than pedophilia
or alt.whatever.rainbow.......

To help those who don't have access to this material other than through
e-mail. And no I am not going to create a list of people and manualy
setup some form of sub-list to filter this stuff according to each 
individuals interest. I don't have the interest, time, or the information
on each and every  member of c-punks to carry this out.

RNG's are commenly used in crypto, to understand the more compicated techniques
one must learn the more mundane basics.

My main rationale is that while I see lots of people making suggestions I dont
see any of them actually carrying it out. In the whole time I have been on 
this list I have *never* seen referals to the newsgroups. I have seen a 
general trend to repost this material so that people simply have it right 
then and there instead of having to send a sub-group  roaming around looking
for it. Seems a much more labor saving system.
