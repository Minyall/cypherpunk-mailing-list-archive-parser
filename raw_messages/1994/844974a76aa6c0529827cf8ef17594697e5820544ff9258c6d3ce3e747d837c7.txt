the soda cypherpunks site, with source for pgp, the remailers,
and much other useful information, is moving.  the new
name for the site is ftp.csua.berkeley.edu.  this will actually
poing to soda until the summer, at which point it will move
to its own machine.  please start refering to the site
as ftp.csua.berkeley.edu to make the transition as smooth
as possible.
