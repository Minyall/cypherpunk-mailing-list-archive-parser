As darwinian as it seems, perhaps someone should just tell the guy how to 
bust Norton's encryption, eh?

Since when are cypherpunks relationship counslers?

If she gets burned using norton encrypt, perhaps she'll take the time to 
learn about real encryption.  (I assume Norton's is trash)

Short term privacy loss perhaps, but long term gain.

If it were to be otherwise, I guess we all better stop posting crypto 
weaknesses at all, afterall, who knows what girlfriend will next be 
violated if we tell joe hacker how to break e.g., enigma.

While everyone is at it, why not just subscribe wholeheartedly to the 
security through obscurity doctrine...?

The more I think about the above, the more I wonder if those on the list 
have conflicting goals, that is, absolute privacy by agreement.  Are we 
really that naive?  If so, why develop crypto at all?
