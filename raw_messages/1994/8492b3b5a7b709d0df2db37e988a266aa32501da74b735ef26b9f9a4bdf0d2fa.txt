Well, this *might* be a stalling tactic, or it might just be typical
bureaucratic behavior.

Put yourself in the bureaucrat's place: you start working on this
problem, and you decide everything looks OK for approving the request.
You take the approval form to your superior for a sign-off, and she
asks "How thoroughly did you examine the material?"  Nobody in their
right mind would want to be in this position and have to answer "Well,
I didn't look at it at all.  They said it was the same as this other
stuff here."
