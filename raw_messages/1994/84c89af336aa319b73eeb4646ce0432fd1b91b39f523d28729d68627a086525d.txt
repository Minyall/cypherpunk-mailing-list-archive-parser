	Ok, I saw a blurb on the new about the the senate debating 
Clipper. The basics were stated.
1) The FBI wanted phone companies to be forced to comply.
2) Privacy advocates said it would be an invasion.
Then they showed clips of terrorists and kidnappers who had been
caught thanks to wiretapping. 

On the subject of home privacy. I am attempting to build a laser
bug. The type that one bounces of a window. Does anyone know of 
the technology involved in such a project? I already have acess
to a laser, but it is the photocell that I need more infomation 
on. Anyone?
 
Artimage.
