It has not been proved to be NP.  But all known methods are NP.  If
P=NP then these methods could be executed in polynomial time.

If there is nothing strange about the brain, then either AI is not
NP, or P=NP

We are wandering rather far from cryptography, so I will refrain
from discussing the description of the perception problem in
terms of a special case of a problem whose general case is NP
complete.
