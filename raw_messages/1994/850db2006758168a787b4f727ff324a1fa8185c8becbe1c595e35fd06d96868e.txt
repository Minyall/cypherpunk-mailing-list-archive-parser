I would like to hear from CP's who have implemented PGP on OS/2.  I'm a
little concerned that I can only encrypt FAT files when the bulk of my 
data are on HPFS formatted drives.  Is there a group out there?

Second item.  I have some comments on Communications Security (COMSEC)
I would like to make but I think I'd better post anonymously.  Could
someone point me to a suitable forwarder?

Thanks.
