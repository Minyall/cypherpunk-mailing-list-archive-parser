I tested PGP Tools with the #define in place to force all set_precisions
to max unit precision. There didn't seem to be any speed difference, even
with a 384-bit key. If this works okay, it could probably be left the way
it is. Someone with a big-endian machine, please compile the new version 
when it arrives, and see if it works. Thank you.
