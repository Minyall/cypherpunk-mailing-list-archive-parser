A mathematical space need not be linear, even locally, and therefore
it need not have dimensionality.  While the use of the word space
started as a reference to our spatial experience, it has generalized
out of that restriction.

Here's how I explained it a recent cypherpunks meeting:

	John Gilmore is the pope.  He owns the hardware.
	Hugh Daniel is the cardinal.  He does much of the maintenance.
	Eric Hughes is the king.  He looks like a figurehead.

Insert your own conception of divine right of kings, etc., in order to
complete the analogy.  Should I ever move the list to my own hardware
and net connection, I get to be Napoleon.
