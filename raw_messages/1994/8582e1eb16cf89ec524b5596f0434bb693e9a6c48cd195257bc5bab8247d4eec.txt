Before the (unsigned) reputation of Critias_the_conspirator is tossed
about further, I was the author of the "anonymous" version.

(No, I can't prove this, either, but such is life.)

I wanted to remind folks of just how easy such unsigned reps can be
"used" by others. (No, I don't sign my own messages, due to hassles
with uploading signed messages to my Internet host, but I also rarely
use digital pseudonyms.)

I used the ``TeX'' style of quoting to suggest certain Medusan poster.

In any case, I have come clean, having made my point, I hope.
