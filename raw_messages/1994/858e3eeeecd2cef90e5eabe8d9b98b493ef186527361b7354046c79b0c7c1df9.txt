Title:  A small Company offers a scanning device to make faxes 
private by encoding their computer bits.

By:  Sabra Chartrand



Some excerpts:

The Kryptofax Corporation . . . was set up to sell a scanning 
device that uses encryption algorithms to turn fax text into 
indecipherable dots on a page.

***

Then the most critical thing is to provide a password, says 
Richard Varga, a former computer programmer who is the 
president.

***

The encoded page emerges with the title and addressee name 
appearing in plain language at the top.  The rest is a grid of 
random dots.

***

As the [receiving] Kryptofax machine reads the encrypted grid, 
it begins simultaneously to print a decrypted version of the 
page.

***

We use an encryption algorithm called seeded pseudo-random 
number generator, Mr. Varga said.  The company chose that 
algorithm because it is in the public domain, he added.

The Kryptofax Corporations's patent is 5,321,749.
