    Pizza Hut is merely taking orders a slightly different way.

Yup.  In fact, extremely similar systems existed before the pizza
places even realized it.  There's been some kind of Xpizza program
around for quite a while.  All it requires is that you can send a fax
from a program and that your pizza place accepts faxed orders.  You
run the program, click in your toppings, etc. and click OK to send the
order.
