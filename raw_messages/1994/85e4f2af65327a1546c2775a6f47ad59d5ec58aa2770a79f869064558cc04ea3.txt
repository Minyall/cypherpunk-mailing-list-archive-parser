Subject: Any cypherpunks building encrypted phone?

	Hello everyone!  I'd like to know if anyone on the list has made
any attempt to construct a true encrypted phone, something at the
level of the AT&T DES phone.  I think that it ought not to be too
difficult to build a couple, using existing modems and basic hardware
design.  If all the commercial phones are going to be Clipper-based,
we'll have to build the real ones ourselves.
