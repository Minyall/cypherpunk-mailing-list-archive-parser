This does present some problems to an attacker.  There's a tradeoff
between the effective key length and the complexity of the enumerator
to generate these keys.  The fancier the model, the lower the
passphrase entropy, but the harder -- and slower -- it becomes to use.
This all seems hard to quantify, though.
