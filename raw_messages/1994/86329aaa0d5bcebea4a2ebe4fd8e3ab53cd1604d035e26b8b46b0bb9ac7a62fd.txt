   I only worry that if I publish, it could be patented.  And I don't
   want the algorithm to end up in the hands of the software patent
   folks.  Especially if they will be making money off it, and I wont.

If you publish, only you can patent.  One must be the 'true inventor'
(or some similar term of art) in order to file a patent on an
invention.  As someone pointed out, a system can be re-invented; then
that person is also a true inventor and can patent.

Publication is protection against patenting.  This is one of the main
reasons behind such publications as the IBM Technical Journal--the
publication of results not worth patenting themselves, but definitely
worth preventing others from patenting.  Publication of a result
precludes this.
