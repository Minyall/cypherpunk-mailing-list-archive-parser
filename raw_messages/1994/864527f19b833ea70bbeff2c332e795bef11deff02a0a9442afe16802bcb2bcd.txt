I must say that I agree here.  I don't think that he can stop him from 
making any modifications to PGP, but I think that he can stop him from 
using the name PGP on it.  I think that he has every right to do this.  
PGP is tied very closely with his reputation and that any modifications 
released under the name PGP should be his and his alone.
