Well, if "they" (those who are in power, usu. government) don't know
what the hell you're doing, and are trapped by their own laws and fear
of public unrest into permitting you to hide your actions from them,
then they can't control you. That's the theory, at least.

Given the propensity of humans to form power structures, particularly in
times of unrest, it's probably not paooible given our current
evolutionary state. Maybe in a bunch o'decades...
