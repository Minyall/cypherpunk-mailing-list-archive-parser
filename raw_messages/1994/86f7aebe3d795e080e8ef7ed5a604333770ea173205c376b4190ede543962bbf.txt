I got information from my Senator on the proposed new currency.  Not the
recent changes, but the new bills coming in a year or two.  He got it from
the Treasury (big letters across the top) but the FAX id info says DEA.

It mentions 'Machine Detectable Thread' and "Additional Machine-Detection
Features' but does not elaborate.

If it's machine trackable (I remember hearing about machine readable serial
numbers a couple of years ago) we can always set up cash exchanges.  Might
even be able to make a profit at it!
