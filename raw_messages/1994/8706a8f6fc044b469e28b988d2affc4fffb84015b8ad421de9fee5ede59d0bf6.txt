I don't know much about modern munitions, but I do know that armor
piercing rounds may have no charge in them at all.  Generally, when a
round pierces one side of a vehicle, it loses enough energy and is
suitably deformed to prevent exit from the opposite wall.  It does,
however, bounce around quite a bit, which can be plenty of fun in a
tank loaded with equipment, munitions, and soldiers.

It was discovered in the second world war that (with then-current
metallurgical techniques) introduction of a high-explosive charge into
the armor piercing round tended to reduce its effectiveness by
weakening the structure.
