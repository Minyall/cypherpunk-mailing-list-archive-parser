Regarding the simple question about Norton Encrypt's security (and ignoring
the alt.relationship-counsellor interlude), I believe Norton uses DES (for
'maximum security' or a 'fast proprietary' method for convenience. I don't
think it has the usual errors (password stored in ciphertext etc), but a
brute force attack on DES is beyond the means of most Norton users IAC.
