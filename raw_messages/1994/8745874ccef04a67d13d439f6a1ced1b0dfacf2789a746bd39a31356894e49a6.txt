If your spelling is correct then several of my books have mis-spellings.

As to Chob(h)am bing classified, this was true till the late 80's. It is
a ceramic based layered with cintered metallics that dissipate the KE
of the incoming round.      

The Russians also developed this method for the T-72's at about the same
time. It was discovered that the 'applique' armor on the T-72 was really
this type of armor that could be bolted on. The reason that I lump the
two together is that they both require a dual warhead to defeat.

I have seen the exact same chain-gun mounted on F-16's and A-10's here at
Bergstron AFB in Austin at at least two different air shows. I am going on
this alone. I do not know if this was ever an active use of the gun.

Could you provide references for this application? I did technical support
for Desert Storm and know of no use of such depleted armor in that campaign.
Has Chrysler started putting applique style blocks on the M1 Abhrams?

Take care.
