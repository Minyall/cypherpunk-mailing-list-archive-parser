I use both digital and analog circuits in some of my designs and they are not
necessarily reducable. Just because you can use a neural network to solve a 
problem using conventional architecture machines does not a priori prove    
anything about the reducability of the technology.

I would have to say that 'spin glass' model neural networks might be such a 
model. However, either way you approach it (yours o r mine) it has not been
done and assuming it is the same will lead to some problems. 

Complexity theory is mathematics so I would have to say your last assertion 
is total drivel.
