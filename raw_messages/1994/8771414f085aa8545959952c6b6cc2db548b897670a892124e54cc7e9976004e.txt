Whew! Thanks, Brad, for setting me straight on this. I _did_ think you
were endorsing censorship, not having seen the Vonnegut piece and not
knowing he was making an ironic point.

In my defense, to the extent there _is_ one, I've seen public figures
go dotty (and I _do_ mean like Dorothy) in their old age, supporting
all kinds of strange and fascist positions in defense of the Old
Order. But I guess that in Vonnegut's case, that would be too
unbelievable. (In Heinlein's case, though.....)

I'm fucking relieved.
