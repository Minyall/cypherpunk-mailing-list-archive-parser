	Sounds along the lines of "It's a privilage, not a right"
	[granted, this is a privately run list.. but that's not
	 what we're about.. at least that's what I've been led
	 to believe]

	I want to know that the people I'm talking to are the people I
think they are.. and that is why I do my own authentication, when I can.
If I trust the machine to do it for me, then I've just shot two large
holes in my objective. [THE LIST database could me tampered with;  The
PGP sigs could be forged from the start]

	It IS censorship if people's posts are trashed because
they are either anonymous or a forger.. even forged posts are
sometimes important.. See my other posts regarding LIST authentication,
not filtering.
