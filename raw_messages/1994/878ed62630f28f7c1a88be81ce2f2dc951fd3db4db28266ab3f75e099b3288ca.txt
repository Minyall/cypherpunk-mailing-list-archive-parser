Vincent.Cate@FURMINT.NECTAR.CS.CMU.EDU once said:

:If we use "nobody" as an email address we can hide remailers or make it
:seem like there were remailers where there are not, etc.
:
:The convention on the Internet is for mail to "nobody" to go to
:"/dev/null".  This is used as a return address when you don't want bounced
:mail.
:
:Now remailer operators are clearly more interested in privacy than in
:following conventions.  Imagine remailers also had addresses like
:"nobody@vox.hacktic.nl", and "nobody@jpunix.com".  

You now can choose from three cypherpunx remailers at vox.hacktic.nl :

    -> remailer@vox.hacktic.nl
    ->   remail@vox.hacktic.nl
    ->   nobody@vox.hacktic.nl
