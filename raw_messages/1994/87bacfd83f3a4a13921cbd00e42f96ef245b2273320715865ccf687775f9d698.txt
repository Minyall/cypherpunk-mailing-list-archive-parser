Advice, please:  I plan on purchasing notebook PCs for myself and
colleagues to that are capable of running much-awaited Phil
Zimmermann's voice encryption program. I'll probably get something based
on the 486 DX2 chip. What type of sound card must these computers be
capable of accepting in order to run the encryptor?
