	Well, once Community ConneXion: The NEXUS-Berkeley is running,
accounts and services will be available for half-price if the other
half is paid in NexusBucks (not yet available). (Eventually I'd like
to move to a full-payment in NexusBucks, but I want to verify that I
can meet my bottom line .. PacBell and The Little Garden don't take
payment in NexusBucks.)
	(TLG willing, this will be running soon)


	Does anyone have any pointers to where I could find out about
LETS? Thanks.
