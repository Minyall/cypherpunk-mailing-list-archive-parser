"I am not a number!" - The Prisoner

Though na48138@anon.penet.fi is still forwarded to me, I have decided to change
the PGP Info Clearing House address to qwerty@netcom.com. When I first got
an anon.penet.fi nickname I figured (wrongly) that people could mail me at
Xenon@anon.penet.fi. Oh well. So now the qwerty-account/remailer will be
receiving mail from basically random addresses out there. This is a fun twist,
being a unique partial solution to the traffic analysis problem. All the
remailers are now sending to other than the Cypherpunks now as well. And the
people wanting PGP info will get it without anon.penet.fi delays. No more of
their forgetting to use na instead of an too.

So how hard is that to remember?: Send mail to QWERTY at NETCOM.COM with
Subject "Bomb me!" for Gary Edstrom's PGP FAQ and Xenon's "Here's How to
MacPGP!".

Finger qwerty@netcom.com for info on the remailer there. It would be nice
if every remailer gained a standardized BitBucket. To keep things simple, I
suggest nothing more complicated than what qwerty uses; just request
remailing to /dev/null. I'm using Hal's remailer, with a few updated
files, and have used his outgoing address filter. These lines thus appear in my
maildelivery file:

# Blocked outgoing addresses
Request-Remailing-To    whitehouse.gov    file A  LOG.BLOCKED
Request-Remailing-To    /dev/null         file R  /dev/null
Request-Remailing-To    /dev/null         pipe A "/usr/bin/echo BB >> LOG"

The A means after the "BB" has been appended to my counter file, the mail
is considered delivered.
