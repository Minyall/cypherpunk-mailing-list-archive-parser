  Yep, you give them the numbers and they still mess it up. My boss's 
credit report had him with 2 Sears cards, one not his. My friend's credit 
report showed that he had a lein agains his house(he doesn't own one), a 
reposses car(not true), garnished(sp?) wages(not true). Pretty sad.

  I guess a nation ID card/number/barcode/embedded microchip would solve 
this, wouldn't it? I can see us making the progression - in 10 years all 
newborns will have a small uP implanted into their hand(ala Demolition 
Man) that will keep track of all their electronic data. Scares the crap 
out of me.
