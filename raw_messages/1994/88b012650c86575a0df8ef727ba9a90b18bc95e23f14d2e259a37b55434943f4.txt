How can sitting in jail cell under contempt of court charge for undetermined
periods be considered cruel or unusual punishment? Would seem to me that if
a person refuses to comply and reveal their keys they should expect some
form of legal retribution.

If a person were to sit there long enough I am shure they would crack if
for no other reason than family pressure and the sure realization that 
their homes and other possessions will be repossessed or otherwise lost.
