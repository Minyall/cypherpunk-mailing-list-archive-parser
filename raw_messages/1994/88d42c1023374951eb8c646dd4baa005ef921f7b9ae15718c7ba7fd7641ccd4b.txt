Network World of June 6, 1994 has a brief article on DSS.  In the article 
it says that "some firms do not appear worried about legal threats fron PKP.
AT&T, which sells SecretAgent - software that uses both DSS and RSA 
signatures - has not obtained a patent for DSS from PKP; neither has 
Information Security Corp., the Deerfield, Ill. bases company that 
develops SecretAgent exclusively for AT&T."  

What do they know that we do not?  Makes you wonder about all of PKP's 
claims.  Has PKP ever sued anyone over their patents or have they just 
threatened?  Very curious.
