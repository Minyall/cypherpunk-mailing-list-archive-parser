   Who cares? I mean, really?

Because credentials are portable reputation.  A college is not a place
of higher learning, it's a reputation-granting institution.  A college
degree is no more valuable than the reputation it grants to you.  And,
once you establish your own reputation (as I have in my field), a
college degree becomes moot.  I wish colleges understood that.  I wish
students understood that.

This leads me to wonder how encryption helps make portable
reputations?  Can it even?
