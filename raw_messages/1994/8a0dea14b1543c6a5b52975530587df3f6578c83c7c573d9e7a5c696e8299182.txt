The media was making a big deal last night about the seizure of 
twenty pounds of U-238.  This, of course, is the non-radioactive
isotope of uranium in which trade is relatively unrestricted.  It does
make excellent shell casings and has a few other mundane industrial 
uses.

I wonder why the issue of bomb parts is now being given such a
huge push in the press?
