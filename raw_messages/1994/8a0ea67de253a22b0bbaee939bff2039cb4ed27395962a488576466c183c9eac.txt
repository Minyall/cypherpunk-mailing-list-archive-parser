in response to the post about the joe-six-pack worry level
if they get clipper int he phone next they will have it in the fax's
the TV is next, seeing that most of it in 10 years will go over 
smart lines to give you more choices, there was a 10,000 home test
in broklyn just last year, the NSA and other agencies won't
give up the opptunity to easily, in fact they might just go 
around " those dumb congressmen" if the chip and the means to make it
are banded by law. 

my financee who hearing me talk about this list, and hte clipper
has gone out and told others in a laymens term,,
" hey did you know the gov't is trying to put a chip in all new fones
that could make it possible for hte police to just listen in on your
talks to others. just by pressing a few keys"
though it is not to acurate, it gets the point across to joe and jill
making them wonder at what they are saying and who might be
listening.. wonder what it all will bring in 20 years??
