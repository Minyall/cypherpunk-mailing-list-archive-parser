Hrm...  As far as I recall they showed how to do _message_recovery_ (not 
encryption) with the discrete log signature functions.  Message recovery 
and encryption are two quite different things for assymetric schemes such as 
the discrete log ones (as opposed to RSA).  Correct me if I'm wrong...

Yea, cool stuff, especially if the fax doesen't shrink the transmitted 
picture :-)  This is also great for demonstrating crypto to newbies by 
showing that noise+noise=picture.
