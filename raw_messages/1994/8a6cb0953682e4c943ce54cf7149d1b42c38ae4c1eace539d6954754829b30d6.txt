There may be killfiles for certain mail readers, but I would prefer a
solution which filters the mail before it gets to my mail reader.  On
Unix, such filters can be installed as pipes in the .forward file.
One such filter is called procmail.

I just started using procmail, and it's great.  I'm now getting all my
mailing lists in separate mailboxes; this separation improves both my
regular mail and my mailing lists.  Try it.
