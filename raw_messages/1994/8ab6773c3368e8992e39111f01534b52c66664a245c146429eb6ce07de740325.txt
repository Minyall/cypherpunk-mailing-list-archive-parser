Whatever we end up with, and I'm agreed that things are changing very
fast, that government will have to have the support of the people.  No
government lasts long without that.  And I'll end this political thread

( Sometimes my posts to cypherpunks appear here AND I get a msg back
saying the msg bounced.  Sometimes the entire msg bounces for no
apparent reason.  Does this happen to anyone else? )
