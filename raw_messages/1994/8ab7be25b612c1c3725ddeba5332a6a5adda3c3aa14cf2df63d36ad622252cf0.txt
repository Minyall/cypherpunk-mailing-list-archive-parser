C'punks,

I've used lynx to connect to PMIP to see the c'punx list like:
     lynx http://pmip.maricopa.edu/crypt/cypherpunks

I connect okay, but get the message that the requested URL isn't on the
server if I want to see anything but the Parent Directory selection.

Maybe this is an "under construction" effect?

Sheldon
