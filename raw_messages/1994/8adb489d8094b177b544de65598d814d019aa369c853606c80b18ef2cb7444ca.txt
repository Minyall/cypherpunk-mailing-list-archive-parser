For those who haven't been paying attention, the Cantwell Bill could
die in the intelligence committee. Please pay attention to Stanton
McCandlish's alert from EFF and act on it TODAY. Call up those
congressmen! When I called, most of them indicated they hadn't heard
from people. Make the phone ring off the hook with concern that this
measure pass!

As always...

Be polite when speaking to congressional staff. Realize that they
don't know anything about what you are talking about and are just
going to record names, addresses, and "supports HR XXXX" when you
call. Be clear and fairly quick and always be nice to them.
