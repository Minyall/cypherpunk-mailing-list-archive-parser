Hmm... wish I had the exact original handy to mis-quote,

They came for the drug dealers, 
    but I wasn't a drug dealer so I said nothing
They came for the pornographers,
    but I wasn't a pornographer so I said nothing
They came for the gamblers,
    but I wasn't a gambler so I said nothing
Then they came for me,
    but there was no one left to say a thing
