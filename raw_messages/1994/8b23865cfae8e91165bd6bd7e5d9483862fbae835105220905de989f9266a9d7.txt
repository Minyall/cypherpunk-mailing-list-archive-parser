In Applied Cryptography, Schneier describes digital cash protocols that
depend on the cut and choose method:  Alice prepares 100 anonymous money
orders for $100, sends them all to the bank, which opens all the envelopes
except one picked at random.  If the 99 envelopes checked have money
orders for $100, then the bank is confident that the one they sign blindly
will be for $100 as well. 

Chaum's system uses different keys for different denominations.  Alice 
only sends one envelope, and the bank uses its $100 key to sign it.

I don't understand why anyone would use the cut and choose protocol over 
denominated keys.  Chaum's method seems a lot cleaner to me and more 
secure.  It obviously uses less bandwidth.  What am I missing here?
