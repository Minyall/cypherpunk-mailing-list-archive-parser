Subject: beta test volunteers wanted

I am in the process of starting beta tests on some server-based
email filtering software. I need some volunteers to help debug the
system. I'll have to ask you to commit to an informal, temporary
nondisclosure agreement. If you are interested, please send me mail.

Thanks--
