I respectfully submit that this would be a BIG waste of money.
TV time is not cheap, and since most infomercials are run by
crackpots or scam artists (or that's the general view of 'em,
in my opinion), this wouldn't buy us much at all.  If people
are interested in a media barrage, a big ad in a major newspaper
would be money better spent (though I have my doubts about that,
too).
