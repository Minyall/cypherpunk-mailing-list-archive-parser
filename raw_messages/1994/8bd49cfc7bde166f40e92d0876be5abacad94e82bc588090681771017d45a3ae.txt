but wait!  you can't actually verify the outer sig until you extract the key
from inside the signed message?  that's a bit more complicated.  pgp will
actually recognize a key embedded inside an armored, signed message but it won't
(i don't think -- warlord?) play with the key other than tell you it is one.

what these people should probably be doing is signing their public keys with
their private keys to provide the same functionality (almost).  what you have,
otherwise, really is a two step process.  you will have to strip off the outer
sig layer to get the the key.

i believe if you used emacs to read your mail, you might get that sort of
functionality since it's very user-customizable (is that a word?).  i wrote
myself a little perl wrapper to handle signing/encrypting outbound messages
so that i don't have to type all the options and redirect the output or move
output files.  it's a one person thing.  to each his own.  i prefer to read
my mail in a very un-adulterated form and i do all my sig verifying and
decrypting by hand too.  i'm weird that way.

apologies to warload, you are right (imho) about the fundamental behavior of
remailers.  they shouldn't do things like that except perhaps atttemp to
remove the outer armor layer if it is an encrypting/decrypting remailer.

peas and goobles!
