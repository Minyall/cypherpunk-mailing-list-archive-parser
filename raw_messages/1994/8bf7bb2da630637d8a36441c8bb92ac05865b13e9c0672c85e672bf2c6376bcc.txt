No kidding! As soon as you make sex more "verboten" then people immediately
search for ways to circumvent the ban.

Well, I think it will be the trigger hopefully generates more remailer's
in Europe. So far we only (since the evident demise of wein) have usura's 
excellent
remailers in the Netherlands. It would be nice if more were placed overseas,
beyond the reach of U.S. pressure.

At least being able to add another couple in a chain (before your message
hits the U.S. remailers like underdog, jpunix, portal, et al) should
lessen the danger of ultimate compromise of your identity even further. I
suspect the Euro-remailer operators would likely just be able to thumb
their nose at whatever cries of outrage eminate from this side of the pond.

That would be a switch...Europe "liberating" North America! :>
