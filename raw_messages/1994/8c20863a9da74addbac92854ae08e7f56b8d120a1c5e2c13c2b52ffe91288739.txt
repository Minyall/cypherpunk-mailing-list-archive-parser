I also heard that the FBI was investigating Blacknet, and had asked
questions of someone quite a bit more reliable than Mr. Detweiler.
Apparantly someone didn't `get the joke' when Detweiler spammed the
world, called the FBI, and the FBI didn't get it either.

(BTW, the recent flamage about encouraging digitally signed messages
to cypherpunks prodded me into doing something I had been meaning to
do for a while: when I go to send mail in emacs, it prompts me if I
want to sign or encrypt the outgoing message.  It's a 10 minute hack
for anyone who knows emacs lisp, but it's something good which has
come out of the flame war...)
