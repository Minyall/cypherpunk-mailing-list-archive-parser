The NES has been pretty much replaced by S-NES, the Super-Nintendo
Entertainment System. Check it out in any toy store.

Oh, you meant something different? This exemplifies what I believe it
was Eric Hughes who called it "acronym overloading," or "TLA overlaoding." I
have thus dubbed this "AOL," standing for both America OnLine _and_
Acronym OverLoading, thus defining itself by example.

Other cases of AOL:

LCD -- Least Common Divisor, Liquid Crystal Display

CIA -- Culinary Institute of America, Central Intelligence Agency

DOE -- Department of Energy, Distributed Objects Everywhere (Sun)

..and probably dozens more
