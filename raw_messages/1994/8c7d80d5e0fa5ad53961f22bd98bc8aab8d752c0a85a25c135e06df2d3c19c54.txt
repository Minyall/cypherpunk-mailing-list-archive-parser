Would somebody please e-mail me the addresses and proceedures that I need to
follow to unscubscribe this account and move to another account now and
finaly my own internet machine in about 3 weeks. I realize this has been put
out before but for some reason I never thought about saving them...(duh).

Thanks for the help.
