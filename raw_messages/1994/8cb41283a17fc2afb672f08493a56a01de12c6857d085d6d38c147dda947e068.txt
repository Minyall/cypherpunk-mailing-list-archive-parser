I don't care about Skipjack.  If they want to publish, I'd read the paper,
but I'm plenty content with triple-DES for routine stuff and DTDTD
(des|tran|...) for more sensitive stuff.  (ditto with IDEA variants)

By key length, triple-DES is far more secure than Skipjack -- and probably
faster.  I don't remember the Clipper data rate off hand, but I just timed
RSAREF triple-DES (CBC) on my 66 MHz 486 (running Mach) at 112 KBytes/sec.
(That's just short of 1 Mb/sec.)  That would do for telephone speeds :-).
