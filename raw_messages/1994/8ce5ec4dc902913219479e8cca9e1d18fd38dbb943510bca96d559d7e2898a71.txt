I agree.  Fission bombs I thought just needed shaped metal with a
conventional charge to force compression and make it go critical.

Fusion bombs I thought used tritium as fuel and needed a Plutonium
trigger or something.  They are supposedly set off with some kind of
inner mirrored ball with high powered lasers.  Fission then fusion I
believe.
