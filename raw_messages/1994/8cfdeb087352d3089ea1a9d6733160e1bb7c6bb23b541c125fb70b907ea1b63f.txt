Puh-leeze! There has been little to no evidence of ANY abuse of the 
Branch Davidian children. The only thing we know is that Koresh liked his 
mates young but that doesn't mean the rest of hte children were abused 
and, of course, Koresh's kink is quite normal in quite a few places. Are 
you forgetting that the BDs were investigated for child abuse and cleared 
earlier?
