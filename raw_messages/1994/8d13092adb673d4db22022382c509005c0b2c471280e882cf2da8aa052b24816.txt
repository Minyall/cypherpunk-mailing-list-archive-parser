Stopping attacks like this will not be easy:

* the attacker is using alt.test (as I recall) to report
results...this is precisely the "anonymous pool" we argue for, for
untraceability.

* if he's as smart as I suspect, he's also bouncing the messages to
penet through Cypherpunks-type remailers first. This makes it harder
(a little harder now, with our fragile remailers, *much* harder
someday) for Julf to "record the name of the site where all these
requests are originating."

The fragility of the Net exposes it to spamming attacks. And I think
Julf agrees that a rewrite of the code at his site is overdue....he's
mentioned this here, and is seeking donations.

(Personally, I think the "volunteer" aspect is at fault here: tens of
thousands of users use it for "free," while the software can't be
rewritten or maintained adequately. Why not a commercial service? And
the same arguments apply, as always, for the Cypherpunks model of
remailers.)
