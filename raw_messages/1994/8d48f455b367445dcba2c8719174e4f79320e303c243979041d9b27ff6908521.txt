Huh?  How do you count that?  There are dozens of algorithms described
in Schneier; most are described as either being of unknown strength
(due to insufficient cryptanalysis), or broken, or substantially
similar to a broken cipher.  Only a few are described as strong.

There's only one unconditionally secure cipher: the true one-time-pad.

And pigs can fly, and you have prime development land for sale in
south Florida..
