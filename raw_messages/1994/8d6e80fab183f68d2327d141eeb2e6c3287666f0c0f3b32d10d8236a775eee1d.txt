The obstacle there has been that this is for a person who refuses on
principle to affirm that he is a national person of any nation.  I think
that such a person could not obtain an RSA toolkit license.  Right?

The interest in the ViaCrypt option arose on the hope that their
national requirements (merely being ``in the US'') might be satisfied,
even if those for MIT's PGP 2.6 (affirmation that one is a US citizen or
national) could not be.
