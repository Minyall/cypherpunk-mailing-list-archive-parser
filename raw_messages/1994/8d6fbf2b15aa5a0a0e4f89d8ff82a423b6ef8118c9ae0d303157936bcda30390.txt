    "There is nothing wrong with your television set.  Do
    not attempt to adjust the picture.  We are controlling
    transmission.  If we wish to make it louder, we will
    bring up the volume.  If we wish to make it softer, we
    will tune it to a whisper.  We will control the hori-
    zontal.  We will control the vertical....  Sit quietly
    and we will control all that you see and hear.  You are
    about to participate in a great adventure; you are about
    to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the
    inner mind to the Al Gore Limits."
