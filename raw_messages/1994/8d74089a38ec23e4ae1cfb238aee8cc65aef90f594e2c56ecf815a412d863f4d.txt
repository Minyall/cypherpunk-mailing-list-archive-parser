A few days ago I asked:

There were no takers.  Therefore, I'll ask different questions:

Would a Chaum-style anonymous digital cash service be more profitable to a  
bank than a NON-anonymous digital cash service?

Are the costs involved in offering and supporting anonymous digital cash  
more, or less, than the costs associated with NON-anonymous digital cash?

In other words, why might a bank chose to offer/support anonymous digital  
cash over NON-anonymous digital cash?

If a "bank-centric" case for anonymous digital case over NON-anonymous  
digital cash can't be made, then there's little chance we'll see anonymous  
digital cash any time soon.
