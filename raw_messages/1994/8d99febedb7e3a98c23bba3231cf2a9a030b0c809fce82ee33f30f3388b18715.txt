Boy am I embarrassed....

(1) I apologize to the list for again posting unintentionally
(that's twice now) -- I'm still learning EMACS, and I forget
that it automagically CC's the list more often than my old
mail system used to (which was never).

(2) I share "Fred Heutte"'s <phred@well.sf.ca.us> sentiments,
in spades, about responding before noticing additional spew...

(3) There's still hope that I'll learn eventually...
