   Can't you hear "them" saying, "Well, those heathen pagan computer
   worshiping nerds are looking at pictures of women defiling themselves
   with carnal relations with animals.  Can't you just imagine what they
   do in private with their little computer thingeys."

   It, in a typical person's mind, is a trivial line between child porn
   and animal porn.  To be identified as part of a group of people that
   routinely pass pictures of women having sex with animals makes us 
   so much more easily identified as part of a group of people that 
   secretly pass kiddie porn... why else would we be so involved in
   encryption... just look what we send back and forth in public!

   Guilt by association is unfair, but very prevalent especially with
   the news media's influence.
