It's the difference between listening to the radio yourself and buying a
home-made tape of the radio program from someone else. The first is legal;
the second is, generally, not.

Better yet, it's the difference between watching a program on HBO when you
are getting that service legally (i.e. paying for it) and buying a tape of
the same program from a friend who has HBO. Whether or not you also have
legal access to HBO, the sale of the tape infringes on the copyright of the
program.
