    Why should I trust them at all?

I think that this is a very reasonable question.  Clearly, you
shouldn't.  If you let just anyone use it, your trust level is zilcho.

On a related note, should encrypting remailers have the keys changed
regularly?  The RSA-IDEA combination isn't very suspectible to known
plaintext attacks, right?
