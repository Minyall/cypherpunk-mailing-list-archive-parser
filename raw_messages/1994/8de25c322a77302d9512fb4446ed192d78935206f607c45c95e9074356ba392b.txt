Don't worry, someone is already working on it...  :)

You will probably see an online version of the "soon to finish printing and
finally ship so now we can have a life again" Illuminati: New World Order
game first.  Depending on how long it takes to get Wizards of the Coast
interested (they are tight with SJGames so it should not take long) an
online version of Magic may be on a web server by the end of the year.
