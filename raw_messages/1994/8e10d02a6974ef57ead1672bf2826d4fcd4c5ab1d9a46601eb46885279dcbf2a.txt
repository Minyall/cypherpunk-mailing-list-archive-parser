I find it interesting that your rebuke is based mostly on your own 
personal reluctance to use the courts.  Who exactly do you speak of to when 
you refer to "the rest of us."

You propose that I resort next time to what.... arbitration?

You seem to think it was merely the post that caused me to resort to the 
courts.  It was not.  Had it remained in Usenet I never would have cared 
much.

This is often the case with lawsuit and any human endeavor.  I'm sorry 
everyone isn't on equal ground in the world.  I personally prefer the 
ability to resort to a civil system of litigation than to have some 
highly institutionalized, standardized, process that could only be 
provided by big government.  At what price equality?

Cantor and Seigel?  Please.  Again, even if one asks to be rebuked, this 
is no excuse for defamation.

I never knew him to be truly ill.  The "please keep up with your 
medication" comments are common in Usenet and hardly indictive of any 
factual belief.  If indeed he is on medication it is news to me, and you 
are the individual who has compromised his privacy.

It would be an easy matter for me to expose his identity, his work, his 
finances, I have and will not.

Your wrong on the first count, right on the second, and as I said before, 
I never had a basis to make the judgement that you outline in the third.

No, it is a Shakesphere quote from Henry VI, (Part 2).  This oft 
misquoted tidbit is taken out of context to be a serious suggestion.  In 
fact the character who utters it is a Nilhilist intended to be laughed at 
for his impractical and poorly thought out theories.  Note that this 
quote comes right after a similar humor:

"I will make it a felony to drink small beer."

What does this have to do with my suit?

Where the free flow of information damages, it is an easy policy to 
insure ones self with flawless, no cost, total liability insurance.  It's 
called a secure anonymous remailer.

I concur, and I outlined said protocol.  I pointed to Julf.  In the 
absence of such protocol I will act to protect my interests by what 
means are available.

I don't find it was a waste of my time or my effort.
