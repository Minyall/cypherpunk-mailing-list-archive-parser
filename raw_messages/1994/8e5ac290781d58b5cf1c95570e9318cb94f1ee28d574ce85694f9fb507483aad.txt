You hire an anonymous reshiper... no different from an anonymous remailer
only you can't use an automated program (yet :) and its damn difficult to
avoid traffic analysis. Assuming that nobody has decided to follow the car
or put a locater in it, your anonymity is ultimatelly ensured by the fact
that the last reshiper in your chain doesn't know whether or not you are
also a reshipper or the new owner. I actually think that given the
impossibility of avoiding traffic analysis, the most sensible solution is
to find somebody that you absolutely trust to buy the car and give it to
you without adding additional stages.
