"Special Tasks," Sudaplatov.

(give or take...this is from memory)

This actually came out about 6 months ago, so it may be worth waiting
for the paperback. I skimmed the book in a bookstore, but saw various
pieces on this book and its implications on MacNeil-Lehrer and
Nightline.

Lots of revelations, but little confirmation.
