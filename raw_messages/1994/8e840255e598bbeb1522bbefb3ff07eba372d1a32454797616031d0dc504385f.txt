Seems to me, perhaps, that the introduction of 2.6 might be a precursor 
to RSA legally cracking down on anyone running pre-2.6 versions 
(accepting that 2.4, viacrypt, is ok).  

Scarey if you think about it, especially if the RSA folx are in bed with 
the fed, which doesn't seem that unrealistic considering the political 
climate.  That, coupled witht he fact that no one has yet verified the 
seciurity of 2.5/2.6 lead me to seriously question the security of this 
new version, since we are essentially being forced to use it if RSA 
starts suing everyone, or gets the fed to crack down because of patent 
infringement.

Sorry, just a rambling...
