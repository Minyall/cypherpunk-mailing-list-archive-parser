It looks like Micali struck it rich with Clipper and his key-escrow
patents. Want to get rich? Read up on digicash, then design a digicash
system with "escrowed identity", meaning you are untraceable until the
government uses an escrowed key to identify you. The bank acting on
its own cannot identify you, nor can the stores. Patent your system.
When the government and the banks try to introduce such a system,
threaten to sue them. They will pay you off just like they did Micali.
