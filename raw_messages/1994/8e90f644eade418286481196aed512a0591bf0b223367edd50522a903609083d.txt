Dear Master Knight,

Normally, I would be happy to oblige in using one's requested term of 
address, however I may make an exception in this case as you want fair 
play to be one sided. According to Master Knight, it is OK to start with 
ad hominem attacks, but not to answer them. Also, Master Knight has this 
devious habit of posting "private mail" on this list. Twice, now I have 
answered Master Knight's personal insults with a "private" reply so as to 
ease the burden on the other members of this  very active list, and twice 
Master Knight, shamelessly  posts follow-ups to the list. Not very 
honorable, Master Knight. So no, if I ever have the need to address you 
again it will be "Master" for you.
