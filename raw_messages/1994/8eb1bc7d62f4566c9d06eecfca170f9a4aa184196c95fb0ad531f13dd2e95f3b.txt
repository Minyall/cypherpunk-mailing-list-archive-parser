Critias_the_conspirator is of course another new pseudonym.

Critias was a disciple of Socrates.

Critias overthrew democracy in Athens and proceeded to
demonstrate that even when democracy was thoroughly
decadent, brutal, and tyrannical, it was still possible to
create an even worse form of government.

From time to time this Critias will comment on financial
privacy.
