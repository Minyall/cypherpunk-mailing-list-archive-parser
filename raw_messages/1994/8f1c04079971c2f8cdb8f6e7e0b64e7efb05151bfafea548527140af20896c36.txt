I'm too tired to make substantive comments, so for now I'll comment
only on the easily commented upon points.

One of the known limitations of virtual realities is that they provide
few of the feedback mechanisms that being in an office several hours a
day, interacting with bosses and subordinates, etc., provides.

The bandwidth for explaining ideas, clarifying misconceptions, and
brainstorming is dramatically lower than in real life.

You are mistaken if you think casual comments on this list will
replace the contact cited above. In any case, good luck.

In another post, you asked what the "MM" I mentioned in connection
with Digital Money was. MM is Magic Money, Pr0duct Cypher's
implementation of digital cash. A gifted programmer, and a prime
subject on this list. And yet MM is rarely used...maybe never used,
despite some announced plans.

You should study this in detail. And study crypto. As Eric said, "time
to read crypto."
