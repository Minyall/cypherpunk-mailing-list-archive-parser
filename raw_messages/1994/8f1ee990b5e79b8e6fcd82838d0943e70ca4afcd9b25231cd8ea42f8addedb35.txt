I believe you'll find that substance in the OED under: "GACK, n., 1.)
putrid excrescence used as a visual emetic for prepubescent american
television viewers. 2.) a rational human's response to american republican
platform planks regarding abortion since 1980, 3.) the sound made when
civil libertarians contemplate any cryptographic scheme using government
access to keys (see GAK)"

Cheers,
