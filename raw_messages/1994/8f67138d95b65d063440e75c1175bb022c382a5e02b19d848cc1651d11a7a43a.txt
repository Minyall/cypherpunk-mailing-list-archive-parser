I should point out that Pitney Bowes has a patent on using digital signatures
and RSA to "sign" a postal meter application. The patent begins by noting
that postal meters are literally machines that print money. It goes on
to show how to control this with digital signatures. There is some kind
of bar code applied to the stamp. My impression is that getting the info
density on the envelope is a bit of a problem with the invention. But I'm
not sure.
