As an addendum to the bibliography that Tim Cole posted, there are
three good papers in the July 1993 edition of _Physical Review A_
(vol. 48 no. 1): "Information-theoretic limits to quantum
cryptography" by Stephen M. Barnett and Simon J.D. Phoenix, "Quantum
cryptography without conjugate coding" by Simon J.D. Phoenix, and
"Quantum computers and intractable (NP-complete) computing problems"
by Vladimir Cerny.
