C'punks,

No, I didn't forget about Acapulco H.E.A.T.  This week's episode
was, "Code Name: Stranded."  In this installment some of the Team
boat off to an "uninhabited" Mexican island for a picnic and R&R.
Of course, they forget to anchor the boat so they get stranded.
To make matters worse, their is a loony Viet Nam vet (is there
any other kind?) on the island who still things he's in 'Nam.

Well, it goes pretty much as you would expect:  gunfire, snake
attack, poisonous spider attack, exploding hut and bikinis.
There is *only* one crypto tie-in (and it's a stretch).  They
communicated an SOS to the remaining Team members by juryrigging
an old field radio without a microphone, so that they could send
Morse code.  No Fabio, plenty of exposed Alison Armitage.

C'punks, I'm sure these last two items are where the motion
picture business privacy, "regulatory arbitrage" and tax
avoidance angles come in.
