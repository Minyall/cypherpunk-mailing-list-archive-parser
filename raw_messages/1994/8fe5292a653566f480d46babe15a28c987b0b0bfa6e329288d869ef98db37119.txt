	Let me make a point here: I run an Amiga, and Amiga games do go 
to town on copy protection. They generally rip the OS out of memory, and 
install a custom one, do custom formats of the disk (as in the structure 
is normally unreadable) and have further hard protection such as laser 
holes, etc.
	This is not kids' stuff - this is serious, and these people are 
carcking it within hours. Let them loose on any program with their own 
hardware, and they are capable of doing some quite serious things to the 
rights of the author.
