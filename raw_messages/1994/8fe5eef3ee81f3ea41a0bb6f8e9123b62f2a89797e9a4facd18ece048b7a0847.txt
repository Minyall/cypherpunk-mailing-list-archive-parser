Well, if having your key on a keyserver encourages people to send you 
messages you can't decrypt instead of looking for other keyservers
which have more useful keys for you, it's a waste of your time
and your correspondents' to have that key out there.
It's also, of course, a way to complain to people who run incompatible
keyservers :-)
