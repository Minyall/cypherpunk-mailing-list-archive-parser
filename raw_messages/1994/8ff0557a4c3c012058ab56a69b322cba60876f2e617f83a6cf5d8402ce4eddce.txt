     Hello fellow C'punks! As my last message said (for those who read
it), I'm just getting into anon remailers. I just picked up the docs and
PGP key for the remailer@soda. I would appreciate it if people would send
me fingerprints of the key. This is so that I know it hasn't been tampered
with, or at least can be reasonably sure. Thanx, in advance!
