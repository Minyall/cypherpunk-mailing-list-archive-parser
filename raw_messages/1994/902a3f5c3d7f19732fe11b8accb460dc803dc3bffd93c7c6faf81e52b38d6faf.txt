Cryptocosmology: sufficently advanced communication
                 is indistinguishable from noise.

 I really like this! Its kind of a corollary to Clarks (Arthur C
that is) third law "Any sufficently advanced technology is
indistinguishable from magic."
  
 I guess this means that if there are other civilizations out
there, and they have Cypherpunks, and they are just a little more
advanced, then the people at S.E.T.I. are wasting there time (and
to beat Tim to it "our Bucks!")
