This last step (therefore p+1 is a prime) is not totally 
correct. You forgot the posibility p+1 NOT prime, but some prime 
number <p+1 but >pn divides p+1. This number is prime and >pn.
So in any case there would exist a prime >pn, which contradicts the
hypothesis, and the conclusion is indeed:

> Therefore there is no largest prime 
number.
