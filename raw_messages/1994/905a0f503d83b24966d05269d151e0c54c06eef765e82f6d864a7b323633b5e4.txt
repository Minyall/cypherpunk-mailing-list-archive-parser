Thanks for your perspective. I have imagined that if I found it necessary
to live in such a place that I might favor choosing a building with some
sort of covenant, explicitly agreed to by all tenants, that allowed
searches for weapons. I take it that you would not find that to be a good
idea. Do you have other ideas along such lines?

I'm in the process of looking further, but the legality of this covenant
is questionable.
