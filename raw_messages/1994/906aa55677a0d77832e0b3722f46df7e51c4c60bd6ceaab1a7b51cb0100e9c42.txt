I know I could just read the source to find this, but...

Is the version number on a PGP public key inside the security
wrapper or not?  If not, it should be possible to write a program
that would take a 2.3a key and spit out an identical 2.5 key.
The keyserver database could be updated in this manner, and
everybody would be happy.
