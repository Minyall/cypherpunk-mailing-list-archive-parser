"Cauzin Softstrips" was the product, as I recall. I wouldn't use the
word "quite" in "It never quite caught on," except in irony, as I'm
pretty sure essentially _no_ such machines were sold. Maybe a few, but
not many more.

We had this discusssion a while back, when Phil Karn was trying for an
export license for Bruce's software. 

OCR recognition rates are already close to 100% for monospaced fonts
like Courier (at least many of us see this...I have TypeReader and it
does very well with such fonts), and could be made even higher.

In my view, the whole export issue is a joke anyway. Anyone with
access to Bruce's code could quite easily remail it, with or without
first hiding the exact form by compressing, encrypting, or stegging
it.

That this hasn't happened--so far as we (or I) know--says more about
other things than about the laws supposedly barring such export.

I'm not saying it wouldn't be an interesting test case, though. Hard
to imagine it happening. I expect the test case could come just as
easily be printing up the code in Courier, or OCR2, and prominently
putting "Insert this end into OCR machine" or somesuch....and then
calling attention to this as one crosses the borders. (I'd guess the
outgoing Customs inspection would be nonexistent, as usual, and that
such an attempt to trigger a test case would be fruitless.)
