  Agreed.

  Yes, that is a problem.

  Actually, the Mobile IP working group of the IETF is busy defining a 
  system of proxy agents which will accept packets for mobile machines
  and then forward them on to the proper destination.  Something like
  this would be useful for anonymous remailers.  

  Imagine a scheme whereby a "core" of these agents were available on well
  known ports of established machines.  When you start up your remailer,
  it registers with the core agents and does it delivery.  It can then 
  move to another machine.  A lack of a "keepalive" packet every n seconds
  would indicate that the remailer had gone down and it would be purged from
  the records.
