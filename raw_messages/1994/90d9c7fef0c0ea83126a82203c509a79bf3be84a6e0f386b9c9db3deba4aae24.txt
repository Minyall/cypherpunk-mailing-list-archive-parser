The 1st ammendment guarantees freedom of speech.  This includes the right
to speak in any "language" you want.   Cryptography is a way of changing
the "language" of a text or binary file so that only the intended recipient
is able to understand it.  Hence, cyphertext is protected by the 1st ammendment.
