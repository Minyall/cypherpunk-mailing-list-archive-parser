     Actually, United States law has something "Conspiracy". That's where
you talk about committing a crime. There are certain limitations to it,
but essentially, idly chatting about killing someone might be construed as
a Conspiracy to do it. Therefore, yes, you _can_ go to jail for _talking_
about murder.
