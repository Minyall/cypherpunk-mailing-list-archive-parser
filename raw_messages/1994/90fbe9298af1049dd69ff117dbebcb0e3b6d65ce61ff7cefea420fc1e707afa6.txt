Do the station staff ever use them ?

Here in Melbourne, all the underground railway stations have cameras
pointing at escalators, up and down the platforms, etc, but if you're
doing something silly like riding around on a chair that the ticket
guys usually sit upon, you can expect an announcement :)  There is also
a window that looks into a `monitor' room from a public walkway at one.

Oh, and one of the cameras looking up a platform has gum fixed to part
of the cover in front of the lens :)
