    does anybody want a 26Mb .au file (uncompressed)?
    
    WHAT'S the copyright laws on this stuff anyway?
    
I'd also be interested in hearing on the legal issues surrounding
this.  Also, is anyone aware of any laws which I might be violating if
I were to convert a message from my voice mail box to a raw
Sun audio file?  How about if I send email the file to someone?
