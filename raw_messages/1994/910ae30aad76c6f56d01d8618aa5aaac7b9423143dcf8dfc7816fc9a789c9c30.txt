The fellow involved was indeed from the the NSA, but he was by no
means representing it.  I understand from him that he did a bit of
bureaucratic hacking just to attend.  

He also kindly offered to post from dockmaster that he had seen me and
some other tentacles in the same place and at the same time at a
privacy conference, but alas, there were no tentacles to be found.
