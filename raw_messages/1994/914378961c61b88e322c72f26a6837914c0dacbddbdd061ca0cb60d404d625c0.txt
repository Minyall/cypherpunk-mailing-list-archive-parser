I've already done that, it's included in the s-tools v2 package as a 
module to conceal information in .WAV files.

The effect on quality when using the LSB of an 8 bit 11Khz mono sample is 
not noticeable unless the original sound is highly pure (e.g. downloaded 
from a synth). Even then it only shows up as _very_ faint interference 
that needs a good hi-fi to hear and the original sample for comparison.
