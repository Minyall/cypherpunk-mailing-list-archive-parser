	More specifically:

soda.berkeley.edu is moving to a new building because the UC
Berkeley's CS deparment is moving to a new building. When back up it
will be called soda.csua.berkeley.edu and soda.berkeley.edu will work
for only about six months. The ftp site is going to move to another
computer owned by the csua so ftp references should be to
ftp.csua.berkeley.edu so that when the ftp site moves it will be
relatively seamless.
(ftp.csua.berkeley.edu points to soda.berkeley.edu right now)
