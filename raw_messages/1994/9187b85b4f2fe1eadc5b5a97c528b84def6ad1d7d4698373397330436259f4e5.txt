Even *better*, use "majordomo" for subscribes, unsubscribes, help,
etc. The Cypherpunks list is now handled by majordomo, so this is the
best way to handle subscribes and unsubscribes.

Send mail to "majordomo@toad.com" with a keyword in the message body.
Some examples:

help        to get a list of commands

unsubscribe cypherpunks          to get off the list with the address used
                                 to send the message

and my personal favorite:

who         to get a listing of all 700 names subscribed to the List
