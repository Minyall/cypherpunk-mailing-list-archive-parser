All the New England States including Taxachussets have State Liquor Stores.
NH has the cheapest booze of the lot and even entreprenurially advertizes to
encourage the residents of other states to save money at their stores.  

Actually lots of states had no sales and income taxes when I was born and
yet life somehow went on.  People may have even been happier (or more
satisfied).
