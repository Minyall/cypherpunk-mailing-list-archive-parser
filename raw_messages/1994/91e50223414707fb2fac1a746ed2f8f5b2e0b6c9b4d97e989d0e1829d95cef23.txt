I think that NSA, FBI & CIA hope that Clipper will become a de facto
standard resulting from its being required for certain kinds of
interactions with government agencies. If this were to happen non-clipper
products would have a more difficult time attaining a critical mass. The
real purpose of Clipper can thus be stated as an attempt to prevent the
success of some de facto standard that the government could not tap. I
recall hearing someone from NSA say something very much like this.
