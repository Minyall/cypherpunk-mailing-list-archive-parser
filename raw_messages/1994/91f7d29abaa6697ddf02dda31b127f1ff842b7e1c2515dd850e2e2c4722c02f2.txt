	Actually, I was batting around the idea earlier of reading the
code onto audio tape.  Clear that, then clear a written transcript of
the tape, then try to clear an electronic copy of the transcript.

	The audio tape would clearly not be 'easily compilable' which
is the pseudo logic they provide for allowing the paper & not the
disks.  The written transcript is probably no different from the book.
The interesting change, I think, comes from calling your listings a
transcript of the spoken word.
