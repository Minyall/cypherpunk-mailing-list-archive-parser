I don't know if they're still held, but for a history of the contest
from 1984-1991, see Libes, Don.  _Obfuscated C and Other Mysteries_.
New York: Wiley, 1993.  Many of the programs use Rot-13 encryption.
The book describes some generally applicable principles of obfuscation.

A "Twelve Days of Christmas" program was the winner of the 1988 "Least
Likely to Compile Successfully" award.
