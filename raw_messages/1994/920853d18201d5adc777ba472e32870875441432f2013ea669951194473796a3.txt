Hi all,

I would like somebody to explain how I would  go about using an anonymous
digicash system to buy a automobile?                       
 
Just for arguments sake lets say I want to buy a new  Ford Mustang GT from
the local dealer and desire that nobody at the dealer has any idea who I
am or where I come from.
