This is unwise and unnecessary.

It is unwise because we do not wish to alert the government
to the fact that the net is largely ungoverned and ungovernable.

It is unnecessary because crypto is already covered by various 
existing declarations on rights.



THE BILL OF RIGHTS


Amendment I

Congress shall make no law [...]
abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the 
right of the people peaceably to assemble,[...]

Amendment II

[...] the right of the people to keep and bear 
arms, shall not be infringed.

Amendment IV

The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, 
papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, 
shall not be violated,[...]
