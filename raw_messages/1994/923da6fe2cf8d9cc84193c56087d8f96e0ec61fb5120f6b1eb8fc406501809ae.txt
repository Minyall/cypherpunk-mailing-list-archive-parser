This really reminds me that I'd like to start gathering short discourses on
various subjects to make a WWW educational library/courses.

It has everything you'd need and there are lots of things even I'd 
like to write about.  I'm really thinking of a contrib learning
library.

Does anyone know if someone has started this yet?

If not, I'll organize a structure, contrib guidelines, WWW
server that allows contrib, voting (on best ways to learn
something), etc. and try to think up a domain that isn't
taken.  I'll by necessity have to set it up and let
it run since I'm already overloaded with work and family.

My feeling is that there is lots of stuff out there already
and that it needs to be organized.  Not overly so as
traditional schooling is, but in a way that allows
organic learning and search for what you may need to learn.

I'll start it on my web server and see about mirroring on
my friends systems (who have faster connections).

And now, the reason I decided to dump this here, I'd like
to ask permission to include discourses like the one just
given.

<wishing I would have brought this up somewhere else...>
