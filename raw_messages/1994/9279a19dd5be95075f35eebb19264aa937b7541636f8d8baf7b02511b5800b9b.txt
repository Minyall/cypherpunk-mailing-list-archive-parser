I wouldn't worry about Wayne: other than an annoying propensity to toss
around TLAs in such a way as to make it fairly clear that he doesn't really
know what he's talking about, and a strong case of inappropriate paranoia,
I suspect he's generally harmless.

Annoying, tedious and occasionally laughable; but generally harmless.
