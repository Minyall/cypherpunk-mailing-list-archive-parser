Hmmm... In this scenario, wouldn't Safeway wind up eating the bad checks?
I realize that it would be a royal pain in the ass for the victim (the 
checkbook owner) to sort out the mess, but it would seem to me that the
victim could prove that he/she didn't sign the checks, leaving Safeway in
the position of having exchanged groceries for worthless paper. This same
problem exists with credit cards to some degree, due to the lax verification
processes in place ay many businesses, and there is some law that limits
your liability in the event of card theft.

Buying groceries may not immediately appear to be cypherpunks-related, but
this thread does bring up a point about 'identity theft' and verification;
I'd be interested to hear from the legal gurus on the Safeway/stolen checkbook
idea.
