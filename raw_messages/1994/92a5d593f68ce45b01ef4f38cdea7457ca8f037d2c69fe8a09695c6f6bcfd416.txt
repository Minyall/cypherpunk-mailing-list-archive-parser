  Perry sez:
  UUNET, among others, considers itself to be a common carrier.

My understanding is that, legally speaking, "considering [oneself]
to be a common carrier" amounts to exactly nil -- that it requires
a special act of some governing body to declare you to be a common
carrier.   One might just as well consider oneself to be an
accredited diplomat and therefore to have diplomatic immunity.

Any of the real lawyers on the net care to comment?
