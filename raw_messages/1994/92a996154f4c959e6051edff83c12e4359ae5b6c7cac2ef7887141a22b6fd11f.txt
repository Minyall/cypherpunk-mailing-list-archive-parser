Where can I get a copy of this, or just the patches to patch RSAREF?  Or
even D-H itself would be nice - I'd like to hack together an encrypted
telnet/rlogin suite for use when I'm on the road, so I can get into my
system at the house from the laptop and not have to worry about someone
snarfing my login/password combo...

I've got RSAREF, BTW ... haven't looked at it much, though...
