What has happened to the list??
My C'punks incoming mail atopped yesterday (5/8/94).  I sent a "Who
cypherpunks" command and my name is no longer there.  There was only about
six names that were returned.

I've been lurking for a little over a month now and really enjoy the
discussion.

Where did everyone go???
