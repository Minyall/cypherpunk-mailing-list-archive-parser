I don't see the need for determinism; it depends on the underlying 
computational model.

The "essence" of nondeterminism may not be algorithmic, but I don't
see why that's important.  If nondeterminism can be sufficiently
characterized that I can express an algorithmic process involving
it (and of course we can; that's how NP problems are expressed) then
my boat floats.
