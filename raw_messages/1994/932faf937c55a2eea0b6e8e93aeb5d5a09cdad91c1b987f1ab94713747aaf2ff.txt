Actually I didn't have a written reference, so I really _did_ forget the first
line. Though I think the quote is a appropriate for all of us, particularly in
this forum, I'll probably excise it from my .sig. I find other people's 20 line sigs
irritating, so...

PS. Why do you remail through extropia when you advertise your penet ID? Isn't
the advantage of chaining that only the final remailer is known?
