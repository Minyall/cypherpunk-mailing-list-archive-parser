It's started.  The >CIA< (nevermind that we suspect the NSA has done this
already) admitedly is starting an internet site(s) where they will monitor
email and usenet feeds.  Supposedly this is for "reasearch" purposes where
agents would "post" questions in such a way as to not give away their real
questions.

See this week's Computerworld.  Anyone have a scanner they can post this
article up with?  I'm not up to typing it...
