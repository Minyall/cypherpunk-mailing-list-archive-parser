I don't think much is accomplished by arguing which set of liars got us
into any particular mess.  However, it was the *democrats* who dominated
the legislative and judicial branchs of government, as well as the
entrenched bureaucracy for the Ragan/Bush years.  I think that is a more
accurate version of "giving credit where credit is due."  Nevertheless,
please be advised, I dispise them all (and so should you).

Now get cracking and write some code.
