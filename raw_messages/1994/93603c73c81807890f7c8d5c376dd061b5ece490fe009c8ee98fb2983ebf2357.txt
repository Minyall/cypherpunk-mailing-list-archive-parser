FYI: I saw a Power PC yesterday, and asked about running standard Mac Apps,
and was told it would do it, but not get the Power PC speedups...

I am 99.9% certain that MacPGP will run on a PowerMac, in emulation mode.
Some time soon someone will get around to recompiling for native mode.

For the original poster: PowerMac is supposed to run all Macintosh OS based
programs, right out of the box. No porting of the programs is required.
They run slower than native apps, but they run as fast as they would on
most Macs now.
