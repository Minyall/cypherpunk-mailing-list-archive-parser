It doesn't seem to me that this _can_ be readily calculated in any
reasonable amount of time.  It's not a simple (realtively) combinatorial
problem: the configuration of the board at any given point limits the legal
moves in an extremely nontrivial way.

I believe I can get you as far as the second move, though: I make it to be
twenty-one possible openings and twenty-one responses.
