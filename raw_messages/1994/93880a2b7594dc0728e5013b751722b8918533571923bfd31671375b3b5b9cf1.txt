How can they crack down on key-servers running only the keymanagement
code?  I don't think they can, but if they're in cahoots with the 
FED's then they can do what they want because they have guns.

I'm willing to wager that this 2.6 and maybe 2.5 versions are 
hacked by the NSA to put in their spiffy key-escrowed backdoor.

Anyone think 2.6 *doesn't* have a backdoor added?
