No. I meant Frankfurt. But you are partly right, as I wanted a 
non-existent place, and as I thought about weird places I had
visisited, Stuttgart, AR came to mind. But it had to be a fictionary
place, so I changed it to Frankfurt. Of course, there probably *is*
a Frankfurt somewhere in Arkansas ;-)

Ahh. So it is! Thanks!

And for those who are thinking "what the hell does this have to do
with cypherpunks?" - There you see! Steganography *does* work!
Look, ma! No dinosaurs!
