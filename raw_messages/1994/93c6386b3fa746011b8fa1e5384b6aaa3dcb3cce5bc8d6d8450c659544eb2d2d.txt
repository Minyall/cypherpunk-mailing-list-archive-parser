Wrong on both counts.  Getting it out legally would be nice--it's a great
*fallback* position--but that's not the object of the game.  The idea is
to get it out and make it widely available.  Period. 

The Constitution and other laws are not magic talismans.  It is fantasy 
thinking that technical compliance with the government's laws renders 
them "completely powerless."  A Smith & Wesson beats four-of-a-kind.
