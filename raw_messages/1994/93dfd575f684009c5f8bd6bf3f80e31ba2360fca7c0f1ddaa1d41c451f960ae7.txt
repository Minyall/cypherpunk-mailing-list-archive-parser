   -at least this wired staffer was somewhat amused with the prospect
   (rather than annoyed, as i had expected). 

I ran into one of the Hotwired guys at a couple of weeks ago.  Not
only didn't he mind particularly, he thought it most appropriate that
the general purpose pseudonym account was called 'cypherpunk'.

   -the account is well used.

In fact, the 'cypherpunk' is by far and away the No. 1 user of
Hotwired.  Maybe 'cypherpunks' will become number No. 2.
