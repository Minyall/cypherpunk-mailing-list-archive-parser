Uh, I think they can, and do, jail for discussing a crime.  It's called
conspiracy, and the crime does *not have to have been committed for
conspirators to be jailed.  It happened here in L.A. recently.  Some
skinheads were jailed for conspiracy to bomb an synagogue, however the
synagogue had not actually been bombed.  They went to prison.
