I've said in a previous post and others like it:

I want to apologize to the fine folk on this list that are not Americans
for my self-centered phrasing.  In everyday life you generally don't
think of other countries and as such I've probably offended someone.

I in no way meant to imply that everyone is American, that we are the
most important, or that our political system is the best.

If I offended anyone I apologize and will try to be more cautious with
my wording in the future.
