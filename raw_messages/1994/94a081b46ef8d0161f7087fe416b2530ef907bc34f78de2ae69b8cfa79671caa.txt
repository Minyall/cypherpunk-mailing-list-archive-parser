Hi all!

I _pay_ to read what's on this list. I was hoping that it would concern
cryptography, remailers, etc. Detweiler was gone for a time. Now
apparently it's the current fashion to flame him since he's returned. I'm
not gonna pay to read rants against him. Do _something_ or talk in
private. Does any of this shit belong on the list? And should I have to
pay for it?

I _know_ there are good minds out there, but why do I get all of these
flames? Not quite what I was expecting. If you wanna talk crypto, post
here. If you wanna beat Detweiler into the ground, please do it in private
email! I _really_ don't care to hear attacks on another person. (Like
that's why I subscribe? NOT!)

Bruce
