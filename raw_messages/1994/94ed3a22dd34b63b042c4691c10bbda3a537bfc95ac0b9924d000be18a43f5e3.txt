- From the frying pan into the fire?  Why assume another?  Why not drop
your U.S. citizenship and be done with it?

Can't be done you say? (*)  Then this is a significant difference between
terminating employment and terminating citizenship.  Employees regularly
terminate and go it alone forever after.

(*) You may be right.  Their statute may not provide for citizenship
termination unless you first go to a place over which they don't claim
jurisdiction.  Good reason to never affirm that citizenship in the first
place.
