I'm not sure what the time-delay features for the "nowhere" anonymous remailer ler
are, but the messages that arrived last night all came through within a few
minutes.  Interestingly, the messages were sent at around 3:00 am, corsimilar to
LD's posting patterns from before.

I deleted the most recent postings, but if someone could send them to me, I'd
like to run them through a grammar checker and compare the results to the 
message base I developed before.
