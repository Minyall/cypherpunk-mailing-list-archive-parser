You don't even need encryption.

1) Initialize the garage unit and hand unit with a secret initialization  
vector for a crypto-hash function.

2) Push hand unit button to send "open" signal in clear.

3) Garage unit send a large random number in the clear.  While waiting for  
reply, garage unit calculates hash of the random number it just sent.

4) Hand unit hashes random number and sends result to garage unit.

5) Garage unit opens door if the received hash matches the local hash.

6) And best of all...YOU CAN EXPORT IT!
