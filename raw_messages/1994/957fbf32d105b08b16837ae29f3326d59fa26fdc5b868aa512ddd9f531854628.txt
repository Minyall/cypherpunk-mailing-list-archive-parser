I would like someone with enough technical background to design
and build a prototype IDEA/DES/RSA device suitable for voice
encryption using modular phone jacks and plugs.

The prototype and what is learned in the process of designing and
manfacturing it, will be used to conduct a feasibility study on
the manufacture and marketing of such devices.
