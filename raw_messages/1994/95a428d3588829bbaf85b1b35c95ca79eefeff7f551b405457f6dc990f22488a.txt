Ahhhhmmm.

This is me, I am switching to a private account, and will be changeing my 
subscription to this list soon to be under this, and did this as a small 
joke.  So unless I look like a detweiler clone, you might be mistaken.
I thought it was funny.(the groups were talk.politcs.guns, 
alt.politics.libertarian, etc, and I put in all the worst statist, 
non-freedom loving stuff I have ever seen)

Now isn't this detweiler a parinoid who finds "tenticles" everywhere?  Is 
that like testicle?  Is Graham Detweiler?  Is detweiler like that guy in 
1984 we all have the hate ins about?

All these tough questions, tell me a joke:-)
