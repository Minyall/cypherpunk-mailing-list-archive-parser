     Wild conspiracy theories aside for the moment, I back MIT on this
one. People are only beginning to get clued in as to what version the
current version is. Releasing a new version at this point, IMHO, would be
a MAJOR headache. If you've ever worked for a software company, and tried
to deal with the maintenance-version-of-the-day, you'll understand where
I'm coming from.

     OTOH, guys [Hey you! MIT!], if it's an easy bug to fix, at least post
a SOURCE PATCH.
