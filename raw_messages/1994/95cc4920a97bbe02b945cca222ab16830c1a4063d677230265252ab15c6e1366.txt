Sorry to bother the list with this thread, but I need just one more
question answered, and I don't know where else to ask.

I work on a heterogeneous system.  My personal workstation is a decstation,
running Ultrix-4.3, but I'm pretty sure that email enters our local domain
via a sparcstation running SunOS-4.1.3.  My email ends up in
/var/spool/mail/werner, which is one of the sparcstation disk partitions.

If I use the above-mentioned .forward magic to start procmail, does it
execute on my local decstation, or on the sparcstation.  In other words,
do I build a decstation or sparcstation executable?

Is there some way I can test this without the mail daemon getting into some
kind of infernal .forward loop if there is an error?

thanks a lot,
tw
