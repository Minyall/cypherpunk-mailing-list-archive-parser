Page 44 of "Applied Cryptography" discusses a point to point *public*  
key exchange protocol called the "Interlock Protocol" (invented by  
Ron Rivest and Adi Shamir).  This protocol is an attempt to foil the  
man-in-the-middle attack.  The protocol does not provide a %100  
guarantee against man-in-middle, but it does make it much harder (or  
so says the book).

Perhaps Robert's device really uses a variation of the Interlock  
Protocol, and not Diffie-Hellman (mentioned only as a red herring?).
