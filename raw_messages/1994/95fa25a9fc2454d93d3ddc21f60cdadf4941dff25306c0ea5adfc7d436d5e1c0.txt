Actually this "dump flamewar" has produced some good discussion regarding
actual implementation issues.  Everything that has happened with MIME will
happen again when people try to add cryptography to the structure of the

ObCrypto:  Does anyone know if a ref implementation of the Eastlake and
Kaufman DNS extensions exists?  Before I dig into BIND I am hoping that
there might be code out there already....
