How is this a "comment" on financial privacy?

I could just as well say "Put your money in your matress." and probably 
have the same level of education effect.

Financial structuring is a highly complex process that earns many people 
hundreds of dollars (or francs) an hour because there are no blanket 
rules.  I suggest Critias_the_conspitator keep his day job.  It will be 
easier on him, and us.
