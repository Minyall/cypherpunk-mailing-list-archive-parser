How about a different tack, having all branch instructions feed in some 
number from the program, generated from the state of the program, to a 
lookup hard-key.  The program then branches to the appropriate site.

If the number of branches/states of program  was great enough, this might be 
secure(of cource, they can just watch it and recode, but they could 
probably re-write the code for this ammount.)

Roger.
