Clancy mentioned a scenario that corporations (and others) might be able to
take advantage of - the so-called "Canary Trap".  Instead of identical copies
of a sensitive memo being made, slightly different copies are prepared
instead.  The meaning isn't changed, but the precise wording is, so that if
someone quites verbatim, the precise wording will indicate which document
was leaked, and hence the leaker.  I know for a fact that the United States
and Canada use this for their classified material, at least some of it.

This is not entirely true, as the courts have ruled that certain contractual
agreements, even when made between consensual parties, may be null and
void, because they go against public policy.  Consider if I contract with
you to kill someone, and at the conclusion of the contract I will pay you
a certain amount of money.  So, you wax the guy, and come to me with his ear
or left testicle or whatever, demanding payment.  I give you the finger, and
instead of putting a .22 hollowpoint between my eyes, you take me to court.
The courts would rule that the contract had no force of law, because it
essentially was a contrat to do something that was against public policy.
Same with illegal "contracts" some companies coerce people into signing as
a condition of employment.  The companies can argue that the employees signed
them of their own free will, but the courts would hold that if the act was
illegal, there can be no binding contract.
