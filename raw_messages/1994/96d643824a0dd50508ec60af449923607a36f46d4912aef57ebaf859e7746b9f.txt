Before you get too enthusiastic remember that electronic cash is not 
legal tender which means that you will require some clearing system 
behind this scheme providing conversion between a legal tender and 
electronic cash before this is getting really useful.  Without such a 
system electronic cash is just prepaid "tokens" with the usability 
similar to the "tokens" on telephone cards.

For those that thinks this will be "the end of the gouvernment":  Who 
do you think will be in control of this clearing system?  Just asking ;-)

However I do think that this DigiCash stuff is a Good Thing -- certainly 
better than mailing credit card numbers over the net :-)
