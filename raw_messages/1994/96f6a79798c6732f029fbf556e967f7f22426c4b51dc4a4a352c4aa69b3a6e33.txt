How about generating a secure hash and using that as an index into a 
table?  If there's an address already there, use that - otherwise, 
generate one.

Generate the hash from the incoming address, of course.  That way, you 
don't need to keep track of anon-id-to-real-id mappings, yet guarantee 
that each user has one and only one anon address. Of course, folks coming 
in from different hosts will have different anon ID's.

Or have I missed some blindingly obvious technical point thaqt would make 
this impossible?
