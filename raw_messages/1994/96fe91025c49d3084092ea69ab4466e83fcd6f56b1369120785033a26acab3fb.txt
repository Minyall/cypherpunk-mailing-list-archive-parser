Sternlight claims people are violating copyright laws by posting his
private email.

I will point out that although this may be true, he would have to show
damages to him in order to collect anything. From what I know, his
financial position is not such that he can afford to pay lawyers for
frivolous lawsuits. I suspect he can't do a thing. Feel free to tell
him so.
