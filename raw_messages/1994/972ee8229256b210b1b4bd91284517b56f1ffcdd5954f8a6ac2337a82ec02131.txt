I've got premail v0.30 installed here as /usr/lib/sendmail. I added
the $config{"sendmail"}="real_sendmail" option, but this means that
~/.premailrc is not used. But that users can't specify their own
options... Specifically, it looks as if doing it this way I can't
automatically PGP sign my mail without adding it to the global script,
but that would mean _all_ mail out of this site would be signed with
my id. Any suggestions how to go about this? It makes it so convenient
to have it replace sendmail, but I'd like to sign my mail as well.
