Today's WSJ has an article by a Cato type about an Indiana businessman who
told state labor investigators to get stuffed.  In the course of this
article, the author quoted a 1948 opion (in dissent?) by Justice Jackson:

The government could simplify criminal law enforcement by requiring every
citizen "to keep a diary that would show where he was at all times, with
whom he was, and what he was up to."

Now we know where they got the idea for various "escrow" and DTI schemes.

Who also fondly remembers Justice Jackson's strong dissent in Korematsu vs.
US against those great civil libertarians Black and Douglas who voted to
uphold that great liberal FDR's imprisonment of persons of Japanese ancestry.
