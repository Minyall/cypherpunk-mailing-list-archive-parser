	 I'm looking for the paper of last year that suggested how
	 insecure 56 bit DES is against NSA-scale computers.
	 Citation?  Or if it's on line, so much the better.

More precisely, it's special-purpose hardware, not NSA-scale computers.
See ftp.eff.org:/pub/EFF/Policy/Crypto/Misc/Technical/des_break.ps.gz.
There are other papers in that directory that you may find of interest.
