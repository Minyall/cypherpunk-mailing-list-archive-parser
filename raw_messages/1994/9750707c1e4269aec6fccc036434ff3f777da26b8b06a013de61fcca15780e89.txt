I've had extensive experience with hardware vendors, and the behavior 
you describe is extreremely anomalous.  It is just barely possible that
your rep has quit, and his replacement hasn't picked up the slack yet.

On just the basic problem of getting the data sheets, you might have better
luck calling AT&T's literature department directly.  This works very well if
you have the part number of the data sheet, but just the part's id should get
you the info.  If the part is more than a few months past announcement, it's
data sheet has probably been bound up with a whole lot of other data sheets and
printed in some family book, which might be easier to ask for, and give you
some alternates to consider.

Or, you could ask some smiley friend ;+> to try to get the information
for you.

Buying the part shouldn't be as hard, they are required to sell to you.  
However, if you are experiencing politics, beware of such things as deliverly
delays and a high percentage of bad parts in your shipment.  Going through
a distributor is probably enough to avoid most of these problems.  

So, when can I buy your gadget?
