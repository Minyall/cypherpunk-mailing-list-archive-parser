I second the motion for Loompanics and Paladin Press.  Two books
that might be directly related, both from Paladin Press and both
by Lawrence W. Myers are "SPYCOMM: Covert Communication Techniques
of the Underground" and "Improvised Radio Jamming Techniques: Electronic
Guerrilla Warfare." Both are full of practical, "nuts and bolts"
discussions of the issues you're pursuing.
