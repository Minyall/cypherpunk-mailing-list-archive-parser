Actually electricity too cheap to meter was an idiotic comment made
about nuclear power in the 1950s. However, I'll point out that its
been some years since I noticed the cost of my electric bill. Now,
admittedly, I'm a fairly well off person, but were my communications
costs for a very wide band fiber connection, even if usage based, as
low as that for my electric usage, I would never notice the cost.
