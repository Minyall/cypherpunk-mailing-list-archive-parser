this term keeps poping up recently.  Can anybody give me a pointer
to where I can find out more info?  Someone said that it is nonsense,
"quantum computers?, Isn't that something out of a carlos casteneda
novel?" I'm just trying to find out the real deal.

FTP sites and any papers articles would be appreciated.
