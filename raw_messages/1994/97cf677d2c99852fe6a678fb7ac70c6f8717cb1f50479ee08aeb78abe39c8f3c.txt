My expectation is that, true to form, such a move would result in the
outlawing of the possession of this information by "unauthorized"
persons or groups. Authorized persons and groups, including all the
usual suspects, would of course then have even more freedom and less
scrutiny. The standard Band-Aid.

In any case, it doesn't tackle the real problem, which is that
transactions are not as "local" as they once were. These days,
permissions have to be gotten, SS numbers provided, health records
blipped back and forth over the I-way, etc. Any systems which require
more and more dossiers to be kept and cross-linked will erode liberty
and strengthen the power of governments.

Scaring the Congressrodents into making the U.S. have the equivalent
of the Data Privacy laws of the Europeans is *not* a victory.
