Great, just the sort of publicity we need; we're out here on the frontier,
alone with our reputations, and if you mess with us?  We shoot you.

Bad angle, man.  Some folks might get a kick out of screwing over someone
else, but doing it invites the authorities to step in and put the handcuffs
on all of us by restraining our access or tools (at least the legal ones). 
If it's only a flame and you're established - no problem, just ignore it or
defend yourself once or twice and let it go.  Besides, you're asking us to
tell you the questionably ethical stuff we could theoretically do if we
were motivated.  I don't think we would be, except in an extreme case, so I
would argue that the "rootin', tootin', quick-drawin' console cowboy" image
you're trying to perpetuate is way off the mark.

Also remember, the probable penalty for mail bombing or any data
destruction is being forced off your account which means that you need to
find alternative access or *be* *gone* *forever*.  Access isn't as hard to
come by as it used to be, but reputations are damn hard to live down. 
Magnetic media store bits reliably for about seven years, but our memories
last much longer.
