I see. It's the ole "It's worse in other places so quit bitching." Sure, 
it's worse in a lot of places. This is the U.S.A. (or it is where I am). 
We use most of the world's resources and we are leaders in quite a few 
technologies (or close to it). That doesn't mean that when things are 
getting shitty here I have to tolerate it because "it could be worse" or 
"you could live under a REALLY repressive government." I don't want to 
live under ANY repressive government, period.
