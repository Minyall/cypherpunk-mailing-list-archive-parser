   And that rule of thumb completely ignores the fact that if a
   transaction is fouled up anywhere along the line, one finds extensive
   legal liability involved instead of a 'mere' corrupt table in a database.

When the algorithms include "Call legal dept. and sue", the ability of
most programmers to design systems goes out the window.

Jamie's estimate of the magnitude of the problem is probably
overstating the case, but not much.
