I'm willing to try to russle up a suitable place for a physical
meeting in the DC area in parallel with next Sat's politically oriented
left coast meeting. But the number of folks attending will change
where I can hold it.

If you are interested in attending a DC-area meeting next Saturday, 3PM EST
until 5 or so, please send me email.

Thanks
Pat
