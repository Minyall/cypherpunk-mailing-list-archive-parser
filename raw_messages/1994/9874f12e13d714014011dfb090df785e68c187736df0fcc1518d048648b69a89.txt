Here is my csh ping script.  You'll have to change the name of the
mailer program to fit your system:

/usr/andrew/etc/queuemail -f pingmail -a mg5n+@andrew.cmu.edu
hfinney@shell.portal.com catalyst@netcom.com elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu
nowhere@bsu-cs.bsu.edu remailer@chaos.bsu.edu hh@cicada.berkeley.edu
hh@pmantis.berkeley.edu hh@soda.berkeley.edu
ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu remailer@merde.dis.org

And in the file pingmail I have:

   To: remailer-list
   From: Automated Mailing Script <mg5n+@andrew.cmu.edu>
   Subject: Ping
   
   ::
   Request-Remailing-To: mg5n+@andrew.cmu.edu
   
   ----- This is a Automated Remailer Ping Message -----

I have one copy sent back to myself so I get a timestamp of when it went
out.  You can set the To: line if you want, but most systems don't need
it.
