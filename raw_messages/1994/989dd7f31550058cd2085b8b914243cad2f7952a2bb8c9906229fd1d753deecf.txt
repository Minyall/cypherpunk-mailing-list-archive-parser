Actually, they don't even need to ask for it anymore....it's attached
to so many _other_ things that pop up when they enter your name that
it's a moot point. In other words, the same dossiers that allow the
credit card companies to send you "preapproved credit cards" every few
days are the same dossiers that MCI, Sprint, AT&T, etc. are using to
sign you up.
