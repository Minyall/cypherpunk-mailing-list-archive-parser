In a column explaining (to the uninitiated) what the networked 
transformation of human society means (your own Genie sans bottle) William 
Safire mentioned the wiretap controversy.  He has done this before.

"Dangers abound:  President Clinton has cravenly allowed N.S.A. (No Such 
Agency) to bug the info highway.  Futurethicists wonder if 
virtuous-reality love can compete with virtual-reality porn.  And the big 
one: how to get our personal genies back in the bottle."
