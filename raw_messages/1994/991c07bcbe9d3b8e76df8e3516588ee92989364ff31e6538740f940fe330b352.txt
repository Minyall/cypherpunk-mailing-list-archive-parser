This isn't quite the mosaic site described, nor is it the "Cypherpunks
Electronic Book", but there is an archive of what I think are some of
the more interesting articles posted here (well, I'm a few weeks
behind adding new stuff and have several posts to include soon).

It's a gopher site: gopher.chaos.bsu.
