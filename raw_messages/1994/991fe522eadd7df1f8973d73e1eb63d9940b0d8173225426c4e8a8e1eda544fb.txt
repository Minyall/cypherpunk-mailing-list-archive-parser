Hmm....
Depending on how you read this, this can be a real can-o-worms.

First off, does it outlaw ANY receiver covering 800 mhz?

Second, consider software-only hacks to phones to monitor and collect
ESN's, etc. Now you are raided by the Powers-that-Rule, but hit the
scrooge-switch first so the phone forgets, & the evidence is gone.

Will they then claim the fact the phone remembers nothing as evidence
that it was altered? Or is erasing it "altering" too?

And how about test-equipment? The kind the celldealer has. And if you
modify it by replacing the power cord with a new one, or......
