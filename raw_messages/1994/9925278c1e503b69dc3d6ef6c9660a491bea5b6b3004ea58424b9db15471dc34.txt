I have about 580k of 'Detweiler files'. These are sorted by mail from his
presumed identities, mail to them and relevant mail about him. Separately
stored are some of his gems, including his roman torture piece and S Boxx's
poetry.

You can't ftp _in_ to my SLIP node, but I can ftp it to some place convenient.
Compressed, it should be about 200k (ZIP).
