Hal and Blanc have started an intesting thread on the concept of "digital 
money" or "Tacky Tokens."  I'm not sure what they are talking about, exactly.
But it sounds like "vitual money."  I would like to see a description of the 
model for this.  Sounds like a form of barter-script.  

I'd like to see more on this.
