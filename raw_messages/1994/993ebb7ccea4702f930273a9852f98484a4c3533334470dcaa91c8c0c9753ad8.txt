Our enemies are industriously corrupting the language 
in order  to make the ideas of liberty inexpressible. 
  
In particular  they are seeking to make the concepts 
behind the declaration  of independence and the bill of 
rights unspeakably and therefore,  they hope, 
unthinkable.

Do you think that 'our enemies' are doing this consciously, 
purposefully, deliberately?  Do you think that they know these 
concepts well enough to apprehend what it is about their 
meanings that should be corrupted?  Do you think that, having 
understood what these concepts represent, they are in such 
abhorrence of them that the only thing they can do, short of 
physical fighting against the promoters of the concepts, is 
disorient everyone into a confused state of cognitive 
indeterminancy & inefficacy?

Maybe that's what happened to Inman during his rejection 
speech!
