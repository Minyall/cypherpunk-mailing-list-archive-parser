Nope.  It's very similar to the CP/M `ed'. (I hesitate to say
"identical" since I haven't touched a CP/M system since 1984..), but
the first time I used edlin a couple years ago to edit an autoexec.bat
file, I had CP/M flashbacks...

Edlin is very different from the Unix `ed' and *its* ancestors (which
are a line of several line-oriented editors which started life on
CTSS, grew up on Multics, and were cut back down to size on Unix, only
to sprout up again into ex and vi..)
