10 cases == 240 cans right? or is it 120?

The question remains -- how many df's per 12 oz (I assume) can of
coke?  I also assume you mean cans of diet coke, rather than Diet Coke
(brand, and possibly empty) cans.  So, how much aluminun, and how much
Diet Coke brand soft drink is 1 df exchangeable for?
