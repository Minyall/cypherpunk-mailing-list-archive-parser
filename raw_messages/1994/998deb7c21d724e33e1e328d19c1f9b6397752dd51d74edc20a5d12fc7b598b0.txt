Zeke,

Read the ITARs. They're available by anonymous FTP from ftp.cygnus.com
as /pub/export/itar.in.full. There's a special section on exports to
Canada. Basically, most defense articles are exempt from ITAR export
licensing requirements to Canada; exceptions include things like
nuclear weapons components. However, there's apparently still a
reporting requirement, and I wonder how this applies to anonymous
FTP...
