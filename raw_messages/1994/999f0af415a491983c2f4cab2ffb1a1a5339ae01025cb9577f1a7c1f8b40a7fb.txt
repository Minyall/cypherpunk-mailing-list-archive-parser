	The benifit to product integrated crypto is that if Microsoft
puts RSA into Chicago, there are suddently 60 mil. RSA users.  OTOH,
if Microsoft puts A5 into Chicago, there are suddenly zillions of A5
users.  There is a benefit to having big companies like IBM, HP, or
Sun provide strong crypto, and that is it makes it look more
respectable to the large corporation.
