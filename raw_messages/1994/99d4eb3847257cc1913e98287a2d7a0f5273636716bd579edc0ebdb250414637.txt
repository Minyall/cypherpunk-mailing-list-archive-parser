	i for one would stick to the UNmoderated groups.  I think that 
many people thrive on the chaos there and the openess.  I personally 
don't think I would like to have to submit articles for some guys 
approval, just something uncool about it to me.  I don't mean uncool, 
like fashion, I mean it just doesnt fit with my idea of free exchange of 
ideas. I mean no matter how much you stress that the moderator be lenient 
and open you are gonna run into problems.  The Inet is full, or should I 
say fool, of BIG fuckin egos, and they have a nifty way of clashing.  A 
moderator just doesnt fit into my free exchange idea.  Too much like an 
"Official(tm)" thing to me, and i don't particulalry take to official 
things.  To me the beauty of usenet is the chaos and mass amounts of 
info, even the noise that goes flying thru it.  Without that it would be 
just like every other stale BBS forum with no edge and no fun.


wow, these remailers are neat
