Does anyone know a way to get Pgp 2.6.2 by ftp, mail or something in 
Europe? All I can find that I'm allowed to download from the net is 
2.3... 
I suppose this is because of those silly american crypto-laws, but 
but I've seen europeans using the later versions, so they can't be 
that hard to get.
