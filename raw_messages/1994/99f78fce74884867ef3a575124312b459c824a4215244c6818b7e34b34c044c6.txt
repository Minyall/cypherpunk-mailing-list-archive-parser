Regarding the archive I believe it was some company in Canada, I'm not 
sure. There was a thread about this archiving question on another group I 
suppose in the last three weeks. I can't remember where I saw it, if it 
wasn't here. Sorry. And about "paying" for the cd-rom, I pay for the 
usenet feed, and none of us who post are getting royalty payments from 
any of the internet providers. So answer the question again, what is the 
difference in paying an internet provider for access to usenet, and 
paying a cd-rom provider for access to usenet? None materially, except 
that the cd is not interactive, and some providers are (not all as in 
bbs' that don't send e-mail to the internet, but have some usenet 
groups.) There is no material difference that I can determine.
