I haven't yet seen the details on the lawsuit, but I would guess that it is
Roger Schlafly, unless the name is more common than I think. He was at
Borland when I used to work there, and was into numerical methods kind of
stuff. I was told that he is Phyllis Schlafly's son, but he did not give
the impression being someone of her political or cultural orientation, not
that I ever heard him talk about political issues.
