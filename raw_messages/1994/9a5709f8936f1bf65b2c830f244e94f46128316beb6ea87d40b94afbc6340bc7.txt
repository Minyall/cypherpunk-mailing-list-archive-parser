Indeed. But if my messages are bounced or delayed excessively, I will
of course have no reason to remain. My own Calvinist Stoicism.

I won't jump through hoops to meet pointless syntactical purity
checkes. Whether I sign all messages will depend on whether certain
tools become available and easily installable...at the current rate, I
doubt it (for me, Netcom, elm, etc.).

Bluntly, Eric, this is what is so disturbing about your position. You
are willing to "use your position" to essentially purge the list
(through bounces, a la "sign your articles to the list or they'll be
delayed and eventually rejected") of many of us who are unlikely to
solve the various problems mentioned so many times here.

You don't sign, others of note don't sign (some that I can think of
right now: Gilmore, Finney, Zimmermann, and probably many others). You
are _planning_ to now begin working on getting your won signing
situation squared away, but many of us are on different schedules
(Hint: It's even lower on the list of things to do for me).

I don't buy this, and hence will have my messages delayed or bounced.
I want my key to be useful for real uses, not just "Power Ranger" (a
la James Donald) uses.
