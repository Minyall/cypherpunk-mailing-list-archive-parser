It's an interesting weakness, and at least as serious as the
naXXXXX / anXXXXX problem that reveals your identity if you send
email to another anonym.  

The one anonym I've used on anon.penet.fi is already known to at
least one other person (to whom I'd sent mail about the fact that
they'd included their .signature in an anonymous article :-)

I disagree with the "despicable" opinion, though it's certainly a
serious problem and it would certainly have been nicer if the 
cracker had done only a limited number as a demonstration (maybe this
counts; I don't know.)  BUt if our tools have technical weaknesses,
it's *much* nicer to find out from a non-police-agency cracker than
to learn about it when they start knocking on your door.

It sounds like there's a need to separate the email and news-posting
parts of the anon.penet.fi software, or go to stronger anon-reply
methods like the one on the newer cypherpunks remailers.
