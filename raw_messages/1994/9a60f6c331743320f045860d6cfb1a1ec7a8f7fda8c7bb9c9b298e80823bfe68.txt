This is absolutely illogical.  He says, laws underlay financial 'behavior'.
You say, [law1] -> [behavior1] and [law2] -> [behvarior1], and THEREFORE
the proposition fails.

He did not say "there is a one to one relationship between laws and
financial instruments".  What he says permits an N:1 relationship, or
an N:M relationship.
