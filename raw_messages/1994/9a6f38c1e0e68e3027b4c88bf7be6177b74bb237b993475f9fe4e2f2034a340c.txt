How about something like small random pad, maybe one octet, then a
signature (such as "***Begin ...") with this header information being
encrypted via IDEA CFB. You could also include a more structured header
after this, ie. an ID for the software that created it, so the correct
demodulation technique can be applied, or at least warned about if not
available.

With this type of method, unless you can pre-supply the key, the stego
header should look like noise.
