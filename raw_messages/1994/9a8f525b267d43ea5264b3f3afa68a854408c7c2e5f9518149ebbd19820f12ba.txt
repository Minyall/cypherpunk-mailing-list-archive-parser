Ok Perry, I am not going to let you off that easily. Could you elucidate why
you feel that such a GUT would not solve this problem even in principle? If
a GUT could answer definitively whether there were a many-worls interpretation
this would definately address at least peripheral aspects of the P=NP problem.
It would also, necessarily, describe some limitations on computations and 
problem complexity. 

When one considers that there is no clear definition or proof of the exact 
solutions methods to prove P=NP it seems premature to posit such a definate
answer. While it might not be true that it would solve the problem in toto
it may be true that a clarification of the boundary conditions might make
the solution easier by reducing the number of choices of methodology one 
might look at.

I am interested on why you feel a GUT would have no effect, at least, on 
the boundary conditions of the problem?

Take care.
