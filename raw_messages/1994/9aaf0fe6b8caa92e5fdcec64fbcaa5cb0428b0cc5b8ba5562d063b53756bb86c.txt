 I have a suggestion on building future remailers. Let's not
overlook the idea of operating them "Out of band." At intervals (
preferably random) it would be possible to transmit messages via
the phone network, or spread spectrum, to other remailers.
(encrypted links of course)( encrypted UUCP?) This would make
traffic analysis more difficult.

 It would also be possible to bounce messages through diverters in
other states, further hindering TA. This might also work well for
random sources for one time pads.
