Is this true ?  

According to the PGP 2.6.1 User's Guide:
"The freeware version of PGP is only for personal, non-commercial use -- all
other users in the USA and Canada must obtain a fully licensed version of PGP
from ViaCrypt. [...] If you have a need to use PGP in a commercial or
Government setting, and ViaCrypt has a version of PGP for your hardware
platform, you should get ViaCrypt PGP."
