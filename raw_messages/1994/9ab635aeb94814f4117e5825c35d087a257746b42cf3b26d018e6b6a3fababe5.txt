    Why don't we stick to the topic? Do you have an intelligent reply
    or are you going to shoot your mouth off? Or Maybe you can share
    something better with us, all knowing and wise one.

His reply was perfectly intelligent.  Why don't you answer his
question: Why pick on cryptography and not the other items in the
list?  Why not simply require that government respect the right of
individuals to engage in private conversation?  If someone commits a
`crime' without using cryptography is there less harm to society than
if they did use cryptography?

What is there about your proposal that might make anyone think that it
wasn't completely ridiculous?
