RSAREF for Perl is complete and ready for beta testing. Does anyone want to
volunteer? Using it requires Unix, Perl, and RSAREF 2.0. You do not need to
recompile the Perl interpreter. It gives you conventional and public-key
encryption, signing, hashing, and Diffie-Hellman as one-liners in Perl.
