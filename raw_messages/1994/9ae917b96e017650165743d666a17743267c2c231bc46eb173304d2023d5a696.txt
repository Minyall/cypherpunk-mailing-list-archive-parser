When:  Tomorrow, March 11, 1pm. 
Where: Espresso-Roma Cafe, University Way and ~42nd; University District.

Since we haven't been able to secure a site where we can use MBONE, 
we'll be conducting a first physical meeting in a coffee shop. We'll be 
discussing possible options for next month's meeting tomorrow.

Bring questions, topics of conversation, etc. 

Hope to see you there -- Contact me or blanc for more info:

Also, we're thinking of setting up a cypherpunks-seattle list. Let me 
know if you'd like to be included.
