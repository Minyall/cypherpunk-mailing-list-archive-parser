Same here.  Except a bit of money I earned working in a video store, most
every dollar I've gotten since 1981 has been from the Feds, directly or
indirectly (FDIC, U.S.P.S., and gov't contractors).  As a software
engineer, the U.S. government is too large a market to ignore.

I just look at it as my personal program of wealth re-distribution.  Every
dollar that goes to me (for value well received, I might add) is one that
won't go to bolster rewards for imcompetency and laziness.

          and punish the productive and still survive (so far)
