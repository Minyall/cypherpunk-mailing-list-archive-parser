re: C128's monitor was soo good...

  That's nothing! ;-)

  As early as 1987, you could purchase an "action replay cartridge"
or "final cartridge" for the C64. This cartridge could freeze
the execution of any progam, save *all* of memory, the state
of every hardware register, and the cpu registers and flags,
allow you to make changes,. and restart the program where it left
off!

  Even more amazing, it knew the values of *write only registers*
and the CIA/Raster latches! 

  Furthermore, you could disassemble sectors directly from disk,
capture sprites/graphics, and automatically save the compacted
frozen state of the computer in "nova load format", which could be
given to anybody (who doesn't have the cartridge), and they could load
the frozen game (200+ block file) in less than 3 seconds from the 1541!

   Anybody could crack games! Simply enter the manual-word, freeze
the game after it had been entered, and viola!

   The best part of the monitor was the ability to run basic
programs from the frozen state without corrupting anything. Sort
of a primitive cooperative multitasking.

   The cartridge also had a nibble mode copier in it.

   
  The cartridge later came out for the Amiga with even more amazing
capabilities (like the ability to know what was in the write
only blitter/copper registers)


  Ahh, the good ole days of 6502, VIC chip tricks, and 1541
programming. ;-)
