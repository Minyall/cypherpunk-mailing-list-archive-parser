	Of course, the problem with this new nifty way to foil Clipper, 
is that most of the Clipper implementations are in hardware, ie the LEAF 
interactions and such are transparent to us mere mortals, and we can't 
modify them via software. Unless I'm missing something, it's going to 
take some hardware hacking to implement the Honorable Dr. Blaze's fix 
for Clipper.
