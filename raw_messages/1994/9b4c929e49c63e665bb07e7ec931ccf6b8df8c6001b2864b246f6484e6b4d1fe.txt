We NEVER put your credit card number on the Internet.  It is entered
ONCE via telephone, and after that it is never needed directly -- people
sell you things using your FV account-id, which does not have the same
security properties as a credit card number.  For more information,
please send mail to info@fv.com or check out our web pages at
http://www.fv.com.
