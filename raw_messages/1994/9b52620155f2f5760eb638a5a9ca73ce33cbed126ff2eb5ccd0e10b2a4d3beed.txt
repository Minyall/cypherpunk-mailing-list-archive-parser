This instruction would be useful in all sorts of applications.  I was just
wishing I had such a thing only last week.  I had to write a little loop to
check the number of bits set in a word.  Each bit represented an action,
and in my particular case it was an error if more than 1 action was
requested.  The loop was really a waste when you consider that it could
have been done in 1 instruction.
