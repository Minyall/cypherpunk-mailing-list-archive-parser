My mother (an English major) raised me to be very careful about language.

The gov't's use of the word "escrow" for key registration is as offensive to
me now as it was in April of 93 -- perhaps more so, through repetition.

I've decided to use the term

	GAK

	(Government Access to Keys)

as my name for the real issue here -- and let "escrow" stand for the act
of doing something for me (cf., the dictionary definition).  (Besides, GAK
has onomatopoeic value. :-)

Anyone care to join me?
