  I may be wrong, but I don't see it this way.  Articles and research 
papers that I write are copyrighted.  If I choose to distribute these in 
the net, it's a given that inet providers will have these stored on their 
drives.  But...  If you archive the net, and compile it into a different 
media that you then sell(presumably to make a profit), then there is a 
matter of copyright infringement.
