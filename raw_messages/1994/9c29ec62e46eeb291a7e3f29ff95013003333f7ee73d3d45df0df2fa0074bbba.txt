My code smells like that?  I didn't think C code smelled...

2^128 and 2^150+ are big numbers.  I doubt that any collisions
will occur.

Another thing...  I do like Eric's idea for an entropy checker.  Is there
any code like this laying around on some ftp site?  Keep poor VK from
worrying about his account...
