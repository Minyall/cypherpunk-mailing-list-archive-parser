ANNOUNCEMENT
============

What: Bay Area cypherpunks physical meeting
Where: Silicon Graphics, Cafe Iris, Bldg 5 (directions below)
When: Saturday, July 9, 1994
      12:00 noon - 6:00 p.m. PDT

The theme for this month's meeting is swIPe, an encrypted IP package.
A Unix implementation is on soda.berkeley.edu:pub/cypherpunks/swIPe.
Please grab a copy and look at the docs before the meeting; it will
help focus the meeting.

swIPe may well be the PGP for the internet protocols.  The use of
encrypted IP channels can make remailers more secure, can help provide
real-time packet mixes.  Encrypted IP is an enabling element for full
crypto deployment.

DIRECTIONS:

  Silicon Graphics, Inc.
  Building 5 (SGI Cafeteria)
  2025 North Shoreline Boulevard
  Mountain View, CA

From 101 take Shoreline East.  This is towards Shoreline Amphitheatre.
It's also "logical east", and points more north that east.  (That is,
it's east with respect to 101 North, which points west near the exit.)
If you're coming in on 101 South, you'll cross over the bridge.

Continue on Shoreline and go past a whole bunch of other SGI
buildings.  Turn right onto Steirlin Court at the big red metal
sculpture.  There will be even more SGI buildings surrounding
you--take note of the building numbers.  Go almost to the end of this
street.  Building 5 is on the right.
