I seem to recall that some of the postings to the CP list indicated that the
authors were lawyers, and it got me to wondering:

    If true that some on the CP list are lawyers, have they (or would they
consider) providing pro bono representation of someone charged with an ITAR,
or similar, violation? It would seem like one way (though not the best :-)
of pushing back some of the limitations on crypto.....
