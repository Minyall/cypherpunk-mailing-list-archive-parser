    It does not matter who the true identity associated with a
    public key is.  My proposal is only that signatures
    be checked for consistent identity, not true name.

Hmmm.  I thought that you had also suggesting that this mechanism
should ``autonag every nym to send a public key in'' which I thought
raised the question of ``Where do you send the autnoag messages?''

Perhaps you meant for the autonag to be a notice attached to the
distributed message?
