Subject: What can one do for remail operators?

I am interested in doing something to support the remailer operators
that put their necks on the line for us cypherpunks.

I have noticed people like Detweiler (dunno who he is) who are basically
awed by the fact that a remailer crashes when you send your VM swap
file through it, or people using it to do "nanny-nanny-boo-boo, you
can't catch me, so pween off" messages, et al.

I would like to something in support of these people who are noble
enough to keep things running even when EVERYONE it seems is out
to get them.

If I knew any around here, they would get a free beer, and if
the operator of Soda's remailer or Julf was in my area, they 
would get the whole keg ;).
