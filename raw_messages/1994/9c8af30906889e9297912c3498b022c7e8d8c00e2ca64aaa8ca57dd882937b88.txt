And within the scope of their operations - among their employees -
corporations have a monopoly on the means of economic coercion
(forgive me if I omit your editorial use of the word "legitimate").
They have exclusive control over livelihoods.

So maquiladora workers are "persuaded" to work twelve hours a day for
fifteen cents an hour.  Salvadoran workers are "persuaded" (at
gunpoint) to contribute to the welfare of their latifundista
benefactors for either a handful of beans or nothing at all.
Similarly, I am "persuaded" to contribute my labor to the designs of
my employer - truly, because if I don't like it, I can leave.

Perhaps your will elaborate your assertion.
