Thanks, Unit Jim! This citizen-unit did indeed realize your
motivations, especially as you went on to explain them (in the section
I carefully elided!).

"What's wrong with a surveillance state?" is so easily answered with
satire, with an "if this goes on" analysis, that I couldn't resist.
All of the arguments are well-know to cypherpunks, of course, but Jim
posted his call for comments to various newsgroups, where the
arguments are either not as well known or are confused by comments
from didactic shills like David Sternlight and Steve Pope.

Good luck to Jim, I suppose. Me, I've been so opposed to the Big
Brother state since 1966 (when I first read "1984"), that I can't
conceive of sitting down to make arguments about the "benefits" of
such a surveillance state.

I'll stick to humor of color.
