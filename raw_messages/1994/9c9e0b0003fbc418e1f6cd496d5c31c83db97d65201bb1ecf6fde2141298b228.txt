Interesting.  I wonder what this says though... 
cypherpunks promote  encryption, digital cash, dc nets, 
data havens...

but wouldn't ever be caught actually using any of the 
above.

I think this says is that it is important to apply the 
appropriate tools when it is apropos and the situation calls 
for it, but not when there isn't sufficient cause to warrant 
the time & trouble.
