   If thats the case.....isn't it an equal pain in the ass to go to
   the trouble of forging a sig? :> You would likely have to go
   through more key strokes and other routines to forge one. Why not
   just play by the rules and sign a message?

This is a perfectly good rephrasing of one of the main rationales
behind the proposal, namely, that the architectural issues are more
important than the actual crypto use.  (Not exclusively important, but
more important.)
