  Claris has or had some checks in their software to attempt to
recognize that the application had been modified. I think this even
detected a (previously unknown?) Macintosh virus.

  Regardless, this scheme seems rather susceptible to attack. More
useful is something like tripwire--a regularly run program which keeps
checksums of various files on disk; stores the checksums on apart from
the data; and compares the previous checksum with the current
checksum.
