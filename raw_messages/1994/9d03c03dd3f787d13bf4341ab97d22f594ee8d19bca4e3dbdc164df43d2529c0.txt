A lot of the crypto users I know are quite the opposite - folks willing
to stand up in public, speaking truth to power, challenging the
NSA in court or in the newspapers, and working to distribute 
and share free software with other programmers to improve the work
done by everybody.  Many of them are as trusting as anyone else
intellegent I know, though I'll have to grant a certain amount of cynicism :-)
