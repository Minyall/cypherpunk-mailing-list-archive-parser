There is a new anonymous remailer online at:

   nate@vis.colostate.edu

It does not yet support pgp encryption, but it does remail
fine.  This is also the standard remailer used by by WWW
remailer GUI (even if no mailers are checked).

I will be releasing a copy of my remailer GUI and software
in the next day or so.
