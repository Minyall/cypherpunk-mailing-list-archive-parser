I just heard that Rep. Jack Brooks, Chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee and one of the authors of the Computer
Security Act of 1987 is planning to make a floor statement on
Clipper tomorrow morning. Rep. Brooks has been a long-time
critic of government encryption policy. The floor statement
should be carried on C-Span.


Also, Vice President Gore, Andy Grove from Intel and Vic Sussman
of US News and World Report will be on the Larry King Show tomorrow
at 9pm EST to discuss the "Information Infrastructure." Clipper
will most likely be one of the topics, especially if some of the 
calls ask some hard questions of the Vice-President.
