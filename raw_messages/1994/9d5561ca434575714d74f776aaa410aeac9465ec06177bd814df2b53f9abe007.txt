  They can do this because the FCC has SOLD part of our airwaves to the 
company. They can do pretty much anything they want to do with it.  The 
deceptive signals rules apply to Amateurs only. I'm currently studying 
for my no-code ham license so that I can start playing with on air TCP/IP 
and my Linux system. Maybe they'll changes the rules if enough 'new' hams 
could get together. I say 'new' because there are alot of old hams who 
like things the way they are - they even fought the change in rules that 
allow no-code users to get a license without having to take morse code(a 
waste of time in my opinion).
