It all boils down to Bedford Forrest's maxim "Get there first with the most
men."  (Sun Tsu said it first, but Forrest probably wouldn't have liked to
know that, I'm sure)

If in fact there is no method for making cash transactions on the internet,
particularly "off-line" transactions with no trusted third party in the
loop at transaction time, then digital cash is all we have.  Eric has
destroyed the point about the efficacy or need for off-line transactions
already, but to expand on his last sentence, there needs to be empirical
evidence to back up or refute his and my opposing claims.

Halleluja!

Eric, for the last three months, you have said that there was no way to
prove whether digital cash was more cost effective than other forms of e$,
and thus potential efficiency was useless as an economic argument for its
adoption.

Perry and have held that it must be, and you have just now given a bunch of
real good reasons.  Now we need to figure how to test all this out...


I love this place...
