On the other hand, I can't imagine that NSA is unaware that strong
cryptographic hash functions designed for authentication are also
useful building blocks for a confidentiality cipher. Which might make
them less than wholly enthusiastic about doing their best on a public
standard like SHA.

Caveat emptor NSA. (John Cleese, if you're out there, feel free to
correct my Latin).
