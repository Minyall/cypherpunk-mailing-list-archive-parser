DAT tape, not RAM, I think. At $5 per GB I get $5*10^11 to hold the info.
MITM requires a sort of this which requires roughly log(10^20) passes with
a favorable constant. This will wear out a bunch of DAT drives but that is
relatively minor. This is about an order of magnitude bigger than a project
that I considered once to find the optimal solution to the Rubics cube.
