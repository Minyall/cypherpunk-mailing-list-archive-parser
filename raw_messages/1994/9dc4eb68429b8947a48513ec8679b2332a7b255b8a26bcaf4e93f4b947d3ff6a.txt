   But what is the reason of the involvement of "law enforcement" and the
   "intelligence community" in this matter? I refer you all to the
   upcoming conference agenda, the involvement of NIST/NSA, TIS, Denning,
   and FBI Director Louis Freeh. Look at the papers being presented at
   the conference.

   Any questions?
   .............................................

   If a system contains "protocols especially suited for eventual 
   mandatory use", like SKE, does this of necessity mean that the 
   developers intended that it should become part of a nationally-mandated 
   open avenue to spying on anyone who uses it?

Not of necessity.  (One senses some bottom-covering here...)

It DOES of necessity mean that they are, wittingly or unwittingly,
contributing to opening the avenue.  It is incumbent upon us to make
them aware of that contribution, so that their consciences may be
tortured thereby.

If in fact they have any.
