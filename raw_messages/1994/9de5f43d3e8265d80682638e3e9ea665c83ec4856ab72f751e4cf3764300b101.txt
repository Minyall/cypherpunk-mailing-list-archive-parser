I (and some others with credentials) think I have solved it.  I wish
I could be more specific and will be as soon as I can with the idea under
some form of protection.  As soon as I file, cypherpunks will be the
first to get the details.  I am not no much trying to be a tease as to
tease out any possible solutions to this that I may not be aware of.
sci.crypt is not the place for unsubstantiated claims and I hope for
a bit more tolerance here.  We are on the same side, I just wish to
profit from it so I can bankroll a few backlogged ideas.  Bootstraping
is a bitch.  :-)


Peace,

Bob
