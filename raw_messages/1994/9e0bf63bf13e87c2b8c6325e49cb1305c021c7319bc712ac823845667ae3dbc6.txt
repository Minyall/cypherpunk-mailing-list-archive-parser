I've taken the liberty of sending the text of the two recently-filed RSA
lawsuits to this list, assuming that most of you would be interested.  The 
text was obtained by scanning and then OCR'ing my paper copies, so you 
shouldn't be surprised to see an error from time to time.  Also please note 
that I've reorganized the footnotes in the interest of readability, as the 
page & section boundaries are not obvious in the OCR'ed copy.
                  
You should be receiving the following three documents.  (Note that I have not 
included the Schedules attached to the complaints, which are quite 
voluminous, and are not really required in order to understand what's going 
on here.)
               
First, the Cylink complaint against RSA, filed June 30th.  This suit is very 
brief.
                          
Second, RSA's relatively swift motion to dismiss the Cylink complaint, filed 
July 25th, and desire a hearing on or soon after September 9th on this 
motion.  This document and its enclosed memorandum of supporting points, 
written by RSA, is substantially longer than the complaint itself and is 
quite interesting reading.

Finally, I've enclosed an immensely interesting and in-depth complaint filed 
on July 26th by Roger Schlafley, which is probably the best of the bunch.

Enjoy...
