When I spoke to the NSA Security Officer for NSA
he was very interested in Phrack (not having heard
of it before).  I gave him subscription information,
etc.

If you are listening Erik, I want a cut of the take.  :-)


Actually I speculate that someone who saw my reposting
helpfully phoned the NSA about the security breach.
But SDO10 didn't give me that information...
