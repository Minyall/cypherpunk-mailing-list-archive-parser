I just ran a few tests, bouncing umass.edu -> remailer ->
umass.edu for sizes up to 55K.  Round-trip time was 3 to 4.5
minutes, uncorrelated with message size.  (Bottlenecks are the
jarthur outgoing queue, and some baroque hand-off job within
umass.edu)  What sort of timings were "way too slow"?
