I have noticed something...

Soda's remailer has the IRRITATING feature of putting shit like
bombing buildings, drugs, et al at the bottom of anon posts/mail.

If an anon user is found, then he or she can get into some deep
trouble not by way of his posts, but by way of Soda's text.

I wish they had an option to turn that off. :(
