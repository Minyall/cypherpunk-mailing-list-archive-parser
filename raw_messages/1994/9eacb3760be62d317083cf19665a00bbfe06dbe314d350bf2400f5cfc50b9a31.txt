It is nice to have a lot of people on the list from Netscape.
Here is a question about SSL relating to the use of certificates:

          + The issuer name must resolve to a name that is deemed
            acceptable by the application using SSL. How the application
            using SSL does this is outside the scope of this memo.

What does Netscape actually do about this?  If I want to make a server
which will interoperate with existing Netscape clients what kind of
certificate do I need, and what kind of name should be in there?
Thanks -
