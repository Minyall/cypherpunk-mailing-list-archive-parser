It has come to my attention that I am the only subscribed member of the
list at present.  Everyone else seems to have unsubscribed, or been unsub-
scribed, and only I have resubscribed.

So, I'll just take this opportunity to make a test post, without worrying
about swamping hundreds of mailboxes...
