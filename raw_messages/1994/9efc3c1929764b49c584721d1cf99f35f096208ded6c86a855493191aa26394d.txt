: She's not asking you to have polite consideration because "we" women
: think of "ourselves" as "victims"--She's asking you to show respect and
: courtesy to everyone in the forum and the forum because we think of ourselves 
: as part of humanity.

Personally I find your caricature of how you think women post to
Usenet the most discourteous of all these posts, Larry.

(Like this, for example:
: Here's hoping the positive vibrations of the Jupiter-trumpet will beam into 
: OUR lives and wreak a positive transformation. 
)
