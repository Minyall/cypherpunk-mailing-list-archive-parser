On page 123 of Applied Cryptography Bruce Schneier cites the work of
two cryptographers and the digital cash system they invented that
satisfies all six properties he listed on the same page.  In his words:

The authors consider this the first ideal untraceable electronic cash
system.

The reference [674] is:

T. Oamoto and K. Ohta, Universal Electronic Cash
Advances in Cryptology--CRYPTO '91 Proceedings
Berlin: Springer-Verlag 1992 pp. 324-337

Is anyone here familiar with this work?  Has anyone tried to implement
this protocol in some manner?

Also how would I go about obtaining the text of this work either in
written form or online?
