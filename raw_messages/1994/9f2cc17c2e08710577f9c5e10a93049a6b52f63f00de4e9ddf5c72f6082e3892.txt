	Well, clearly, 2.6 will have some very bright AI features, so
that it will talk to people who'se Key-ID's identify them as being
outside of the US, as their versions of PGP are perfectly legal.

	And 2.4 is legal, if the 2.6 code doesn't recognize that,
well, then that code is buggy & will need to be fixed.  :)
