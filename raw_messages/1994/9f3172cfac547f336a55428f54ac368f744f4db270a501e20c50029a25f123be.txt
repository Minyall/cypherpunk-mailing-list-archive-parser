Subject: Help: Can I get a current Cypherpunks gateway site list here?

I have been sent a somewhat dated file, listing Cypherpunks remailer sites,
and mail-to-news gateways; can I get sent a current list, please?

(It is the gateway list that I'm particularly after.)

In case this is an automated a/c: I did not get the list please send list

Thanks,
