And I'm answering in public for the same reason. (I'm also seeing a
delay in getting mail, at NaughtCom, so I apologize if others have
already answered this.)

Eric Hughes described this scenario a few days ago: you may be
subscribed twice to the Cypherpunks list if you manually subbed and
then were also subbed when the old sub list was restored, and you used
two different addresses.

Vinod should see if the duplicate messages are being sent to two
different addresses, etc. The unsub via majordomo from the one he
doesn't want to see.

If this is not the case, then my explanation here is not the right
one.
