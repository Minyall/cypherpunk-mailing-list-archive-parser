This sounds like the standard KGB practice to frame "spies". Have an
agent posing as a dissident ask you to carry a letter to the
West. When it changes hands, pounce. Then conduct a show trial
"proving" that "secret" information changed hands.

I'm seeing fewer and fewer differences between the present-day USA and
the former USSR.
