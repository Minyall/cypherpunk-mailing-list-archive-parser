I just signed and checked some pgp keys (using pgp 2.6.1) and I found
something unexpected:

Keys can be checked with the -kc option. To identify the key to be checked
either a string or the KeyID (with 0x-prefix) can be given as an argument.

If I do now 

pgp -kc name_of_anyone 
pgp -kc 0xanyones_key_id

for the very same key (once identified by substring, once by keyid,
which should both do the same job)
the first command checks many more signatures than the second command.
The second command stops earlier, but I couldn't find out yet, whether
this stops after finding a trusted path to the checked key or what else could
be the reason for this.

Any ideas?
