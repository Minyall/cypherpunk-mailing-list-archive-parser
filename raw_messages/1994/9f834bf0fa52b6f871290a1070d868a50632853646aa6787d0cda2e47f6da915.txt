I should point out that the standard argument that picking 'k'
different values for 'a' and then calculating the probability as
(1/2)^k is fallacious.  This would be true if the probabilities were
independent, but they aren't.  There was a paper on this about five
years ago whose awareness has not been yet widespread.  I no longer
have the reference.

For everybody that wants to really know about this, find out about the
Miller-Rabin test.

The 50% figure is easy to show with some considerations about
quadratic residues.  Tightening the bound is much more difficult.
