There is no PGP 2.6(1).  However, PGP 2.6.1 should be released soon,
once we make sure that there are no problems with the distribution,
etc.

Mail will be sent out when the release happens.  Unfortunately Phil
tends to jump the gun on things like this, and sent out mail before we
were ready to release.

Sorry for the inconvenience.  We'll let you know when the release
is made.
