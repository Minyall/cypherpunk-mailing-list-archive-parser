I think you have this wrong.  What I believe he has said is that he has 
blocked some specific newsgroup or mail list.  It was something like:

			alt.rush.somethingorother

He blocked it because it wasn't personal e-mail, just the postings of some
anti-Limbaugh listeners who bitched about each show after it aired.
