Naturally, the two aren't mutually exclusive, but I'll not buy a vault 
door for my house unless I've got a vault to put it on.

Anyway, I think the best key management so far is the PGP web of trust 
design of Phil Zimmermann's.  I think this could be extended for other 
applications, too, like encrypted IP (swIPe?) and the like.  I've been 
trying to think of ways to extend that to private key systems, too.

Peace to you.
