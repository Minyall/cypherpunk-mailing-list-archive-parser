         In order to hide a Stealth PGP (or equivalent) encrypted "noise" file
         effectively one may follow the steps outlined below:
                               
                           1    Embed it in "structured garbage" such as is
                                present normally on the deleted portions of the
                                disk.  This can be accomplished by using a 
                                stegonagraphy program or by splitting the file
                                into small segments and scattering them among
                                "structured garbage".
                                
                           2    Write the resulting "structured garbage"/noise
                                combination directly to disk.  This can be
                                accomplished by using a normal disk-sector 
                                editor utility.
                           
                           3    Keep track of the exact location and size of the
                                file if you want to retrieve it later.  Keep
                                this information secure.
                                
                           4    Modify the FAT (or equivalent) to mark the
                                sectors you've written to as "FREE", "BAD", or
                                "DELETED" (if necessary).
         
         In order to retrieve and reconstruct one's file simply reverse
         steps 2 and 1.
