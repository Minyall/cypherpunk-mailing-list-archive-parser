Ahem. He was proposing a mechanism that will work in log(n) time. All
current known methods are subexponential. As you SHOULD know, a log
function will eventually be smaller than a subexponential one if you
only let N grow large enough. This is baby complexity theory. I find
it astonishing that I should even have to mention it.

Thats not what he was proposing. Obviously one can build such an
algorithm given a factoring algorithm, and we know of exponential
factoring algorithms. That wasn't the idea. His notion was that there
might be a CHEAP algorithm to do this.
