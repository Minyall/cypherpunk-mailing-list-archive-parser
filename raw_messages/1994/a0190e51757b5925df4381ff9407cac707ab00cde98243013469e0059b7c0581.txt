Good luck with it.  From the name it figures that you're gonna use the 
PGP as the engine.

As an aside, several years ago... I knew people who used 
'crypto-phones'...all they did was time-slicing and basic simple scrambling.

They sliced up the conversation into 1/100ths of a second and 
regurgitated it at the other end.  A friend of mine could listen to the 
'encoded' output and tell you exactly what they were saying...in real 
time :>

I guess PGP should be better  (or 1/10000 sec time slices :> )

just for interest.
