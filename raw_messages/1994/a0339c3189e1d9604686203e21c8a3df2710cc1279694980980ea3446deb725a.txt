Here's a brief quote from a NewsBytes copyrighted article. You can surmise
the rest, or go get a copy of last Sunday's NY Times. There are no new
arguments in the Times editorial, but the fact that they wrote it is what's
interesting:

 WASHINGTON, D.C., U.S.A., 1994 JUN 13 (NB) -- In a Sunday editorial,
 the influential New York Times has criticized both the Clinton
 administration's Clipper encryption scheme and the digital telephony
 legislation backed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
