Band hop. Build a variable modulo counter and use its output to reset its 
modulo and hop the band around pseudo-randomly. Unless they know or stumble
on the particular design you are using it will be very difficult to track.

Since music, energy wise, approaches 1/f^2 it might be ok to even use the
actual stations.
