According to a discussion I had with Dave Lawrence (postmaster at UUNET, as
 well as moderator of news.admin.newgroups), UUNET is registered with the FCC
 as an "Enhanced Service Provider," which, according to Dave, amounts to
 similar protection as "Common Carrier."  ("Common Carrier" seems to not
 be appropriate yet, since Congress is so behind the tech curve)
