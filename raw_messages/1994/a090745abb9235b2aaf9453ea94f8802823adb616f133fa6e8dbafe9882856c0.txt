    It may thus be quite reasonable to build in a hard cutoff in
    service time . . . since the extreme delay which triggers the
    expedited transmission is an unpredictable and infrequent event

This is not a safe assumption.  Check out the stats for ghio@kaiwan.com.

    it will not make cryptanalysis of the remailer any easier.

I'm pretty sure that cryptanalysis, per se, is not the question, but
rather traffic analysis.
