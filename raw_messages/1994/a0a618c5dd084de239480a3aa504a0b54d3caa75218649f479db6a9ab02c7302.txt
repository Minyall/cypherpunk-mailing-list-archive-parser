Yeah, it's been conventional wisdom around NYC since the 19th 
century that the best way to get some funding from LEAs was to 
set up a group with the word "anarchist" in it, or have an 
anarchist-like manifesto.

In the 80s the "commie bomb thrower" types were bitching that 
the money was moving out west to the "right wing gun nut" 
types.

Now long-time anarchist hustlers around here say that even the 
gray-haired cops bemoan Red-squad cut backs so that LEA money 
could go toward defeating "psychopath survivalists" and "the 
David Koreshes" and "murderous ex-defense workers".

To divert attention from the nuclear geopolitics of the 
Kissingers.
