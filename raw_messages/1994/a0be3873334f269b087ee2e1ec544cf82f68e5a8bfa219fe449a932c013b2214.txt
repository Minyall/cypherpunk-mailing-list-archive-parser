You can engineer them, actually.

Imagine that you had a 64 bit hash function, and the birthday paradox
thus provided you with a 2^32 difficulty in finding a collision.

Prepare two versions of the document you want to fake the signature
on. Adjust the documents over and over again (trivia like spacing will
do -- find 32 locations and either add or don't add a space) until you
get a colliding pair of hashes. 

This illustrates that hash collisions are actually quite a problem if
you have an insufficiently large hash.
