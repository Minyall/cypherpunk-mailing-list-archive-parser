You dropped the part of his message where he said that he believed
v2.5 was available abroad.  If it's not, I don't think it will take
long.  And once it's escaped from this little prison state of ours,
overseas users incur no risk in using it: they can't even be
Noriega'd, since they've broken no law in any country.
