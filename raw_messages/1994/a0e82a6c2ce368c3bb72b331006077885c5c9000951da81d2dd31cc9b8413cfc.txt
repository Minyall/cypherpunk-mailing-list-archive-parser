I remember reading a Scientific American article about two years before
Iraq invaded Kuwait, in which it was made clear Iraq had and were
developing missiles with ranges paralleling only U.S., Russia and China. I
don't think harmless and defenseless quite fits the description. Maybe
wannabe super power would be more accurate.
