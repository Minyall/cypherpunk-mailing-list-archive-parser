K00L, RayDewd! Like, I'm glad dewdz like you can , like, _follow_ this
stuff. Maybe you can translate it into ordinary prose for old farts
like me, who favore multi-sentence paragraphs and even reasonably
thorough explications of ideas that don't fit into a single line of
repartee!

No insult to Arsen Ray is meant, and there may even be some nuggets in
there I missed. But it sure does reinforce my hatred for "IRC" and
similar fora for the attention-challenged. From what I could see
scrolling by from Ms. Denning, she wasn't getting into the "dewd
repartee" either, showing that we have at least one thing in common.

Repartee has its place, and we all do it. But the format here is not
conducive to getting views exchanged and coherent thoughts developed.
What a waste. 

Me, I'm not as polite as Ms. Denning. About one minute into this I
woulda said "Fuck this shit, I'm outta here!"
