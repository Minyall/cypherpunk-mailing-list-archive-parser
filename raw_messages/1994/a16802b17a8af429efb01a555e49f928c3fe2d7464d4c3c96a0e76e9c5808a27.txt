What stops a *corrupt* government from shooting you if you dissent?
You have to assume *some* degree of respect of laws or the constitution; the
fact is that those in power, *when* in power, could possibly ignore all laws.
Obviously, there's no point discussing such situations; obviously however pro-
Clipper etc a government may be, it is still very far from any such situation.
