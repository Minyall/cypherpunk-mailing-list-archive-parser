It was introduced in 2.6 -- 2.6ui doesn't have this particular
problem.  There was a one-character patch sent along with the
original mail describing the problem; in randpool.c the function
xor_bytes is missing a "^" character.  This was described fully
in the mail.

We expect that the next release of 2.6 will be the _final_ release
of this code tree, and that future releases will be based on rewritten
code.  But I cannot guarantee that, it is onoly a hope (and a plan),
not a way of life.
