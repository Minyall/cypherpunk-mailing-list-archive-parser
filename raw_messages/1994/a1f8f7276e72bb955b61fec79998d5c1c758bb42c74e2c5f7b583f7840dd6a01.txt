I agree with your observation.  The Telnet protocol is however 
independent of any underlying network protocol.  In our application the 
Telnet connection can be established over a lot of different types of 
networks.  Implementing secure IP will not give us much since it does not 
cover the other possibilities for a Telnet connection.  It is also a 
question of resources (read "time") -- we require a solution *now* (and 
preferable yesterday :-)

No flame, just an observation that what seems to be a better solution is 
not always suitable...
