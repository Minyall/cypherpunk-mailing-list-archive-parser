 No matter WHAT California Privacy Law cueently states about the confidentiality
of DMV records Home addresses and such... its STILL trivial to get the info from
the DMV in a semi-legal way(Social Engineering...)

   Faked Insurance Investigator Letterhead created on your
Laser Printer and an out of State PO Box work wonders...

or simply subscribe to NCI, Nighthawk, Superbureau or any number
of info brokers... then you can get it ONLINE...
