Love it!  I don't know the full Detweiler story, could someone fill me
in via email?

I missed Matthew's post somehow but, yes, I am asserting that you can be
speaking with someone you have not spoken to before and can go secure
at any point in the conversation.  You can see how useful this could
be to business.  Many large companies have spent bundles on secure
phone systems within their organizations yet are still vulnerable
when making calls across company boundries.  With my widget it's quite
easy to provide this in a distributed way, only to those individuals
that require it and it crosses company boundries securely as well.

Until the full functionality is in an ASIC, the cost, while lower than
a computer modem, is still not yet what a large mass of the public
would dish out so I am counting on business from business to make it
cheap enough to be easily affordable by folks like you and I.

BTW I agree totally with an earlier post that all I have presented so
far is vapor and unsubstantiated assertions.  Why bother talkin' at all
now when I've been sittin' on it for a year?  I really do have my
reasons and they are objective, some having to do with fear of
"interference" from the fed.  Perhaps more on them in the future.  All
will become clear.  :-)


Peace,

Bob
