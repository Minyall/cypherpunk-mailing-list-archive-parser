Hmm, yes, using agents for security verification seems reasonable;
if you've got a legal relationship or other sufficient trust.
It does also require an adequate communication path between you
and your agent - on the incoming side so you know that the message
the agent verified is the message you're seeing (e.g. the agent's
signature on the message, plus potentially some check to make sure
all the messages get delivered), and on the outgoing side to make
sure your agent gets your messages correctly.
