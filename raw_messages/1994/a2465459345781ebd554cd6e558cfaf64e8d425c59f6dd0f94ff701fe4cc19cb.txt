Seconded.  Gary Jeffers does not speak for me.  Tim May does not speak
for me.  Roger Bryner most certainly does not speak for me.  L.Detweiler
not only doesn't speak for me, he doesn't even speak for himself :-)  The
only person who speaks for me here is me, and I'd like to keep it that way.

Also (not related to the postings above) whenever anyone speaks to the
press, *please* try to convey you're a member of this list speaking
personally, and not speaking for the list.  Even if the journalist
deliberately ignores you when he writes it up, I'd like folks to make
the effort first.
