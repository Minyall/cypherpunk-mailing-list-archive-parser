This is a good argument for using e-mail digital mixes for even
routine communications, and eschewing house-to-house phone 
conversations with one's closest associates.  Here are some
other alternatives:

+ Use public phones with transferable phone cards
+ Phone redialing services
+ Call large numbers of wrong numbers from your home
phones.  This is easy to do with a modem script,
but might be hard to arrange so that you don't run up
the phone bill or annoy lots of people.
