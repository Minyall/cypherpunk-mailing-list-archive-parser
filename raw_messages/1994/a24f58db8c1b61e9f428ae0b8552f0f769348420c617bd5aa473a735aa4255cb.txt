   A couple of weeks ago Eric asked for statistical information on
   remailer message sizes.  I put in a size-counter a week ago [...]
   or so, and here are some results.

Based on Hal's numbers, I would suggest a reasonable quantization for
message sizes be a short set of geometrically increasing values,
namely, 1K, 4K, 16K, 64K.  In retrospect, this seems like the obvious
quantization, and not arithmetic progressions.  Live and learn.
