I regret that I'm not able to read your
metashell messages...would it be possible
to send me your email address otherwise..
a plain text type perhaps?  I think you're
looking for a copy of Burn 2.0...but I
can't send it until I can find an 
address!

(Sorry for the waste of bandwidth...)

Regards,

Dave
