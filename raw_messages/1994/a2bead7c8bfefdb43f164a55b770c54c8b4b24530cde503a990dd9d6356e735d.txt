Just some sage advice for newbies:

Stay away from Blacknet unless your a serious customer.

Ames was a major Blacknet user.  I don't think the authorities
will take a bright view of anyone posting about it publically.

On the otherhand, if you have legitimate information to pass, and
want money for it, and don't mind taking quick and speedy trips
to other jurisdictions in disguise, go for it!
