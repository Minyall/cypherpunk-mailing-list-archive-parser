   Usually a candidate number is send through a probabilistic prime test
   which says either "No, not a prime" or "a prime with a probability of
   at least 50% ". Usually this test is repeated 10 or 20 times, so after
   passing this iteration the probability of having a prime number is at
   least 1:2^10 or 1:2^20 . 

The probability of a composite passing one trial is extremely small,
much smaller than 50%.  _And_ the trials with different moduli are
_not_ independent, so you just can't multiply the probabilities
together.  Rather, you have to calculate a chain of conditional
probabilities.

There was a paper in the last seven or eight years on this.  I believe
Pomerance was one of the authors.  Ask on sci.crypt for details.

   I am also not
   convinced yet of the Fermat test. Why not use a Rabin-Miller-Test ?

Rabin-Miller would be better.  It would be instructive to examine the
conditional probability that a composite number which fails
Rabin-Miller passes Fermat.  I understand it's vanishingly small.
