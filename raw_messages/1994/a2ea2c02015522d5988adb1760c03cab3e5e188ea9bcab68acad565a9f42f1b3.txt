And I am trying to distribute MACPGP copies (on DOS disks).  What is the
best version of MACPGP to hand out.  (Give me the full MAC name.)
 
Thanks

Mr. Hawk:

Which version do you have?

Mr. Frissell:

The most recent version is MacPGP2.3.hqx.cpt

Do NOT distribute MacPGP2.3 V1.1 as the source code is not "out there."

I will be happy to send you a copy if you like.
