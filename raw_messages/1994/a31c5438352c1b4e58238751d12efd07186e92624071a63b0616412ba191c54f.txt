I see you were sticking your tongue out at Russell.  I need to know whether
you were sticking your tongue out when you responded to my message as well.

By the way, I believe the word you're groping for is "prognosticative".  If
"prognosticatory" _is_ a word, which I doubt, it should be marched out back
and shot immediately.

I bet if you get someone to help you look it up and sound out the words in
the definition for you, you might even have a fighting chance of using it
properly in a sentence next time.  Try asking one of the older children, if
you can find one who isn't inclined to beat you up on sight.
