Yes.  This embarrassing little programming exercise may be enjoyed
by connecting to http://www.pizzahut.com.  You first enter your name,
address, and phone number into a form.  If it is within their 
delivery area, you can enter pizza information on a subsequent form.

If not, you have the option of pretending to order a pizza on
a demo form.  The whole thing is pretty lame.
