I can see two problems.  First, at least the first machine on the trans-
port path will see both your origin address and your destination address.
So it is in a perfect position to do traffic analysis.  Many users may
not have the ability to control which machine this is since routing is
usually automatic these days.

Second, if each machine simply saves a message and sends it on, then even
if the messages are encrypted there will probably be timing relationships
between the incoming and outgoing messages which will allow them to be
linked.  So someone monitoring the intersite communication channels may be
able to track a message through the network just by noticing when it comes
into and goes out of each node.  This is why Chaum introduces message
batching and mixing at each node.
