Some of you may remember that I was promoting triple-DES-CBC using three
feedback loops rather than one, claiming that is was clearly at least as
secure as triple-DES with one feedback loop, while being faster for
pipelined operation.  It is clearly faster in a pipeline but Eli Biham has
shown me his attack on inner-loop triple-DES and it's quite good and I was
quite wrong...at least for chosen-ciphertext attacks.  The inner loops
weaken the resulting cipher drastically, under those attacks.

I might still use the inner loops to get longer brute force attacks (as
noted by Burt Kaliski in a posting here a while ago), if I knew that
chosen-ciphertext attacks couldn't happen, but my original claim is clearly
wrong and I thank Eli for pointing that out.  Meanwhile, there are probably
better ways to get the longer key for avoiding brute force (eg., XOR with a
single secret value or with a simple (fast) PRNG).

I'm told that Eli has a paper in preparation explaining his attack in full
and I'm looking forward to that paper.  I am sure that its location will be
announced to this list when it becomes available.
