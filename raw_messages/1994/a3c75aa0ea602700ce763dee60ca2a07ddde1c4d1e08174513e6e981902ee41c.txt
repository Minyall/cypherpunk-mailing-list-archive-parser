How about locating it in a recalcitrant country e.g. North Korea, Libya,
Iraq, Iran.  During the Gulf war scuttlebutt has it that Iraq used encrypted
communications on the Internet to keep its C3 functions up. (Command,
Control, Communications) If they can't get at the remailer its pretty hard
to shut it down. Use satellite communications instead of copper and it would
be real hard to shut down.
