As Barlow told me during an unrelated incident, "Christ, *shit* happens, eh?"
One of the main reasons I don't live in NY or CA is they have so many laws.
If you can't find a way around the system, or to slip through the cracks,
you'll just have to goose-step along to the bitter end.  If the internet
becomes the surveillance system the intelligence communities envision, there
may be a law against sitting on the toilet sideways and a means to enforce it.
