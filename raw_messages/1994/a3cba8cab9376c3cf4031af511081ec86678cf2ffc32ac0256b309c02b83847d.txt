Like it says in the header, "Remailed-By: ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu".
I remailed it; I did not originate it.  No, I do not know who the sender
is, and cannot find out.

Without belittling your dismay at being called a "spook", I think
it's worth noting that nobody has posted to say "Thanks for the hot
tip!", while several have said "Yeah, right."  This is as it should be
in reponse to an unsigned message making unsupported claims.
