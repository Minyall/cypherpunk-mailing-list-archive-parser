It may be that, under some monopolies\\\crooks\\bums\\\ Public Utility 
Commissars, the PUC has made it illegal to avoid Phone Company fees,
or (far more likely) some Phone Companies don't let you do this,
because it *is* a cheap way to get an unlisted number.
I haven't heard of any jurisdictions for which this is true,
but there are 50 sets of PUCs who make random annoying laws,
and a lot of small phone companies as well as the Bells, GTE, Contel, etc.

Most phone companies also let you have additional listings,
usually for a fee, which are good for things like roommates,
spouses with different last names, organization listings that
are really your home phone number, etc.
