I can't tape it, but anyone else is more than welcome to do so and
distribute tapes and transcripts to their heart's content.  I say
this partly because I'll be too busy concentrating on the talk and
partly because I've had many problems in the past getting people to
stick to their promises to transcribe tapes (notably the interview
I did with Tim May on my radio show last year, which was very good;
the guy who promised to transcribe the tape screwed me, and so it
never happened).

These messages should probably not be posted to the whole list.  If
anyone there next Thursday tapes the talk and wants to make copies
available, s/he can let me know and I can pass the address, price,
or whatever along to the list.
