Much more important to the survivability of Iraqi C-Cubed I was their
use of Banyan-type networks. Links could be cut by bombs, SEAL
sappers, etc., and then the network would reconfigure and "heal."

Several U.S. companies supplied the technology, according to reports
in EE Times, etc., and export laws may be changed as a result.

(No matter, as plenty of other countries supply similar network
topology software. The Internet is in many countries....)
