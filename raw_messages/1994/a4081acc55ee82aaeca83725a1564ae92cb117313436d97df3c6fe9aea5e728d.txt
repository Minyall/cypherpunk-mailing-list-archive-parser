You know, this radiation experiment reminds me of another incident.
A group of African-American men were injected, without their knowledge
or consent, with live syphilis spirochaetes, and studied for a number
of years.  No attempt at therapy was ever attempted, as I recall, for
these individuals.  Here is a reference.
