   the great voice-over-data protocols and products introduced by
   Intel, Rockwell, ZyXEL and others at Comdex which will make
   Voice-PGP so much easier

As I understand these voice-over-data products, the voice goes over
analog, added to the modem signal.  The modem signal is interpreted,
and then reconstructed and subtracted from the incoming signal,
leaving voice.  Very clever, but insufficient for secure phones.
