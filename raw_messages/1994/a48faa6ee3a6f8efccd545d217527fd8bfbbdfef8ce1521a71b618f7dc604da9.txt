What are your LEGAL grounds for attempting to retain "editorial 
control" over PGP, as commendable as your desire to maintain its 
integrity undoubtedly is?  The notice distributed with PGP itself 
seems to say otherwise -- only that modifications must also be 
freely distributable.  So why CC: your letter to what appears to 
be a legal firm?  Does the legal term "in terrorem" apply here? <g>
