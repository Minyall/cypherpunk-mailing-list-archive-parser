But Tim, don't you believe in the march of progress?

(I agree. I retrieved some of those docs this issue arose over. I
 got a MIME doc, the header of which told me to fetch a translator,
 and when translated I text plain text. I know that simple ASCII
 will be overtaken by fancier tech, but why the hell encode plain
 text in a non-human readable format?)
