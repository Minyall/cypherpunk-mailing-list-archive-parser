   Cell1 is just not incredibly smart about security, physical or 
otherwise.  An aquaintance of mine found a "Fraud Alert Bulletin" in a 
Cellular One trash can which warned about the dangers of not shredding 
your trash.  Of course, in the same bag was wads of credit card info, NAM 
& ESN info, etc.
