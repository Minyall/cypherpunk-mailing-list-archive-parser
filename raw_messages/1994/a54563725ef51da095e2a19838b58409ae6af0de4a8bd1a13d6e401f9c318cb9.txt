That only works for sensitive information that is likely to be leaked.  
The NSA doesn't do that for every FOUO and classified document it has - 
if it did, it'd never get anything else done, it'd be so busy doing that 
stuff.  Even with software to do the synonym sonkey-work, it'd take a 
massive amount of work to print different copies of every single document 
the NSA has.

I did find one interesting thing about FOUO documents mentioned, though - 
how can FOUO documents be exempt from the FOIA?  That doesn't make sense, 
unless it was either a deliberate evasion on the part of the NSA to 
attempt to mislead the innocent and naive.  Either a document is 
classified (and therefore subject to the standard classified document 
review process) or it isn't.  Sorry, but they can't have their cake and 
eat it, too.

Of course, I could be wrong.  Their SPOs carry guns, too...
