And it is superior indeed... But what are we talking about here. A 1024 bits
key should be save for at least the next 10000 years so who cares if a 5000
bits key could be save for maybe a 1000000 years!!! 

If the big keys are going to be used PGP will be taken away from user that
not can use very fast machines... 

... If you outlaw Privacy, only Outlaws will have Privacy!
