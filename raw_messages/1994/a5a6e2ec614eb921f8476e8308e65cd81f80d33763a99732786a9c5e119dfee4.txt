So the purist stance is untenable? Less than 2 years ago I was a
homeless person, living on the banks of the San Lorenzo River. Then I
met a person named "Timothy C. May." He wasn't interested in being on
the Net anymore--he said it took too much of his time--so he game me
his account, his password (which I've since changed, of course), and
said "Have fun." 

The purist stance is much more common than many might think.

There are plenty of items of property that can be stolen, and are
stolen. And yet these items continue to exist, be sold, traded, etc.

If someone is really, really worried about havin their codes stolen,
they can arrange to use codes only usable in their banker's office
(not altogether a bad idea, by the way), or with a duress code
built-in, etc. Or none at all. Choice, and costs.

In any case, the free markets will have a major effect. With strong
crypto, the communications transparently cross borders, making legal
moves problematic.
