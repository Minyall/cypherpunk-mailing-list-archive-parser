Well thats 2 replys,  Man it`s going to be packed! :)

When a meeting happens what do we discuss?/do?

 - an obvious one would be NZ crypto!
 - New crypto ideas?
 - NZ Anon remailers & Repositorys
 - Patents??? (maybe not)
 - Cryptanalasis  (Hopefully, oh please-oh please)

  Um, what else


	T

PS:  Why do we need a workstation? (probably a dumb question)
