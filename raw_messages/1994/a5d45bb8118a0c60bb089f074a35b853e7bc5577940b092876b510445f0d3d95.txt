But will a dictionary attack work when the passphrase is multiple words?
Because then it would have to try all the words in the dictionary
grouped with other worde, and the permutations thus become huge.

i.e. "spinachwalrusgazebo" is three words, and to me, would seem immune
from a dictionary attack, because the attack only uses single words.  Is
this right?
