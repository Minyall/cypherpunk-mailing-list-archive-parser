My recollection of the DFAT building was that it was quite old (by
Canberra standards, which means built in the 1950's or so), but reasonably
well maintained.  Most of the bus tour operators will point out the
fourth floor anyway.  It's good touristy stuff.

You are.  ASIS bungled a training exercise, at the Melbourne Sheraton,
which led to an embarrasing public disclosure of the organisation's
existance.  It was pure keystone cops stuff.
