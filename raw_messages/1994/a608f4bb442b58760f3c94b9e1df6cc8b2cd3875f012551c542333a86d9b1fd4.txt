        Being a relative newbie to cypherpunks I realize I'm posting at my
        own risk...

        It is my understanding that you can be compelled to at least
provide            
        decrypted information.  In other words the court can say, "We want
        your PGP e-mail, deliever it to us in an unencrypted form."  A question
        may be how they could prove you didn't alter the information while
        decrypting.  This could be acomplished by supervising you while you
        decrypted the info, with attorneys for both parties present.  Of course
        an attorney could still argue you could change it and want the court
        to do the actual decryption, therefore demanding you turn over your key.
