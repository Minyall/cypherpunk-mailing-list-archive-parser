	There has been a post to comp.home.misc about how we need net
providers to keep accounts of where people access on the net so that
they can be charged for the net services they use. I replied saying
that we need it in a digital cash scheme. Those more knowledgeable
about the specifics of digicash might want to check out that group and
field any questions, if they may arise.
