The same way companies have been made to commit not to kill dolphins,
or test products on animals, or give to Planned Parenthood: organized
public pressure, combined with threatened or actual negative
publicity.

You could also, like the Luddites, pressure the inventors of computers 
not to make any more of these new-fangled, fearsome things.  Because 
you just *know* what they'll be used for, once they develop some 
database "features" and make it possible to send messages anonymously.

signature about my address:
I don't any express any "official" opinions from Microsoft; I just like 
to argue on cypherpunks.)
