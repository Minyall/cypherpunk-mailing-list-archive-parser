Has anyone heard off or seen a report by a UK firm called "Kable"
entitled "Wired Whitehall 1999"?  I've just been looking at a summary
of parts of it, and it seems scary: national ID cards and a concept
called "Single Citizen's Account" for management of money flow from
(and certainly to) the government.  This fits with what Levy described
as the low-resistance path most likely to be taken for online money
schemes: more visibility, less privacy.
