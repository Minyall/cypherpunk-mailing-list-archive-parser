Windows 3.1 shareware, you get source if you register. If you want to take a 
look then try:

ftp.dsi.unimi.it
/pub/security/code/s-tools2.zip    (I think!)

The gzip steganography patches that I made are freely available from:

ftp.netcom.com
/pub/qwerty/Steganography

I was particularly pleased with myself when these worked, since it 
demonstrates that you don't need sampled data in order to hide information.
