No.  ViaCrypt uses a licensed version of RSA code.
Regular PGP doesn't.  When the ViaCrypt port to Macs comes out,
you'll be able to use that, though.
Now, if you mean "Can you use it without getting caught,
as long as you remember to change the Version number in your PGP 
and recompile?" - probably.  But that's not EFF's objective :-)

Sounds doable.  I'd hate to have to count how many hacks like
that I've built over the years :-)
