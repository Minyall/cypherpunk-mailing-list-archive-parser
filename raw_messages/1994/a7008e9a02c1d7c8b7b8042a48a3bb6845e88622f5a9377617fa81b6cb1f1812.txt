The Net is growing rapidly.  As it grows it will become more signifigant in our
world(transaction of digital cash, etc.)  Security will become more of a neccesi
ty(lets face it MOST people don't need encryption)  If Clipper is widely impleme
nted
(be it voluntary or forced) people will be looking over their shoulders and righ
tfully so.  Also, i feel that the structure of the Internet is likely to change(
It's present structure is not a good base to build on) when the cahnge occurs do
n't you think
Clipper is going to become the "standard."
