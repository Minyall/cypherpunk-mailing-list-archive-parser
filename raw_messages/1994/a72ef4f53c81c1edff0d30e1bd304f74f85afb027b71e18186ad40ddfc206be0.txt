   Aren't there multicast provisions at SGI? Eric?

We may be multicasting this weekend.  Far more important than my
involvement is that of our host there at SGI, Katy.  Her crew gets the
MBONE running.  There are some fiddly things with the SGI firewall,
etc., that I just don't understand.

So I'm passing the buck.  Katy?
