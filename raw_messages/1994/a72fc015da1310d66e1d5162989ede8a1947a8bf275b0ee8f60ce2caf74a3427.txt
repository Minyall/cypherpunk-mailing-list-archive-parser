AP 4/8/94: A federal grand jury indicted an MIT student Thursday on
charges he ran a computer bulletin board that allowed people to copy 
more than $1 million worth of copyrighted software for free.  [...]
   
The bulletin board, named Cynosure, allowed people on MIT's computer 
network to copy business and entertainment software, the indictment 
said.  [...]
  
Internet users also were able to illegally copy the software, Stern 
said.[..]
   
Many of the Cynosure users hid their identities by using an 
Internet address in Finland that provided an anonymous forwarding 
service for the pirated programs, according to the indictment.  

.... Like to include more but ..uh.. "fair use" and all that ....

Wonder how come he didn't encrypt?
