Just got word there's a 32-bit OS/2 version of PGP in Compu$erve's OS/2
forum library. 

I'll leave it to the PGP archiving folks to go snag it.

"In a Time/CNN poll of 1,000 Americans conducted last week by Yankelovich
Partners, two-thirds said it was more important to protect the privacy of
phone calls than to preserve the ability of police to conduct wiretaps.
When informed about the Clipper Chip, 80% said they opposed it."
