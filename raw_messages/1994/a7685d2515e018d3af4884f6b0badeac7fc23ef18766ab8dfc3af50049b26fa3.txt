   I don't know if anyone else has had this particular idea before,

Yes, lots.

   However, there should be a use for persistent store, for a remote
   encrypted database accessible anonymously.

The real questions are "how big is the market?" and "how much revenue
is there in it?".

Something like this doesn't get made reliable by volunteers.

   Ideally, the data is stored on a distributed data base, with some
   redundancy in case one or more gateways go down

Look in Schneier for secret sharing.
