The session key encoded with the unit key in the Law Enforcement Access Field
is not recoverable.  The unit key is only contained within the orignating
clipper chip, and within the two escrowed key portions.

An external key exchange in performed.  In the case of AT&T TSD 3600s the
key is negotiated between them blindly.

FIPS Pub 185 requires that clipper phones adhere to a protocol not contained
within the FIPS, and requires transmission of the LEAF.

Using a constant unit ID even if the session key is not recoverable, still
leaves you open to traffic flow analysis.  Using a LEAF from another
clipper chip still identifies you (or serves to flag interest).  It would
be a wise to assume that the adversary routinely decodes all LEAFs crossing
their purview, recovering unit IDs.  (Which would at least flag a lot of
counterfeited LEAFS, were ID ranges or (as in IP) prefixes used.)
