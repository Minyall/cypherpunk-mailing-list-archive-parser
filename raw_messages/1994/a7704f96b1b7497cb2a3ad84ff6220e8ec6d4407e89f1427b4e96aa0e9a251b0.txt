I think you missed one important condition:

  5.    Make it optional, with no strings attached. Furthermore, make the
        system designed so that the "default" option is no key escrow. In
        other words, the government would have to get permission for key
        escrow.

Condition 5 would of course not apply to government employees. Nor would it
apply to the office communication equipment inside the more "paranoid" business
associations. Of course, it would be the company, not government, who would
hold the keys, and of course the company should have the choice in deciding
whether key escrow is really necessary.

Of course, with this extra condition, key escrow seems fairly pointless. :-)
But I don't mind. It's not as if I'm exactly looking forward to it Down
Under.
