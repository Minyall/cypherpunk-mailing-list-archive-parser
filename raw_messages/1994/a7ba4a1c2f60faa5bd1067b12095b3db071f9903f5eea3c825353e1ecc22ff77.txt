I don't have an answer to your question, but you did bring up something 
I've been meaning to ask about for some time and I never really got 
around to it; Are there any short-term plans to press for an RFC 
utilizing digital signatures?  With the exponential increase of mail 
users, as well and the influx of Compu$erv, AOL, Prodigy and other users, 
some methods for the transparent use of digital signatures needs to be 
worked out before it becomes too difficult to implement change because 
the commercial services have all the power.  (or worse, before the 
government decides for us.)

Of course the question then become one of which standard to use.  PGP may 
seem great, but if there are nothing buy licencing problems and political 
backlash, maybe something else needs to be looked at.

Sorry, just a-babblin'.
