OSC has already used their modified L1011 to launch a Pegasus.  Last 
month they launched a stretch Pegasus from the plane for the first time.  
Unfortunately they are using new control software in the Pegasus and it 
did not properly take into account the difference in the Phugoid 
frequency of the stretched bird.  The result was positive feedback in the 
yaw control loop causing failure of the main wing.  A self destruct 
charge was detonated from the control facility aboard the L1011.  They 
are due to try again sometime soon.
