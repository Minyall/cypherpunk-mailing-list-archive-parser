I am well aware of how to do a binary search. I have been programming since
'76. The question I have is not how to do the search but if there is a way
to feed a RSA fake keys in such a way that I can determine the relative 
magnitude of the difference in the key, not even the exact difference.

On another note, ad hominim resoning does not impress me. If you would like
to discuss my idea that is fine. It has no relation to me personaly.
