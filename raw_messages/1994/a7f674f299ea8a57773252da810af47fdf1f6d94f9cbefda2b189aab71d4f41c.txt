I know this has been hashed over recently, but I never found out (or don't 
remember) what was decided in regards to the legal implications of a PGP 
functional DLL for Windows.  If a company (i.e. SPRY, wink, wink, nudge, 
nudge.) were to write a PGP DLL and make it publicly available, would that be 
legal?  Viacrypt just straight out charges too damn much to make it worth 
licensing.  So, if a company wants to make it's mail client PGP friendly, but 
not actually supply the encryption algoritm, etc.  Would a DLL be legal if it 
were in the public domain?
