You're missing a few qualifiers.  The benign autocrat mentioned above
is for _bootstrapping_ a workable _distribution_ of moderation.  Once
the dynamic of moderator selection is stable, this autocrat then loses
most all power to influence, since the initial distribution of
articles to moderators need not be in any particular place.

I'm not proposing that every newsgroup be moderated, even in
distributed form.  What I am proposing is a system for a distributedly
moderated newsgroup which can compete for attention with other
newsgroups and other fora.
