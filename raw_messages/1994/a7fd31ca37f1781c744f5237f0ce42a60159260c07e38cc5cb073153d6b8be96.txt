Paid for "by the government"?!!  And just where does the EFF think the  
government gets its money?  Are there any taxpayers out there who don't  
use the phone systems?  Looks like they're are going to get a big bill  
from the government in the next few years.

I can't belive the EFF is actually using this as a pro argument.  I can't  
believe the EFF is supporting the Wiretap bill.  The EFF is not getting  
any more money from me.
