I am looking for a source for Harware Random Numbers
for a PC. I would like it to be a simple plug-in, but
need it to be fast (at least 100K, preferrable 1 Meg
bytes/sec), and good (in randomness properties).

Any FAQ, pointers, adresses, phone-numbers, e-mail
addresses, etc... would be apreciated.
