Subject: creating a v2.6 of PGP for the REST of us!

If patches are going to be produced for PGP 2.3a for those of us outside the
USA who wish to send PGP encrypted data to USA users of v2.6, will the 
patches also enable a key from a patched 2.3a to be put onto a USA key-server 
that only accepts v2.6 keys - will the keys be labelled as v2.6?
 
I take it Pr0duct Cypher's patch doesn't include this?
 
Maybe instead of many people producing different patches (some of which will 
be good and some bad) a new version (labelled as v2.6euro?) should be 
released from outside the USA that is derived from 2.3a code; therefore 
producing a version that is no different in _appearance_ to MIT's v2.6. 
 
The point being that an 'ALL-NEW-SUPER-DUPER' version may attract more 
attention outside the USA than, as some may view it, 'just a pointless 
patch' would do.  Also, some ftp sites and bulletin boards outside the USA
don't like carrying software that was illegally exported.  A special non-USA 
version of 2.6 would allow everyone to be happy and compatible.
 
Wouldn't this create a unified world of compatible PGP users?
