Subject: REMAIL: Changes to chaos and bsu-cs remailers

     Today I installed an updated version of the anonymous remailer on 
the following remailers:

	nowhere@bsu-cs.bsu.edu
	remailer@chaos.bsu.edu

     Recent changes:

	"Refuse" addresses now apply to From: lines as well as To: lines
	When sending from an address that is refused, you will receive a
		bounce message (only from chaos remailer) stating that
		remailer access is denied.
	When sending to an address that is refused, you will receive a
		bounce message (only from chaos remailer) stating that
		remailer recipient is illegal.
	When you forget the recipient address, you will receive a bounce
		message (only from chaos remailer) stating that a
		recipient is required.

	Please note that all bounces will only occur when using the chaos
remailer.
