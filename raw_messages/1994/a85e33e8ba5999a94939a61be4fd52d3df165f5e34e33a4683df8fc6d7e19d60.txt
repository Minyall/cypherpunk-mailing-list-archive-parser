Well, look around you.  Examples abound.  One of the origins of this
thread was Phil Karn's observation that it's the ham radio operators
themselves who demand curtailment of other hams' freedoms.  One of the
biggest threats to freedom right now is the government takeover of
health care.  Is this being pushed by a ruling elite on a recalcitrant
population?  No!  Most of the driving force is coming from the people
themselves, each trying to get his neighbor to pay the bill.  The list
goes on and on.

Ending bad government begins with refusing to accept its ``benefits''.
Unfortunately, lots of people gratuitously accept those benefits or even
actively solicit them, oblivious of the resulting destruction of freedom.
