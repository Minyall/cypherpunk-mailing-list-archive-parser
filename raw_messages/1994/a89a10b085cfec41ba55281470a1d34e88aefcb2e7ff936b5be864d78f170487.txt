On CNN there was a poll shown in a short segment about Internet.

The question was "Do you know what Internet (AKA superhighway) is?"


32% had read or heard about Internet


68% had never read about or heard of Internet


It is unclear whether these people are computer users or whether
if they were whether they would use cryptography. One thing that
is certain is they will probly not "FTP" anywhere to get any form
of program.      !!!FREE!!! get it !!!FREE!!! before it is gone!
What is it? I don't know, but get two, they are free!!!

No free man shall ever be de-barred the use of arms. The strongest
reason for the people to retain  there right to keep and bear arms
is as a last  resort to  protect  themselves  against  tyranny  in
government. <-------- Thomas Jefferson                            --
