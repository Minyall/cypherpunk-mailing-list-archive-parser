A couple of months ago a registered threatening letter from who 
cares appeared near here about my posting a ClariNet article to 
this list.  It was ignored and after a couple of weeks returned 
itself in shame.  End of story.

Everyone knows I would never ever post copyrighted material to 
this list unless an insane over-riding out-of-control 
compulsion forced me to do so against the scientificly-rational 
self-preserving law-abiding judgment I've had rammed down my 
obedient brain since
