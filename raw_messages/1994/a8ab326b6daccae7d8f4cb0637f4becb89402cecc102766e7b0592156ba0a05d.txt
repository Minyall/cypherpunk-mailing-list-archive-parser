Hi all,

Does anyone have any hands-on experience with:

Contemporary Cryptology: The Science of Information Integrity
Gustavus J. Simmons
656pp., 1992
ISBN 0-87942-277-7

It is listed in a catalog of books carried by Omega. I was wondering if
anyone has read it (or even looked it over peripheraly for that matter)?

Thanks.
