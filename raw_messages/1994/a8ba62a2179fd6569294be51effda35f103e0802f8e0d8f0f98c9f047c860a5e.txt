   Indeed.  Then you could set your proxyserver to: 
http://localhost:4242/CHAIN:3/ ... which would connect to the local wedge 
on 4242, tell it to chain, and pass the URL to go to.  Hopefully then the 
wedge could pick another one out of a local list and connect to it, 
passing: CHAIN:2, ad infinitum.  It really does not seem to be very 
technically difficult.  Once again, it comes down to "who's willing to 
run these beasts?"
