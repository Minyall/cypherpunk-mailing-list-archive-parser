 I remember awhile back someone posted some clipper documents that
were released under FOIA as I recall. The thing that struck me was
that the NSA was refering internally to clipper as "The Trapdoor
chip." Why refer to it as such if there is no back door?

 If anyone has the documents I'm refering to handy, please repost,
(or I'll have to dig them out!)
