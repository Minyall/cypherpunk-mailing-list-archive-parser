	So, does anyone know what the record stay on comtempt charges is?

i think it was 2 years.  It was that famous case of the woman who wouldn't
disclose her daughter's wherebouts.  She kept getting slammed back until
a higher court declared it unconstitutional to do indefinitely.  However
two years is two years too long in my opinion to spend in a state pen.
