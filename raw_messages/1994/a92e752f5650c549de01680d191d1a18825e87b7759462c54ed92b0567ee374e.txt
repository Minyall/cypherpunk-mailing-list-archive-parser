There is a lesson here.

Getting the BBEDIT extensions which do PGP and the emacs mailcrypt
functions made PGP almost convenient enough for me to use it without
grumbling about the trivial message enclosed.

Isn't it time for cypherpunks-who-write-code to respond to this obvious
customer need?

I have no mailer myself but I do have a friend who produces one and I'm
helping him to incorporate PGP seamlessly.  It's taking a long time but it
should be worth it.

Anyone else out there with their own mailer?
