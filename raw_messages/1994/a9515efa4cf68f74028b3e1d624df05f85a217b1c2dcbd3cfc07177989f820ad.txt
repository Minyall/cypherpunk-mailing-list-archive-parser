Once again, what we call a modem today has gobs of bells and whistles
in firmware and hardware that a simple voice->bits->wierd-bits->anlog
and it's inverse is a whole lot simpler at many levels than today's
modems.  In fact it doesn't even require 9600 baud with CELP or VSELP
which is wonderful since overseas sessions at that speed are iffy at
best I have found.  Compare the price of a 4800 baud modem today with
what we now call "modems."

No, not cheaper, just viable.  :-)

We shall see.  I contend that with this I can establish a spoof-proof
point to point with a total stranger to any desired probability that
a spoof could not be there without disclosing him/her.  It is not hard
for me to envision, especially in business situations, how such a
thing would be more than useful.

There really is no point in arguing this until I can present it.
There are two reasons I mentioned it.  The first is that I wanted
to see if there have been any other breakthroughs in the time I 
have had this on the shelf and the second reason is private.  :-)

Yep.
