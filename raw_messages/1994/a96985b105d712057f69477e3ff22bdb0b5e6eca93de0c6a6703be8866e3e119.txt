I was just counting them, and realized:

If you knew that you were in someone's kill file, and that only those 
who were also members of that illustrious group were the kind who would 
reply in reference to those who had put them there, those banished ones 
could talk about their censors in front of everybody and the censors 
ones would never know, although everybody else would.   Secret 
expressions unconcealed.
