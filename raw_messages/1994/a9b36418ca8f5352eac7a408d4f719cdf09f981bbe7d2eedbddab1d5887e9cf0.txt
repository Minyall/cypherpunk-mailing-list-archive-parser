I disagree with Brad's interpretation.  For example, if I photocopy a 
book and anonymously snail mail it to people, do you think the postal 
service is going to take the fall?  Nope - they are just a carrier, and 
are not responsible for content.  Like the common carriers - they just 
receive a message and pass it along.  They aren't responsible for message 
content.  If Brad Templeton's view of the world was the prevailing (or 
correct) one, then every common carrier in the country, including Ma Bell 
and the US Postal Service, would not exist, because they would've been 
sued out of existence long ago.

Of course, this situation illustrates yet another interesting twist on 
the old "denial of service" attacks... I understand Brad's interest in 
making money from Clarinet's product (and I don't have a problem with him 
making money), but I think that this "scare tactic" is going a bit too 
far in protecting corporate revenue.
