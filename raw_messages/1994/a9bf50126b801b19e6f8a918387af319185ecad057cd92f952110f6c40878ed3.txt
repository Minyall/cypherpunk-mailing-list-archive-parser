Phil,

I really liked this.  Perhaps you can find a way to stitch into 
other topics like you did here.

Don't know what the list reception will be since the recent 
thread on government got thumped for disobeying the sirens of 
crypto and technology.

Hope yours will catch fire.  Fan the embers.


John
