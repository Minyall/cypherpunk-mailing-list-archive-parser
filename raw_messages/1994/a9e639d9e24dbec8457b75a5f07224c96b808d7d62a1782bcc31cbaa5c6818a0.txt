When I read the quote being discussed, it seems to say that no system
which can be contained in a surface with an appropriate area A can
have more than a finite number of states.

I don't think that volume is discussed at all, just a surface.  If you
are happy to contain the singularity in an imaginary cube with a
million light years on each side, I'm happy to call the surface the
sides of that cube.

This may seem pointless, because, as you point out, everything in the
universe can be contained in a surface (or volume).  It is not
pointless if we can imagine systems which cannot be contained in a
surface.  I'm guessing that a very large system, say everything in the
universe, might not be containable in a surface.  If the quote is
correct that would imply that the universe may not have a finite
number states.

The cryptography tie in: if the quote is correct, then any computer we
build is going to have a finite number of states which implies that
the number of computrons is theoretically limited.  And this implies
that there may be RSA keys of sufficient size that they cannot be
broken with brute force, which doesn't seem that surprising.
