Someone has just pointed out to me that the basic PKP patents (D-H
especially) expire relatively soon now (the D-H patent was issued in 1980).

Seems to me this is a strong motivation for the gov to get Clipper in place
now; three years from now all the places that won't use PGP because of legal
tangles will be able to use it free and clear!
