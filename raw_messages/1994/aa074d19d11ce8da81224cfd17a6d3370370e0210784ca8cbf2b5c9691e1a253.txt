It's my understanding that, according to international missile
treaties (probably the MTCR), missile telemetry data must be
transmitted in the clear.  This is ostensibly so that the various
world powers can be assured that a "test" missile launch really is a 
test and is not going to wipe out someone's capital.  It's also so
that various intelligence agencies can have accurate estimates of
everyone's capabilities.  This knowledge is widely viewed as
stabilising.
