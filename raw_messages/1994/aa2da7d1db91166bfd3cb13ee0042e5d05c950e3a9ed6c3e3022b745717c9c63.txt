Yes, it does!  You can find the public key for this remailer at the
gopher site (gopher chaos.bsu.edu in "Anonymous Mail"/"Public Keys").
Argh, I've fallen a bit behind and may not have upload the latest
stuff to the soda.berkeley.edu.  I'll do that soon.

Yes, I think it is.  I got it to work a few times recently, but very
erratically.  Just a few days ago there was a message sent to the list
by the admin of linet.org saying entropy hadn't polled in quite a
while... so I guess it is down.
