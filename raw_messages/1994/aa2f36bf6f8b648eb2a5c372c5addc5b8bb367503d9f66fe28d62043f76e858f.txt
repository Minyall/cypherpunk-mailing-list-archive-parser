Well, I guess this is about as mainstream as the issue can get. In today's
paper, the comic strip "On the Fast Track" is about the clipper chip. It
suggests that we need a way to spy on government in return (other than by
bribery).
To say that I was surprised to see a clipper statement in the 'toons would
be an understatement. Looks like our campaign to inform the public is
paying off.
