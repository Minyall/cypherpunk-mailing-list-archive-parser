Robin Williams once made the interesting observation that, if you were
convicted of sodomy in Georgia, the punishment you were likely to receive
consisted of being locked in a cell with somebody who would sodomize you.

I'm starting to wonder whether we're liable to see laws passed punishing
practioners of sadomasochism with flogging...
