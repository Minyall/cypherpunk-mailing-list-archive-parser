Hi,

THere was a wire service report over the weekend that
the Clinton Administration, is moving to prevent any doc-
ments, etc. created by the NSC (National Security Council)
from being subject to FOIA. I wonder, vis-a-vis, Glimore's
FOIA for Escrow keysd, if they will move to make NSC
a Key holder.

Anyway, i thought it was worth mentioning.
