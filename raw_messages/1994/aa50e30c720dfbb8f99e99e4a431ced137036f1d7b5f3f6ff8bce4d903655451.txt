I had a fun idea.  Imagine getting enough information together to
spoof clipper transmissions?  The idea being to disguise other types
of secure transmissions as clipper ones. 

What would be needed would the escrow encryption identifer, a bunch of
damaged LEAF/IV assemblies and a transmission channel that wouldn't
be easily distinguishable from data portions of a clipper transmission.
You start the channel up prepending one of a large number of spoofed
LEAF/IV assemblies.  

With enough of these traversing the ether, the chaff/wheat noise ratio
goes down to where having a source identifier (ID in the LEAF) gets
real hit or miss - to where it loses traffic analysis value.  Sort of
growing weeds intentionally on the information superhighway.
