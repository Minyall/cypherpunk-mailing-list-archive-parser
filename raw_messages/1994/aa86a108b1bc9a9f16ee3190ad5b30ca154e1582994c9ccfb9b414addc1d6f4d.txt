Children are "cured" of their parents' ideas all the time. I've
known lots of kids who grew up in restrictive settings where
their access to forbidden ideas was tightly controlled.  After
four years at college away from parental influence, they were
magically transformed into happy free-thinking sensible people.

If it's impossible, then why does such outrage manifest itself
when it is suggested that it shouldn't be done?  Something is
fishy here.

There's always one loony toon who wants to screen all five
volumes of "Faces of Death" for his son's kindergarten class. :)

Teaching kids is sort of like feeding them.  In general, we let
the parents make the day to day decisions.  But we also let
experts research what things are toxic and hold parents
accountable if they insist upon feeding the kid lemon scented
furniture polish.  Both approaches are needed.

This is a trick question, right?  Caring counts for zip.  The
road to Hell is paved with good parental intentions.  Suppose the
fundamentalist father wants to beat his six year old son with a
belt everytime he touches himself to save him from Satan's
influence?  A little bureaucratic input from a child welfare
professional might not be a bad idea in such a case.
