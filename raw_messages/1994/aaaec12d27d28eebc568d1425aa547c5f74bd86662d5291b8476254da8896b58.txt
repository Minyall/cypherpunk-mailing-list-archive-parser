Bearer bonds are not illegal in the US.  The interest paid on bearer bonds
issued after a certain date is not deductible from taxes but the bonds are
legal.  Additionally, depending on specifics, financial institutions may
have to report sales and purchases including tax ID # on some transactions
involving bonds.

A bond is just a debt obligation.  If you want proof that bearer
instruments are legal, endorse a check made payable to you - you have just
converted it into a bearer instrument (as long as you add no restrictions
to your endorsment).  You will not be busted if the government finds out
you signed the back of a check.
