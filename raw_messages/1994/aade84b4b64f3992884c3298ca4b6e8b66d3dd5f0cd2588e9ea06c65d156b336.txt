Okay, I've printed my first set of bumper stickers, using the W&M bumper 
sticker stock for laser printers.  It prints out *great*, and the 
"removeable" adhesive seems to have enough holding power to keep in on a 
car, but not so much as to become a permanent fixture (anyone seen a Bush in 
'92 bumper sticker of late? :-).
I guess I'll find out this winter how well the SlapSticks withstand wind, 
rain, etc. here in north Texas...
