Fellow Cypherpunks,

Please gently correct my misinterpretation of the White House
press release.  I read it to state that commercial encryption
must embody key escrow, even if it's not Clipper.

Does this mean we must turn over our one-time pads and our
PGP private keys to a government agency?  I don't like this.
Not one bit.

Perhaps the CPSR request for votes should have read, "I oppose
key escrow," not just "I oppose Clipper."
