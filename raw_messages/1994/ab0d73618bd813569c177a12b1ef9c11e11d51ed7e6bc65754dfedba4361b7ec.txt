I might take this opportunity to tell you all how wonderful Trondheim is 
in the summer, but of course I won't do that :-)  (Well, for those who 
*must* know -- the weather *might* be nice and the beer is certainly 
expensive.)

I'm sharing my office with Knut who is busily answering queries about 
ISIT.  He was quite excited when his mail propragated to the cypherpunks 
list :-)
