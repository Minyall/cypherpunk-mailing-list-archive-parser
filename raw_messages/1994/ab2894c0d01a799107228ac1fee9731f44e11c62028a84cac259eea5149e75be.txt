...They have plenty of money, and EXTREMELY smart people. ........ 
That, and the concrete evidence that they are probably twenty years 
ahead of us, leads me to believe that it is
stupid to underestimate them.

They sure make some BIG mistakes, though, don't they?
And they didn't cover up the Clipper mistakes very well at all.
And they're not seeing the economical relationships regarding exports 
very well.
Do you suppose that maybe this is intentional?
