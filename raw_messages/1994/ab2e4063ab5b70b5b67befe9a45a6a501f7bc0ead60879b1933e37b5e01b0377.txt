BOSTON, MASS., U.S.A., 1994 AUG 11 (NB) -- ZiffNet, the online  
service of Ziff-Davis Publishing Co., will host a week-long  
debate on computer private issues, beginning August 15.

Ziff spokeswoman Lisa Landa told Newsbytes the panelists will  
include: James Fallows, Washington editor of the Atlantic 
Monthly; Jim Bidzos of the encryption firm RSA; Doug Miller of  
the Software Publishers Association; and Rebecca Gould of the  
Business Software Alliance. Sam Whitmore, editorial director of 
 PC Week, will host the event.

Much of the electronic discussion will be about encryption,  
given the attention this subject has been getting. There is  
also likely to be a discussion of the Clinton administration  
electronic wiretap bill and the links between encryption,  
privacy and the information highway. "For the successful  
implementation of a global information infrastructure, these  
issues will need to be debated and, ultimately, resolved," said 
 BSA's Gould.
