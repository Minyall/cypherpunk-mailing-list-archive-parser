No, but (Cliche Alert) the road to key escrow is paved with good
intentions. IMHO the developers who might actually be working on
implementations of this scheme either
	a) don't know that it _could easily_ "become part of
	   a nationally-mandated open avenue to spying,"
	b) know but don't think such developments are likely, or
	c) know and don't care.

Clearly education is a powerful antidote to cases a) and b)
