Rumor has it that certain government applications do Diffie Hellman
with 2K-bit moduli. Given the apparent connections between factoring
and discrete logarithm (the complexity formulas seem to look very much
alike), it appears that at least one user feels that keys longer than
1K bits provide a desirable safety margin.
