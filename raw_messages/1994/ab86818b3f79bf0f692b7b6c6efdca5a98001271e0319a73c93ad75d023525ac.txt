Recently I watched Monty Python and the Holy Grail again for the Nth
time. At the very end of the movie, as the police arrest King Arthur
and Sir Bedevere and break up the attack against the French castle,
one of the officers accosts a knight. Grabbing the knight's shield,
the officer says "Hey, that's an offensive weapon, that is!"

I'd say that pretty much sums up the government's attitude toward
cryptography, doesn't it? :-)
