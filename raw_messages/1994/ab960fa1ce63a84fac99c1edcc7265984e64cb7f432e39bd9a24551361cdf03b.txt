Good afternoon.

Having just percipitated an accidental thread on rockets, I'm not one to
talk, really. That's never really stopped me before, of course...

However, if someone could tell me a direct relationship between strong
crypto and parental values, control of one's offspring, evangelical
christianity, and other inherent Rights of Mankind(tm), I would greatly
appreciate it...

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
