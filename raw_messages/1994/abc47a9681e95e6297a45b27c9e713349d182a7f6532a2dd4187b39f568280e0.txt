This is quite accurate.  Howard Zinn makes the same point in
_Declarations of Independence_.  He describes an incident during the
'60s when a group of black civil rights demonstrators approached him
and asked if they would be within their legal rights conducting a
demonstration on a public street.  Zinn responded that they would be,
but that their legal rights were irrelevant; the police would arrest
them anyway.  After citing a number of such examples, he concludes
that law is made not by legislators and judges, but by the policman's
club.
