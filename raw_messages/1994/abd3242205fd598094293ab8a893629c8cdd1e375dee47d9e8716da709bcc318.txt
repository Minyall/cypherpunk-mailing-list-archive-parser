Silicon Valley, CA- Intel Corporation announced today their plans to
exchange up to several million defective Pentium microprocessors. The
chips, widely used in personal computers, have a flaw which causes them to
make calculating errors. Although the problem affects only certain types
of applications, Pentium owners have demanded a recall.
     Asked what the company intended to do with the returned chips, a
high-ranking Intel official, speaking on condition of anonymity, would say
only, "let's just say we found a good home for them."

On an unrelated note, the National Security Agency today announced plans
for a major expansion of their Fort Meade headquarters...
