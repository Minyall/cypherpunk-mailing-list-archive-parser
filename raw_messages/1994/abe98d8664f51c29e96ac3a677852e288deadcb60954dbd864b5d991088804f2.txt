In a fusion, or H Bomb, the tritium (which is just hydrogen with an
extra two neutrons) is that which produces the boom -- the main fuel,
as it were. Its a "neutron source" only in the weakest possible sense
-- the same way dynamite might be considered to need nitroglycerine as
a "neutron source". (I'm not sure that people outside of the bomb
building industry really know *for sure* what the geometries used in
the atomic weapon that sets off the fusion reaction.)
