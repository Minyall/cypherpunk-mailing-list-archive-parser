I was thinking that Robert meant something like getting a usenet feed
via mail.

Speaking of which, are there any sort of "public", or "free" NNTP
servers?  Or even "cheep"?  Even just read-only?  I'm afraid of losing
my full feed along with my account when I finish my masters.  I don't
want to go for a PhD just so I can keep browsing the alt groups.
