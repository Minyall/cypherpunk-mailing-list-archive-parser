Excuse me? Will the cyberspace Waco abuse children with paddles in basement
'punishment rooms' - maybe by posting their names to alt.basement.punishment?
Will the cyberspace Waco be able to _physically_ intimidate people into acting
against their will?

The major difference between cyberspace and the world of brick houses is that
no _physical_ crime is possible - no matter what anti-porn kooks say, you 
_can't_ rape with words; or murder, or torture or kidnap. Even the pedophiles
(98.3356% of the Net's population, apparently) cannot go beyond _communication_
on the Net... Even if one agrees with the debatable criminality of consensual
sex with minors, the act itself has to be _physical_! The crime cannot be in
discussing it. What's the FBI going to do? Jail people for _talking_ about
murder, or jail _murderers_?
