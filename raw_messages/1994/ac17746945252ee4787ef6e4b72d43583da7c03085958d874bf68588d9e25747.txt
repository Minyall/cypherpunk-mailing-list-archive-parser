	Hal describes a nice scheme. (I only skimmed it so maybe I missed
something.) I have written such a aystsem and it is running. I can't
publicly advertise it due to restrictions on my net connection, but
hopefully by this summer I will have a net connection which I own so I will
be able to run it publically. Check out
