I don't think the idea proposed is to reverse-engineer the Clipper.
Rather, the idea is that once you know the pin-out you can make an
electrically-compatible (and, in important ways, software-compatible)
replacement.  You'd then have a phone that does IDEA encryption
instead of Skipjack, and presumably the non-crypto parts of the phone
wouldn't know and wouldn't care.
