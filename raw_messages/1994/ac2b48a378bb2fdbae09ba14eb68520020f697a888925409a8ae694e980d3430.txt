If this hadn't been made clear already, then hopefully this will:

	Our intention is to support any development effort attempting
	to implement an SSL conformant implementation. We will work with
	you to repair the spec as needed to eliminate any errors or
	ommisions, and help you test your implementation to ensure that
	it interoperates with ours.

I'm really sorry that this is how we are currently being perceived. It was
never our intention. Rather, we wished to do those things that we believed were
necessary to allow commerce on the Internet. We are a small company with
limited resources and limited time to market. After talking with prospective
customers we came up with a plan and implemented it. We are sorry if somebody's
toes were stepped on in the process.

We believe that we were up to date with respect to what was going on in the
internet community at large when the company was started. Somebody should feel
relieved that approach matches where the internet seems to be heading -
security at the transport levels.

Our imperfect examination of the work in progress yielded nothing that would
meet our needs and our timelyness. I'm sorry if our selection criteria don't
meet yours.

In any case, the cat is out of the bag, and we are where we are.
