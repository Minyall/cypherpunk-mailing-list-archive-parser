	I managed to get swipe into the kernel here at
infinity.c2.org-- If any sites would like to install swipe on their
systems and setup encrypted channels between our sites, and then do
some experimentation with it, maybe some development (I don't really
have time to develop stuff.. but..), please mail me.
