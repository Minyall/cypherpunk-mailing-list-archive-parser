    I accept the terms of the 4th ammendment [sic]: search and siezure
    allowed when due process followed.

The 4th amendment:
       The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,
    papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,
    shall not be violated; and no warrants shall issue, but upon
    probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and
    particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons
    or things to be seized.

One problem with what you've said is that the fourth amendment is not
phrased in the sense in which you refer to it.  Specifically, it
proscribes unreasonable searches and seizures.  It does not require
the people to actively facilitate the government in `reasonable'
searches and seizures.  Essentially, you've turned the 4th amendment
on its head in your effort to rationalize key escrow.

In any case, it's a purely academic question given the dissociation of
the `Bill of Rights' from reality.
