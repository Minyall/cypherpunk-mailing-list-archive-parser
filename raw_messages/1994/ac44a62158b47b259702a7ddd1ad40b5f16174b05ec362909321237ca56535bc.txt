-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Has anyone here been able to get the PGP 2.6.1 makefile to work for DJGPP?  
So far
I will probably have to rewrite it...  Also
are there any special settings for 32-bit compiles in the RSAREF code?  I 
have not found any
but I may just be going blind.

Thanks!
