I agree. But we need to have a meeting, not a virtual reality.

MOOs are a really interesting social experiment, but I prefer to live
in the real world. IRC is a simple, straightforward everyday tool that
doesn't get in your way and doesn't try to impose some internal fake
universe on you.

Sure. And my notebok PC is much more unreliable than my Sun. It's keyboard
keeps going dead. So we should all abandon PC:s and switch to Suns ;-)
