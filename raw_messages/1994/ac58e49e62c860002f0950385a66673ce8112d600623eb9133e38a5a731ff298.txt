Identd is pathetic, but may help with finding who did it.
(Also, a good look at the mail headers will help too.)

If the mail was a forgery on the local site, a check in the mail
logs will do, as sendmail is not accessed when mailing from
user@localhost to anotheruser@localhost.

Enough of the "FAA's... the info that everyone knows, or should.".

Other than using PGP or PEM, or writing a new RFC for mail, is there
any other way to verify that a message is authentic that I missed?
