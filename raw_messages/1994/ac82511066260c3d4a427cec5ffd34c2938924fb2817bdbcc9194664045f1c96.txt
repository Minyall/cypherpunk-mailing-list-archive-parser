I think that sending many copies of the same message sounds like a good
way of making sure that it ends up being monitored by some 
alleged surveillance net.  Sending dummy messages is another matter. 

A fivefold increase in traffic may or may not have an impact on analysis, 
depending on your assumptions about the adversary's capabilities.  Anyway,
you still have a message of fixed size going in one end, coming out the 
other, and landing in someone's mailbox.  The superfluous messages may in 
fact be easy to identify if they are addressed to bit.bucket@dev.null.
