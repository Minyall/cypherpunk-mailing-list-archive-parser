Health insurance reform

1) Dissallow preexisting clauses and limits in medical policies

2) Pool no hope cases (AIDS, Cancer etc.) in underwriter pool
covered by all insurance companies. 

3) Shit? no more medical insurance problems.

4) Oh yea, set maximum rates and make them uniform for all
insureds.

5) Use public assistance for the remainder of people that fall in
the assistance level due to income.
