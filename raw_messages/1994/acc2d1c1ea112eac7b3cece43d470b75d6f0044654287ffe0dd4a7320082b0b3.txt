I am *NOT* talking about factoring anything. Perhaps this is why you 
are having a problem understanding what I am asking. I don't care what
the original key is, simply am I above it or below it. I don't see this
as a 1 to 1 with factoring large digit numbers.

I am less than convinced by this line of reasoning, if somebody has looked
at it why is there no mention in the texts on number theory or crypto that
I have access to? I am no expert and have not read all the texts in their
entirety, too busy building rockets and working on my own internet feed,
which is why I asked if anyone could point me to some prior work. I myself
find it hard to believe that such could be possible but one thing is certain
about life, it isn't.

Take care...
