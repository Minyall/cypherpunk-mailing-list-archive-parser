Bravo.  Good article.  Except:

	"What will they do when people start encrypting messages to each
other?" suggests that this isn't happening.

	I've been routinely encrypting e-mail since 1981 -- including
overseas traffic.

Still -- good article.  Thanks.

P.S. We need to establish that publishing an article on an FTP server or
via an e-mail newsletter is, in fact, publication according to the first
amendment.  This may be the wrong case to establish that precedent but it
needs to be established.
