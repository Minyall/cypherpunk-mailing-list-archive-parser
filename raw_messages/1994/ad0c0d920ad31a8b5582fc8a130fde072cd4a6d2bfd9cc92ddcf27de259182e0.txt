Does anyone know of any legal problems with a party asserting that
they have a notarized photocopy of certain id, representing that a
third party is who they say they are?  If I take someone's money, get
a notarized copy of their id, and sign their PGP key, can I be sued?
Obviously, I don't trust any non-lawyers to answer this question, but
does anyone know of an encryption-aware lawyer to whom I could pay
money for an opinion?
