I would be intersted in technical details of these for several machenes.  
I am interested in going around them.  Code for these programs  would be 
appreciated.

One really good way is to display the alphabet on the termanal, with 
mixed up character corispondence, done as a one-time pad.

You then enter the char from the display and a spy would need to see your 
screen, and your keystroke record, and match them up.
