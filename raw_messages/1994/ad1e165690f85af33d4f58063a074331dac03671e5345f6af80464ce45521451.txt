I think that sometime last night around 3am or so the mailer on io.com
began to send copies of some of Doug Barnes's mail (cman@io.com) to the
info@io.com address which then sent an auto-reply to the original sender.
I thought I fixed it before I finally went to sleep but apparently missed
something...  Sorry.
