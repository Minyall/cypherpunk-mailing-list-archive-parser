Subject: Nate's Remailer... slight problem
Message-ID: <199403170921.BAA03261@mail.netcom.com>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain



It appears that Netcom does not have the latest version of perl
(4.0 rev 36), so some of the pattern patching code does not
return theproper value... for instance, if I can find a string like
"hello there" with 4.0r36, in the version that netcom has, I only
get "hello"

So, basically, the name displayed for my remailer is "Jed's" and it 
should actually be "Jed's Anonymous Remailer Emporium and Tanning Salon"

This should not affect any of the functioning of the remailer, but it
does affect the cosmetics.  I am talking with netcom to see when they are
going to upgrade...
