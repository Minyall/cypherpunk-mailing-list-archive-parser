When the CIA wanted to deliver some packages during the Viet Nam war,
they set up their own air line, Air America.

If they wanted to send encrypted traffic through a 'civilian' system, I
would suppose that they would do the same sort of thing.

Did you know that Sprint has set up a Global SprintLink service, with
offices opening up in London, Paris, and Tokyo, and that Sprint already
handles a large chunk of the traffic to the former Soviet Union?  They
have a direct link from Falls Church (you know, next to Langley) VA to
Moscow.
