What, IMHO, are the top 5 most important things the cypherpunks should be  
concentrating on?  No doubt everyone else has their own ideas of what the  
"cypherpunks top 5" (or top 10) is, so please tell us your suggestions.

1.  anonymous http proxy servers ("re-webbers")
2.  PGP compatible crypto library
3.  reply-able remailers that are secure and easier for the recipient
4.  better remailer security (dc-nets)
5.  socket-based keyserver interface for real-time automagic key
    fetches

<btw, this is a top 5 rather than a top 10 because I couldn't think of 10  
good things to concentrate on when I wrote this>
