Why don't we just outlaw curtains and window blinds?  That way, law 
enforcement officials could just drive down the street looking into 
windows!  It would make it *much* easier for them to tell if crime was
being committed.  Of course, some people might not like the loss of 
privacy but the civil libertarians are making too much of this anyway. 
Besides, law abiding citizens should have nothing to hide, right?  So 
why should they object? 

Oh, e-mail is differnt altogether?  So.  When did you start mailing all 
your letters in clear envelopes?
