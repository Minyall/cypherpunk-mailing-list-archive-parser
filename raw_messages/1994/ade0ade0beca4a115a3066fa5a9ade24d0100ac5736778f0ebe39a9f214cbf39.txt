	Are we thinking of the same A-10? Tank-killer? The one that
houses a multi-barrel gun the size of a small car, and fires shells
which could pass for milk bottles in a dark room? I've seen an F-16, and
i don't think it could carry the chain gun off an A-10 - or have i
missed the point somewhere?
