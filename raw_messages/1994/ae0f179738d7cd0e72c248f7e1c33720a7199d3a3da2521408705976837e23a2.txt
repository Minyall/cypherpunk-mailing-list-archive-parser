Howdy fellow 'punks-
	A friend of mine thinks his girlfriend has been cheating on him, and 
thinks the proof may be in a few Norton Encrypt files. Is there anyway to get
the password with a data/resource editor, or is he shit-out-of-luck and looking
for a new girl-friend?

Please reply via private mail, since I had to leave the list for my christmas 
break.
