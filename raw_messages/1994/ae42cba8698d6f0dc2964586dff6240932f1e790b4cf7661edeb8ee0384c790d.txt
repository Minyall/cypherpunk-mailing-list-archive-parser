I think the point is that people should take some time to think
about what they say.  By forcing them to sign their message,
it will take an extra few seconds so they will consider what they
are saying.

As for privacy, who's to say that I can't generate a random PGP key
with a random UserID and use that to sign the message.  I don't thin
the idea was to keep a "who can send to this list" keyring on
toad.com (Eric: correct me if my interpretation is incorrect).
