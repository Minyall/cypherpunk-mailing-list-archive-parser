Matthew Ghio,
	You've done a great job in the past and continue to do so, but for
the past week some (all?) of your users have not been getting any mail.
	What happened?  Post to cypherpunks, remailer-operators, alt.privacy
or alt.anonymous.messages, alt.abuse.recovery (either one. You choose).

Thanks.



END
