...and, to mail to an anon.penet.fi address, you must change the an1234 to
na1234 (not anonymous), for I have a password/anon.penet.fi address for
this account but I don't wish to either 1) give it out so anyone could then
change it, or 2) have Julf remove it, so anyone could remail to anon.penet.fi
but a few could also forge mail from qwerty to set a password.
