All the evidence is that it was an accident. You contend, without
evidence or even a rational reason, that they did it intentionally.

I'm not a conspiracy theorist. I operate on evidence and the
assumption that people behave in their self interest. NSA had nothing
to gain by sabotaging their own efforts in this manner. Even if they
had another back door it is worth their while to make the public back
door as good as possible. The notion that they would have done it
badly intentionally for no reason when doing it well would be easy is
at the very least without evidence or even rational suspicion.

What would they possibly have to gain via such an act?

They may be able redesign the system before widespread deployment.
Its also in their interest to play mistakes down. How do YOU know they
aren't really embarassed?
