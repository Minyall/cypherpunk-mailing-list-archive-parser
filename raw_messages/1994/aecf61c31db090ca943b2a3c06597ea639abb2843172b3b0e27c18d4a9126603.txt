If the govt and all its agencies used Clipper for all their communications,
they would be vulnerable to attack from foreign govts that have bought the
keys from spys.  Despite being in escrow, I can't imagine they are really
as secure as everyone seems to think.  If random govt agencies can get the
keys for legal wiretaps, spys will also be able to do so.

Does Clinton have the right to listen in on NSA communication?  If he tried
he might find that they aren't using Clipper internally (or that they keys
aren't in the proper escrow locations).
