I'm working on a system that indexes,marks up, and serves up html versions
of E-Mail lists. It's still very alpha stuff. cypherpunks is in the
tryal part of system I call the Biblotech. All URL's that come through
the system are also indexed...


It's not tiny stuff Sybase, Verity search engine etc are all involved.

Would anyone be against me doing such a thing? alowing anyone to 
view the c-punks list via html etc...
