True.

Less true; there are multiple proposals, but none of them meet my
internal standards on what is needed :-)

I would partially agree. We do have some actual real world experience
with one key management and authentication system -- Kerberos. Its not
sufficient, but it does provide a lot of interesting lessons. In
particular, it has a distinct advantage over most the the currently
proposed key management systems in the IETF: it is actually possible
to write secure applications with Kerberos. (This is not as bad as it
sounds; there are still ways to use the proposed key management
systems (for setting up encrypted tunnels as an example) but these
uses are more limited.)

Actually, swIPe the implementation has been ported to three systems
(largely berkeley clones) and is being actively sold as part of the
TIS firewall product. However, its future with its current packet
format is obviously limited. swIPe the packet format is quite dead,
but swIPe the implementation will probably be hacked to support the
IPSP protocol, whatever it ends up being in the end.

Quite true.
