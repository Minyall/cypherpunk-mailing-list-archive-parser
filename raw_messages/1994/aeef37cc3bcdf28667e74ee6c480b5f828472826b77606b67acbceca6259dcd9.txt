Whoa!  Since when is the state your landlord?  Wait a second, when the
settlers moved out west, didn't they own the land they claimed, or did the
state reserve the right to reclaim it from them?

(I know that they can take away whatever they want from you, by force or
otherwise, but where is it written that they explicitly have the right to
invade your property without a warrant?)
