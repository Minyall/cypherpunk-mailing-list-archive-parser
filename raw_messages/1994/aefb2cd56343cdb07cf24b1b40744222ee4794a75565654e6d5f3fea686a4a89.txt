   Does the idea of having the list software check signatures strike
   anybody else as a Bad Idea?  

You mean, like the proposer (me)?

I think it _would_ be a bad idea to have the server check all
signatures, and I said so last night.  That's why I only plan on doing
syntactic checks.

Steve Witham understands this.  Steve, didn't you used to fake all of
your sigs, from the last time this got discussed?
