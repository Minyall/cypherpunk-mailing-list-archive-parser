ENR, a construction magazine, reports July 25 on the Davidian 
site cleanup at Waco:

Quote:

As the crew sifts through debris, workers are finding human 
remains.  "Mostly we've found childrens' bones," says Fawn.   . 
. .  "These are the things that mess with my mind."

The project manager adds that he has trouble finding workers 
for the job.  "They are scared of the bones."

Only 47 bodies have been identified of the 80 or more victims.

End quote.



The LEAs endlessly search for easy targets.
