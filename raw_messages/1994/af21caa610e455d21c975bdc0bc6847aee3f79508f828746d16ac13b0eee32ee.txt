The "1984" T-shirt was suggested by one of the NSA reps at the CFP 
conference.  I started puting one togethor.  Several of my friends at CFP 
were interested in the design.  I thought that on the back I might make a 
list of government policies which are eroding civil rights.

I'll make a GIF available if anyone is interested.
