Could someone please explain what is a "Chaum style blind signature" and
how it can be used? I looked in all the FAQs on rtfm.mit.edu and could not
find anything about this.

Any help appreciated, --JYL

P.S. I've seen the term used in a document claiming these can be used for
     untraceable e-cash
