Uh, I don't see that IPSP provides any automatic immunity to traffic
analysis. It does make certain kinds of fine-grained traffic analysis
a little more difficult. E.g., you can't tell what upper level
protocols are in use, and if you share a single SAID between each host
pair you can't tell which or how many users are sharing the path. But
you can still tell that the hosts are communicating.

If you use IPSP in the IS-IS tunnel mode, you could help protect the
identities of the end systems on each end, but again you can't hide
the fact that the ISes are talking.

Something like IPSP *could* serve as the basis of an anonymous
forwarding IP network analogous to the existing anonymous remailers,
but this would take a lot more work. And you could generate bogus
filler traffic between a pair of IPSP hosts to help cover the real
traffic between them.
