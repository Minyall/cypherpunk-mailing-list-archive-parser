There is stuff to be had.  Look on the ftp sites (especially ripem.
msu.edu).

crypt200 by John K. Taber helps solve transposition and substitution
ciphers.

Again, lots of statistics gathering software in the crypt directories
lying around the internet.

I have examined a couple of these software packages and found some
of them very powerful.  However, all I have seen are interactive.
I want a pipe (ciphertext in; plaintext out).  This is completely
feasible for large classes of substitution/transposition ciphers.

I have ideas and _some_ code.

Some of the concepts to look for include isomorphisms and cross
reduction.

Good luck!

Cort.
