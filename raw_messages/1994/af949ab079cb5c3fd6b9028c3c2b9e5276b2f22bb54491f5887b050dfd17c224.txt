People are using anonymity in a different way than has practical value
within cyberspace. Anonymity usually means that you can not match a
physical realm person to a cyberspatial private key. But that doesn't
mean you don't know anything about the entity. The skills of an entity
without any reputation capital are absolutely worthless. But usually an 
anonymous entity will come around brandishing all sorts of certifications 
(reputation capital).

So, as it is usually used, anonymity does not mean zero knowledge. It
means you lack knowledge that would enable you to match the key to the
physical realm person it corresponds to. With this in mind, the
coexistence of the aforementioned attributes ceases to be problematic.
