In the case of a forged drawer's signature (forged signature of the 
account holder) on a check, the bank that pays on the forgery is liable.  
This is because in theory a check is an order to your bank to pay on your 
order and a forgery is not a valid order from you.

If a check is paid based on a forged *endorsement* on the other hand, the 
transaction can be walked back until the person who first accepted the 
forged endorsement is stuck with the loss.  This is because everyone in 
the endorsement chain has a claim that is based on the validity of prior 
endorsements.

"true" answers about you that give no useful information.
