I just looked on news.mit.edu and bloom-beacon.mit.edu (the MIT
news-transport machine), and I found both alt.anonymous and
alt.anonymous.messages, so I don't think saying "MIT doesn't get
alt.anonymous" is at all correct.

It may be correct to say that "GNU.AI.MIT.EDU doesn't get
alt.anonymous", but GNU is _NOT_ MIT!
