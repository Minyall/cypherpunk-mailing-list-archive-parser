I have no idea about these "auto-signing services." My inclination
would be not to use them, as I rarely engage in "workarounds" to deal
with situations where speed bumps have been placed in my way.

If it's just a few minutes delay, who cares? If it's a few hours, I'll
likely bombard the list with "Has anybody seen the message I posted?"
messages. (There is no rule against this, so I expect to do this.)

If my messages are delayed by many hours or days, then it is the same
as if they been rejected...participation in threads is ended. (I think
Jamie Lawrence made similar points, when he/she (I forget which)) made
the point about minutes-hours-days being a tough issue.)

I haven't said I plan to leave the list. I've said that if my posts
are blocked/bounced/rejected, I would likely choose not to remain.

(Reference to "I am still considering the "sign-or-delay" proposal for
the toad.com server, that is, sign your articles to the list or
they'll be delayed and eventually rejected." [Eric Hughes, 1994-11-28])

I will register a note of purely personal frustration that many have
framed the current debate in terms of "Eric's list" and "If Eric wants
to do it this way, then this is how it should be done," etc.

I have no animosity toward Eric, but think this is a misguided
rewriting of history.
