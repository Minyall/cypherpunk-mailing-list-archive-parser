What about MediaMOO
(MIT MediaLab)
Storm the temple!

I'll be happy to talk with the janitors to ensure they can handle all the 
guest accounts simultaneously and set up a suitable environment
(there is a virtual auditorium which is set-up to handle a large 
gathering and there is precedent for this type of meeting).
Can anyone give me an idea of how many people were on for the last meeting?
