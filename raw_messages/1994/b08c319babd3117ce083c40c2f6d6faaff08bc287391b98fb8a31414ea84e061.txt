Well, I have never been assigned a penet id -- not now and not earlier.  
(I've only been on this account for almost a year, and my memory isn't 
*that* bad.)  This probably rules out the "who cypherpunks" attack.  But 
then I haven't posted much to this group -- perhaps, whoever he/she is, 
is more interested in frequent/recent posters?

-- Rolf  (who is wondering if this post will result in a penet id...)
