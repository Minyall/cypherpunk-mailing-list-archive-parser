Well, OTP gives you this.  Probabilistic encryption does too, I
think (the original version -- not the practical version).  Quantum
cryptography is pretty close, depending on how much trust you place
in the laws of physics.  Granted, none of these are very useful.

The question is, 100% objective certainty of *what*?  If breaking a
scheme were provably exponential-time, that'd be enough for me.
