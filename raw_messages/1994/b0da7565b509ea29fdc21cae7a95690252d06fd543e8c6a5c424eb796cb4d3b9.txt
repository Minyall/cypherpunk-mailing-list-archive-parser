: Ideally, you want to pick up your crypto-phone, initiate a call to

The physical key exchange can be done by Diffie-Helman, but as you note it
can be man-in-the-middled.  I think what the STU sets do is to print the 
other guy's keyprint that was actually used on an LCD on the phone, and you
read it back out to each other in voice mode.  Of course, that can be
m-i-t-m'd too but it's a damn sight harder...
