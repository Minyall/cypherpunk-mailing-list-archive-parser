You claim we haven't done anything and Netscape has.

ftp.csua.berkeley.edu has the swIPe code sitting right on it.

Its being deployed by TIS in their new firewall products, and is being
used by others. I could have conducted the full PR campaign to get
people using it, but have chosen not to because I don't want to have
to later sell them on an (incompatible) IPSP packet format (which is
superior). I'm already working on hacking swIPe into IPSP.

Netscape looks foolish because they don't bother to look at other
people's work. I won't comment on you.
