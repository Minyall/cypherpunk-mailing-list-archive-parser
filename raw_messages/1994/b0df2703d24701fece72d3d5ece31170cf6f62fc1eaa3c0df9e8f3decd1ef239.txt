With some experimentation, it is possible to have partially anonymous
channels (all messges to/from the channel can appear as a singular name)
but all inter-server messages must retain full identity which is a loss.

Also, commands such as "/who #channel" and "/names #channel" currently
return full info...and "/whois" will show you being on it...these can
be changed, easily enough, but to have text traverse server-server with
no id. would not work if you desired /kick and /mode.  I'll work on
fixing these three commands tonight.

I might add, that this seriously screws with the most common (ircII)
client and any others which keep their own private channel membership
lists because the same person always enters and leaves >:-)

Do cypherpunks believe this kind of anonymity is of any use ?
