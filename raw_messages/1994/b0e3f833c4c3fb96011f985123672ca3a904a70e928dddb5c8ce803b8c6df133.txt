Remember, however, that advances in technology benefit encryptors as
well as codebreakers.  Unless the "bright person" comes along and
proves P == NP, there's still opportunity to develop strong
cryptosystems.  (Indeed, if a bright person comes along and proves
that P != NP, then things look pretty good.)
