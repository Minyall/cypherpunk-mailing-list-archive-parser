	My use of the word interception was deliberate.  Before
1986 it was not illegal to intercept, just to divulge or use for
benefit or gain.   And, in fact, this 1934 law was essentially never enforced
and certainly never enforced against government interceptions for
intelligence purposes.    Also it only concerned radio, whereas the
loophole for digital data in the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets
act including wiretapping.
