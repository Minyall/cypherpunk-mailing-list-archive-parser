Along the lines of Big Brother and your genomic heritage:

No, the few cells left on your chair are not enough to provide a genomic map.
Hair does, indeed, contain cells capable of being analyzed, in the follicles.
PCR (polymerase chain reaction) is capable of analyzing a variety of genetic
polymorphisms (genes that vary among the general population) from only a 
single cell. Thus you could be typed in a limited fashion and identified but 
not mapped. Small comfort, however, and PCR is becoming easier every day.
For escaping DNA typing tests, I suggest carrying along some HeLa cell DNA 
(that will really screw up the test ;->.
