I haven't really kept track of which remailers are how reliable;
they're almost all relatively new and experimental,
people are hacking software, they go up and down a lot,
and I almost never use them anyway.  I also don't like
keeping track of the syntax and which ::'s are followed by which ##s :-)

Julf's anon.penet.fi remailer is serious; he's done a lot of work
to get a private machine, payng for a reasonably expensive
64kbps line himself, and has it located somewhere that only 3 people know.
(The original was located at a university, and somebody decided
they wanted it Closed.)  It's also outside the US, which is useful,
.  On the other hand, it works differently than the one-way anonymous remailers,
uses up a substantial fraction of the net.bandwidth into FInland,
and costs him real bucks - somebody ought to start a US equivalent
and deload him.

I'd guess tht extropia is also probably well-run, or at least 
has good features.  But I haven't used it.
