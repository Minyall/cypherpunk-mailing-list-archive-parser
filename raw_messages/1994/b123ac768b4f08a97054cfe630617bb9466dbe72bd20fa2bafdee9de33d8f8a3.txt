If anyone wants to know the NYT has a longish article today on 
Leonard Adleman's experiment using DNA as a molecular computer. 
 It amplifies the Science article mentioned here earlier and 
quotes several computer scientists who praise the work.

To see it, send a blank message with subject:  DNA_la
