Triangulation works great for tracking any transmitter--but it is
expensive.  Cellular systems, by their nature, know which cell you are
in.  Given that they already know, the service provider could log all
movement pretty easily.  A simple matter of programming--programming
which is possibly already done, judging from the Simpson case.
