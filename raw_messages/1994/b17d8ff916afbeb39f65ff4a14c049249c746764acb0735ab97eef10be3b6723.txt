How did it happen that "we on the internet" was an unforseen force?

The first answer is obvious: they didn't realize that cohesive action would
arise out of the internet.

The second is not so obvous, but illuminates part of the Clipper strategy:
The Clipper promoters assumed the the issue to be beyond most citizen's
technical horizo.  However, the unexpected thing which happened was that the 
initial few who did understand rapidly interneted the information to others.i
Without the internet, the information, and opposition, would have spread 
more slowly. 

Cain observes that Denning and friends are afraid of the *unknown* that 
will come out of the new communications technologies.  The reaction to 
Clipper, and how developed, should convince them they are right.
