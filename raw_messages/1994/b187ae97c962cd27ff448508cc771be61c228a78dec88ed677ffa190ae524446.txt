Where does Steve Jackson fit into this theory?

I don't think it's nearly as black & white as you suggest:  Our systems
are not monolithic and some consitutional and democratic principles do
still have some sway.  Noam Chomsky discusses this when he talks about
reasons for optimism.

Which is not to belittle the orginal point that we have reason to be
paranoid: it's just to say that we don't have total justification for
despair, either.
