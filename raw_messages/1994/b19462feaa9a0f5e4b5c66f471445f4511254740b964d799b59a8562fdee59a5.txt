To everyone on this list who flamed me.  The number of flames I have 
received for accidentally sending a "please take me off the list" to the 
list itself in addition to the correct list has been truly offensive.  I 
asked to be taken off this list over 1.5 weeks ago and when I still 
received mail I thought I would, like I have seen others do on this 
group, send a request to the list itself.  I have been using various 
items on the internet for years now and have never, EVER, been treated so 
poorly by a group.  Thank you all for sending me notes telling me not to 
send unsubscribe messages to the list.  I am well aware of that fact, but 
you all took up much more "bandwidth" by sending me all those flames.  


Please try and refrain from sending every person that you think is a 
newbie a flame informing them of their stupidity.

Sincerely,

Richard Savel
