PGP Tools and Magic Money would not run on a big-endian machine. This did
not surprise me, because I don't have one to test it on. I sent a new 
version to csn.org which fixes a bug in fifo_moven, and includes a #define
to force the precision to maximum on a big-endian machine. This should make
it work, but will slow it down. The new version, when it shows up, should
be in the pgp_tools directory. Go to /mpj, read README.MPJ, and it will tell
you how to get into the crypto section. Check the file dates to see if the
new version is there yet. I sent them on 2/6.

Is there anyone who would like to fix it so it will run properly? The files
pgptools.c and ptd.c in the toolkit, and mm.c, s.c, and c.c in the Magic
Money system, need to be changed. There is a function called rescale which
has to be run on mpi's after set_precision is called. I have no way to test
any changes, so I can't write this.
