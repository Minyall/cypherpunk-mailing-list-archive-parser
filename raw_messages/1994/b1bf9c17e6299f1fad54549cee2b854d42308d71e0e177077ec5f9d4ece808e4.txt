SSL provides "channel" privacy. The two endpoints which are communicating can
be ensured of three basic properties:

  1. You are certain who you are talking to (server authentication)
  2. Your conversation with the server is private (privacy using encryption)
  3. Your conversation cannot be interfered with (data integrity)

That is all SSL does. MIME multipart encoding used on documents can provide
deeper encryption, tamper-proof document storage, etc. There are up and coming
standards for these actions.
