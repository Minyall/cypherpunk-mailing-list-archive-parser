Thanks, Hal.  Maybe you remember me from some time past.  I confess
that Perry Metzger's tone set me off and prompted an intemperate reply,
for which I apologize.

Regardless of the technical brunt, I think we all view with great
satisfaction the shock waves produced by someone who the CypherPunks
can truly call one of their own.
