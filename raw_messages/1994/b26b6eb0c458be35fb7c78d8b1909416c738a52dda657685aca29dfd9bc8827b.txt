This suggests that there are three possible files which are already
archiving the list.  How frequently they are deleted is another matter.
The list volume is so high that the disk space to hold much of an
archive becomes a bit expensive.  Still, if one of thse could be made
accessible to anon ftp it might be worthwhile (if toad allows anon ftp).
