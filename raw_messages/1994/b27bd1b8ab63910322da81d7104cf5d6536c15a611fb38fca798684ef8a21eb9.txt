   Sure.  I'm not sure the message would get through as you're framing it,
   though.  People don't react well to messages that are put too strongly...
   a gentle, gradual approach is more likely to get through.

Several approaches to gradualism have been usefully suggested in this
debate, and I appreciate that.

Just to be sure, I was expressing a willingness, not an imminent intent.
