  Your understanding of how IRIDIUM(r) will work is incorrect.  It most 
certainly WILL be the NORMAL operating mode for a subscriber unit (cell 
phone, if you will) to talk to another subscriber unit by only going 
through satellite links.  The caller will be authenticated via a "home" 
equivalent to the MTSO switch, but the call itself will NOT go through 
the switch (or any other) unless it is to a phone number which is not a 
subscriber unit. ONLY in that case will the call be routed through the 
MTSO equivalent.

  Your thoughts about caller authentication are correct.  I don't know if 
IRIDIUM is planning to do this correctly or not.
