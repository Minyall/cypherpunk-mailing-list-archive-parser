Well, I keep a variety of old posts at chaos.bsu.edu, available via
gopher, in the "Cypherpunks gopher site" directory.  It isn't a full
archive of the list, but has some of the more interesting posts since
I joined the list (Oct. 1992).

I added about 15 more files over the weekend, and probably need to
re-organize the posts and directory structure soon ;)
