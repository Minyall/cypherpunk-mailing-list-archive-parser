Not a flame here, but a slight difference of opinion.  The admonition,
"Cypherpunks write code," should be taken metaphorically.  I think "to
write code" means to take unilateral effective action as an individual. 
That may mean writing actual code, but it could also mean dumpster diving
at Mycrotronx and anonymously releasing the recovered information.  It
could also mean creating an offshore digital bank.  Don't get too literal
on us here.  What is important is that Cypherpunks take personal
responsibility for empowering themselves against threats to privacy.
