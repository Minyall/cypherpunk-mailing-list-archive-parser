Hezbollah, Hamas, the IRA, the Khmers Rouges lock people up. You may not
believe it but there are those who accept their 'rules' under the threat of
violence. I suppose 'most people' call _them_ governments?

I'm amazed at the way some of you keep screaming about the violence of 
governments. Maybe you need to experience some _real_ repression.
