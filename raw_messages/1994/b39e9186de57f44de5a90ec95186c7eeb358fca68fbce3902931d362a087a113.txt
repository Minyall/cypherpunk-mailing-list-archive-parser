I use Linux at home, and uucp my email down at regular intervals to the
box at home.  When I want to run windoze, I just say "reboot".  The Linux
uucp runs just fine, and talks to everyone else, as far as I know. 

I keep my PGP pass phrase in $PGPPASS, although I have to type it in every
time I log in - small price to pay.  The machine at home is pretty secure 
- - I hope!  :)
