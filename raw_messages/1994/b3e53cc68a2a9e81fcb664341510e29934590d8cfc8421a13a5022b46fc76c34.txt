This scheme wouldn't be workable in the currently fragile and ephemeral 
net of remailers.  They would have to spend a lot of time talking to each 
other and making sure that they all had up-to-date lists of valid 
remailers.  That's too much of a burden to put on the net.philanthropists
that are currently operating mailing lists.

Any validation of a chained remailer pathway is up to the user (not 
exactly *caveat emptor* cause you ain't paying for anything, but you get 
the idea)
