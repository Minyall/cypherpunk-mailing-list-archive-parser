Just a note to let you know that the rperkins remailer is back in
business. This is available via:

Sorry it was down for so long, but I lost net connections for a
while. I'm still not back on the list, but for those who don't
know me, I used to be known as ub075@freenet.victoria.bc.ca.

Have fun.
