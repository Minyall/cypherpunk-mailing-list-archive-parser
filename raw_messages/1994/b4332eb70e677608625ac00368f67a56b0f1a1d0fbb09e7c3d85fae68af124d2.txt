First, how were they crypto-related?  They dealt with statistical tests
for distinguishing good crypto-weak RNGs from bad ones.  Anything that
even hopes to be a strong RNG will pass this sort of tests.

Second, if people don't have Usenet, telnet, or ftp access (any of which
could have been used to retrieve these articles), they can get accounts
that do what they want.  If you want to tide them over in the interim,
you could post a pointer to sci.math, with the comment that you would be
happy to mail a copy to anyone who can't get the articles by other means.
