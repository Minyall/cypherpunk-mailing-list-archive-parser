But one of the important things is that action is not JUST writing code.  
There are those of use who are unable to write good code (or, I suppose, 
any code at all) or do not comprehend the math of cryptography.  They are 
just as needed in the battle as those who compile.

Cypherpunks (the list) I believe has sorta become a combination of 
talk.politics.crypto and sci.crypt, and provides a uniqie opportunity to 
integrate both the coding adn the political sides into one cohesive 
fighting force.  The small number of (active) participants allows this to 
be done in a very intimate and (relatively) fast fashion.

This is a GOOD thing.

That assumes that people can get it...
