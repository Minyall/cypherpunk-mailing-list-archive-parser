You know.. I wonder with all this bickerig if in fact we CAN agree on the
fact that we all are opposed to invasions of our privacy via governemnt
surveillance techniques.. Can we agree on that issue? It seems to me that I
have heard a consensus on this at least...
	One more thing- I recently completed a first ddrafty of a paper I
am working on regarding computer curveillance, Clipper, etc- and the
professor who read it asked me "What is the likelihood and what re the
reaosns for the NSA and other governments agencies wanting to monitor the
people?" I wasn't sure of exactly how to answer that! I mean- it seems to
me that the governemnt wants to maintain its own power, and keep a watchful
eye on those with opinions oppposite of their own. Any other reasons you
all can think of? Hmm..
