Hi, I hope that you read mine.  I am favorable to EVERTHING you are 
saying EXCEPT the identification part.  It is too much power.  You have 
no need for this.  Just make dsclosure of age bracket mandatory.  This 
gives the "beast" the minimal information to play with and does EXACTLY 
what you want to do.  

Also, I would be very interested in trying to provide a censorship 
service.  I think the most valuable thing you could do is to provide 
services orented to this.
