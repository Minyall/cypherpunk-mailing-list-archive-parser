So?  Don't sign anyone's PGP key unless they've proved to a Notary
Public they're them, with 3 pieces of ID including a photo ID, making
that assertion under penalty of perjury.

Tell everyone that that's your level of certification.  If people
have reason to believe you, you'll gain reputation and trust.

You put too much trust in "the authorities", David.
