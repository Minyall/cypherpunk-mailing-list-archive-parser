Subject: Problem with my Mail (1000 extra lines of junk)

Several people have written me to inform me that my last mail message
to the list had 1000 lines of extra junk appended at the bottom:

501 macrakis@osf.org~h...  550 Host unknown (Name server: host not
found)
501 macrakis@osf.org~h...  550 Host unknown (Name server: host not
found)
...etc...

I've informed the folks at Netcom. If _this_ message has the same
extra junk, then I'll of course cease posting until the problem is
fixed.

Thanks,
