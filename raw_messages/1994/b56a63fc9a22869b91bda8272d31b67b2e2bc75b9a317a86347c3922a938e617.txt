I find this analogy pretty thin...

"Us"?

I appreciate your input, but please do not presume to speak for me.

An "insider", because he happens to know a judge?  Sorry, but
knowledge of the law is not some sort of exclusive privilege.

It has never been demonstrated to my satisfaction that tmp@netcom.com
is ill, and while the suggestion has been made frequently I don't
think we can use the supposition to accuse Mr. Unicorn of "kicking" a
sick person.  This is a serious twisting of the facts.

No; that's the most bizarre misattribution I've seen in a while...

Indeed; it might be $10,000,000!!!  Or, of course, it might be
nothing, and it might be that someone victimized by a frivolous
lawsuit can sue to recover costs.

I'm pretty quickly losing track of this train of thought.  Are you
suggesting that Mr. Unicorn should have consulted a mafioso instead of
a judge?

This statement makes no sense.  Is it not obvious that litigation need
have nothing whatsoever to do with the free flow of information?
