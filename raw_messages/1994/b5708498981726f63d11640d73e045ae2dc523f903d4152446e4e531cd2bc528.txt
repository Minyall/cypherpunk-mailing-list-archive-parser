:     Want to be a spy?  Here's your chance.  The US Department of Justice is
: seeking evidence of restraint of trade and monopolization in the computer
: and telecommunications industry.  Currently their big investigation is that
: of Microsoft, but they are looking for other cases of abuse of economic
: power by dominant companies.

:     With regards to patents, the Justice Department is looking for cases where
: the owner of a patent denied a potential licensee a license for the patent,
: while giving licenses to some of your competitors.  Maybe this is a case of
: anti-trust, depending on market conditions.
