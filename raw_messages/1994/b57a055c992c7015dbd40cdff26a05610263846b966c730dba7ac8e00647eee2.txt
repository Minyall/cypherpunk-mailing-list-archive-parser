 - wuarchive.wustl.edu:/pub/msdos_uploads/pgs/pgs099b.zip
 - oak.oakland.edu:/SimTel/msdos/security/pgs099b.zip
   (just uploaded it... So it must be there in a few days...)

   (just uploaded it... So it must be there in a few days...)

If you want it fast look on wuarchive...

For the ones who don't know what PGS is...

PGS is a very good ms-dos shell for PGP. It reads directly from the 
keyrings and has a very good keymanagement system...

... If you outlaw Privacy, only Outlaws will have Privacy!
