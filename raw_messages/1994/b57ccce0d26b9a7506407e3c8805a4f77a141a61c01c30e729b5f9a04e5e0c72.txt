Uhhm...  Boy!  Was I _that_ unclear about my meaning?  It is a _virtue_
of strong cryptography that it reduces the effectiveness of governments.
That's part of what cypherpunks is about.  Or am I now misunderstanding
you as badly as you apparently misunderstood me?  No way did I intend to
defend _any_ nation-state, _especially_ including any conducting wars on
drugs or presuming to forbid the showing of a film or tapping the phones
of dissidents.

My point was that liberals are not automatically innocent of Statism and
in fact have ample reason of their own to want an oppressive leviathan
State.  For this reason, strong cryptography threatens them as much as
any other Statists.

Freedom and cryptoanarchy are not on the liberal-conservative axis at
all.
