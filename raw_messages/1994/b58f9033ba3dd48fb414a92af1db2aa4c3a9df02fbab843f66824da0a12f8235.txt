Eeek! My skin just peeled off!

Seriously, I thought the whole ITAR hassle was that 'code fragments' intended
to 'illustrate algorithms' are only exportable on paper? After all Mike Ingle
can't sent me his Perl RSA libraries to 'illustrate cryptographic prototyping
techinques' even though the libraries don't run on their own.
