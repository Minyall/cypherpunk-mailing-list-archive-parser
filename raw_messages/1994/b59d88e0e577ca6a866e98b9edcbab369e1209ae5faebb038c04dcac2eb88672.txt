I graduated a couple of years ago, and I haven't been keeping up with
the academic literature in Comp Sci. very well since, so I'm kind of
lost in the discussion on quantum computers and cryptography.  Can
anyone give me the Reader's Digest Condensed Version (TM) of the
theory behind quantum computers, or maybe point me to a good journal
article or two?  Many thanks,

Ken
