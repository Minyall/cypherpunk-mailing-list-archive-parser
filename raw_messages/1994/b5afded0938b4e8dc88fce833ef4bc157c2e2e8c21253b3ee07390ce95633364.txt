It's not just you.  I'm having the exact same problem.  Most messages
get thru rather quickly, but some have gotten delayed, sometimes by
several days...  The problem is appearantly at toad.com.

Same thing.  I've gotten over 50 reject messages from penet so far. :(

I think Julf did a sweep to eliminate "inactive" accounts, and
unfortunantly set the parameters a bit too broad.  My penet account got
killed too.

The offending addresses seem to be:

na56715
na55954
na49546
na69591
