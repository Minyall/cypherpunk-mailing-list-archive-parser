You _would_ ask.   

grok  /grok/, var. /grohk/ [from the novel _Stranger_in_a_Strange_Land_,
by Robert A. Heinlein, where it is a Martian word meaning literally
'to drink' and metaphorically 'to be one with'] vt. 1. To understand,
usually in a global sense. Connotes intimate and exhaustive knowledge.
Contrast zen, similar supernal understanding as a single brief flash.
See also glark. 2. Used of programs, may connote merely sufficient
understanding. "Almost all C compilers grok the void type these days."
