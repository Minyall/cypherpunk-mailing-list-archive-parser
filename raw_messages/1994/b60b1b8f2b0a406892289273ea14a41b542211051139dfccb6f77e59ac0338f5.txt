Well, I went through a similiar situation with CMU, they told someone
(not me) that they wouldn't allow PGP to be in the campus software
library, so I put it in my personal directory and told everyone where to
get it, and they didn't complain.  It's in
/afs/andrew.cmu.edu/usr12/mg5n/pgp/pgp23A.tar.Z
