Most do.  RPGs, for example, definitely do.  As I recall, a shaped
charge punches a tiny hole through the armor and then injects a
blob or jet of liquified metal into the vehicle.  It's much worse
than a ricochet.

The explosion occurs outside the tank, driving the jet of metal in.

Armor piercing artillery rounds are called HEAT (High Explosive Anti-
Tank).	The name says it all.
