And as Hal and I have been discussing, that's not at all an obvious
problem.  A filter for PGP messages cannot make them completely random
for all the reasons presented.  The session keys must be generated
differently if the encrypted form if them is to have a flat
distribution.

To wit, PGP itself must change in order to make a random PGP output
format.
