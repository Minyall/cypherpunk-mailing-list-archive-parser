Not. What one page on their server
(http://www.digicash.com/ecash/ecash-win.html) used to say was that
there are two versions of the MS Windows client. One uses the PGP 2.3
MPI library, and that version is not licensed for US use; the other
uses the RSAREF library, and, while slower, it's legal for US users.

There's now only one choice for the MS Windows version-- I suspect
that means that v2.02 and later use only the RSAREF library.

Actually, there's not a separate ecash "server" per se. If you want to
accept ecash payments (plug: check out my store at
http://www.iquest.com/~fairgate), you just write a CGI script that
calls the ecash client. Nothing much to it.
