After this, I shan't be replying any more to this thread, as its a
completely obscure and uninteresting topic to most people that has
little to do with cryptography.

No US equities are book entry only. To my knowledge no enabling
legislation to let that happen occured. You can always call up your
broker and ask for certificates if you want them.

Well, if you allow nothing but book entry, you don't need certificates
sitting in a vault (they exist only because the UCC doesn't grok
issues without certificates), but even so you would still need someone
to be keeping track of the information -- someone has to play bank.
