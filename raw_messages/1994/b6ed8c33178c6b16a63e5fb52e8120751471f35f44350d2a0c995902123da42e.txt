No, we wouldn't call you or anyone else an idiot for not having seen
this compression farce a couple of years ago, not when we're just
recovering from The Snake that Cannot Be Named.

The WEB thing was really a hoot. Do what Ray suggests and read the FAQ
in the compression group. (You know, there needs to be a "High Tech
Urban Legends" book....I can see someone asking: "I heard there was
this great compression algorithm, but the disk drive makers bought up
the rights to it to keep it off the market...")
