just a quick note to tell you all that I just read an editorial in
info security by John Droge.  He rambles on in much the same way
Dorothy Denning does, terrorists, you can trust that gov't...blah, blah, blah..

Anyway, I was wondering why any sane, 1/10 intelligent person would be
defending the Clipper chip...then I read his bio...he is a VP at
Mykotronx.

Looks like their PR machine is in full steam! :)
