HTTP, like SMTP, is only a transport for underlying documents. The
underlying documents are the things people wish to secure, not the
transport layer.  By securing only the transport, you make it possible
for people to get pages that are forged, although they can be sure of
what machine delivered them (which isn't significant). Your system is,
for instance, useless in a proxy HTTP daemon environment.

Actually, securing the communications as well is important for
privacy, but that should be done via IPSP, not some new, incompatible,
mechanism.

I'll point out that X.509 is widely loathed in the internet community
-- its X.509 that caused PEM to fall flat on its face and die.

RSAREF versions of the code can't be used commercially. RSA won't
license people to do stuff on their own -- unless you have significant
pull, you have to buy TIPEM or BSAFE from them and use THEIR code.

Well, TCP/IP is available for free, but thats a horse of a different
color. I don't particularly like your security model, but I don't
object that strenuously to your use of TIPEM qua TIPEM. I do strongly
object to X.509, which is based on technologies entirely alien to the
internet. How do I look up an X.509 certificate in the DNS? Now, given
the Eastlake and Kaufman DNS security system, you can put keys in the
DNS if you use DNS names, but X.509 uses abortive ISO distinguished
names which are utterly unmappable into the DNS.

As for your "peer review", I'll note that it was done extensively by
RSADSI folks, who aren't entirely unbiased about technologies...
