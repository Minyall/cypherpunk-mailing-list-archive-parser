"Enemies"?  Isn't that a subjective term?  :-)

I'm going to make the almost certainly valid assumption that you know
more about the way the network works than I do, but my assumption is
this:  in the wacky scenario I described wherein Clipper devices are
installed in the network interfaces "everywhere", then the presence of
these identifiable (and identifying!) packets means that a central tap
at a regional switching center could concievably perform traffic
analysis without the need for taps on local loops anywhere.  Is this
assumption way wrong?
