: Please don't do that.  I don't want to go through hoops to read this
: mailing list.  It's already cumbersome as is.  Adding PGP in the soup

That was exactly the point Eric Hughes was making; it is not a good
strategy to save encryption for only private communications.

Besides, procmail (or similar) should be able to handle piping
incoming cypherpunks traffic through the decryptor, so the hoop 
would be transparent anyway.  No muss, no fuss.
