To attempt to make this crypto-relevant:

Most scheme implementations support infinite precision integers
("bignums") directly, though some of them don't, and some of those
which do have really slow bignum support.

I haven't seen one with a fast modular exponentiation routine,
though :-).

I haven't looked at STk at all.
