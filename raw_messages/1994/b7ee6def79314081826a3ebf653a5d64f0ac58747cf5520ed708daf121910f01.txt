Most American airports, especially those with international
connections, routinely videotape all passengers. I can't cite a source
for this, but I think it's common knowledge (not that this means its
true).

The recent film "The Pelican Brief" has this as a plot device, with a
terrorist captured on tape on his departure to Paris.

Paranoid note: Ear shapes are said to be a fairly unique
characteristic, hard to disguise, and easy for computers to process (
a line scan). This may mean the return of long hair. (No wonder
Singapore bans long hair on men.)
