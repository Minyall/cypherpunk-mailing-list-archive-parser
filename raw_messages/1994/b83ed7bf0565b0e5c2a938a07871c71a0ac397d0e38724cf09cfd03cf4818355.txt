Is this really that impressive? MapleV and my 386dx-20 just factored it 
into 212885833 * 48544121 * 228479 in a matter of 23 cpu seconds.

Speaking of who .. he's at my university. :) Nice guy; one of the people 
who offered to help me with the remailer situation last year. 

Funny thing; last year the computer administrators wouldn't even allow a 
copy of PGP to reside on their systems -- now it is part of their public 
account (student-run officially University unsupported software, usable 
by all).
