Hello, all!

I have just changed jobs within the company, and now I
find that my PC is not as secure as I'd like. (Long
story.) I'm looking for SecureDevice, hoping that
it will let me create a secure area on my hard drive.
I ftp'ed to wuarchive.wustl.edu, changed directory
to /pub/msdos_uploads, then tried to change directory
to cryptography only to find that the directory
does not exist!

Pointers? Suggestions? Thanks for your time!

P.S. Does anybody have a FAQ or something about how to
integrate PGP with Microsoft Mail? (Note the lack of
a PGP signature while I'm getting my act together..)
