Out of curiousity, is anyone aware of whether the USSR employed PAL's
(Permissive Activation Links) in their strategic nuclear weaponary?  If so,
is anyone aware of how secure the PAL's the Soviets actually used were?
There was a rumor on USENET some time back that the Soviets were using RSA
in their PAL's, but it sounded too much like an urban myth to me.
