Phil Karn suggests that people who care about the second amendment are
loonies.  Put me down with the loonies.

Cypherpunks might want to tie their legal arguments to something else,
but they ought to consider that the set of folks hostile to guns and the
set of folks hostile to crypto overlap a lot.  There may be a common
reason.

I'll be happy to continue the discussion by e-mail.
