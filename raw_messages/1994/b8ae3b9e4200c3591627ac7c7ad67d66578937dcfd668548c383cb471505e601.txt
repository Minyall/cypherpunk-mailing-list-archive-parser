	I think terminal emulators are the wrong layer for PGP
integration.  PGP support is needed in document editors and viewers,
rather than in network layers.

	With direct ip connectivity becoming commonplace, we're seeing
PGP integrated into mail & news tools, which is a great thing.  (There
is also a use for encrypting networks, but I think it is different
from the use for PGP, which is a document oriented system.)
