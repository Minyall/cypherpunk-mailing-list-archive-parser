Another facet of human nature one can trust is 75% of the population will
follow a direct order without much question, given the person issuing the
order appears to have the authority to do so.  ......
It only takes a matter of seconds to organize a concerted team effort 
to aid the victim- because I am the responsible person.  They are not 
accountable for their actions anymore in their minds, I am.

This isn't civilization, it's gregarious herd instinct ;)
.................................................
This isn't herd instinct; it's innocence & ignorance.  If someone can 
recognize the situation for what it is and has knowledge of what is 
required, they will proceed to contribute according to their informed 
judgement.  If they are not sufficiently familiar with the meaning of 
what they are facing, then they will be amenable to guidance or to the 
appearance of knowledgeable authority.

If you seem to know what the right thing which needs to be done to 
correct a problematic situation, they will accept your commands; but if 
it is recognizable that you don't know what you are talking about or 
what is apropos, you will lose their following.
