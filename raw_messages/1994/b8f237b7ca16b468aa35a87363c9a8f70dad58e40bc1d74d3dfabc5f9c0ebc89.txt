This may be true, but how exactly do you plan to argue "anonymity" is
necessary in a digital cash system (from the point of view of the bank
and stores)?

I mean, strong crypto could provide "zealous anti-counterfeiting"
without providing anonymity.

Precisely my point.  Except I think the icing will be left off.

Oh, and in response to Tim May, no, I'm not afraid to use my real
name; I've been on this list quite a while (perhaps this is useless
trivia).  I just thought I'd try comminicating via anonymous remailer,
perhaps establishing a pseudonym while I'm at it, so I'll be signing
posts from now on (actually I already signed one previous post).  Just
playing around with some crypto-anarchy concepts.
