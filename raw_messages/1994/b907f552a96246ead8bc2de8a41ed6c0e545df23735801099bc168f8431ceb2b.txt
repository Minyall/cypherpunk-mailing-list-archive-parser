Well, now that we've gotten THAT straightened out..  
I guess its always helpful to be clear in one's wording, hmm? 
Hopefully this will be the end of this thread- I'll go back to lurking
again for now. By the way- am reading 1984 again- I
think we should definetly get those NSA shirts out "We're just running a
little late"! Scary!

Ciao for now..
