Just to make sure you all know, good 'ol rush can be contacted at:
70277.2502@compuserve.com
I've written him a couple letters capping on clipper, and although I 
don't know weather he really learned from what I said, but he did mention 
the next day that he 'recently learned' that the majority of the 
net-users themselves oppose clipper... just a note.
