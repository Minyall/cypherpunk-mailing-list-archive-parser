Grey and black capitalism is already a major component of
international cash flows.

Once adequate user friendly software is available, the internet
will accellerate this already existing trend.

A fifty percent taxation rate (income plus sales plus this and that)
maximizes the states return in the short run, but is unsustainable
in the long run.

Crypto anarchy is merely the application of modern tools to 
assist covert capitalism.
