Its called "binary search". You were supposed to learn it in your
intro to computer science class.

Lets play the guessing game, shall we? Its much like twenty questions,
only that just works for twenty bit things or less. We know that we
have a big number. If you give me a function that tells me one bit
(greater or not greater) for every guess, I can get a bit of the
number. After a short time, I'll know the number -- the time is
exactly the number of bits in the number (that is, the log base 2 of
the number.)
