I have been thinking along these lines lately, too.  The situation
with the reputation of the twwells.com anon-server and its continued
use in spite of those questions by under-informed individuals in the
alt.sexual.abuse.recovery newsgroup have motivated me to do a couple
of trial postings there.  So far I have posted the "remailer.help.all"
file from chaos.bsu.edu as a "how-to" and the most recent update
posted here of Raph's Reliable Remailers List as a "where-to."

Neither has generated any visible response in the newsgroup as of yet.
My thinking is that it would be a Good Thing to post this kind of
information on a regular basis (weekly?) to some of the "support" and
"recovery" newsgroups.  Unless I begin drawing a lot of flames for
inappropriateness, this is what I plan to do in the immediate future.

Introducing the people using those groups to remailers, encryption,
etc. would not only be helpful to them, but would also be helpful to
the publicly perceived reputation of remailers, etc. in just the
manner to which Adam alludes.
