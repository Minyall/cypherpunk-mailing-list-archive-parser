This is especially true with products that are pulled from the market to 
save the average (read idiot) consumer from him/herself.  Or products put 
there for the same reason.

The amount of law that is intended to safeguard the world and cater to 
the bottom of the barrel when it comes to intellect and intelligence is 
significant.

I really don't want a function on all cars sold in the United States 
which prevents people from starting their car with the clutch engaged.  I 
actually find use for starting with the clutch engaged.  I can't stand 
ABS, and can usually threshold brake much more effectively than ABS can 
pulse brake.  I turn ABS off.  It's an idiot button.  It's the product of 
a culture that presses the button on the ATM machine, but has no idea 
what's going on behind the screen.

Who's to tell me I have to have ABS or the "safety starter" if I don't 
want the thing?

Who's to tell me that I need a backdoor in my crypto?

Where do you draw the line?  Outlaw sugar perhaps?  It would save 
consumers millions in dental bills.

And a "failed market" is when the market doesn't match up with the 
administrator's choices.
