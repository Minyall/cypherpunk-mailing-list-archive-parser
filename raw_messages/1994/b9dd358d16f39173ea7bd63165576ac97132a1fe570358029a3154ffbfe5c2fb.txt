Do any of you have a current list of banned mathematics topics handy?
I was reading a number theory book (Rosen) and got worried that I
might be stumbling into some of the areas forbidden to private
citizens.

I have e-mail in to Professor Denning, author of the Index, for
guidance on what mathematics is and is not allowed, but she has not
yet responded.

Meanwhile, until I hear from her or get a special waiver, I've put the
book away. I'm hoping that Rosen's introductory text is not treated as
"crypto paraphernalia," even though it's sold over the counter at
Computer Literacy, Stacey's, and other such "head shops."

where the owners received an unsolicited data packet from Tennessee
and were then prompty arrested by the Data Police
