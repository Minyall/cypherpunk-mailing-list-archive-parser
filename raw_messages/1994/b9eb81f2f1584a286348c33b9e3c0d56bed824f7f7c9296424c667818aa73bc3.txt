Huh?  Nonsense?

vie: - use PGP to sign & encrypt
vis: - use PGP to sign

Both of these sign or sign/encrypt outgoing messages automatically if 
you're using "elm" - just use them in place of your favorite editor.

pgpview does the same thing for incoming email.  Use it in place of your 
mail viewer in elm.
