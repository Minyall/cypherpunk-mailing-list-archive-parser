I'm specifically interested in *fixed point* multiply and divide
performance, since these operations appear to be crucial to IDEA and
high quality speech coding, not to mention multiple precision modular
exponentiation functions.

My 486 reference shows 13-42 clocks for a 32x32 multiply and 40 clocks
for a 64/32 divide.

I've heard that the PowerPC can do a multiply-accumulate (the basic
operation of a FIR digital filter) in one clock cycle, which qualifies
it as a DSP chip in my mind. If true, then it may become possible to
do high quality speech coding (essential for a secure phone) in
software on a widely available general purpose computer instead of
needing a high performance DSP subsystem that may be costly and/or
less readily available.

Here are some figures on my latest DES code. I'm placing it into the
public domain; how do I go about putting it on soda.berkeley.edu?

Measured execution speeds in crypts/sec:

11,488 (C version, 486DX-50, DOS, Borland C++ 3.1 -O2, 16-bit real mode)
39,185 (assembler version, same system)
62,814 (assembler version, 60 Mhz Pentium)
24,172 (C version, 486DX2-66, BSDI 1.1, GCC 1.42 -O, 32-bit prot mode)
64,185 (C version, 50 Mhz Sparc 10, GCC 2.5.8 -O)

The C version is essentially identical to Outerbridge's code in
Applied Cryptography, with a few extra tricks. The assembler version
is the same thing rewritten in assembler, with numerous optimizations
that were possible only in assembler.

Anybody have a tool for translating Intel 486 assembler code to the
Gnu assembler format?
