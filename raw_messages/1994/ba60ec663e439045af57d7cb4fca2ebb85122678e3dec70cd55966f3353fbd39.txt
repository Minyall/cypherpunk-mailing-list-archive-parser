I saw an ad for a book titled "ATM Networks" a while back.  After reading 
an entire page of blurb I still had no idea whether it was a book about 
automatic teller machine networking or fast switching of small 
fixed-sized packets.

If it had been the latter, I would have bought it.  Another customer lost 
to the evils of AOL.
