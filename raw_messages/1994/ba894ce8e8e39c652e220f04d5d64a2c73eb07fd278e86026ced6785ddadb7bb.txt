-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

I spoke with Phil Zimmermann today at some length, and he has informed me 
that users who decide to use the jumo keys generated by the hack of 2.6ui 
will be running a risk of incompatibility on down the line with future 
releases he has planned. You have been warned!

Ever forward,

David
