In a society where anonymity were commonly available, I would agree withyou, but
sadly we do not live in such a society.  As cypherpunks we are trying to rectify
this, to make anonymity available for _all_, pricks like Detweiler included.  I 
think that it sets a bad precedent to boot him off of our private remailers 
while our remailers are still all that's out there.  When public remailing is a 
reality, we can rightly do as we see fit with our private remailers without 
risking jeopardizing the future of anonymity rights on the net as a whole.
Understand of course, that I am not saying that you have no right to boot 
Detweiler...I am merely pointing out that I think it would set a dangerous 
precedent, and would in the long run be detrimental to all we are working for.
