Something that just occurred to me is that chaining is a justifiable
standard feature for hosts that hold other hosts' MX records.  

I think I'll start hacking on a protocol proposal (Request For

be to implement and distribute as a security suite.

(How's this towards furthering the "everybody a remailer" idea?)
