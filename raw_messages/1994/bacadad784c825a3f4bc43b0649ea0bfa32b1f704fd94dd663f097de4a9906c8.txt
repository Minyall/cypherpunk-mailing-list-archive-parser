   I looks like I am going to have to track down the proceedings from
   Crypto 85, 86, and 87.  (Still in print?  Expensive??)  All the main
   sources seem to be in them.

As Tim mentions, the Crypto proceedings are about $60-80.  I'd
recommend a library for specific or occasional use.  MIT's libraries
are very complete for cryptography, for example.
