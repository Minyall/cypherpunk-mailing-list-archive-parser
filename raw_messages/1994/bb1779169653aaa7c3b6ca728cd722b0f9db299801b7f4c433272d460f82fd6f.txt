(been absent from the list for a long time since Rice disabled remote
dialups AGAIN)

I see there was a question on how to encrypt something to be read in
the future.  Several months ago Tim May sent a post covering this very
topic - "Timed Released Crypto", which is at the gopher site

chaos.bsu.edu

in the Protocols directory.  The archive is now a menu item from the
top level directory which is called something like "Cypherpunks Gopher
Archive" 

I just mention this since I don't see any followups which mention
this.  But then I have very few messages from the list given I haven't
been able to check mail in a week and a half.
