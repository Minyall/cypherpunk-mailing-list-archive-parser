I can see how this gets around the problem of sending cleartext 
passphrases over a network, but how does it help stop the problem of the 
remote system running a keystroke log that is handed over to the 
authorities during a bust?  Armed with 800/some-number they can just type 
the same thing into PGP (or a modified copy) and decrypt the files that 
you were keeping on-line.
