Why not do just that? Many areas of the net transfer mail, and even newsfeeds
through UUCP. ERNet, which I'm connected to in India, had to use UUCP for 
newsfeeds when their connectivity was at 9600 bps, 5 years ago.

UUCP doesn't need phone lines or direct connections; private sites could easily
hitch a ride on the Internet.

Fidonet users have been distributing their message bases worldwide for years.

Oh - there *is* a newsgroup, alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.children, which 
would have been shut down if it were a BBS, and presumably cannot be traced to 
individuals. I don't know if anything is ever posted to it, though.
