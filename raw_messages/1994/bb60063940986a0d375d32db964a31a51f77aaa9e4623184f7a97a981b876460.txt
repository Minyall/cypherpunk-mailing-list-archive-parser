I have not been able to get Magic Money to work right in big-endian
mode using pgptl10c.zip and mgmny10d.zip.  It does not work
with either -DHIGHFIRST or -DHIGHFIRST plus -DHIGH_KLUDGE.

The key generation seems to go OK, but then when I "mint" a coins.dat
file with 6 coins in the server and try reading it in the client, all
coins after the first are said to have bad signature.

I have tried it with both 512 and 1024 bit keys and both fail.

The previous version of magicmny.zip worked OK.
