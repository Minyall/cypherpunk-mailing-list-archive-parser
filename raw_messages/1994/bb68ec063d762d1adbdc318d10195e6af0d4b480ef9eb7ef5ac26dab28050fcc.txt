Perhaps the following nested headers might be more cost-effective to
quantizing message length:
Pad-Me-By: 3289   (Add 3289 random bytes to the end of this message)
Truncate-Me-To: 1433  (Remove all but the first 1433 byte of this message.)

The message would then change size as it traveled thru the mixes.
