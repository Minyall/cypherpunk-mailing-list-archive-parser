Employers are REQUIRED to obtain an SSAN for tax purposes, as are banks for
reporting interest, etc. to the IRS.  Regarding credit, they generally ask
for an SSAN because that's the "unique personal identifier" that most credit
bureaus index your records by (and still screw them up, even then!).
