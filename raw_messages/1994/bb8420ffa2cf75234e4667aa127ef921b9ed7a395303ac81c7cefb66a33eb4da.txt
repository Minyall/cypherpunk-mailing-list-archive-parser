     The Cypherpunks gopher server at chaos has been migrated from 
gopherd to GN version 2.09.  All of the data should be intact.  Although 
many of the filenames have been changed so that they could be stored in 
compressed format, they should be served exactly the same way as before.

     If you experience any problems with the system, please write 
gopher-admin@chaos.bsu.edu.  This entire gopher hierarchy will probably 
be moving in the near future after I install the new hard drive for 
chaos, but there should be no interruption in service.
