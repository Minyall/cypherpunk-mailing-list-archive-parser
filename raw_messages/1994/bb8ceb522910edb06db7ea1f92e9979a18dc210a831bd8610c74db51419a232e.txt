Do you need a server certificate issued directly by one of these PCAs, or does 
it just need to be rooted there (i.e., can I use my [hypothetical] corporate 
PCA, which itself has a certificate from the RSA commercial PCA)?

If it's the former, I would strongly urge you to extend your clients to 
include the latter.  I don't want to have to go to RSA for every server 
certificate--that's in part what the PCA hierarchy exists for.

Similarly, if I set up a personal server (with my home page, for example), can 
I'd like to be able to use a certificate issued by the RSA Unaffiliated User 
CA, which is itself a PCA certified by the Commercial CA.
