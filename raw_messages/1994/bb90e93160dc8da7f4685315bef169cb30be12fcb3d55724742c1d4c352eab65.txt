I assume you mean so that running "strings" on the binary will not
lead you to anything, right?  You can use an XOR with some weird value
to hide the strings.  Just make sure the value you use will, for
example, set the high bit on the string bytes...

Its is a cheap, free way to hide strings.  It is, by no means, secure.
