Oh, I'll also point out that yours truly distributed 150 disks with
the swIPe code on it at Usenix. Right now, I'm concentrating on the IP
stack as the most productive place to seal crypto in.

Also by the way, I've come to the conclusion that there are several
major flaws in the design of PGP that will make it impossible to scale
network wide. It is, for instance, impossible to design a reasonable
distributed key management architecture because the key IDs are
essentially random 64 bit numbers without any structure. I'm saddened
by this, but not truly horrified. PGP is a cool start to the
"encryption everywhere everyday" movement, but it is only a start, and
one can't be overly attached to any one design.
