It is just this kind of thing that does in fact give me big qualms when
considering the enormous consequences of unleashing inexpensive, easy
to use, hard voice crypto that is accessible to anyone.  I'm not really
being a devil's advocate, I'm just sincerely concerned.  Sure, this guy
may have a nonsense plan or a workable one or perhaps none at all
but...

It could be the Pandora's box awaiting the opening that the cold war
years never quite showed the balls to attempt.  In this unstable and
angry world with people obviously standing ready to do *anything* they
can to get their way, is it appropriate to help them accomplish their
deadly and reckless methods?  I dunno, but when you feel you hold the
key to this in your head and respected people think so too it really
make you *stop* and think.

On the other hand it is inevitable so why be personally concerned.


Peace and Love,

Bob
