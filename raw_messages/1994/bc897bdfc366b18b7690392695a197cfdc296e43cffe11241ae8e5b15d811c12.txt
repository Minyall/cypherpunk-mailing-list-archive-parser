WAit!  Let me correct that statement before I lose my shirt.

I'm willing to wager that 2.6 (and maybe 2.5) MIT'd PGP versions
are hacked by the NSA to put in a backdoor.
                                ^^^^^^^^^^ (emphasis added.)

I'll bet you a C-note, Perry.

Now how do you propose to prove or disprove this?

PS:  just make make sure we agree on the definition of "C-note":

      C-note == $100.00 US
