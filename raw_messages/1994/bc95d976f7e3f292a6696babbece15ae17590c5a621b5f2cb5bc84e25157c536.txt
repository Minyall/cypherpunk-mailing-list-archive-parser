Indeed, a paper has been published on how to break Sun Secure RPC
based on the idiotic decision by someone at Sun to standardise the
modulus used. It is basically a matter of precomputing a lot of data
based on the numbers which allows you to break any particular discrete
log in that field on the fly. The suggestion by Mr. Cain to use a
single generator and modulus for all traffic is astonishingly naive.
