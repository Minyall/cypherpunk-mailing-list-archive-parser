The few people that still have outstanding orders:

I am resolving problems with the screening company and a certain size of 
shirt. I have received numerous promises from them that I would get the 
last of the shirts "by the end of the week". This has been going on for 
months, and is starting to sannoy me as well. There are as of now, only 5 
orders that have not shipped, and this is the reason why.

The shirts WILL BE SHIPPED. I have no control over the screening company, 
and have an order placed with another company which I may have do the 
small lot of shirts that have not shipped.

I apologize to those of you who have waited, as this reflects moreso on 
me than anyone else.

As always, if you have any questions, mail me. I do respond.
