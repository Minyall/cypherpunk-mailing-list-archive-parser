Steve,

Thanks for your patience and forebearance on this Detweiler issue.

A few months back I wrote to you and suggested you ought to have "a
talk" with LD, as I was getting various threats and whatnot from him
and from what most folks suspect (but cannot prove, I agree) was his
"an12070" account. I won't bore you with more details.

You replied that you were not going to censor anyone. Fair enough.

I think what you're now doing is reasonable for any sysadmin to do:
not censor a user, especially not with circumstantial evidence, but
still have a chat when a user's actions appear to be flaky or
exceptionally disruptive.

So, no complaints from me about how you've handled this matter.
