If part of your communications are encrypted and part are not you have
sent the message about what information is sensitive and what is not.
This difference in encoding is a fir-class message in it's own right.

Therefore _all_ communications should be encrypted at all time.  It is
no argument against the principle that this is difficult to do at the
current time.
