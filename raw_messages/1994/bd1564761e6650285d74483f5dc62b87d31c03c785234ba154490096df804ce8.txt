I have had this question also, has it been shown that the transformation 
of 128bit words through md5 is *theoretically* invertable, as if it is 
not, iterating it 1024 times could actually make you *LOOSE* entropy.
(say it was a random transformation, it would not contain each of the 128 
bit outputs, ie some inputs would map to the same output.)

I am not aware of any such result.

Roger.
