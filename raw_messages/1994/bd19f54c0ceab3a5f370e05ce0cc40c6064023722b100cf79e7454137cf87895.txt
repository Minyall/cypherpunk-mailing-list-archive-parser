            Wire Taps and Cryptography in Your Future
                              with
                         Nelson Bolyard


Everyone is talking about the Clipper Chip, and lots of people are
wondering about the FBI's digital telephony initiative.  This talk
will discuss both of those things and provide some historical
perspective on the battle between Congress and the Administration
over control of standards for civilian cryptography, and CPSR's
role in that debate.

Nelson Bolyard is an engineer for a major computer manufacturer in
the Silicon Valley.  He has background in cryptography and highly
secure systems, and is presently working in high-speed networking.
