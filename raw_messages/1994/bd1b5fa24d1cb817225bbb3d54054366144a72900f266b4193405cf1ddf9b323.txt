Well, the specification is pretty clear. Its pretty simple stuff,
actually, and remarkably well designed.

When last I checked, Sun's "Mailtool" did not support MIME, but
supported a proprietary enclosure format. (This may have changed in
the Openwindows supplied with 2.4, but to my knowledge 2.4 only came
out weeks ago and it is unlikely that you are using it.)
