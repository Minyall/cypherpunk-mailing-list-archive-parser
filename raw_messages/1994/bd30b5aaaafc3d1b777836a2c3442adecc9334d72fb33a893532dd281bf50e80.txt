RE: IR Face scans...

Time to get our hands on some cans of compressed-air dust 
cleaners... when you hold them upside down and spray, they
spray a super-cold liquid which quily evaporates.  BTW:
you can also just pop a 400mg Niacin capsule... Niacin will
quickly dialate all your capilaries bringing lots of blood
to your face and making you look like a lobster.

That should mess up any scan... so if you're a wanted
crook in an airport that uses ir-face biometrics, just
pop niacins like them were pop-corn. :-)
