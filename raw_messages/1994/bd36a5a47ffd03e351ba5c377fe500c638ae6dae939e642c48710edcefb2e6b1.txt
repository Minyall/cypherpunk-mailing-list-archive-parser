I'm in the process of writing a remailer front-end for Windows (I can hear
it now - "Oh, GROSS!" :-), and am looking to collect the addresses of as
many remailers as possible.  I've already got the listing from
SODA.BERKELEY, so anything not on that list is welcome.  Please let me
know if the system handles plaintext, PGP, RIPEM, or ????.

Unless somebody screams at me not to, I'll upload the finished program
(it'll be free) to SODA.

My Email address is     merriman@metronet.com
and you can finger me for PGP/RIPEM keys/fingerprints
