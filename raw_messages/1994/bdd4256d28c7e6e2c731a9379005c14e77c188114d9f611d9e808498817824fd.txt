There might be a problem in that Ida would have to phrase the answer
_exactly_ in the way that the sender has anticipated it would be phrased.

For example, Fred might ask:

"Where were we when we first kissed?"

Ida may answer:

"In the back of a dumpster truck"

Although correct, Fred may have anticipaded:

"In a dumpster truck"


There has to be a provision for unambiguous wording.  Even a question as
simple as:

"How old are you?"

may be answered in more than one way

"99"

"ninety-nine"

"99.5"

"ninety-nine and one half"

Knowing the answer yet having the program reject the "correct" answer 
time after time may frustrate your PGP-Self-Decrypt unaware user.

Why use PGP?  As I understand it, the virtue of PGP lies in it's 
handling of public and secret keys.  Any semi-secure algorythm may be 
used with a self-decrypt program.
