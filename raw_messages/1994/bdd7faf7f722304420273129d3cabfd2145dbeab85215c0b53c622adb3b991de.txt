To paraphrase Perry, the cypherpunks list assigns primacy to action.

The political discussions are meant to inform the design of the
software systems we're working on.  They do not stand alone, and as
soon as they do stand alone, they become irrelevant.

The Usenet newsgroup talk.politics.crypto is for political discussions
about cryptography of any sort whatsoever.
