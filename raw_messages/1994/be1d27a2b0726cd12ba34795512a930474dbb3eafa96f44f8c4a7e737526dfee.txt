Rather than everyone freaking out about 2.5, why not just wait a few
hours until the FTP site is announced and look at the thing for
ourselves?

Myself, I'm running on the assumption that this is a good thing,
because now PGP is completely legal in the U.S., and doubtless a PGP
thats legal overseas using a library compatible with RSAREF will
appear within days of release.
