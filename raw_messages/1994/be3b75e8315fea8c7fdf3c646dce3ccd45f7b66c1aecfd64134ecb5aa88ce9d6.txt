The two are not necessarily mutually exclusive :).  And from this point of
view, I have to say that for all of my complaints about the specifics of
various things Netscape has put forth, I cannot fault them for trying to
improve the status quo.  One thing that everyone has in common here is that
we all believe that the issues we discuss are important, and that it's worth
trying to solve the problems.  This is in part, I think, why tempers flare
from time to time--I know this was true in my case.
