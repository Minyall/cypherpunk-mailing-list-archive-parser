Agreed, but two people can definitely learn french, and you can send
a french dictionary to your friends... Passing instructions a la

"ok, now use that cable you jus bought at radio shack and stick this
wire there, and the other end in the back of the PC..."

is still difficult, but nowhere nearly as impossible as getting your
cousin who works in a diner firm to reburn his ROM. I wasn't looking
at a global accessibility, more as a possibility for a small group.
