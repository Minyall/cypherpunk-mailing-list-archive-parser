I am authorized to announce...

Phil Zimmerman is in Atlanta for Interop and will be a "commentator" at a
separate panel discussion (Tuesday 13 September) on Clipper/DTI sponsored by
EPIC.

The subject of the panel is "Issues of Trust" -- "Can we trust the government?"

All the usual suspects:

Clinton Brooks (late of NSA)
Jim Bidzos (RSA)
John Droge (?)
Dorthey Denning (Georgetown)
Barbara Simons (ACM)
David Sobel (EPIC)
