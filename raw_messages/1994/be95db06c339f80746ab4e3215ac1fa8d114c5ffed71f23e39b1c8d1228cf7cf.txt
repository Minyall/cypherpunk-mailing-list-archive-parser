Ahhhhhhh, I don't know how to say this, but no such atack exists, and 
none will ever exist.  You can not EVER atack a cipher if the plaintext 
is "random", as you have no basis for saying which "plaintext" is in fact 
the "plaintext".  Now if you know the plaintext(random bits) this is a 
different story.
