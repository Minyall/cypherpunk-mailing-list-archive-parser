Please note that MIME is an encapsulation methodology -- ZMail,
Eudora, AMS and others are implementations.

Netscape is an implementation. HTML and HTTP are the things that it
implements (along with some other protocols).

Just keep in mind the distinction between a standard and the
implementations of that standard -- they are different.
