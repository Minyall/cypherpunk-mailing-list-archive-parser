I'll definitely agree that for something as binding as a signature that 
I would want to have a very large key. For daily communication it seems 
that fairly weak keys should be more than adequate as long as they 
can't be broken in a reasonable amount of time. I'm  interested in what 
most of the people on this list would consider a reasonable amount of 
time though. It seems that the average person doesn't have adversaries 
with the know-how and computing power to break even a 64 digit key let 
alone a 129 digit key. Consider the group of people that broke the RSA 
key, they would not fit the profile of the average person, let alone 
the average computer user. I doubt if the local police department here 
could convince the NSA that they need to crack my e-mail because I 
might be conspiring to commit some illegal act and I doubt that they 
could put my e-mail out on the net saying, "here's some encoded data, 
does anybody know what it says?" Right now that's the only two ways 
that I could think of for someone to get some encrypted data unencrypted.
