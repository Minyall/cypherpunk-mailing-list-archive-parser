[concerning a low RSA modulus]

I haven't had a chance to look at Matt's post very much...

Actually, I beleive the largest concern over using a small modulus is
if you encrypt a message to multiple recipients (i.e. an identical
message to several people)

This then leaves you open to the "low modulus attack" (how
appropriately named :-) as described by Judith Moore in her paper
"Protocol Failures in Cryptosystems".  This paper also appears in the
Simmons big book on Crypto.

Basically, the message can be reconstructed with the Chinese Remainder
Theorem (I beleive, it's been a while since I worked through it).

To prevent this, random bits should be appended to change the message
for each person.
