Now wait a minute, Perry.  If a device is going to use other than a 
set of known moduli or even just one, how are two devices going to each
know what the other is using without a listner knowing?  I think it is
pretty much agreed that devices that use "secret" numbers are not very
practical.  What you say seems to indicate that D-H as we know and
love it has been rendered obsolete because it depends on the modulus
being known.  What am I missing?
