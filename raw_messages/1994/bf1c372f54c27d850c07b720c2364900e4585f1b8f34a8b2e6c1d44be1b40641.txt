For that matter, the trivial use of the Dining Cryptographers algorithm
really doesn't involve anything I consider True Crypto: it's just
coin flips and xors -- more of an "encoding" than an "encryption".
Notice there is no encryption/decryption key.  As in DH, the information
emerges in the end if you follow the protocol.  
 
# be an updated RSAREF version including Diffie-Hellman key exchange, 

Try writing to burt@rsa.com and asking for it.  They sent it to me.   strick
