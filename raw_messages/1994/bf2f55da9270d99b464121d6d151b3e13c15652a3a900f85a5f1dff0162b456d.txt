You made the assertion in your rebuttal about area -v- volume in relation
to black holes and event horizons about the entire universe not being   
containable in a volumn, if you accept this premice then you have to accept
the premice that the universe is unbouded and hence not containable. This 
leads the bounds on the B-equation to be infinitly large number of possible
states.
