Who is writing or doing this crap!!!! This is ludicrous... It's 
brainwashing and it teaches nothing but ignorance... If you want your 
cchildren to learn things you expose them to everything, but you guide 
them through it. If you can't do that, you will ultimately fail as a 
parent. Why hire someone to tell your kids what they should be reading. 
Soon people will be banning books like Huck Finn, The Crucible, Grapes of 
Wrath, and many others through this method of CES... THE FUTURE OF 
TOMORROW WILL BE DOOMED IF THIS THING TAKEN SERIOUSLY FOR USAGE!!!!
