I believe it was stated (correctly, according to my understanding) that one
may use any pseudonym, as long as the intention in using it is not to
commit a crime.

Copyright infringement _is_, like it or not, a crime.

There is not, to the best of my knowledge, any such thing as "a legal
pseudonym".
