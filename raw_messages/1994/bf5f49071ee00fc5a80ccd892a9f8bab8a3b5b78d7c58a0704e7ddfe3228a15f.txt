Did anybody see the Larry King Live show last night (6/15)?
He had Al Gore & others on, talking about the nations future
information infrastructure. There were a few words about the
Clipper. 

Gore said something like, "There are people out there who think
that it's o.k. to do away with the FBI's ability to tap the
communications of terrorists & drug lords." He went on to
describe a future scenario where a terrorist group is able to
detonate a nuclear device in an urban area because they can
have secure communications.

The show was pretty one-sided.
