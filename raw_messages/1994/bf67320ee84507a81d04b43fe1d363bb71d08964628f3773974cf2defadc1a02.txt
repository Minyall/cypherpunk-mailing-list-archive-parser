I'd say it's pretty obvious, from the many articles, editorials, etc.
against Clipper. Cypherpunks were by no means the only, or even the
dominant, factor. Many factors were involved.

Clipper became a national joke, with 80% of polled Americans against
it. And corporations were loathe to associate themselves with it,
especially after the initial, highly-negative reaction.

A campaign of ridicule is often effective.

If and when Microsoft unveils government-friendly key escrow, I expect
we'll be ready with some nice slogans...I know I will!
