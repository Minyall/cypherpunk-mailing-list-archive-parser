It's a one-liner in the .forward or .maildelivery file you edit to
set up a remailer.  Almost anybody could act as a "bounce point" in
this fashion.  I don't think it would do much for joe@uptight.org,
though.  root@uptight is more likely to notice the traffic than to
happen across joe advertising his remailer in alt.random.group.

Try "man forward".  (Or "man maildelivery" in my case, but probably
not netcom's.)  This sort of handling happens before the MUA sees
the mail.
