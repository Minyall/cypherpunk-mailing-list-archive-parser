I've already said it.  I own the copyright to my posts, and only permit
them to be distributed by Usenet because I can *cancel* and provide
expiration dates with my posts.  CD-ROMs do not provide these standard
Usenet message control features.

If I issue a cancel message, it's obvious that I'm asserting control
over the further distribution of my content (sites that ignore them
notwithstanding.)  Any time a CD-ROM is published with my message, and
it contains an expiration date or is later cancelled, the publication
violates my right as a copyright holder to retract my message.

My expiration dates or cancel messages are perfectly reasonable ways
to communicate the way in which I'm exercising my copyright.  Netcom
and other service providers currently honor those communications, but
CD-ROM publishers of Usenet news do not.
