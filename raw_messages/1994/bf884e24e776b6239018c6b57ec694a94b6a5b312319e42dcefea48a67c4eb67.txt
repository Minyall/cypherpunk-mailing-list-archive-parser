Does the GIF have to portray a person of the female persuasion in order 
for the "hostile" environment to be created, or will any sexually 
oriented image suffice?

Yes, the Canadians are way ahead of us in the area of censorship.  In 
addition to drawings and stories, anything which suggests that sexual 
relationships between adults and minors are not always harmful is also 
prohibited by law.  If you do a piece of scientific research on 
intergenerational relationships, it can only be published in Canada if it 
concludes such relationships are harmful.  One sex study which came to 
the "wrong" conclusion has already been banned by the Canadian government.

I would make that "most Americans".  But only after they finish their 
current crusade to bring back flogging. :)
