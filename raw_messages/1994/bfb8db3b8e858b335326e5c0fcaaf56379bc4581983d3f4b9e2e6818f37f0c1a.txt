How much alpha do you really need (he asked, wondering when somebody
will get irate and insist this thread be terminated)?  I have some
mineral specimens at home that are fairly hot (uraninite,
cuprousklodowskite, and something else similar) with (this
non-physicist thinks) mostly alpha emissions.  Such things can be had
at your next gem & mineral show, if you're lucky.
