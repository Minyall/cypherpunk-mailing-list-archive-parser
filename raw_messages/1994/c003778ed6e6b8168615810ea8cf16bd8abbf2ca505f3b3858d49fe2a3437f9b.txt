Certainly passwords are not the only threat, and the rarity of Tempest
equipment at the local computer store does mean that the TLAs keep an
ability to spy on anyone they can aim an antenna at, but for some
folks (read: most folks) there might be much easier ways.

I actually don't worry so much about RF monitoring because the natural
evolution of computers is slowly killing emmisions.  Particularly for
battery operated equipment and equipment near OSHA inspectors.
