I agree and fully understand this. But in a situation where a remailer 
operator might realize that spamming is occurring, it could provide quick, 
temporary relief from the pain and embarrassment of athlete's spamming. :)
If 20 spams get thru and there are 200 more on the way, source blocking 
can stop this at least temporarily.
