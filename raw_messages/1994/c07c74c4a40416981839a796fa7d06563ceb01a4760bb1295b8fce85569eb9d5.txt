I happen to be in exactly the right location, the Santa Cruz area,
from whence this idea originates, but I have no interest in such
gimmickry.

I say gimmickry because it is just using Mosaic ("home pizza pages," I
guess) to place the order, just as with a cellphone, a fax machine,
whatever. Payment is *not* made over the Net.

Ho hum. Sadly, it is already being dubbed "the first case of true
Internet commerce." Yeah, like the Coke machines on the Net so many
years ago were examples of Internet commerce.

Pure hype. Madison Avenue nonsense. Good for our tabloid generation.
