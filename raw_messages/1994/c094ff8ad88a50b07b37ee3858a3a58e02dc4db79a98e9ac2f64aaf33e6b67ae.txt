I want to know whether GATT will affect the export of encryption
software. It seems to frown upon any barrier to trade and I think
I could argue, perhaps not correctly, that if ACME in Taiwan
can't buy the necessary encryption software to do business with
CENTRAL in Kansas, then ACME is prevented from competing in America.
BONEHEAD Inc, from North Dakota won't have to worry about foreign
competition. 

This means that either there can be no secure international EDI 
standard that anyone can use to do business or there will be 
trade barriers to foreigners interacting with American firms. 


Of course, this is just a random conjecture based upon a conversation
I had with Dave Banisar. Is it silly? Or sensible? 

I'm sure there are exemptions for military hardware, but heck, when
it comes down to it food is the ultimate strategic resource. Where
does crypto lie in this spectrum? Everyone knows where it lies in 
the eyes of the NSA. Where does it lie in other people's reality?
