Schneier has a good discussion of this. Suffice it to say, if I have a
magic collision search box, I might very well be able to produce an
interesting result very easily.

Imagine the existance or nonexistance of a space at some number of
locations in a document as being a bit. Then, imagine that I have a
hash signed by you. If I can search very fast, I could compose a
contract that you never signed, and search through the trivial
variations of that contract with spaces present or absent at some
number of points. I can thus trivially generate the number of
variations on the contract needed to find a collision -- if I can only
search those variations fast enough you lose.

Given that ten million dollars isn't real money, if this is true MD5
isn't worth that much any longer -- it certainly isn't safe for use in
signing digital drafts, for example.
