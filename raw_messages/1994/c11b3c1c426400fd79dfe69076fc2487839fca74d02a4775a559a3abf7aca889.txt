Here's the latest schedule of events... looks like the only public
meeting left is on the 27th.

What the heck is the National Security Telecommunications Advisory
Committee?  (see Oct. 17-19)

Any brave cypherpunks in the area of "lecture room B" feel like
venturing into the den of the enemy and reporting?  NIST is lecturing
to the Committee on Applications and Technology... is that a
congressional thing?  Might there be a chance it'll appear on C-span?
