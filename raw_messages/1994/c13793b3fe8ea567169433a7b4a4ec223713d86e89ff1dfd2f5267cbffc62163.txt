Sorry, but I didn't know I'd subscribed to an alt.talk.politics-style
or alt.anarchy-style mailing list.  The discussion is interesting, and
the essays erudite, but the topic is not what I was looking for.

Can someone tell me if there's a list around somewhere that cypherpunks
use to discuss the means and mechanisms, and the pros and cons of open
and guerilla crypto?
