Wow, Bob, what a vision.

You (and Dr Denning and certainly the gov't) seem to be afraid that:

Freedom of association was so revered by the founders of this country that
they put it in the very first amendment to the Constitution.  If I am not
free to meet with my friends, associates or others, then what freedom do I
have?

Yes, I'm a First Amendment purist.  <shrug>  I'm sorry, but visions of
nameless, faceless "Bad Guys" with nameless, faceless nefarious plans just
don't move me.

I understand that the pro-Clipper people feel a real danger and are trying
to block against it.  But there are real nameable, quantifiable dangers all
around me and if I want protection I'll ask for it.

Till then...

First they stole the fourth amendment.
    I said nothing because I don't deal drugs.
Then they took the sixth amendment.
    I was silent because I know I'm  not guilty.
When they came for the second amendment,
    I kept quiet because I don't own a gun.
Now they've come for the first amendment,
    and I can't say anything at all.

We are Chaos Boys.  We are coming to a paradigm near you.
