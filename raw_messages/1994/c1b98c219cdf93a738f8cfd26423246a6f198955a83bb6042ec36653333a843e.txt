Because many, probably most of us aren't participants, and these items
are of greater cryptological relavence than much, if not most, of the
material on the list.

How would a note about the drafts being pending and the posting of the
announcement be significantly different?  I appreciate the MIME
encoding of the mail, since my MIME mail reader can go out and pull
them for me.
