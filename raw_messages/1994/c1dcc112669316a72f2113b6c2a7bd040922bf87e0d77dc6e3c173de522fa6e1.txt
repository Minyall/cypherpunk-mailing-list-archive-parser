Ah - so provide an unencrypted list for the software-challenged and
the merely lazy.

The incentive for using the encrypted list, then? Simple --
	1. Increasing ones personal encrypted-to-unencrypted ratio
and
	2. The old chestnut -- delay the unencrypted list 24 hours.

Do I need to insert the stereotype that those who can't run procmail
are probably experiencing worse delays than the above thanks to their
UUCP feed? Or is enough to use the "information*timeliness=value"
argument that's been advanced in the past to advocate encrypting
traffic *to* the list? Either way, the rhetorical advantage still lies
in the turnaround time to the list.

I believe it's traditional to reply "Indeed."
