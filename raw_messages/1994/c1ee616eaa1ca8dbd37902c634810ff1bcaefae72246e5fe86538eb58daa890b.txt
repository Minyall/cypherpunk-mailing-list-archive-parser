Apparently it was a spoof, but whatever.  I'd be really bugged by
the security implications of software claiming to have validated
signatures; software that complains about bogus sigs is fine,
since if it's spoofed it's only a warning, and if the warnings
are deleted your trust is still somewhat limited unless you've verified
the signatures yourself.  Trusting someone else's verification
is less than ideal security policy :-)

Cypherpunks signature checking agent:  It's valid - trust me!
