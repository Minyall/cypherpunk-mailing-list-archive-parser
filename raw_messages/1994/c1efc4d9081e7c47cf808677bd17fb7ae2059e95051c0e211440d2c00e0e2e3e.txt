I think the question of storage goes beyond copyright law.  I have yet to 
find someone who lost a suit for owning a copy of a magazine.  But since 
you feel the way you do about CDs, why don't you scan in a couple of 
issues of Life magazine, master it, and try to sell it?  Do they supply 
Inet feeds in prison?

Have you ever published an article in say a not-for profit journal?  Just 
because you don't sine a contract guaranteeing your rights DOES NOT mean 
you have given them up!

There IS an implied motivation to put that material

Now that you have set your rate, I set mine.  Please remit your check of 
$10,000....  I think this is getting a bit carried away.  Copyright cases 
generally relate to the sale or use of material belonging to an author.  
As I said above, I have never heard of a case where someone lost a suit 
for posessing a 1942 issue of Life magazine.
