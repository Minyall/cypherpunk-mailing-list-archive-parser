What I do is I zipped up my pubring.pgp and secring.pgp files into an 
encrypted zip file, then used PGP's conventional encryption to encrypt 
the zipfile.

Then to use pgp, I run a batch file that copies the encrypted zip files to a 
ramdrive, decrypt the conventional encryption by prompting for the password, 
then having pkunzip decompress the zipfile and prompting for it's password, 
and then presto.
