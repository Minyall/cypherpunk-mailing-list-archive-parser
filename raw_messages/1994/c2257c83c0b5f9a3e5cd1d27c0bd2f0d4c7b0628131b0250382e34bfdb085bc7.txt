ELECTRONIC EAVESDROPPING
A measure soon to be introduced on Capitol Hill would require that all
network providers, including the Internet and commercial on-line services,
build in the capability to record any person's e-mail and deliver it to
federal law-enforcement authorities. Government agents will need only to
show a person merits investigation, rather than obtain a court order as is
the case for telephone eavesdropping. (Business Week 3/14/94 p.55)
