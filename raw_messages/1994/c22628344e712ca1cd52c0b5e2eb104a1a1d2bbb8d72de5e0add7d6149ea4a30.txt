Actually, I _think_ I've read an article in a pop-science magazine about 
some work of Hawking's that indicated there was a minimum amount of energy 
neccesary to do some sort of quanta of computation. (is there such a thing
? I don't know enough about the math, I'm afraid. INformation theory?)
If my memory serves, he used this to hint at a solution to the 
"why does time only flow in one direction, when the mathematics are perfectly
symmetrical both ways?" question. 
 
But I could be wrong. Sorry I don't have any better info then you.
