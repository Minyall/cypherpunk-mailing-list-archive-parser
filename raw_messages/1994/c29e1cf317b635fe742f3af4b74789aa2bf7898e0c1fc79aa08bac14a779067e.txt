This was one of those "MIME" things I got, that tell me to "Hit any
key to go on," "Now press ^H-Alt-Hyper-Abort to return to the main
menu."


Did I miss something here?

This is not a flame, but there sure has been an increase in the
frequency of this strange MIME messages lately. (At least with the
practical demise of NeXT, I've been seeing fewer and fewer of those
"NewGrazer" (?) messages.)
