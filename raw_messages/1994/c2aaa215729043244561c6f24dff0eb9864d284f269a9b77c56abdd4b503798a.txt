I don't know whether that's what he means or not, but it's true.  In a
mod(pq) system, every number with square roots has four of them.
Given two of these that don't add up to 0 (mod pq), you can find a
factor of pq by GCD(pq, sqrt1+sqrt2).

Example: pq = 15, a = 1.  Square roots are 1, 4, 11, 14.  Choose two
of these: 1+11 = 12.  GCD(15, 12) = 3, which is a factor of pq.

This can be proved using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
