Hi Everyone.

I've been lurking on this very interesting list, but I figured this needed
to be commented on. ;-)

This kind of fascism has, IMO, doomed PGP 2.6 before it's even met full
release status.  Not only do I disagree with the principles behind this,
but it shuts out the rest of the world from reading messages originating
in Canada and the U.S., which more than anything else will kill PGP 2.6. 
After all, the world most certainly does not revolve around North America.

I'd say that it's high time for another European release of PGP.
