The most famous and widely used plagiarism detector here at Berkeley
must be the one John Osterhout wrote. It basically detects
similarities in program structure (call graph, loops, conditionals,
etc.)

It was used in the undergraduate compilers class. I believe the output
of the program is a list of pairs, ordered by decreasing similarity.
The professor spoke to the top two matches, they both ended up
confessing. He didn't check more for lack of time.

I believe the source code _isn't_ publicly available.

Good luck.
