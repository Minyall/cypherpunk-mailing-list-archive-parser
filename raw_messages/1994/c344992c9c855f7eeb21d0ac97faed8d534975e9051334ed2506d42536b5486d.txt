Amanda Walker criticezes SSL because it is irrelevant to
the threat that people are likely to be concerned about.

This seems a very relevant criticism:  Has Amanda, or anyone else
proposed an extension to HTML that would incorporate such things?

for example:

<ENCRYPT ALG=soandso PUBLICKEY=87hfkjjhfd98uyeuihdhiucschhuichcxzcxhjcxjlcx
fkfdhfhjdhjkvcccv3454DFFl l79*79 y978yy98gk gkghgksdghsdkghasdsak>
Encrypted and possibly signed material.
</ENCRYPT ALG=soandso SIG=3489347893uisdjhkfdy897r4hf893r4hjf>

(with any special html characters, such as '<' and '>', being escaped
in the ascii armored bitstreams.

Or did the standards groups that Netscape has been ignoring not
bother to discuss such matters?
