	I was thinking about this the other day.. and my first reaction
was the following.

	What if you encrypted the document with p/k and made multiple
copies of the same [private] key.  Then you encrypted each copy of the
key with a user's public key.  Now each user has a copy of the private key.
If you decide Joe SHOULDN'T have access to the data anymore, you can
re-encrypt the document and redistribute the p/k encrypted copies of the
key.  There may be some fancy algorithms to achieve more security.. and
ease of use.. but that's the answer I came up with.  TTFN!
