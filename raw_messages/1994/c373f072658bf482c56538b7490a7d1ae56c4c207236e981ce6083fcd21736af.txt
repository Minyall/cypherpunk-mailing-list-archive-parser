I first want to thank Karl Barrus for making my Cyphernomicon FAQ
available in separate chapters.

And to answer question raised above by JOHNKC, either of the following
will get you to Karl's files (I found them by gopher, but anonymous
ftp showed various files, but nothing obvious to me as the files that
gopher showed...but I didn't look too hard):

gopher chaos.bsu.edu 

ftp chaos.bsu.edu
