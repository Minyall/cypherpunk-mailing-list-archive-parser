I don't see where this complication arises from. Assuming that you have
already created a floating rate exchange apparatus between dollars and
digicash [maybe you aren't making this assumption and that is where my
confusion arises from] all you have to do is invest the money that
backs the digicash and make regular, frequent and public reports about
how well it is doing. The exchange rate will then naturally parallel
and the interest problem is solved without any extra more complication than
is involved in the creation of a floating rate exchange mechanism.
