I think the question is premature, but the intention isn't. We ought
to give Phil a few days to figure out what his future strategy is.
Meanwhile, anyone with contacts at EFF ought to emphasize to Mike
Godwin and others there the importance of this particular opening --
by potentially giving Phil standing to sue on the clearest conceivable
case, in which their position is the most clearly indefensible,
they've produced a clear opening to shatter export control over
software published on the internet in court.
