Some of them do, some of them don't, at least for anon-ftp.  I have accounts
behind two different kinds of firewalls - the accounts behind router-based
firewalls have difficulty with the FTP servers that authenticate using
RFC931 or DNS, since the firewall blocks them, while the accounts behind
the AT&T Firewall (ref. Cheswick and Bellovin) need to use proxy ftp clients,
but don't have trouble accessing the servers, which think (incorrectly)
that the requests are coming from the outside part of the firewall.
