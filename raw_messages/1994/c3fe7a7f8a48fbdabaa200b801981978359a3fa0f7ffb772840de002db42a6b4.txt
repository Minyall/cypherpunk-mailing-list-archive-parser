   Indeed.  Archie for DEPL.ZIP or DEPLSRC.ZIP - the program is called 
Delam's Elite Password Leecher (sic) and will do exactly this task.  Also 
you could write a 5 minute TSR in the language of your choice to hook 
interrupt 9 and write to a logfile; examples of this are all over the 
net.  If you must, post to alt.2600 asking for one, and 18,000 k0de 
k1ddies will mail you back uu'd copies.
