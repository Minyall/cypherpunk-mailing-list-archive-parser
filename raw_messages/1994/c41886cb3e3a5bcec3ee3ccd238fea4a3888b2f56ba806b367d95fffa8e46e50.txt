"Crypto-weak" as opposed to "crypto-strong", cryptographically strong.
The guy was testing BSD random(), which I think is Yet Another Linear
Congruential Generator.  If you think an LC PRNG has cryptographic
relevance, you are gravely mistaken.

What's so hard about "crypto-related"?  If you can't think of any
relationship between the articles and cryptography (technical,
social, political, whatever), don't forward them.  If they had been
about cryptoanalysis of random(), that might be relevant, though
hardly ground-breaking.

So I see.  You're not willing to take it upon youself to mail copies
to people who can't otherwise get them, but you're happy to inflict
irrelevant material straight out of Knuth on people who could easily
get it themselves.  What *is* your rationale here?

Source code, yes.  Would you like to explain its relationship to crypto?
