So why pick specifically on cryptography?  Why not increase penalties
for criminals who in their crimes are found to have used:

*	computers;
*	pagers;
*	cellular phones;
*	Casio watches with multiple alarms;
*	Cars with power windows;
*	Velcro-fastening tennis shoes;
*	Gore-Tex jackets;
*	Ibuprofen pain relievers;
*	Fat-free ice cream;
