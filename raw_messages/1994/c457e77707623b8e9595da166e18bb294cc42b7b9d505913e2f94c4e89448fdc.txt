Assuming for the moment that alleged-RC4 came from the keyboard of Ron
Rivest, my question is whether to look at this as an amateur cipher from a
famous cryptologist -- or as a carefully designed cipher from a
professional.  If it's the latter, we should probably look for some
underlying strengths the way the community picked apart S-box design rules
years ago.
