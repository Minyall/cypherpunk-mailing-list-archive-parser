So far some kind people have sent me two key blocks:

The first was

- -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

which is for a Compuserve account Hal apparently has. This wasn't used to sign
the recent messages.

The second was

- -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: 2.6.2

which didn't contain any keys I didn't already have.

I'm still seeking the key used to sign the recent messages from Hal.
I should have mentioned before that it should have Key ID 4ECBD301.
When I find it I'll send it to the list.
