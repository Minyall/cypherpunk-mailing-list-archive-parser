Subject: I posted "gtoal" string to 3 groups

Just to let you know, I took up the challenge Graham Toal proposed: I
posted messages with the string "gtoal" somewhere in them. For good
measure, I did it in 3 Usenet newsgroups.

I did this more than a week ago, and have not seen any reponse, any
indication that Graham found the messages.

(I didn't announce that I was planning to send the messages, as that
would make it "too easy"--a real signal would not be planned in
advance like this, so I chose to say nothing.)

Any comments from Graham?

If I missed this, I'm sorry. I've been travelling, but think I've at
least _seen_ most or all messages.
