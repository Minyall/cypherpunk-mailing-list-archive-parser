Well, it could, just posibly, once in the enrtopy of your adverage 
algorithim, but then, as you pointed out, you could just use DES as a 
magic IDEA decoder:-)

You can prove that there is no such interaction if you use two different 
algorithims on two halfs of a one time pad message, even with the SAME key.
