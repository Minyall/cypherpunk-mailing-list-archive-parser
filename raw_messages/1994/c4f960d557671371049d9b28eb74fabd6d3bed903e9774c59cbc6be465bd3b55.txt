Lead Story

* In February, the Royal Bank of Scotland announced that it would begin
to issue extra check-cashing ID cards to its transvestite customers who
request them -- so that they might have separate cards depicting
themselves dressed as male and female in order to "avoid embarrassment
or difficulties," according to a Bank spokesman. [Globe and Mail-Reuter,
