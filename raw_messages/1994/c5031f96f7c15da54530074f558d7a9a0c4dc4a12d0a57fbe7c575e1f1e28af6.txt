There has been a lot of discussion of cryptography/communications
issues on the UWSA reflector (uwsa@shell.portal.com).  This list is
monitored by people who work for Perot, so post there and it might
get his attention.

You can be added to the reflector by e-mailing to:
telcon@shell.portal.com  [I think that's right - I believe it 
used to be telconsort@shell.portal.com]
