Yes and no.  All you really get is usenet and email.  Plus irc, I think,
although I have never used that.  You can't telnet or ftp out, although you
can telnet or ftp in.  Your disk space is limited to 2meg, and all your
files expire every 2 or 3 days.

As I recall, you have to receive a letter from them with your password, so
they know at least your address (no PO box, I think, not sure, been too
long), and they require you to use your real name.  They're actually pretty
cool, but they have a couple of rules about abusing the account.  They do
carry all the Usenet groups.

Also, there are times when it is impossible to log in.  Many times, when
you do get in, the response time is unacceptable.

Still, it's better than nothing.  Especially if you have no other way to
get alt.binaries.pictures.tasteless.
