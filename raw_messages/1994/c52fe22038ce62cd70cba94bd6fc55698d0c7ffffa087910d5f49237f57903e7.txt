The last two messages I've sent through remailers have taken upwards of 
two days to arrive at their destinations.  Parallel messages sent 
directly arrived immediately.

The two remailers are Hal's and rebma.

What is making this happen?  Is it related to all the recent PGP FAQ 
traffic?  Which remailers if any are not suffering from these lags?

THX,
