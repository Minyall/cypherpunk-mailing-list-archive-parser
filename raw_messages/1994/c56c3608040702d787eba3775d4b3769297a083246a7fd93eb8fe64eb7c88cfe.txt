   What is SELF-DECRYPTING STENOGRAPHY? Something like a self-extracting
PKZIP file. Its definition would be: picture + password = plaintext.

   Its utility? Imagine a bunch of state agents searching your pc
& they find a subdirectory of pretty pictures. The stenography has no
telltale flag or tag. No embarrassing arguments with a judge about
passwords or contempt or court. No hassles with customs agents. No
interceptions of internet code pointing you out as a dangerous
dissident or freeman. Just a bunch of pretty pictures!

   Admittedly, programming it could be a bitch. But then, succeeding
with it would put your reputation up there with Zimmerman & the RSA
discoverers. It would also give us all a wonderfully safe method of
encryption. The encryption engine itself could be of our own choosing.
I would recommend IDEA.

   Your programming job would consist of 2 problems. 1. The method
of taking out your already encrypted data from a picture.
2. the bootstrapping method of having the picture with password unravel
itself.  One might be a little difficult but I would guess it would just
be some assembler drudge work, taking a month or two if you are
experienced. Two might be very tricky & you might be forced to resort to
a small hidden or remembered xor type assembly program.

   Only the decryptor would be tricky. The encryptor would be much
simpler since it would all be hidden in a pretty picture!

   When strong cryptography is outlawed, only outlaws with
SELF-DECRYPTING STENOGRAPHY will converse with impunity.
