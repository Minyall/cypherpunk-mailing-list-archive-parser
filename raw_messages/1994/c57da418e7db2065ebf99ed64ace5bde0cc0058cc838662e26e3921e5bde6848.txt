Why?  If you XOR-split the message and encrypt each mask differently,
you are /guaranteed/ that all of the encryption methods must be
broken to retrieve the original.  If you use repeated encryption,
this is much harder to prove, and not always true.  There's a result
that if you choose the first cipher unwisely, you're hosed no matter
what you do on top of it.
