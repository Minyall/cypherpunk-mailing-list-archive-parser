This appears to be merely hot air, since despite all his talk Master 
Knight hasn't taken any "action" and it is doubtful that he has the money 
or other "necessities" requisite for doing so. Also, notice the term 
"beliefs", which explains a lot. I thought were were having a discussion 
on a legal or academic basis, not one involving religeous or 
philosophical "beliefs" or faith.
