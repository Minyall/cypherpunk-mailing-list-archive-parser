Thanks Bob... that admission from the opposing forces has
made all of our effort in this fight worth it...

This makes the complete devaluation of this "Clipper/Tessara"
nightmare relatively easy.... we doing good... keep the pressure up!!
This has lifted the fog of battle for us momentarily...
