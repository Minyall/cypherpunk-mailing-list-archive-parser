This is the way to go.  Serial port real estate is way too scarce in the
average PC.  Besides, this approach makes the design easier and has
another advantage...

Yes, this can be a real problem.  So design the card such that the noise
source runs continuously at a high speed, and feeds an 8-bit shift
register.  Place a latch on the output of the register, and set up
decoding logic to read the latch in a memory-mapped port position.
Ports are available, if you look and plan around the popular ones (such
as UARTs, soundblasters, CD-ROM cards, etc.).  You'll want to make it
configurable to several possible ports.  This design assures that each
random byte can only be read once.  A TSR couldn't read the card in
parallel (because reading a port doesn't require hooking an interrupt),
so the only way to compromise it is to subvert the application reading
the card.  Conventional anti-virus protection can see to it that the app
remains trustworthy.

I hack both.  Hardware is fun!
