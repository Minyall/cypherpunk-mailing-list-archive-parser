I was going to say that an SSL-aware proxy daemon could play "man in
the middle" and pass through the SSL handshaking messages which occur
at connection time, so that the user client could authenticate the
remote server, then communicate using a key shared with that server but
which the proxy would not know.

But that won't work with SSL, I guess.  The SSL handshaking goes on
before any message data has been exchanged; in particular, before the
URL is sent to the proxy to tell it what server to connect to.  (Hiding
URL's is one of the features of SSL.) So in fact with SSL the only
authentication possible is between proxy and user, and then between
proxy and remote server.  There doesn't seem to be a place in the
protocol where the user could authenticate the remote server and create
a key which would not be known to the proxy.  This does seem to be a
deficiency.
