Which is kind of a problem for a floating city, since stones don't
float very well, concrete canoes excepted :-)

I'm not sure their economics can float that well either - if it costs
$500M to build, and holds 1000 people, that means $500K/person....
Maybe they're looking at more people or less money.
Nice T-Shirts and promo material, though.
