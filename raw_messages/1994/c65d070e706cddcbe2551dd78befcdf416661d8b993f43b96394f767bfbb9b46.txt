I probably wasn't clear. I didn't mean just talking, with no actions,
but talking about new remailer features designed to thwart law
enforcement, and then implementing the features.

(In this interpretation, the remailers that many of us have talked
about, designed, written software, run on our systems, etc., could be
considered to be part of a conspiracy, should Bidzos, Mykotronx,
ClariNet, the Feds, etc., choose to focus on remailers as "a
continuing criminal enterprise.")

We've done more than just talk, you'll have to agree.
