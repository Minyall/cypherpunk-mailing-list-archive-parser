Every PRNG needs to be seeded somehow.  I was thinking he meant to
start the process with a secret key.  The main problem I see (assuming
you hash the blocks down to get decent random data) is that CD-ROMs
aren't all that big.

(The vast majority of CD-ROM drives, by the way, cannot make a bit-for-bit
 copy of audio CD's.  The record industry was unhappy with this idea.)
