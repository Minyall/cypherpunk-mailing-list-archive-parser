Would you pray tell why these are not 'rights' under that government and
why they are not as 'natural' as any other right?

 Seems to me these are all results of recognizing that property is a possesion
since even optical cables and such are property, either intellectual or 
otherwise. If a government, when formed, is given a charter which limits
the ability of others to access these possessions then I hold their is an
implied 'natural' right.
