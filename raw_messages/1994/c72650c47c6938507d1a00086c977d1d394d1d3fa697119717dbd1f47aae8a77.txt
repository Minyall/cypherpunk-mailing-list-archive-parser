 I agree with those who oppose unwarranted attacks on Dr Dennings
character. She is by all accounts an intelligent, well-mannered
person and deserves to be treated as such.

  I completely disagree with her about clipper however. I have
watched with growing horror as our government over the last 15
years has slowly turned into a near fascist state. Black clad
commandos storming a religious group's compound deliberately
inciting an armed confrontation, then harrassing for more then a
month, then initiating an attack that left most members including
the children dead. People who had not been convicted of anything. 

 We are told if we only knew, we would support clipper, I think
not. Hide behind your secret information if you chose, we have a
general idea of what you fear anyway. We are less worried about
nuclear/chemical/biological/informational terrorists then we are of
what our government could become with such fascist tools. After
all, there are terrorist acts now, when you can listen.

 Its about privacy...... Its about adults making their own
decisions, not some paternalistic government, no matter how well
meaning, doing it for us.

We will build the tools we need, we will bypass attempts to stop
us, we will advance till our communication ressembles noise.
