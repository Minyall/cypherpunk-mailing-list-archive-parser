   Does not everyone get a complete header like the one below from 
   Eric's post with incoming mail?  

Everyone gets it, but the better readers don't show it to the user.
Many people don't even know about those hidden headers, perhaps most.

   I had assumed that because every mail received here has such a 
   header that everyone else could also see who sent my mail, 
   signed or not.  That is why I have not signed my posts.

The Received: fields can be forged.  You can even forge your own with
the cypherpunks remailers and ##.

   BTW, Pipeline does not allow anonymously-sent direct mail -- as 
   a take it or leave it policy.  So we cannot manipulate headers 
   to forge from this Windows-driven end.

That's what the :: syntax was invented for, for folks who can't
manipulate headers in their systems.  The original purpose was for
Fidonet, and Tom Jennings, who couldn't use the remailers at the time.

What :: does is glue in the headers you want _at the receiving end_.
If your service passes message bodies with no harm, these soon-to-be
header fields will pass just fine.
