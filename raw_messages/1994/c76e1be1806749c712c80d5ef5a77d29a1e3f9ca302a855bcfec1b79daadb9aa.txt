	I was told/taught/have read that _Griswold v. Connecticut_ 
(1965?) was a key case in defining the "Constitutional Right to Privacy." 
Briefly, Griswold was representing Planned Parenthood, and was 
challenging a CT law that made it illegal to give information about birth 
control to anyone except married couples. The Supremes said that this was 
an undue invasion of privacy, and that there *was* a Constitutional right 
to privacy. They neglected to specify exactly where it was, though. ;) 
However, they suggested that it was held somewhere under the Ninth Amendment.

Of course, 'assert (Mike == LAWYER);' fails during runtime. YMMV.
