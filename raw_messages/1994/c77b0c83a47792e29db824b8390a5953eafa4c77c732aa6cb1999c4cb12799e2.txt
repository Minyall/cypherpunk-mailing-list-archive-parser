Big Brother Chips?
The Clinton Administration has decided to foster use of "Clipper Chips"
in government communications equipment, thus allowing the FBI et al. to
eavesdrop on computerized messages.  The FBI reportedly is also
investigating increased use of "sniffer" programs, which steal passowrds
and access to private data on the Internet.
