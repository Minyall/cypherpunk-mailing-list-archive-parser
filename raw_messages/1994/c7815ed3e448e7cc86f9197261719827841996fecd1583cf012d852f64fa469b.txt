Actually, there is work underway to to generate an inter-operation
between MIME and PGP, similar to the interoperation between MIME and
PEM.

It will *not* have detached signatures (i.e., a signature in one MIME
part which is signing another part).

The idea is to have two PGP types, one that is defines a PGP-encoded
text object, and one that defines a PGP-encoded MIME object.  When
using a text-object, it will just use PGP.  When its a MIME object,
the output from PGP will be run through a MIME program again (like
metamail).

Details are still being drawn.
