Lewis wasn't that hard to talk to at CFP'94.  He used to write the 
Executive Computer column in the Sunday Times so I've followed his stuff 
for years.  

I didn't see any problems with his Anarchy in Cyberspace article on 
Monday.  He was mostly talking about bad manners which exist on Internet 
and equally in the over-governed realms of the real world.  Nothing new 
there.  He is trying to interpret Cyberspace for the masses.  His job is 
not to be inside talking out.

Perhaps he could have talked about the problems potential regulators would 
face but that would be writing his article for him.
