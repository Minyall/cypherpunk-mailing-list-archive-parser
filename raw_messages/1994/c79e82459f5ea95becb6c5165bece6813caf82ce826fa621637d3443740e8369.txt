He's still mostly normal in e-mail.  However, I think it's best to be
careful what you say.  I once responded to a question of his about
actual instances of PSEUDOSPOOFING; I mentioned a user here who spent
some time replying to himself on rec.music.industrial.  His response
was something along the lines of "hee hee you're a tentacle", and
now look what he's doing to talk.politics.crypto et al....

Hal's analysis seems plausible to me.  This whole self-reply cascade
has got to be some kind of surreal propaganda maneuver.
