	The info in the pub ftp sites about the cypherpunks mailing
	list should probably make a mention of the volume of mail
	currently piled onto subscribers.  This would probably greatly
	reduce the number of subscribers who bail out a few days later
	and get on just the announce list (like me :-))...
