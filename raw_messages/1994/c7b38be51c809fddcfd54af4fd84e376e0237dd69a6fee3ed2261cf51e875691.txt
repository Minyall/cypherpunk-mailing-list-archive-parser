This is one of my favorite books as well.. You should have mentioned that 
Trent (the uncatchable) dislikes LINK so much that he STEALS it from 
under the nose of the government to free the Lunar network. No LINK, no 
monitoring and while the network is in chaos, the other hackers (players) 
and such can reorganize the system.
