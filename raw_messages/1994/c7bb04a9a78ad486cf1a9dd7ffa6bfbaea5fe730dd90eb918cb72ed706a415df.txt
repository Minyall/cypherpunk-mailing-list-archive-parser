Speaking of "Debt of Honor," I just finished it last week. The best
Clancy novel I've read in several years.

It bogs down in too many pages in the second half, in my opinion, but
the descripton of the U.S. financial system is masterful, a better
introduction to how monetary policy affects interest rates I haven't
seen.

And the description of the events surrounding a car defect is
chilling, and gripping.

I won't give any spoilers, but Clancy's solution to the problem of too
much government is, shall I say, "explosive." The Sato Solution is
something we can all work toward.
