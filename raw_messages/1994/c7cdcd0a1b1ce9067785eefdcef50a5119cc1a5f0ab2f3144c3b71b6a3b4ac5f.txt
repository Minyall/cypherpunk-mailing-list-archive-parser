Doug, you must be talking to my dad; he's Mr. Robichaux. Having
inadvertently offended the Digicash people in my previous message, let
me see if I can give equal time to what's wrong with FV in this
message.

Maybe it's just me. As a beta-shop owner, I expect to have Digicash
work with me when I have problems, concerns, or questions. Marcel,
Paul, and others at Digicash were very helpful during the incubation
period. My chief concern at this point is that there's no way for me
to get paid, and no publicly available date for same.

I didn't suggest that Stefan Brands, or anyone else, was being denied
access to the trial. I have no evidence to suggest any explanation for
his complaint, Hal Finney's, or mine-- other than that the Digicash
folks are very, very busy.

I think their attitude is that crypto's not _necessary_. I disagree;
Nathaniel Borenstein has already been taken to task on www-buyinfo for
that view. Their API supports TCP/IP transactions, so the mail
exchange is between the FV server and the buyer.

The very fact that FV has a set of terms and conditions that mention
exposure time, responsibility for fraud, and so on tells me that their
system is more fully fielded. I know, I know; ecash is in beta. That's
fine. I still want to be able to sell things _now_.

All of the above is true. You can't use FV for hard goods, the minimum
transaction cost rules out microtransactions, and the payment hang
time is too long. 

On the other hand, I can't use ecash for hard goods. I have no idea
what the transaction costs will be, and there's no way for sellers to
get paid _at all_.

You're right here, too. I happen to agree with the portion about
allowing try-before-you-buy access; in some cases that is a very
valuable way to gain market and mindshare. Remember the "Macintosh
Test Drive" in 1985?

Not. Read their web pages. There's a TCP/IP API, which I'm using. The
only mail exchange is from the FV server to the customer and back
again. As Hal pointed out, there are valid reasons to support systems
other than the Digicash e-wallet. After all, there will be offline
ecash, right?

First Virtual's chief advantage is that I can get paid. No fooling
with clearing, scalability, or anything else-- people can buy my
products.
