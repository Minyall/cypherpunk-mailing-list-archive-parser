Who cares.  A mention of WIRED in cypherpunks is far more noteworthy.  
The lag time inherent in magazine production, particularly a magazine 
dealing with the expansion of cyberspace, is oxymoronic.  Here, at least 
there is immediacy combined with no whit of concern for the expectations 
of readership. Wired isn't even worth reading any more.
