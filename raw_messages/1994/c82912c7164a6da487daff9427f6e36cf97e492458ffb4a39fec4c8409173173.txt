I'm pretty perplexed: What's wrong with the current Netnews (Usenet...),
Email, etc. setup?  It's very flexible and you can get access for
very reasonable amounts of money (even for a server).  The software's
free, the net is huge, etc...

I dislike BBS's alot compared to standard Internet services.

It's only expensive if you want online, realtime access, gigabytes/mo.
of traffic, etc.

Most systems/people on the Internet are not subsidized.  This is well known.
The critical mass of users has obviated the need for it.

I've been grappling with what features I'd like in the perfect
communications / BBS / Internet / online system.  Does anyone have
strong opinions about which features are important?

For instance: I find that my Unix Internet mail/news tools are an
order of magnitude more efficient than any BBS message base reader
I've ever encountered.
