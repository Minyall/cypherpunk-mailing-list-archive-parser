Apropos the recent thread on tamper-proof programs...

Can anyone think of a way that RSA-the-company could include some sort
of RSA-cryptosystem-secured check in a release of PGP so that it would
only interoperate with other versions that have the same check?  I don't
see how it could be done, but it's sure an intriguing idea.
