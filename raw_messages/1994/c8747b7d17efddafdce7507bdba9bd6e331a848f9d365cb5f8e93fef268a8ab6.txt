Distributing the key fingerprint allows J. Random Human to correlate a
key supplied via one method with that supplied via another. For
example, now that I have the fingerprint for the Betsi key, I can
verify whether any other alleged Betsi key I see is real or not.

It's a lot easier to read off & cross-check 32-character fingerprints
than the entire key block, especially as signatures are added and the
key block grows in size.
