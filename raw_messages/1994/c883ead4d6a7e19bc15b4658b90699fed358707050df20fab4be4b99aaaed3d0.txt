I greatly enjoyed Bruce Sterling's speec/rant/assessment of the entire 
CFP conference on Saturday afternoon.  Does anybody know if he will be 
posting the text of that speech on-line (as he has of other presentations 
he has made) or if somebody w/ access to one of the tapes of the speech 
will post a transcription?  If someone can get me a bootleg, I would be 
willing to do the typing.
