C'punks,

The Seminar will cover this in much greater detail, I'm sure but...

There are alternatives available.  Are you familiar with "selling short 
against the box"?  What about tax-free "contributions of capital" to 
corporations or trusts?

You are too smart to believe this.  Why not try to see the obvious 
solution rather than lament the "fact" that you are trapped?  For those 
of you who haven't followed Duncan's argument in favor of "attitude 
adjustment," the explanation is implicit in the defeatest attitude 
demonstrated above.

Stuff and nonsense.  The tactic Heinlein used, for the reasons he used 
it, would work just as well today.  Perhaps you are unfamiliar with what 
he actually did and why.  (Remind me to cover it in the Seminar.)
