I heard that they take orders at a central location, then a human phones
the PH closest to the customer and relays the order verbally. From my
experiences with PH, "real-time" to them is sometime that week.

It's just a high-tech way to have some low-paid drone screw up your
pizza order for you. More road kill on the ISH . . . thin crust, please.
