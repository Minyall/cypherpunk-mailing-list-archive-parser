That's true for transferable and off-line cash systems.  The same
argument doesn't hold for on-line systems.  There you can have an
exchange protocol to deposit a piece of digicash and immediately
rewithdraw it, blinding it again in the process.  There need be no
account with the bank for this to happen.
