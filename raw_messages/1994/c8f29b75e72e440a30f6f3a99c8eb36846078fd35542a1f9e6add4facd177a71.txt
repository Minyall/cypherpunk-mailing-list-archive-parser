This bring to mind the following question:  Is there anything inherent in  
NON-anonymous digital cash schemes that make them more vulnerable to  
fraud, bribery or inside jobs?   (I assume the schemes account for double  
spending and "counterfeiting" (however that applies to digicash).)

Can a case be made that anonymous digicash is less risky (to a bank) than  
NON-anonymous digicash?
