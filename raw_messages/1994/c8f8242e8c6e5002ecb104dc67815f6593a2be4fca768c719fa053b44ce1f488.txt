Thanks for posting that, John.  I don't think I particularly want to
ask ONE of my Senators (Packwood) about this, since as far as I am
concerned he is a shame to the nation and my state.  But I will ask
the other one -- Hatfield -- to vote against this nomination.  In
general, I am against career military and/or intelligence operatives
from being Secretary of Defense, because it is important to retain
at least a semblance of civilian control.  (Of course, the way things
really work, it might not make that much difference.  But appearances
*do* matter, and I care deeply about small-d democratic civilian control
of our national government and its agencies.)

Hatfield is no particular friend of the military-industrial complex
(although not especially an opponent either), so it may be possible
to find someone on his staff who is interested in pursuing the *real*
Bobby Ray Inman story.
