I should have added in my remarks about registration that one very
easy way to "ping" a cellular phone is to call it. If the phone is
powered on and hears the page, it will automatically acknowledge it on
the access channel (the mobile-to-base link that is also used to
request a mobile-originated call). This will certainly reveal the
mobile's location to the closest cell.
