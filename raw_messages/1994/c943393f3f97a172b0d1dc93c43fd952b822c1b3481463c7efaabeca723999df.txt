Cypherpunks meetings officially start at noon and last 'til
"whenever," which is usually about 5 p.m. But things often don't get
rolling until around 12:30 or so, and may end around 4:30 on a "light"
day.

Since missing the first part of the meeting can be bad (announcements,
hot topics, etc.), I'd recommend getting to _any_ meeting at the
starting time, or just a bit late, and then staying as long as its
interesting to one. 

The "best three hours" are probably noon-3. Your mileage may vary, as
they say.
