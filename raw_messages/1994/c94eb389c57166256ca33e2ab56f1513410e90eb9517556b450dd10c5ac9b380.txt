Would it not be fair to ask that all the parties earlier listed 
by Tim --  Microsoft, Sun, Apple, IBM and others -- be asked 
for an official statement of their positions on SKE?

Even so, will this produce credible statements?

What if confidentiality or secrecy agreements are already in 
place?

Disinformation needs cryptanalysis, no?
