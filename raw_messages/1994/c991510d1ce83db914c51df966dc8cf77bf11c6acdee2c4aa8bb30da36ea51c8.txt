Would it not make sense, therefore, to publish a public cypherpunks
mailing list key, which is returned with subscription requests?
All incoming message cleartext to the mailing list server would
then be encrypted in the server's key; not for security, but 
precisely for the reason you state above.  That _would_ create
quite a volume of encrypted communications to each receipient of 
the list.
