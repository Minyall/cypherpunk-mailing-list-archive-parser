Again, I may be wrong, since I am not a lawyer, nor would I want to be 
shot as one...

You didn't seem to like my thoughts about "media shift"...  Let's say the 
same thing in a different example...  You wrote a letter to 
Communications Week which was published; something you expected.  George 
over there runs a news stand, and he sells Communication Week; nobody has 
a problem with him selling magazines for a living, do we?  But, we have 
Bill over here who subscribed to CW, photocopies articles and letters he 
likes, and compiles these into a book which he then sells... Now we have 
a problem.

I'm not trying to draw lines, but I do see a change of media as a reason 
to request the author's permission to re-publish.  You would be 
distributing the material in a way different than the author intended.
