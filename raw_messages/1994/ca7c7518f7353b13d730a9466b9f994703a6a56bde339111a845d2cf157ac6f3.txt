Indeed.

I've been wondering recently, by the way, about what advantages doing
some of this stuff on DSPs might have. DSPs are not magical chips, but
they are optimized for a few tasks, including, typically, fast integer
multiplies. IDEA and modular exponentiation both require lots of fast
integer multiplies. Would it make sense to use DSPs as co-processors
to things like Pentiums to speed up these processes?

Phil? You are the resident expert on DSPs, I believe...
