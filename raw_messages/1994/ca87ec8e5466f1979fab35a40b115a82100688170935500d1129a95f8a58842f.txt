Cypherpunks, I did not write that letter. It was fowarded to me via an
anonymous remailer. One among you sent it to me. The question is, which one? why?

To those of you who are so confident it is a forgery-- why? perhaps it
is, but you base your dogmatic convictions on nothing credible, simply
your passionate, zealous enmity to me.

BTW, this is my official resignation as Chief Cypherpunk Whistleblower.
The position is a thankless, nasty job. There just really is no place
for me in cyberspace.
