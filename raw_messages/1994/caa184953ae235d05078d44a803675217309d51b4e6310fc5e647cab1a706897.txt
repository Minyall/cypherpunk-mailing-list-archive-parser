This may be a lot to ask, would anyone be willing to volunteer a little 
space on an ftp site for the 1984 NSA t-shirt gifs?  While its easy for 
me to set up an http page here, its not so easy for me to get the gif 
onto an anonymous ftp site.  The response has been considerably greater 
than I imagined, and it would be a lot simpler just to get it on an ftp 
site somewhere, and will provide more prompt turn-around time, than for 
me to mail it out.  You'd get a complimentary shirt out of the deal :)
