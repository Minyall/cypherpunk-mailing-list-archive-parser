Cute, Tim!  (Uhh, you're about 3 weeks too late for this ;-)

Actually, the *first* thing I did when I received these factors was
fire up a trusty mathematics package and verify the product: bc. :-)

Although I admit that RSA-129 dprobably does not have any cosmic
significance with regards to protecting any vital data, it is a data
point: it is the largest number of its type to ever have been
factored.  As a result, it tells us that 425-bit keys are not secure,
and keys not much bigger are not secure, either, today!

But you are right, we are learning alot about factoring and
distributed problems as a result of this exercise (at least I feel
that I have learned alot).
