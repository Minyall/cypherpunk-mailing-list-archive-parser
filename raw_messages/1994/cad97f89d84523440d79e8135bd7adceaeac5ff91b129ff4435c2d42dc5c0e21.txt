It occured to me that perhaps getting messages to a message haven
won't require anonymous mail to protect privacy (who you are
communicating with.  You would still need to use a remailer to hide
the fact you are using the message haven!).

In each message, the author could specify what to name the next reply.
If messages are encrypted, then all a watcher would see is incoming
messages from various people, but not be able to figure out who is
reading what message, and what messages are responses to what other
messages.

This would require the service to reject unencrypted messages, which
would be easy enough.  But it would still require people to "download"
everything and sift through it at home, to hide what messages they are
interested in.
