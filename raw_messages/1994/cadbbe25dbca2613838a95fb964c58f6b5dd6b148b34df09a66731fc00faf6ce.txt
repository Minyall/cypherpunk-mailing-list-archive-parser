Hello,

I have a little question about some math algorithms.

People have talked in alt.security.pgp about the Miller
Test and the Miller-Rabin Test.

I am getting ready to improve PGP's testing of potential
prime numbers and have been looking for a good algorithm.

After reading some in Knuth Volume 2, I have come across
Algorithm P on page 379.  Is this algorithm in fact the
Miller-Rabin Test ???

Thanks,
Tom Rollins
