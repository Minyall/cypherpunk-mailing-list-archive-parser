"Implicit right to cancel"?  Where'd that come from?

There's a poem by Carl Sandburg with some relevance to this.  I don't
see why the feature of cancel messages (which aren't guaranteed to
work anyway) carries with it a new right.

I am perfectly free to implement my own news system and mailer that
does not honor cancel messages.  What authority would force me to do
so if I don't want to?

Why?  Does he have an equally clear right to expect that the message
does not get deleted before then?

This seems pretty specious to me.
