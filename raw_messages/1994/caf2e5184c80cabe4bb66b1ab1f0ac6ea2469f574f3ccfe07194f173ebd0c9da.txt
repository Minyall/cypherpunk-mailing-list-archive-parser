Hm... interesting.  There is a related problem about every integer
being represented as the sum of four squares, but you ask if
(1+4k) can be written as a sum of squares, without mentioning a limit
on the number of squares.

If this is the case, then each number of the form (1+4k) is easily
represented as the sum of squares: 4 is represented as 2^2 up to k
times, and 1 is just 1^2.

So for example 21 is 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2.

Pretty cheesy, eh? ;)
