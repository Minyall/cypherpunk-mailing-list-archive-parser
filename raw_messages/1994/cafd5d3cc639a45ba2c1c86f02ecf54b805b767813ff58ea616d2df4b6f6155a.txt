Actually it is even worse than that:   It is like wearing red
ribbons to protest AIDS.

A checker that checked signatures for consistent ID would
actually promote cryptography.

A checker that merely checks if a signature looks like 
a signature merely makes cryptography look stupid, like
a power ranger suit.

I would entirely support a real checker, but not a toy
checker.
