Apparently this is your (presently unsubstantiated) opinion.  How about
some references that don't involve ATF employee testimonys?

In many places, spanking a child (with restraint and compassion, as a
parent) is considered child abuse, so I suppose this statement could be
considered true.

I am not alone, however, in my belief that corporal punishment is sometimes
a necessary part of parenting.

While I don't share the Davidians religious beliefs, I'd like to see more
evidence that the ATF was justified in their assault.

I'm not yet convinced.
