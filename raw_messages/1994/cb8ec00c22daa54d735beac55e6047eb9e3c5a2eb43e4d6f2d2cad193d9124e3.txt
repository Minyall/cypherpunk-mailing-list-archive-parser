Remember that what is being secured here is almost certainly a stronger
cipher than any of us have access to (representatives of TLA's excepted :),
and so the public scrutiny issue does not arise.

I agree with Black Unicorn's phrase: security by obscurity alone is no
security.  If we need a buzzphrase - which itself is questionable - then
that's about a close as we'll get.
