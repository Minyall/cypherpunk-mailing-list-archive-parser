Hi,

A quick, and quite possibly stupid, question:

As an American living overseas, how applicable is ITAR to me?  Since I'm
already in a foreign country, does this also mean that I shouldn't be able to
receive any cryptographic software/books?  Does this, in a strict 
interpretation, mean that if I show my books on cryptography to my friends
here that I am breaking the law -- even though these books are publicly
available in the states?

I imagine that the answer is that the law applies to me just as much here as
it would were I living in the US still, but I'm curious....
