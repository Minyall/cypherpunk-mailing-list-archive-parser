Responding to msg by Mark Terka, who is having a bad crypto 
day:

I don't recall seeing too much in the waqy of 
condemnation of the guy that  posted RC4 to this list 
..... but as soon as we see something that touches  
close to home like male/female relationships, the shit 
hits the fan!!!!!
............................................................

Don't you distinguish between the evil that governments can do, 
and the evil that female opponents in relationships (of dubious 
merit) can achieve?   Are you proposing that some people make 
it a policy to cheat on their friends, just as some governments 
do, and should be dealt with in like manner, automatically and 
without further consideration?   It were a wise & just 
government, which could not distinguish between the good, the 
bad, and the all rest.

And who appointed you the list censor, anyway?  If it makes 
sense that a cypherpunk could provide instructions for breaking 
a password, it also makes sense that they could choose to 
withhold it.   After all, if they are smart enough to know how 
to do this, they should also be capable of making a reasoned 
decision about when it might be reprehensible   -  with or 
without your approval.
