My sentiments exactly. Whether or not she's two-timing, I imagine she'd be
pretty upset (and justifiably so) if she knew her boyfriend wants to break
into her private documents. He should *ask* her straight out to confirm or
deny his suspicions. If he doesn't like the answer, he should get out.

Someone needs to give her PGP ASAP, IMHO....
