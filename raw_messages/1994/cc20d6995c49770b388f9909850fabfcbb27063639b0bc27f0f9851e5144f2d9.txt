On whose reconning?!  At the very least, the US is one of the largest users
of capital punishment - including being one of the few countries where
children can be tried as adults and executed - which sounds very comfortable
to me.  And let's not forget the rather unpleasant physical and sexual
assault statistics which are noticed in prisons worldwide, which includes
the USA.

Want to back this up with some reliable references?  I am very aware of
the criticisms of the Australian prison systems, and would be the first
to agree that massive reform is needed.  But I have never seen reference
to this, and don't believe that it would be possible to supress it in
this circumstance.
