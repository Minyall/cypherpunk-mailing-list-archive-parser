As I mentioned to Perry in E-mail, the above is incorrect. Pure text
can be obscene and hence unprotected by the First Amendment.  Kaplan v.
California, 413 U.S. 115, 118-119, 93 S.Ct. 2680, 2683-2684 (1973).
Others here (Mike Godwin?) can likely provide a much better discussion
of just where this fits into First Amendment law; Shepherds' reveals no
more recent decisions which modify the holding in Kaplan.
