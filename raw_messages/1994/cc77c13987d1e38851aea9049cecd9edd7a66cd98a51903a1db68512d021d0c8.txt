	Whats wrong with PGPtools?  (A lack of documentation.  Been a
while since I looked, but I think it lacked a high level interface.
The low level stuff is great, but on the mac, I can send an Appleevent
"Encrypt *file recipient" and, some extended period later, get a
response.

	Who needs real time?  The servers are often bogged down and
don't respond in real time anyway.  The following procmail works fine.
Theres also a short shell script at the end.
