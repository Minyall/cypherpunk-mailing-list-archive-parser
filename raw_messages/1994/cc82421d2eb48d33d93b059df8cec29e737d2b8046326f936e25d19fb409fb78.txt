ANNOUNCEMENT
============

What: nothing
When: would have been Saturday, August 13
Why: summer doldrums

So I'm going to be out of town, and one of our main speakers
cancelled, and our host at SGI would just as soon have the day off,
and so, hey, we're cancelling for Saturday.

That means you can stay up until all hours on Friday and watch the
Perseids.  Cool.


Eric
