   What has happened to the list??
   My C'punks incoming mail atopped yesterday (5/8/94).  I sent a "Who
   cypherpunks" command and my name is no longer there.  There was only about
   six names that were returned.

   I've been lurking for a little over a month now and really enjoy the
   discussion.

   Where did everyone go???
