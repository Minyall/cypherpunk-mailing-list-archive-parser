Well, it is true, from a pragmatic point of view.  A neighborhood kid with a 
Radio Shack scanner can't listen in on digital cellular calls.  You have to 
actually hack a phone, which is a much less prevalent skill.

I still think that CDMA+DES is the way to go for secure cellular, but from a 
purely pragmatic point of view simply going digital does increase privacy.  
Using analog cellular is like using a walkie-talkie.
