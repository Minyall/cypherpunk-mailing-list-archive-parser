FYI:

This letter was written by rbork@frb.gov, someone at the Federal
Reserve Board, who is not the Judge Bork you might think.  This was an
example used on pem-dev for why Distringuished Names would be a good
thing.  Personally, I think it doesn't make a difference.  John Smith
is John Smith, and just because you know that this John Smith works at
Foosite International and that one works at Barsite, Inc., doesn't
mean you necessarily know who they are, although it does help you
differentiate them.  (Then again, jsmith@foosite.org and
jsmith@barsite.com differentiate them as well).

Sigh.
