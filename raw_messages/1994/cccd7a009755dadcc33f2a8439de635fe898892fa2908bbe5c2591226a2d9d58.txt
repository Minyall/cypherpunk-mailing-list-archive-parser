I would not sign a pseydonymous entity's key based soley on the
reputation of the entity.  How do I defend against a man-in-the-middle
attack -- how do I know I'm not signing the middle-man's key instead
of the entity's key?

With a real person, my defense is to use a tamperproof out-of-band
channel to verify the key fingerprint: a phone call (for a friend
whose voice I recognize) or a personal meeting with passports (for
someone I don't know very well).  How do I do that with a pseudonymous
entity?  I'd really like to know if it's possible to do.

I'm all in favor of pseudonymous entities building reputations, but I
think that the price of pseudonymity is the inability to be part of a
PGP-like Web of Trust.
