Some time back, Xenon maintained a list of 
anonymous remailers, along with what records
were kept, i.e., simple counter, to & from
addresses, full text for some time period,
etc.  I know the list is available via
finger (Many compliments to those involved
in that!!!), but was wondering if the record-
keeping aspect was reported anywhere?

And no, I've never written to whitehouse.gov,
don't intend to, and wouldn't on a bet!!!

Regards,
