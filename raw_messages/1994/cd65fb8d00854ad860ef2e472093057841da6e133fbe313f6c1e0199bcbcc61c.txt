I have been having quite a bit of difficulty with my encrypted drive mangling
files. After getting secure drive 1.3d installed on my hard drive, I find that 
various files are being corrupted and many times after accessing the drive a 
bunch of crosslinked files are present. The TSR was being loaded into high 
memory (login /s was included in my autoexec.bat and safe mode was on after 
the boot); I use Novell DOS 7.0. I had to uninstall the encryption on the 
drive and am thinking of trying Secure Device to see if the problem persists.

Has anyone had any problems such as this? Any suggestions would be welcome as
I desire to keep PGP on the encrypted drive. Encrypted floppies do not seem to 
be a problem (good thing I keep an encrypted floppy backup of my PGP files :-) 
Does anyone know where I can get a utility to decompress the secdevice.arj
file? Is it the same as .arc files? Thanks.
