The government does not have a monopoly on military force.  In fact, the 2nd 
amendment explicitly prohibits such a monopoly, however much it has become 
eroded in recent decades.

However, I will agree with you that a certain amount of corporate coercion 
goes on with government collusion (not all, however: look at Westlaw or 
Equifax for examples).
