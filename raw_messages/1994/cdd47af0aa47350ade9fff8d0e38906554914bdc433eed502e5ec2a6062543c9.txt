	safe-tcl is designed to allow for enabled mail without opening
up many security holes like this.  Unfortunately, few people use
safe-tcl.  I suspect that a lot of this is becuase many of the people
who would get lots of benefit from safe tcl's basic functions (like
mail sorting) use procmail to do those basic functions.
