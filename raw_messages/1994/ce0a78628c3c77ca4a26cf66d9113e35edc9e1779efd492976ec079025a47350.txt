I don't think so.  The book entries still exist.  The book is the only 
place securities ever really exist.  E$ certificates--and even physical 
certificates--are nothing more than receipts evidencing ownership as 
defined by the book entry.  Remember, securities are "intangible" assets 
by definition.  (Ditto for dollars, yen, pounds and francs, by the way.)
