NSA must have an interesting collection of literature on line. They need
high bandwidth (but not rapid) access to it. This could be the beginning of
a new business if they ever turn their swords into plowshares. Conversely
if anyone aspires to digitize a great deal of literature I am sure that NSA
would subscribe, thus seeding a new industry. I seem to recall something
about a Midwest university beginning to digitize a large body of
literature.
