You can also tell it comes from the remailer because it is encrypted to
allow you to verify exactly this. I am not interested in hiding the path
information, I *want* to certify where it came from - *not* who(!) is
sending it or *what* is in it. I can see not knowing or being able to
prove the pathway as a possible hole for interjecting bogus packets.

Now, about this re-sending issue. If I rcv. a packet at 10am and it
gets a random time-stamp there is no guarantee when it will be sent
other than within 24hrs. It may or may not be sent in the 5 hr. gap in
your example, no way to know really.

The random order is what does it, not the # of packets sent out. the
randomness in leaving the site is more important than how many.
