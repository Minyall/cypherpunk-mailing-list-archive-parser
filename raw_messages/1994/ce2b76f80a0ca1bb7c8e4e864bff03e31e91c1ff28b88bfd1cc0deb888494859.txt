Gee, Claude, where have _you_ been hiding?  Look at the date
on that message.  

As for using 2.6 -- I do.  It's _only_ a factor in key generation,
and it doesn't weaken key generation enough to be a concern.

Also, there is a planned bugfix release for sometime soon that
will have the one character patch that fixes that problem.
