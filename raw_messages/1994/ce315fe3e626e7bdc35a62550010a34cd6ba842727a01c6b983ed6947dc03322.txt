Ah, but that's the beauty of it. Who would believe that we're actually
doing anything? Better yet, what jury would now believe that all those
messages that the NSA has gotten via Tempest from us were anything but
elaborate NSA fodder? (I *knew* I should have bought that Faraday cage!)

Seriously, though, what with the simplicity of communicating in a very
secure manner on the 'net--whether that means PGP or old-fashioned code
(Aunt Sally's not feeling all that well, but the postcard you sent really
cheered her up. Are we still on for coffee and bagles at ten on
Saturday?)--it makes one wonder just what the NSA is trying to monitor, and
what they hope to accomplish by it.
