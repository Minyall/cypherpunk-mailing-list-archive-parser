Gawd!  What should the quota for FemiNazis be?  Scared away the 
women just to make room for female impersonators like you?  Did 
you enjoy wearing mommy's clothes when you were "growing up"?  Or 
DID you ever grow up?

Oh really?  As if we couldn't have figured that out for 
ourselves?

Here we go ... another religious spammer on the net.  Why don't 
you go hang out with Ralph (the Mouth) Stokes and Clarence (the 
World is Coming to an End RSN) Thomas IV, and blather each other 
to death.  Take your Shirley MacLaine bullshit elsewhere.

Are you what Detweiler died and became reincarnated as?  If so, 
Karma dealt him poetic justice, I'd say.

Probably as soon as you get back on your broom and fly away.
