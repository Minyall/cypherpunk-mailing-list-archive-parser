Yup.  And a variation of this is what's called double
invoicing.  It's one of the things that made Hongkong
great.

Congratulations, you have re-invented a time-honored
service of offshore banks and incorporation services.
Of course, there never has to be a forgiveness of the
loan.  It can just be rolled over forever.  Or, the
recipient can use his "loan payments" as a means of 
ex-patriating more money.

I'm really quite impressed with your thinking on this.
Though many sophisticated varients of these techniques
have existed for years, it is quite an accomplishment
to invent them independently.  Unlike some knee-jerk
hand wringing (mixed metaphor?) I have seen on this
list, you have identified the transactional essence
present in successful transnational thinking.

Again, congratulations.
