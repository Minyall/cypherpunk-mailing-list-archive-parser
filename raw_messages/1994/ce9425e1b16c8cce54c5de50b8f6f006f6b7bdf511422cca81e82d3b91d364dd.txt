Isn't that the same information 'Random Hoser' posted last week from
some 'PR Newswire' thing?  Not like clarinet to be so behind with the
news...  (I believe the Customs announcement was July 6th)

Still, it's nice to hear it again with copyright permission this time.
Maybe I'll just run over to my newsspool and delete the other article now
that I don't need it any more.
