Perhaps my apparent frustration is caused by the fact that I've become
convinced that crypto-anarchy will not come to pass (I posted a
lenghtly scenario earlier of that I think the future will be like).

I think that writing and thinking is the only thing any of us can do
that will have impact.  The only coding effort I can see paying off is
helping to make PGP better.  Maybe that's what I'll do.
