@ THis dovetails with what the service guy told me about using some sort of 
@ piece of plastic to make stuff copy...but that was when we were working 
@ with the color theory--he said he could interpose this piece of clear 
@ material to make stuff that was the 'wrong color' copy. HE didn't say 
@ what it was.

I am willing to think that it first looks for a color or a range
of colors. (I have said that before).

However, it must be looking for something special based on the
test I just ran. (It could be something in the non-visable spectrum.)

Does anyone know what range of the specturm the CCD devices in the 
CLC 550 can capture? FYI, The 550 has 5 CCD's.
