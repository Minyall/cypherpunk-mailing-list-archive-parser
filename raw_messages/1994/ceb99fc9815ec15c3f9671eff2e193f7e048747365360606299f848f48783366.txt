For a good example of DB/Expert system technology used for good instead
of evil ("A power so great...") check out ringo@media.mit.edu, body of
mail "join".  You tell it your musical preferences and it suggests
albums that others with a similar taste to yours liked. 

It'll also tell you what to avoid.  I intend to honor its advice, to
avoid Neil Diamond, Tiffany, and Barry Manilow.
