Correct. The hierarchy as I remember it is roughly (from least to most
powerful in terms of size of the recognizable languages) FAs, PDAs
(that is, deterministic push-down automata), NPDAs, TMs. Its been a
while, but I seem to recall that non-deterministic pushdown automata
could recognise some languages that deterministic ones could not.
