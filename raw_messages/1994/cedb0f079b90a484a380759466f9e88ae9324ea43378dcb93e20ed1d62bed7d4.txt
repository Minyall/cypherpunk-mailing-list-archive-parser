     If you have backups and keep paper trails like any serious company,
this is merely inconvenient and annoying.

     This argues similiarly to the gun control argument. Encryption, like
guns, are a tool. When used responsibly, tools don't cause problems. When
used irresponsibly, problems occur. Responsible use of encryption is for
privacy. Irresponsible use is for some damaging purpose.
