Although CPSR hasn't explicitly called for it yet, I think it's a good idea
for each of us who support HR3627 to call our own representatives and urge
them to do so.  I've called mine.  Eventually they'll be in a position to
vote on this bill and the more aware they are the easier the fight will be.

All the world's a stage and most of us are desperately unrehearsed.
