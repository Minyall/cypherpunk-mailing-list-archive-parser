I echo Eric's warning, that I also don't mean this to have anything to do
with the current thread.

The benefit of having the list sign the entire message, is that even if
people _don't_ sign the message themselves (assuming they aren't being
requried to ;)  ), there's still something left to sign. The list would be
signing to indicate that, yes, this message did pass through
cypherpunks@toad.com.  Regardless of whether the author signed the message
himself or not, completely different issue.
