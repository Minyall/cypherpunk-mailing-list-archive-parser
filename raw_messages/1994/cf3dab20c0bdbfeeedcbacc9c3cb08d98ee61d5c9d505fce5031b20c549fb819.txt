Please do.  There are a great many issues which your input and opinions are
a valuable contribution to the content of this list.  There are others
where you seem to make guesses as to where things are going without having
much of a leg to stand on.  Your MIME position hurts the widespread use of
cryptography because the advantages MIME gives to crypto far outweigh the
short-term costs associated with a systemic upgrade to a better method for
message transport and encapsulation.
