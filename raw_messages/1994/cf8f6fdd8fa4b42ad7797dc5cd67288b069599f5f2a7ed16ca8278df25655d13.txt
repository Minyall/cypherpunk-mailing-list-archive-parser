Two recent incidents in NYC show massive market failure in the 
information security industry.

One of the city's largest bookies was busted when the Feds intercepted the 
daily fax transmissions summarizing business results sent from his NY 
office to his Florida home.

A major cocaine dealer is facing prosecution based on written transaction 
records seized at his office.  His simple code was broken by a "known 
plaintext attack" when investigators were able to match his written 
notations with transaction information derived from wiretaps.

Can't anyone help these people?  Maybe 178th Street needs PGP and Secure 
Drive more than the PC Expo.

1001 Flaky Anti-Tax Arguments (#286):  I suffer from a recognized 
social-affective disorder.  I'm an anarchist.  Due to a mental disease or 
defect, I am congenitally incapable of conforming my behavior to the 
requirements of society.  Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, the 
Internal Revenue Service is required to make reasonable accommodations to 
meet my needs.  The only way to satisfy the needs of one with my 
disability is to not impose any social obligations on him.
