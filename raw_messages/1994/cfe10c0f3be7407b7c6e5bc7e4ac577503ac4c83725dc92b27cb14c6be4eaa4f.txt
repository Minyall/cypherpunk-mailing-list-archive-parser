	Actually, I prefer the "Anon-Send-To:" and "Anon-Post-To:"
that hh@soda's remailer uses. It makes the news/mail distinction very
clear. Maybe that Anon-Send-To: and Anon-Post-To: should be the
"standard" (as well as their non-Anon counterparts), with Anon-To: and
Request-Remailing-To: retained for backwards compatibility.
