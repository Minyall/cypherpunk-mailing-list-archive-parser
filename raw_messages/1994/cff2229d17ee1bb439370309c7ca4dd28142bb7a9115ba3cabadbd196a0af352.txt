So has anyone tried to solve the problem of double spending and
the online requirement of digital cash?

It seems digitial cash is really only digital "check" right now as
it must be verified at the bank before it can be show to be "valid."

Is there any way to take cash offline?  Or is this merely the copy
protection problem rehashed?
