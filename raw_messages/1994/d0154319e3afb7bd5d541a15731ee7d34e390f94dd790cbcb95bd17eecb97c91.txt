I don't think that's how they do it. As far as I know, most methods multiplex
digitized audio with the data. One system used by some people in India provides
a dynamic combination of fax, (digitized) voice and data, depending on the
throughput - eg vox/9.6 data if 14.4kbps, fax as well if 19.2, etc.

While Intel and others are proposing standards, ZyXEL does it with software
along with a voice card or possibly RJ11 input. A friend of mine saw a demo
of it at Comdex, on an old 1496E (16.8 kbps zyxel to zyxel). The new v.34 does
28.8k - lots of room for clear digitized voice and high speed data.

This is exactly why I thought it would make secure voice easier, if not secure
phones (who wants to lug a modem and PC around as a 'handset'?).

I'll be testing some Onetics Rad VFAST modems this week, which apparently do
digitized voice over v.34 as well.
