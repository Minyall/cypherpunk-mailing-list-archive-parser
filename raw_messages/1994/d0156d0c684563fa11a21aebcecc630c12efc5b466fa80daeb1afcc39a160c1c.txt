It is available via FTP at ftp.csua.berkeley.edu (I'm pretty sure this
is the new name of soda.berkeley.edu!) in pub/cypherpunks.

It is also available via gopher at chaos.bsu.edu in the Essays
subdirectory of the "Cypherpunks Archive Site" directory
(gopher://chaos.bsu.edu/Cypherpunks Archive Site/Essays/Cypherpunks Manifesto)

I guess it should be renamed it to "Crypto Anarchist Manifesto" ;)

It is probably elsewhere too; I'm currently reorganizing the gopher
site (still have to do "Anonymous Mail" and "Misc") and hope to finish
with adding extra material, including pointers to other the other
sites I know exist.
