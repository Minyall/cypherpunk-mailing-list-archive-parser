Sigh.

Subscribing to this sentiment does not, in any way, shape or form, require
one to start handing out podia and bullhorns to anyone who has an opinion
to express.

Put it this way: I own a Macintosh, a copy of PageMaker and a laser
printer.  Should I let anyone who wants to use _my_ equipment to produce a
newsletter?  In particular, should I allow a person whose views I consider
to be heinous and reprehensible to use _my_ equipment to produce a
newsletter espousing those views?

To me, the obvious answer is "Of course not".

Does this mean that I'm censoring that person?  Does it make me an opponent
of "free speech"?  No, and no.

I will certainly defend his right to produce a newsletter.  I will
certainly defend his right to buy, and use, _his_ _own_ equipment to
produce a newsletter espousing whatever opinions he likes.

People, _please_ learn what "censorship" is!  If I submit a manuscript to
Addison Wesley, and they return it to me with a rejection note, _that_
_does_ _not_ _constitute_ _censorship_.  I am perfectly free to submit it
to other publishers, or to publish it myself.
