I've got the code written to check the whole coin, and I found another
subtle bug caused by precision setting. Since setting precision does not
seem to affect the speed of the decryption (I think the mpi library sets
it internally during modexp) I'm just going to fix it at MAX_UNIT_PRECISION
and leave it there. Tomorrow I will strip out all of these damn things.
