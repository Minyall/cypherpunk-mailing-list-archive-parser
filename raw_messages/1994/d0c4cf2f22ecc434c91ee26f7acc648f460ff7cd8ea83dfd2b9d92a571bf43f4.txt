I saw an interesting thread in alt.security.pgp about when PGP v 2.6.2 will
handle key sizes of up to 2048 bits. Someone speculated that it will take
effect in the middle of the month (ie after Dec. 15 you type pgp -kg and
it will give you four choices, the last one of up to 2048 bits).

I wasn't aware that this feature was programmed into this version of PGP. I
always thought that there was simply going to be another upgrade that would
allow the larger key sizes.

Can anyone shed some light on this???
