I sent my donation to:

     Christian Douglas Odhner
     14079 N. 34th Place
     Phoenix, AZ  85032

But beware!  I sent him $15 bucks about 6 months ago and have
yet to see any stickers in the mail...  Perhaps I'll try e-mailing
him again to see what's up; or perhaps I should acknowledge a
beautiful scam when I see one!  (Or maybe the elusive tentacles
have struck down another pesky cypherpunk...)
