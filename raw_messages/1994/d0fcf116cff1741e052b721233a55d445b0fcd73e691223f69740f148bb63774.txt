I'm sorry I responded just now to Nalbandian's first spew before noticing
that he has stuffed my mailbox with another handful of non-germane
babble.  

Instead of wasting my time handing him good advice about better ways to
spend *his* time, I will simply say that the usual treatment here is
the correct one: /dev/null
