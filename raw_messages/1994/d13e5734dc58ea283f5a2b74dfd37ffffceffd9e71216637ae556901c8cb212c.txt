Spies generally like to help each other -- after all the CIA and KGB had
much more in common with each other than with the common people of their
respective nations. Probably the foremost use of NSA's technology would be
by governments monitoring traffic and other data for incorrect thought
patterns. I can see other uses, though -- if Cypherpunks had this thing,
we wouldn't need Arsen Ray's Tentacle-sniffer -- NSALookUp (tm) Detweiler
should do it ;-)
