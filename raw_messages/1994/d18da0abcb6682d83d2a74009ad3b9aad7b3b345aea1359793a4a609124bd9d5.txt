Extensive arguing about this is going on in comp.org.eff.talk.

The EFF has also provided details of "their" bill in these places:


** 1994 final draft, as sponsored **
     
ftp.eff.org, /pub/EFF/Policy/FBI/digtel94.bill
gopher.eff.org, 1/EFF/Policy/FBI, digtel94.bill
http://www.eff.org/pub/EFF/Policy/FBI/digtel94.bill
bbs: +1 202 638 6120 (8N1, 300-14400bps), file area: Privacy - Digital
     Telephony; file: digtel94.bil
 

I checked and the texts are the complete bills, as of the 1994-08-09
introduction in Congress.
