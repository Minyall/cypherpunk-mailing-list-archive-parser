The PO delivers mail whether or not it has a return address, let alone
whether it has a _correct_ return address, so I suspect that Mr.
Templeton's lawyer would have to be very creative indeed to pass that
analogy by anyone who isn't asleep at the wheel. I think his thinly
veiled warnings re: remailer operator legal liability are an attempt
to intimidate, as it can get expensive to defend yourself even from
a very weak claim ....... just ask Phil Zimmerman.
