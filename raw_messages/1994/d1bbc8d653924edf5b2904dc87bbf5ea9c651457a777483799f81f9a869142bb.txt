Market forces are lathargic, sometimes they need a boost.  I propose 
this boost
be accomplished with motivators like tax breaks, market assisters and
privatization.
      . . . .
Anyone who thinks the Federal Government is the
driving force behind the majority of technological advancement (aside the
space program and military hardware) needs to take a good look.

Market forces being lethargic, sometimes they need a little boot, a 
little tax break, a little assistance.  Anyone who doesn't think so 
needs to examine their current Federal allowance.
