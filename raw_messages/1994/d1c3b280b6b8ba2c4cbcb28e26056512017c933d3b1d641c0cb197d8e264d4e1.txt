Gun control is people control.
The War on Drugs is the War on Citizens.

   I would like to suggest that some of our more knowledgeable &
eloquent Ccypherpunks such as May, Hughes, Frissell or others consider
approaching Soldier of Fortune magazine about a series of articles
or a regular column on encryption & privacy. SOF may seem to be a
childish publication to some of us but it has a readership many times
that of Ccypherpunks & we would not be preaching to the converted
(I know there are other purposes to cypherpunks as well).

   I've read some of their writing on the Waco affair & was impressed
by their anti-government stance & the heavy detail (much better than
the high production value/low content stuff from the mass media).
I'm not a regular reader of SOF but they seem to be old fashioned
patriots & might be warm to the Cypherpunk cause.

   We might have a series or a regular column titled CRYPTO -
THE COMING GREAT WAR or COMMUNICATIONS - THE NEXT GREAT BATTLEFIELD.
We already have a library of articles & copy. Our views would be a bit
novel & just might fit right in with SOF. We could make a deal with
them so that we could reprint the articles on the Internet. A number
of Cypherpunks regularly write good articles. We should make better
use of them.

                                            Yours Truly,
                                            Gary Jeffers
