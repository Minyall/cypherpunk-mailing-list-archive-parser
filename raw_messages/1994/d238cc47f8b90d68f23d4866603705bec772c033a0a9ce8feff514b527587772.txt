   What if the European user obtains PGP 2.6 from a European site,
   then rips out the RSAREF code, and makes it use Phil's original
   code from 2.3a, and then distributes this copy. Is there still a
   copyright violation on RSADSI?  Is there one on MIT ?

re: RSADSI.  Is the 2.6 work in any way derived from RSADSI property?
It doesn't appear to be.  There's none of the original RSADSI code and
it wasn't used as template for replacement.

re: MIT.  There would still be copyright property of MIT in a code
base as outlined, since that part was not altered.
