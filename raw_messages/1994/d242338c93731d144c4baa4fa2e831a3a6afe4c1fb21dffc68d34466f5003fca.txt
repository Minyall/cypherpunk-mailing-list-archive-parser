Of course, but what if you bought something from a Web server, revealing your  
account-id to the server.  A smart server could adjust the prices on pages  
that haven't been retrieved yet.  I don't know if this is necessarily  
possible with hhtp (i.e. does your client always use the same return port  
number for requests during a given instance of the client? <bear with me, I  
don't know the real details of http>), but you get the idea.  Worse,  
linkability of transactions also allows the merchant to do 'payment traffic  
analysis' in an attempt to determine the real identities of it's clients.   
Many merchants can get together and compare transaction logs as well...

These 'attacks' are a feature of any payment system that has only counter  
party pseudonymity (as opposed to anonymity), not just First Virtual...
