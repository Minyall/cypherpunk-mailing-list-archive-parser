I've worried about the same thing myself.  The best way to fight these
tendancies is to "follow the tracks back to the barn."  Uncover the
illusion and place it in context.  Whenever I visited Disneyland, I used
to follow all the tracks back to the barns.  Most of the rides there are
rail vehicles even the submarine ride.  You can see the reality of the
place by observing the tracks.

In the case of experiments like this you can be aware of the existence of
the researcher and avoid trusting him.  In the larger world, you can keep
a death's grip on reality and note that people giving you orders are just
men who have their own reasons for doing things.  Trace the power
relationships back to the barn.

Never be afraid to jinx sideways to throw them off your tail.  Practice
violating small orders so that when it really counts, you'll be able to
violate big orders smoothly without even having to think about it.

Not to attack others facing a different world but how many jews could have
saved themselves during the 1930s by choosing to become illegal aliens in
the US or the UK.  

Practice disobedience.
