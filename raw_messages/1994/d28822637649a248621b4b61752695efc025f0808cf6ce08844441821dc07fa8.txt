FYI: This email and some related followup emails were sent to a number of
low low-volume lists lists that I belong to. Somone is now apparently
engaged in harassing a wide variety of Internet mailing lists completely
unrelated with cryptography.

In particular the Squish email was posted to were
CREA-CPS@HEARN.nic.SURFnet.nl (CREA-CPS Creativity and Creative Problem
Solving) and Annotated Lists of ThingS (ann-lots@vm1.nodak.edu). As a
member of those lists I don't believe that the person sending the mail was
a member. I have also recently seen complaints from a number of other list
owners and users.

I suspect that the Squish email may have been sent to every list out in
world publically on the List of Lists, and those with remailers that allow
non-members to post let the mail item through to their members.

Please note that the request in that email...

...is spurious, as I believe the members of the cypherpunks list and the
people listed above are targets of a clever net flamer.

As I do subscribe to quite a number of lists, and as an active internet
user I thought as a courtesy that I should let you know that that this
message did not truely originate on cypherpunks nor the from the people
listed as owners of cyperpunks.

I suggest that you ignore the Squish email, and if your remailer allows
non-members to post to your list that you should turn that feature off to
prevent further re-occurences of messages of this sort.
