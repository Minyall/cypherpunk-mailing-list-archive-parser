It's available via ftp from a few european sites also:
(from the pgp22.txt file at ftp-os2.cdrom.com).
 
OS/2 executables for PGP 2.2 are available from
        ftp.uni-erlangen.de, pub/pc/os2/fauern/crypt/pgp22os2.zip

I checked a few domestic os2 ftp sites; they all seem to have a file
telling you where else to go... I guess the os2 ftp sites are
unwilling to carry pgp?

I got my copy of pgp32.exe (32 bit pgp2.3a) from the archive in
Finland (nic.funet.fi in pub/os2/2.x/diskutil I beleive; I can't check
right now because of a "your ftp client misuses NLST primitive" error
which seems to hang eveything...)
