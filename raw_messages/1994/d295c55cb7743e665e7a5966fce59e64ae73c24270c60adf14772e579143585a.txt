    While we're being picky, I'll point out that (unless I'm wrong of
    course) it's not really an NFA, but a non-deterministic Turing
    machine (an "NTM"?) that's the automaton at issue here.

No, NFA is acceptable and correct, it's Non-determinisic Finite
Automaton.  A non-deterministic Turing machine is a perfectly
reasonable example, however.
