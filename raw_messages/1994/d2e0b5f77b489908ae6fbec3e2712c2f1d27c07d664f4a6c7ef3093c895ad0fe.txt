<mmnyfast.zip update sent to csn.org>

This is an update for Magic Money. The PGPKGEN.C here contains a very fast
mp_inv function, provided by an anonymous poster on the Cypherpunks list,
which reduces the time to unblind a 1024-bit coin from minutes to a few
seconds. 

The C.C contains a new -r option which generates a blank message,
similar to the -i option, without generating a new key. This should be used
by infrequent server users, to update their elists and make sure they do not
miss an expiration. The message generated by -r has no coins, but causes the
server to reply.

Blinding is now fast enough to use a 1024-bit server key. A server operator
should re-integrate the assembly-language speedups from PGP, or the server
will be very slow in signing coins. The PGP makefile might help you do this.
