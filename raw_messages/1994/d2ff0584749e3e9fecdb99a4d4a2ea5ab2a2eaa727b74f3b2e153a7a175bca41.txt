Ummm, if you just want to hook up a digital phone line to it so you
could, say, speak into the microphone, sample that and PGP encrypt it
then send it over the line where a person with similar software would
decrypt and listen... (or maybe you just want a fast data link, anyway)
The power MAcs, I belive, are equipped with fast serial lines (GeoPort)
and you can purchase an ISDN compatable modem to interface to the Mac. I
don't belive you need to mess around with NuBus cards at all.

Now, just a little hacking around with the Sound Manager and MacPGP...
