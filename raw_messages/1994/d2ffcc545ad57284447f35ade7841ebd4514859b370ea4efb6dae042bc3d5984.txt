There is.  Copyright 1994 James Nitchals.  Duplication and redistribution
rights permitted only until the expiration date or issuance of a cancel
message by the author.

CD-ROM publishers cannot honor the request except by reissuing the CD-ROM
without my content.  Anyone who backs up their home directory is safe,
but if they redistribute my article after it's expired or cancelled, they
are in violation of my copyright.
