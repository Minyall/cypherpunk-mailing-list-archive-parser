Does anyone know if the death penalty has been extended to weapons or
arms trafficking? If so this means that simply sending a disk w/ pgp
on it now rates a lethal injection....

Anywhere I can get the full text? It does not appear to be up on the white
house or other gov. sources yet.

Thanks.
