   What is the difference if a big company subjects its employees to a 
   key-escrow system or if the government does it with the people. If you 
   think about it, the government could coerce the company into reading 
   through information being passed back and forth....

Employees have the option of not sending personal information through
the company system, instead using a service they hire themselves.  The
people, if subjected to key-escrow in their private communications,
would only have the option of not sending the information via
electronic means if they wanted said info to be out of the range of
snoops.

The government should NOT be viewed similarly to an employer in its
relationship with citizens.  Employees are free to quit and make their
income some other way.
