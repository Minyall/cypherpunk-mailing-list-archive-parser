On reflection, it seems that some users will want an interoperable
standard, and other users will want complete stealth.  So what I'll
do is add a bunch of switches to pnmstego and pnmdestego, so that
the user can specify all sorts of different formats.  Letting the
switches default will get you a simple interoperable mode, so you
can send stuff to people without prior arrangement or put stuff on
an ftp server; but an attacker will be able to extract the bits and
try to decrypt them.  Specifying things like offsets and bit-usage
schedules will mean that the attacker won't even be able to extract
the bits; but the settings you use will be equivalent to that much
more key material that you have to communicate or remember.
