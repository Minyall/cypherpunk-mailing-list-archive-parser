It doesn't, I hate it when the press finds some new _esoteric
mathamatical concept that you ORDINARY joes is just too dumb ta'
understand_.
I especially hate it when the reporter demonstrates his own stupidity by
calling a conjecture like the butterfly effect an axiom >:{

I want to set fire to that butterfly and see what happens to New Yorks weather.

As for the PRNG I wonder if they did something like periodically rotate
the seeds...
