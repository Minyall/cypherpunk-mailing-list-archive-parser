	I have done a great deal of reading on the subject including most 
of the Physical Revew Letters, and in the end, I haven't seen the issue 
of the Public Channel really addresssed.
	In most articles it is explicitly assumed not to be a problem, or 
not even considered.
	But I think, if Eve is capable of manipulating the Public 
Channel, she may be able to eavesdrop or deduce the message.  I wrote a 
paper on it, but don't have it about here.   I could include my thoughts 
in more detail in a couple of days... but has anyone else given it any 
thought?
