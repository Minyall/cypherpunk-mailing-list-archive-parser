I call that "flat-rate".  Netcom charges $30 a month (I think) with
no marginal costs (right?); Harvey Mudd charges $20K a year with no
marginal costs (and certain other benefits, to be sure).

The reason that most access providers don't charge by the packet for
Internet traffic is that it's not economical to do so -- a T1
doesn't care how much you put across it.  As a result, they do flat
rate service, users generate more traffic, and users see a slower
network connection.  But until people aren't willing to pay
per-packet fees in order to deter excess traffic, this will continue.
