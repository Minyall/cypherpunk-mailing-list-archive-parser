Routine implants of transponder devices into humans are not a question of
if, but only of when. I predict that they will become routine before the
end of the decade. First they will be voluntary, used primarily  in
children to facilitate identification in case of abduction, some years
later they will become mandatory for all drivers, to combat the use of fake
driver licenses, and soon thereafter transponders will become the primary,
if not sole accepted form of ID for all business transactions. A generation
from now transponders will be mandatory used not only for identification,
but for routine tracking of the movements of every citizen. If you think
this sounds crazy, go to Germany, where you will find a camera on every
major intersection, tracking your every move.
