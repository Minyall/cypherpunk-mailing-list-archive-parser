Well, last time I looked for it, I couldn't find it.  And doesn't it use DES?
What does it use for key exchange?  I'd also have to hack it quite a bit 
to port it to linux, I think.  But if you could point me to an FTP site 
that has the code, I'd be willing to look at it.

Come to think of it, the last time I looked, I *did* find it on a Walnut 
Creek CD-ROM FTP server - but it wasn't complete, and it had no 
instructions for adding the DES code.  Could you refer me to a site that 
has the COMPLETE code, ready-to-build?
