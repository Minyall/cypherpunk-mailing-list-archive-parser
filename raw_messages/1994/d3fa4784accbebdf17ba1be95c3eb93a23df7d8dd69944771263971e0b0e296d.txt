I thought I answered this as clearly as I knew how.  Let me use
shorter sentences.

>I still don't have an answer for that, will it essentially
>be a checking account denominated in dollars 

Yes.

>or will the digital cash
>unit be detach from the dollar in some way?  

No.

Is this clear?  These are the plans I personally have.
