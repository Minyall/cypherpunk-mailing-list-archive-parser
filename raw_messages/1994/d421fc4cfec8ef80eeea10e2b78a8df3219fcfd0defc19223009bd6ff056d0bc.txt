This is exactly the sort of issue the Cypherpunks were formed to address.

CALL TO ACTION:

I suggest that those of us who are able to do so immediately lay plans to offer
such courses.  These courses should only contain open information, and they
be specifically advertised to foriegn nationals living in the US.

To the extent possible we should coordinate these courses, perhaps to content,
certainly to date and notification of the interested authorities.  The 
should happen in every corner of the land.  

The time for the CRYPT-INs has come!

[No one who supports with the government's right to suppress publically
available information should participate.]
