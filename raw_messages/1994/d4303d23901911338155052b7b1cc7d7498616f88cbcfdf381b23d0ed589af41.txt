Sorry to be a pain.  I just resubscribed after whatever it was that
happened that caused the massive unsubscription.

Anyway, I missed the start of the PGP 2.5 thread.  If someone archived
the messages between the unsubscription and now, I'd appreciate it
they'd get in touch with me so I can get a hold of them.  Well, except
for the Nalbandian message maybe :-)
