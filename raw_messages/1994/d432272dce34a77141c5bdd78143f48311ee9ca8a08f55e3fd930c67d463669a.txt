I have found a source for paper to print bumper stickers on.  It's a
thin plastic that is *very* sticky on one side, and made to go through
laser printers.

I have been tossing around some ideas for stickers to make, and I have come
up with a few... what so you think?

The WIRED ist icon, with and without text

"CYPHERPUNK CRIMINAL"

the "Warning: Strong Crypto" logo from the Tshirts

"1984: We're behind schedule, NSA"

and others.

Who would be interested, and does anyone have more ideas.

I would be selling individual stikers for between $0.50 and $1.00 each,
depending on their size (some may be 3" square, some may be "8x3", etc...)
