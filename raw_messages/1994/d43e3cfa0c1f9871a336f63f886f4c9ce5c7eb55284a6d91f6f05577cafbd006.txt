Indeed, many government policies can be understood only from this
perspective. Clipper is a perfect example. Key escrow exists only
because the NSA doesn't want to risk blame if some terrorist or drug
dealer were to use an unescrowed NSA-produced algorithm.

The fact that a terrorist or drug dealer can easily go elsewhere and
obtain other strong or stronger algorithms without key escrow is
irrelevant. The NSA simply doesn't care as long as *they* can't be
blamed for whatever happens. Classic CYA, nothing more.

A similar analysis applies to the export control regulations regarding
cryptography.
