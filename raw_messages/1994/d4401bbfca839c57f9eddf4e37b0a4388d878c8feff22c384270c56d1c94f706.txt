What do you know. Al Gore's home page might be a bust, but he presents the
"Tool kit to reinvent government" at http://www.npr.gov/

The page features a huge picture of Al hacking away on his computer. Still,
I have the suspicion that his ideas of reinventing the government are
somewhat different from ours. Well, he is asking for feedback through his
electronic townhall. Let's give him some.
