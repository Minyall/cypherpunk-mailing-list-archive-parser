I think the reason people attack the messenger is because people in the
government listen to her, and I for one am exasperated beyond words to
know that my government is paying attention to such an idiotic scheme, and
(BTW) violating every known law of security to do so.  Denning, in a very
real sense, represents the attitudes of the NSA and the people controlling
this whole scheme and trying to foist it off onto people.  Is she such an
idiot that she actually *believes* the nonsense she spouts? 

Is it wrong to suspect her motives, her judgement, her common sense, in
backing such a proposal?
