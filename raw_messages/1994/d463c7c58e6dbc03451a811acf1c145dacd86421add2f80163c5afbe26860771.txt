ftp cs.cmu.edu
cd /afs/andrew.cmu.edu/usr12/mg5n/public/remailer
get ghio.cp-remailer.tar.gz

gunzip & untar

Change the following line in the readheaders.c,
in the block_addr function:
  if (match==1) address[0]=0;
to
  if (match!=1) address[0]=0;

Your blocked.addresses file is now a pass-addresses file.
Put the email addresses of other remailers in the file.
You now have a stealth remailer.

Now, EVERYONE should go do this RIGHT NOW!
No more excuses for not running remailers...  :)
