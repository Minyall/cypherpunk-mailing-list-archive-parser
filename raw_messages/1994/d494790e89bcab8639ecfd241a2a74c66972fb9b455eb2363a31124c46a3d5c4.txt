     So true! A popular example of this is the following:

Classified Fact:    The Government is funding a new supersonic jet
                    project.
Unclassified Fact:  Boeing was awarded a new contract from the Government.
Unclassified Fact:  Boeing purchased 17.34 tons of titanium alloy.
Unclassified Fact:  Titanium is commonly used in supersonic jets.

.:, the govie awarded Boeing a Supersonic Jet contract.
