You can find this file at the gopher site (chaos.bsu.edu) in the Misc
directory, as "Sendmail and + in addressing".  Or something like that,
the Misc directory will be reorganized soon, and the file name may
change.

Also, I split Tim's large FAQ into 20 chapters and placed it in
FAQs/Cypherpunks/Cyphernomicon, if that makes it easier for some
people to digest ;)
