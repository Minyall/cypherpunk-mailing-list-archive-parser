A month or so back, there was a brief discussion talking about the 
production of a cypherpunks net.book.  Out of that discussion I talked 
about the fact that I (would) have a workstation available to provide a 
platform for various mailing lists if they were needed.

On of the suggestions that was made by Eric was that it might be a 'good 
thing'{tm} to creat some regional cypherpunk lists to facilitate the 
planning of physical meetings, to make announcements about speakers, or 
whatever.

In any case, I have the computer up and running, and am now in a position 
to create whatever cypherpunk mailing lists might be wanted or needed.  
So, does anyone have anything they'd want a mailing list for?
