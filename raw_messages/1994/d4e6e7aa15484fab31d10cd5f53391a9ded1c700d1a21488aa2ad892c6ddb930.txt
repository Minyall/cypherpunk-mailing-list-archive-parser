  I have restored the backup of the list from June 11th, and merged it
with the list as of a few minutes ago.
  Some list users who signed up again in the last three days are now
signed up twice for the list (due to signing up from a different
machine or having changed your name).  If you are getting two copyies
of the posting to the list, send majordomo@toad.com a "unsubscribe
cypherpunks" command from the machine that you don't want the list
going to.
  If you still have problems after trying that, please contact us via
cypherpunks-owner@toad.com or majordomo-owner@toad.com and we will fix
it by hand.
  Enjor, and write code and doc!
