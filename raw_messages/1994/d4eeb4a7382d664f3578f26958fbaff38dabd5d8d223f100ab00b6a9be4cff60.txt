The Japanese Yen is not a representation of a dollar but it is convertable
into dollars.  I think what was originally meant was whether the digital
cash will be in units equivalent to dollars and readily "convertable" into
dollars in the same sense that dollar bills were at one time readily
convertable into the amount of gold that they "represented."  Anyway, that
was my understanding of the question.
