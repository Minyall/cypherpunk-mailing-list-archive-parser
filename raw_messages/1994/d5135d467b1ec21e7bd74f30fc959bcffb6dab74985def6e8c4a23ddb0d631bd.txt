How does the 'tamperproof' nature of the software help at all?
It's still possible to double-spend in any off-line cash system
by making multiple copies of the tamper-proof modules.. the only
security provided is in obscuring the algorithm.
 
Speaking of digital cash, many thanks to the author of the
'magic money' software.  I am in the process of integrating it
with a local bulletin board, which should hopefully be available
on the net sometime this summer.
