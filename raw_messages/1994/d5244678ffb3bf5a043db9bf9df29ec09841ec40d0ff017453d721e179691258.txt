Uni (who is not a centralist):  "[It] almost sounds like you are 
calling for liberation from the Constitution of the United States."  
....  "I think it's difficult to accomplish what you propose.  This 
seems to me to amount to calling for the status of sovereignty to apply 
to every individual.  A system of individual sovereignty strikes me as 
unworkable, and again a slippery slope to complete lawlessness. "

Say, is the Cypherpunks list? where they intend to use PGP in
defiance of government decrees to the contrary?

Uni: " What I feel is the obligation of the sovereign is to limit the
level of corruption of the individual by forebearing from unneeded
exertions of authority."

Maybe they would do this if you said "Pretty Please".
