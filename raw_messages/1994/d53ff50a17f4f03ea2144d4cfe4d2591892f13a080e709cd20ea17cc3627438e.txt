Its not a question of deriding the estimate...

...its a question of deriding the security of any system that takes so
little time to crack, and thats assuming there are no better attacks
than brute force (yet to be determined). With optimization, you can do
even better than that. With a little bit of hardware (not very much)
you can crack open a 40 bit keyspace with the effort normally reserved
for opening your bathroom door in the morning.
