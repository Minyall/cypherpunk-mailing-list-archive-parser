I think you misunderstand.  Perry and I are talking about the
algormithm (If it exists) being O(log_2(n)).  That is, "log base 2 of n".
This means that the time taken is proportional to the log to the base
two of the number of keys.

Fascinating as this speculation is, I see no way to craft such
an algorithm.  The nature of the modular space makes "larger"
and "smaller" difficult to distinguish.
