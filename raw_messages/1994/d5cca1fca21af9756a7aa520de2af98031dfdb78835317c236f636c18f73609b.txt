C'punks,

Okay, back to basics.  David Merriman wrote:

    But if the system is set up for total anonymity, _who
    would know_ that an escrow agent was the "bag man"? Just
    like no one would know who the contractee was, or the
    contractor:

The escrow agent is a publicly known entity.  That's how it gets
a reputation.  How do you imagine an escrow agent could get a
reputation for being a murder's bag man if it didn't advertise
as such.  If it advertises as such, I believe most people would
refuse to do any business with it.  If it doesn't advertise, how
will it get those sorts of clients?  There is no reputational
incentive to perform the loathsome service, and plenty of
incentive to (a) just keep the money, or (b) blow the whistle to
the cops and the intended victim (and keep the money).  Please
note, this was all intuitively obvious from my previous post.
