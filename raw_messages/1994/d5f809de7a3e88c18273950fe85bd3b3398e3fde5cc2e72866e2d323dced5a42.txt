Is there any way to make Majordomo tell all such newbie posters how to
subscribe (send a mail with "subscribe cypherpunks" to majordomo@toad.com)?

After all, almost anyplace you find the Cypherpunks list mentioned, the 
address given is the list address, not the subscription one. We can't really
expect people who are not necessarily very net-aware, who just happened to
see the address in some article somewhere, to know all about mailing list
protocol...
