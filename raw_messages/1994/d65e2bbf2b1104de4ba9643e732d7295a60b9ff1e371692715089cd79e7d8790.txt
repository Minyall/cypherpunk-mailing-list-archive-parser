	Ah ha!  Another facet of a LIST run authentication system
	[Cypherpunks Run Authentication System - CRASs?]
	may be to allow users to mail THE LIST and ask their mail
	to be filtered so they don't have to pay for msgs they don't
	want.  THIS IS DANGEROUS because a forger could mail in
	such a request.. to patch this, THE LIST could mail out a
	weekly msg -- a compiled list of which msgs got thru, and
	which were filtered, and why. 

	This opens up another possibility which may prove more
	effective.  If THE LIST can maintain a list of msgs/posters/
	PGP authentication, then those users who trust THE LIST
	to authenticate their mail can select the msgs they want
	to receive [from the same compiled list].
