You're right, it's an account, just as cknight@crl.com is just an 
account, and you've attached the psueonym "Chris Knight" to it.

Price of being anonymous.  You mean the price of being Obviously 
anonymous.  As opposed to this "Chris Knight" character, who has chosen 
to show himself as to what looks like a real name.  Ever wonder about
Emanuel Goldstein?  That name is as valid as "Chris Knight"

I'm not going to touch this.  After reading a few of "tmp@netcom"'s 
messages, I aggree that he has been posting what "appear" to be childish 
posts.  But at the same time, there are many other posts here on this 
list with just as much useless information.

Are cypherpunks for anonyminity?  Authentication?  Privacy?  More than one?
