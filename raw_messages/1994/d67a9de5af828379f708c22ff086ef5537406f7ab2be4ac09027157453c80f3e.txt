   The last point is certainly not true.  If user X communicates with
   service A (a gateway) in one country to purchase something from
   service B in another country, X can settle accounts with A anonymously
   (say in US$) and then A and B can settle accounts with one another
   (say in sterling) openly.

May I point out that that in your example that X and A are performing
an anonymous transfer in dollars, which is one of the two currencies?
