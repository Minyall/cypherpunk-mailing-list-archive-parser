To whoever is sending the piles of messages through my remailer that contain
the "Do-Inject:" header line:
You might as well leave the remailer at rebma.mn.org out of whatever it is
you are doing.  Your mail is not making it through.  I'm not directly on
the Internet.  If your goal is to supply bogus traffic to make traffic analysis
impractical, I applaud your thinking, but not your implementation. 

You're filling up my disk drive, dude.
