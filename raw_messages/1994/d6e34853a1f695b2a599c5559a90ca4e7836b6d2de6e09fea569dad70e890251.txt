... well almost.  It's trivial to write a program that extracts the LSB's 
from a GIF file and then determine their randomness.  Truly random data 
gives away the presence of an encrypted file. The solution is to choose 
the LSB's that you alter according to the output from a decent random 
number generator so that each LSB has a probability of being altered.
