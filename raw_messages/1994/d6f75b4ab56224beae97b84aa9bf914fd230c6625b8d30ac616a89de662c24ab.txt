Hello Cypherpunks,

  Another new remailer anon@cyberspace.org is on-line now... Does anyone know
if one can get news postings via. email? My site doesn't support a few of the
groups i'd like to read. Can i get subscribed to any using email? I know that
my INBOX would see more traffic...

                                Thanks in advance,
				Anonymous Remailer.

ps - sorry no pgp support... <not enough disk space for pgp executable or for
any logs> thanks...
