   ... goes away fast at higher angular frequencies.  So all in all, I am inclined
   to think that the best ground resolution attainable with a 2-meter aperture
   from orbit is about an inch.  That is in fact just about enough to read a ...

Could the same effect (as a segmented mirror) be achieved by taking multiple
pictures (from the same mirror) and processing them together? E.g. does
synthetic aperture radar actually produce higher resolution than achievable
from a single "snapshot"? If so, then this might work (at least for slow-moving
targets :-)...
