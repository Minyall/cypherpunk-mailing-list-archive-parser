It is now possible to send outgoing mail via the alias remailer at
alpha.c2.org.  To send a message, create a message of the following
format:

From: me@alpha.c2.org (My Nym)
Password: mypass
Subject: test
To: alt.test@demon.co.uk

This is my message.

Encrypt this with the public key for the remailer and send it to
alias@alpha.c2.org.  It will decrypt it and send your message
(after verifying and removing the password line.)
