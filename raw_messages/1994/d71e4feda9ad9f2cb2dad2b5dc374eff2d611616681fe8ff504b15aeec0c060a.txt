I am in the 'la area' too, which makes us three.  Perhaps we should
hold a concurrent meeting here next month?  I could host, but my house
is in Arleta (in the SF valley).  Eric, how hard is it to create
cp-la@toad.com?  Until, or unless, it is set up, I will operate
jpp=lacp@markv.com as a mailing list.  Mail to jpp=lacp=request@
markv.com to be added to the list.
