The proposed standards I've seen on the net say you can't encrypt
*after* using Clipper, because that makes Clipper key-theft useless.
On the other hand, encryption with real systems before encrypting with
Clipper is undetectable until after they decrypt the Clipper, so it's
hard to enforce except on people who are already suspects,
and is unlikely to be convenient to implement (for interoperability)
on some of the major Clipper targets, like cellphones and fax machines.

...... Wiretap the usual suspects!
