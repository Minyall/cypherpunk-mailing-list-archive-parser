Its even worse than that.  They have a catch phrase - "other legal
authority", where some do not require a warrant.

While not having formally answered this, it has been indicated that the
unit key is sent encrypted to a decoder box, which can disassemble the
LEAF and extract the session key.  I believe this decoder is based on a
PC, which leaves one to wonder about even the possibility of timelocking
the transaction.
(the crypto algorithm is contained in a chip on a P.C. board.)
