Okay, "joined" in the sense that the light collected by each mirror must
be added coherently to produce the final image. This coherent addition
requires precise control of the phase of each component to a small fraction
of a wavelength. This is hard.

Someday there may be phased array antennas operating at optical wavelengths.
Not yet.
