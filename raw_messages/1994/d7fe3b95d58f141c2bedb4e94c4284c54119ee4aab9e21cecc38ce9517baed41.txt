Assuming the language we are using is English, this is just plain wrong.
Government has nothing to do with throwing people into prison or using
guns. It is an entity that exercises authority. Or an entity that enforces
laws. I understand that you feel strongly that certain types of punishment
are inappropriate. Fine, but that doesn't change the language.

They can take away your personal property by force and they are not
governments? Why not?

Well I know my definition of government and I know websters definition of
government, but this is the first I've heard of defining government by the
force it weilds. I guess all I have to do is buy a gun if I want to start a
government.

I'm curious were it is you got your definition. I looked around for it, but
I just couldn't find it.
