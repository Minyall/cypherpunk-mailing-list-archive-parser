Because that's where his host is, Lefty! Before deciding to see about getting
a local access node here, my best bet for private internet access was
going to be Portal out in California, and I would have gotten about
30 hrs. access a month (off-peak) for fifty dollars.

This is cyberspace. Physical location is irrelevant.
