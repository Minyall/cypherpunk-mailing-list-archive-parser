   "Attention Businesses...Accept Personal and Business Checks Over The
   Telephone (or by fax) for Your Orders, Payments, Collections and
   Donations!"

   Could this be useful for a digital cash bank interface?

Sure could.  Problem is that they charge something like $2 per check
they write for you.  Makes it hard to deal with small amounts.

Other problem is that people are resistant to give you their checking
account number.  Yes, it's no worse than actually sending a check, but
who ever said that people were rational?
