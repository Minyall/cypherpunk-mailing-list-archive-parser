-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----


Someone recently posted a forged message with my name on it to the
Cypherwonks list. In the future, all of my messages will be sent
PGP-clearsigned. Please ignore (or mail to me) any messages which
aren't - particularly if they appear to support Detweiler and his
totalitarian schemes, which this particular forgery did.

The header of the message in question was a byte-for-byte duplicate
of an authentic header from a message I did write; apparently our
favorite cyberspatial lunatic has moved beyond just signature blocks.
