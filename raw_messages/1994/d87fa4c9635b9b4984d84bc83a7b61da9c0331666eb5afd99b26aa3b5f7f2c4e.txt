This has nothing to do with security...

Clearly I'm an idiot. Explain it to me. And while you are at it, why don't you
email me your comments on the spec? I put my email address in there for that
very reason. Jeesh.

This is an outright lie. We don't use TIPEM. You could build a
conformant SSL implementation using RSAREF and the freeware IDEA
cipher code. As for a barrier to competition. So what else is new? We
all have barriers to overcome before we can compete. Should we get rid of
TCP/IP as a barrier to using the web?

You are somewhat right here. In fact, this was done because we are a company
interested in surviving long enough to withstand the eventual attack
by microsoft. Instead of waiting several years before anything was agreed
upon and ending up with a kitchen sink protocol as all others these days
do, we took a simpler approach. And instead of hiding in a closet with
it, we brought it out to light. As a result we received critical review
from some decent members of the crypto community, including:

	Martin Abadi
	Mike Burrows
	Alan Schiffman
	Matt Robshaw
	Burt Kaliski

to name a few. As for the IETF standards process, we are pushing the
document into the RFC process.

This is a matter of opinion. However, I believe that our opinions
don't matter in the long run because of the 800 pound gorilla
Microsoft. They will push something out, it will be proprietary, and
they will name the tune and ask us to play along. Now we can either
just sit back in our current comfy cozy standards based processes and
languish for a few years, and then SIGH and say "Gee wasn't that fun,
too bad microsoft shoved yet another piece of excrement down our
throats" or we can be "loose cannons", get something out there, try it
out and see what happens. The market will decide one way or the other.
