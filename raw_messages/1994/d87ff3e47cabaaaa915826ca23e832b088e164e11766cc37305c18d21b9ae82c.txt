   Yes, if transmitted in the clear, PGP is legal now :-).  Vendors on the
   net need to be pushed to use encryption.

I'm not referring to the problem of sniffing credit card numbers off
the net.  I'm referring to the problem of credit card fraud by the
operation on the receiving end.  Even if the transmission is
encrypted, there's still risk.
