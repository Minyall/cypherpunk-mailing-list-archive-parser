Let me see if I understand your scheme: you prepend 4 unpredictable
bytes to the data before running through each single des cycle.  What do
you do with the 4 bytes from each cycle that are shifted into the end of
the datastream?  Is the datastram vulnerable to independent search there,
too?

Assuming the 4 bytes really are unpredictable, and assuming you deal with
both "ends" of the stream, there doesn't seem to be an *obvious* attack
that allows independent search for each of the 2 or 3 des keys.  There
was a paper in Eurocrypt this year (that I haven't seen yet) that
discusses some not-so-obvious properties of multi-cipher modes that may
reveal another attack, however.

If you don't think you've weakened 3-des, now the question is whether you've
strengthened it (or otherwise improved it).  Your method doesn't seem to
increase the complexity of a brute force attack on the 112 (or 168) bits of
3-des key material.  In fact, you may have actually increased the number of
bits of key material (if the decryptor has to know extra secret bytes in order
to recover the ends of messages) that the good guy has to manage without
increasing the work factor for the bad guy.

3 des is plenty strong, and if you don't trust or otherwise don't want
to use 3-des, it's not clear that this offers an improvement.
