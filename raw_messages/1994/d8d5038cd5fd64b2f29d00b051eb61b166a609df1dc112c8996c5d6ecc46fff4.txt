Does AIL, er, AOL have kill files?  The reporter trying valiantly to
cover the story with some kind of objectivity was reduced to observing
that some people just can't ignore any email - they have some kind of
weird need to read every message.  I guess this goes for messages even
from those they want to ignore.

In order to overcome this, do email kill files have to do their work
silently, so the user can avoid stress about what they're missing?
