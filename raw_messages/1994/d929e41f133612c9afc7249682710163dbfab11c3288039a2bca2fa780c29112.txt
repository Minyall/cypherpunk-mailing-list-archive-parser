The "final" pre-print version (dated August 20, 1994) of my paper, "Protocol
Failure in the Escrowed Encryption Standard" is now available.  You can get
it in PostScript form via anonymous ftp from research.att.com in the file
/dist/mab/eesproto.ps .  This version replaces the preliminary draft
(June 3) version that previously occupied the same file.  Most of the
substance is identical, although few sections are expanded and a few minor
errors are now corrected.  I'd appreciate it if anyone who's citing
the paper use this version.

Only PostScript format is available.  Sorry.

This paper will be presented at the 2nd ACM Conference on Computer and
Communications Security in Fairfax in November.
