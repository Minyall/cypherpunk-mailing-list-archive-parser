Take a look at the errata (I'm quoting from version 1.5.9).

} Page 287:  Last line:  Wiener's attack is misstated.  If d is
} less than one-quarter the length of the modulus, then the attack
} can use e and n to find d quickly.

Still, I do prefer e=65537 to e=17 (the value that PGP typically 
uses). But the situation isn't as bad as it looks from reading 
Schneier.
