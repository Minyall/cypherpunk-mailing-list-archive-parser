Again, as I've noted, there are people who will need, for whatever
reason, to fix their old 2.3a (or pre-2.3a) system so that it will
interoperate.  Assuming that 2.5 finds its way overseas, it is not an
unreasonable code base for FUTURE development. However, what we are
talking about is not new development but retrofits.
