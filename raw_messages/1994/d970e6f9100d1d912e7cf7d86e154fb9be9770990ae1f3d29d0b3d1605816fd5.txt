There was an error in the earlier message describing format of the magic
money coins.dat files.  The C.ID field (my name for it) has as its low
16 bytes not the coin ID, but rather the MD5 hash of the coin ID.  This
is supposed to make it harder to create fake money, according to the earlier
discussion on cypherpunks list.
