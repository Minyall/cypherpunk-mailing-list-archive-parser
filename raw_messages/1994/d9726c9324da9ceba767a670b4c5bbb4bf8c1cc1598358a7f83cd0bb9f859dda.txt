Hey PGP gurus:

A Mr. Ken Nahan (of New York, *I think*) was on the NBC Today show 
this morning, discussing his plans to set up a commercial art gallery 
on the internet.  He intends to set up some kind of server with graphic 
images and text descriptions of works of art which are for sale.  He 
also wants to be able to accept bids via the internet.

Some knowledgeable person should talk to him about digital signatures,
PGP, etc.  

Regards,

Brad  bdolan@well.sf.ca.us
