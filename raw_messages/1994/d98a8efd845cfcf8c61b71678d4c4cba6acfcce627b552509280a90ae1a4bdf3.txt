I have to disagree. What I am asking is a binary question, not one of 
magnitude. I never care what the magnitude is. Don't want to know it.
Will give it away unopened if I do get it. If all you know is 1/0 then
you can't use it to factor the number. The other aspect of your method
is, yes it can give  you some of the factors, but it has no guarantee 
that you will find all of them. If your algorithm can'g guarantee it 
finds all of them every time then it can't be positively used to factor
number.

To each their own (opinion). I am not breaking anything, I *am* asking for
a reference. 

There seems to be a particular sub-set of prima donnas on c-punks who feel
it is their duty to stipulate what kinds of questionsss can be asked and
how much one has to know to ask them. I  have only one other question 
for these folks, do you work for the government or the church?
