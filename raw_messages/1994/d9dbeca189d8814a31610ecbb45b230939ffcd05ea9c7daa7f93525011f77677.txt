	Yes, not to mention that it just seems a lot cleaner so to 
speack, and also I dont have IRC here.  I think a virtual MOO is very 
important at this juncture.  It's probably the best low-cost(as in close 
to nil) virtual meeting you can get.  Just as long as I can get a 
client(not a prob) and am sufficiently prepared to figure out wht MOO 
it's on etc.. so I can go get accustumed. etc...
