Depends on what you call ultra-left. You have a very serious socialist
here... I don't advertise it much becuase too many libertarian
types spam me trying to tell me why I'm wrong. Maybe I am the only
one that gets tired of those arguments...

Well, you were doing well for a while...:) And this pinko agrees
110% with the last statement.

My own personal opinion is that waiting for governments to collapse
due to crypto and tech is gonna have you waiting a long, long time.
I prefer doing something with the tools at hand to dreaming. And the
government isn't all bad, as is; just mostly bad. Heck, let me be
so optimistic as to say maybe even fixable, at least to what I want
to see.
