I'm following the unfolding tale with interest.  The document itself
is trivial and looks like a thousand others throughout the government
(and in the private sector too, particularly in the Beltway Bandits
who service the 'national security' establishment).  But what is
interesting is the response from the throne room when the peasantry
dares point out that the King of Encryption has no clothes.
