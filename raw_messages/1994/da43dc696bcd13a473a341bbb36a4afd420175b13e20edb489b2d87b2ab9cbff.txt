Perhaps some improvement on RISC architectures could be achieved by
using four arrays, 32 bits wide by 256 entries long.  The arrays would
mirror the single array in the original code, except that the
"interesting" byte would be at a different position in each.  Then,
the main encryption loop could be unwound so that you'd do four
operations to each word, one from each array to hit the four bytes.  
(You'd do the increment/swap between each one.)  This *might* be
worthwhile.

(On an Alpha, you'd have 8 arrays...)
