	Not the same program at all. Why don't you actually read some of the
	RFCs instead of making yourself look foolish?

Well if you have nothing useful to contribute but won't shut up anyway,

	Have you asked them to run it? Have you considered simply running the
	daemon yourself on another port instead of implementing some crude
	hack?

I already do this.

Goodbye.
