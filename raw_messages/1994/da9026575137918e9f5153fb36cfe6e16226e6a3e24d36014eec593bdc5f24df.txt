I agree with Tim May that Usenet newsgroups can do the job of a  
global message pool.  However, it takes too damn long to get a reply.   
It typically takes 3 to 4 days before I see replies to messages I  
post to Usenet.  I wouldn't want to use Usenet for one-on-one  
communication.  I'd prefer a network of indexed message pools like I  
described in an earlier post.
