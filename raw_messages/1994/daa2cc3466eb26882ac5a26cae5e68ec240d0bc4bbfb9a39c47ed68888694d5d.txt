The ALGORITHIM also contains information.  If the ALGORITHIM is part of a 
secret key, so much the better.  To say exactly how much information an 
algorithim contains is, to say the least, formatable.  In the case of 
functions, it is simple.

Lets put the question to addition, how much entropy does + have when 
applied to bits.?
