Here is my vote for "its a bad idea". Cypherpunks is NOT an
organization. Leave the organizational fronting to people like CPSR
and EFF who have good PR people and know what they are doing. They've
done a great job thus far.

If we want to answer blowhards who claim we are a small number of
nuts, we can just show off the Time magazine poll.
