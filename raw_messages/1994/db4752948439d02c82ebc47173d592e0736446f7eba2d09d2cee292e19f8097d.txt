At the Hughes/Blaze/Stratton talk at HOPE, Eric announced that he'd be
 speaking for the Society for Electronic Access in NYC on "Pivacy,
 Anonymity, and Money" on Tuesday.  I don't remember seeing it on
 cypherpunks and don't know whether Eric would get a chance to announce
 it, so what the hell.

It'll be Tuesday, August 16th, 1994, at 49 Chambers St., Room 610,
 in Manhattan.

("Where's the CRIME?"?  Maybe that was Detweiler.)
