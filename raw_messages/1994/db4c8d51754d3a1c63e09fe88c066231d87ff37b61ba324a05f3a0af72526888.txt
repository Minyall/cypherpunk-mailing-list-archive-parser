Think about this.  Under whose law would your running PGP 2.5 be
illegal?  Your country's perhaps, I don't know.  But the U.S. has
no law against foreigners (who aren't under its jurisdiction, anyway)
using encryption.

Now, it's illegal under the ITAR for someone in the U.S. to export
any version of PGP, or almost any crypto software.  This is for
National Security reasons, natch.  And most U.S. use of pre-2.4 
versions probably infringes on RSA's patent on the math behind PGP.
But once it's over the border, none of this matters (until GATT
extends the miracle of uniform software patents to its signatories).
