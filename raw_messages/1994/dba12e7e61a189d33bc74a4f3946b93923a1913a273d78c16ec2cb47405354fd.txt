I think that Mosaic pages are the way to go these days.  These
are not hard to write and they are very nice to use.  For some 
interesting examples of what can be done, check out some of the 
existing cypherpunk mosaic pages:

   ftp://soda.berkeley.edu/pub/cypherpunks/Home.html
   ftp://ftp.u.washington.edu/public/phantom/cpunk/README.html
   http://www.quadralay.com/www/Crypt/Crypt.html

I think it would be good to have a "cypherpunks-essay" mailing list
that was not moderated but people only sent essays that they thought
were good enough to be archived.  For starters, people can just
CC: mail to "vac+cypheressay" and it will get dropped into a separate
file in:

 ftp://furmint.nectar.cs.cmu.edu/security/cypheressay

My "vac+cypheressay" was done with one line in my .maildelivery
and a short shell script I call "save-numbered".  Both are below
(note the A.I. methods used to moderate mail).

Having a "cypherpunks-essay" mailing list on the same machine as 
"cypherpunks" could be nice for folks who want a lower volume group.
Could have mail to it also go to cypherpunks, and Reply-To: also 
go to cypherpunks.
