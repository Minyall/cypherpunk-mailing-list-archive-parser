This has been hashed almost to death before.  The use of crypto does not
remove the fear of prosecution.  It only makes it more difficult to
intercept messages in transit.  Actions at both ends of the transaction

We don't have any duty to make law enforcement's job easier, especially
at the cost of our privacy.
