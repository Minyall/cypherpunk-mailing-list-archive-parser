I saw a movie last night called "The President's Analyst".  The movie  
was made in the mid 60's.  It's an action comedy that stars James  
Coburn as the President's psychiatrist who sneaks away from the job  
because he doesn't like it.  Most of the movie consists of silly  
scenes of spies from the world's major countries chasing after Coburn  
under the assumption he knows all the President's secrets.  At one  
point in the movie the Russian spy is talking to the US spy...

Russian spy:  You mean all the phones in the country are tapped?  But  
this is America, not the Soviet Union!!

It's a moderately funny movie that contains more truth now than when  
it was first shown.  I recommend it as a cheap laugh and somewhat  
relevant to today's issues.
