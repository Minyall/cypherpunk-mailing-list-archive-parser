I'm not sure the ECPA provides the protection you want here.  I'll have 
to look again, and do not assert this as certain, because I'm only 
pulling of the top of my head what I remember from a quick scan of the

Anyone want to repost it?  I recall it limited the ECPA in some 
interesting way, and I remember being offened, and not surprised at the 
narrow reading.
