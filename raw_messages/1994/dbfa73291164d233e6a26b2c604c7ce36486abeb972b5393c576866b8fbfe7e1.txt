Indeed.  If/when this technology becomes widespread, to the
right/wrong people this data will become an exceedingly valuable
target for theft or destruction.  We're talking outlandish James Bond
plots here; it becomes realistically worthwhile.

If you're an organization with no special love for the US Government
and plenty of resources at your disposal, would you choose to go
through the pain and labor of trying to break the cryptosystem when
you know the keys are all sitting around in a couple of filing
cabinets?
