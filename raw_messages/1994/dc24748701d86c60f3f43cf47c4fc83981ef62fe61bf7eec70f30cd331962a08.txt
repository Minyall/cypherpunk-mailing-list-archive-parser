Subject: Detweiler's SQUISH broadcast: can remailers filter out addressee?

I'm not familiar with anonymous remailer internals.  Would it be cheap
in terms of hack-time to add the capability for an anonymous remailer
to maintain a list of addresses (or address regexp's) which do not
wish to receive anonymous remailed messages?

That way, if Detweiler is sending unwanted msgs to say,
"chess-fans@foo.bar.com" via an anonymous remailer, and the readers of
chess-fans complained to the (hopefully responsive) remailer operator,
the remailer operator could add the "chess-fans" address to a "don't-
remail-to-these-folks" list so that the nice readers of chess-fans can
read mail in peace.

However, if the "Don't-mail-to-these-folks" list gets too long, it
would probably degrade remailer performance... sigh.  (remailer authors:
is this a correct assumption?)

(Perhaps the "don't-mail" addresses could be tagged with amount of time
somebody last attempted them;  addresses that no one's attempted to
hit in say, a year, could be expired.)

NeoSoft is a commercial access provider, not my employer.  (They didn't
demand identity verification when I signed up, either.  Yay, capitalism!)

P.S. Larry:  I didn't make the "tentacle" list in your SQUISH post?  I
feel slighted!  Please correct in the next version.
