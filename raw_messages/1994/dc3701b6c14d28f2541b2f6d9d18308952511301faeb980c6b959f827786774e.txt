I seem to remember from way back in high school that the number of

of legal moves.

	The number of moves in a given chess position is less than 64
(number of starting squares) times 64 (number of destination squares)
x 4 [number of ways a pawn can promote]. Thus we get the bound 16, 384
[which can be easily improved] which is way less than "billions of
possible moves". The same computation shows that the number of
possible games of length n grows at worst expoentially pace mr
markley.

The right way to think about this is to get sharp upper bounds rather
than attempt a precise calculation. A crude upper bound would be
longerst possible game is about 6000 moves [using the 50 move rule].
At most 2**16 mves per position so at most 10**[192 * 10**6] games.
I'm sure that sharper estimates are readily available.
