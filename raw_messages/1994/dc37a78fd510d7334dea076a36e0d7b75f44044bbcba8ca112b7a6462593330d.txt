Since this is the second request, I will take the bold liberty of
wasting a little cypherpunks bandwidth:

	chile-heads-request@chile.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu

Please, don't get on the list just to badger Sternlight.  (Unless of

surprisingly high, and (though there are bursts of newbie gaffs) the
S/N is pretty good.
