ANI and CID are different, by the way.

The only way I can imagine this working is if the ultimate receiver of
the caller ID information is badly designed, and the diverter in
question is strangely designed to exploit those bad designs.  Caller
ID comes through between the first and second ring pulses.  Any Caller
ID box or modem that decides to recognize the modulated CID
information after the second ring pulse is, IMHO, broken.

The only place for your dreamed-of device or the diverter you
described to put the CID information is directly through the completed
circuit after the called party answers.  If they have a truly
brain-damaged caller ID box that only stores one number, and they fail
to look at the box before they pick up the phone, then *maybe* they'd
be fooled.  Doesn't sound like much "security" to me.

Do you really have access to one of these call diverters?  If so,
could you post the brand and model?
