Good point.  The line between storage and transmission gets kind of 
fuzzy, however, if transmitted messages get stored in encrypted form.  I 
think that if I were designing an encryption system to be used for both 
in my own business, I would probably consider a compartmented escrow 
system for both kinds of messages, with a different escrow public key for 
each department.  That is would be a good balance between two evils:  
unauthorized disclosure of proprietary communications, and loss of 
encrypted data due to loss of a key or loss of an employee.  Naturally, 
this would not be as convenient for law enforcement agents and spies, but 
I suppose that my own escrow data base would still be subject to the same 
subpoena process as the rest of my records, but I would be more likely to 
know when information was being leaked.
