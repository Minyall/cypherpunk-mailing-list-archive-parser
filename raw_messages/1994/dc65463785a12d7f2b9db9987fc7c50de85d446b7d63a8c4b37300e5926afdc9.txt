   I friend of mine has shown me a bug in MacPGP that allows someone to come
along after you have decrypted a message, check "Recycle Passwords" in the 
options menu and proceed to decrypt any encrypted messages you have.  
Even if you didn't have "Recycle passwords" selected before you decrypted the 
message, PGP will recycle the passwords.  I assume it exists in all versions.
