I just installed procmail (on my Linux system at work).  The 
installation (readme, makefile, hand-holding along the way)
was _very_ nice.  It earns my hearty endorsement.

Please advertise crypto enhancements to procmail to me (in
email if not of general list interest).  Who has the procmail
integrated PGP (signing, etc.)?

Cort.
