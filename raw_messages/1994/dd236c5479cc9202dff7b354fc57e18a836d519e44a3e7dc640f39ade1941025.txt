The constitution has no age limit on the basic rights it
guarantees.  It is only by interpretation that these rights have
been transformed into "adult rights", a term just as obnoxious to
many as "white rights" or "men's rights" were when those
interpretations prevailed.

Your right to do whatever you like to your children stops where
their constitutionally protected rights begin.

I'm all in favor of an uncensored Net but I am also in favor of
guaranteed access to that Net for all citizens, including young
ones.
