This is the way to get people to use crypto.

It would also be useful to patch majordomo to check signature
consistency -- to check that a message signed by X is signed
with the same public key as previous messages by X (a non
trivial problem because of the key distribution issue).

In the absence of such tools, nagging people to use crypto
is unlikely to do much to further the cause.
