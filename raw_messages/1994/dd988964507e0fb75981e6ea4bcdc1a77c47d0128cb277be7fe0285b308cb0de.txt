I newgrouped alt.anonymous.messages as a simple implementation of a
message pool.  I imagine that it will take a while to propagate, but
once it's accessible from the mail-to-news gateways, it should serve
as a more reasonable place than alt.security.pgp or alt.test for
anonymous communication that's less subject to traffic analysis on the
recipient side.
