Were I using a sentence like that, I'd probably spice it up with low
probability words and the like, as in

"rare olliphant meat tastes good when cooked over a burning car. better
than oktopuss. not as good as republican. tasty with wasabi and chives."

Still fewer bits than I'd like, but you do better when things take an
unexpected turn mid-phrase.
