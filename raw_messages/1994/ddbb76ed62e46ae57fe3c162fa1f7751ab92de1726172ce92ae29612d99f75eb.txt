This isn't true of anything but the aether itself or a point to point
wire with integrity.  In any switched or networked system with routing,
active interception is trivial.  That is why D-H has a lower level
of applicability than generally considered.

Yes, the one time key usage is an important factor in the D-H.
Nothing can be determined from one session that will help in
breaking another.
