I would like to emphasize that it is useless and a jeopardy to those
who communicate with anyone on a public connect service such as Netcom
using PGP.  The *only* way that PGP can be used effectively is to run
it on a local computing resource like a PC that is *not* directly
connected to the net.  It is irresponsible to use it otherwise.

I don't mean to flame.  The danger and futility of using PGP on a
multi-user, networked system seems non-obvious to a lot of folks.


Peace,

Bob
