I have actually tried memorizing truly random passwords of 8 characters 
or longer (generated with a paranoid program similar to PGP 2.6's 
excellent technique).  I've found that if I review it enough, that I find 
patterns and mnemonic clues in such passwords that help me to remember 
them.  I don't imagine too many people will go through that effort, so I 
still think that a longer pass phrase that sort of "makes sense" is 
better for a PGP key.  Still, I do use the truly random passwords on 
publicly accessible Unix systems like CSN, since that makes dictionary 
attacks improbable.
