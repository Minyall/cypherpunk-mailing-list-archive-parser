The notion of government as a product which must compete on an
equal footing with others in society definitely wins "Nifty Idea
of the Week" in my book.

Reminds me of something TS Eliott once said.  "If only we had a
system so perfect it did not require that people be good."
Perhaps "government in cyberspace" will be the first working
example of this paradigm.
