  I now have my system somewhat kludged into the net. I can now EASILY 
send and receive PGP messages from my home box. I am connected to my 
shell account at free.org throught a local xyplex terminal server and 
term 2.0.4

  I use popclient to get my mail from my host(a better way may be 
possible), and I have my local smtp service redirected to 
squeaky.free.org so that I can send mail out without a hassle.

  Anyone who needs help getting set up like this can e-mail me. PGP 
messages are welcome!

   Brian
