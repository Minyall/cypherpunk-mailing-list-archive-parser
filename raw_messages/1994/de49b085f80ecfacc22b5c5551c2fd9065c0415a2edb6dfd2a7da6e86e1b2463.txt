Speaking of which, can anyone explain why my usually-MIME-compliant mail
reader (ELM 2.4 PL22) pukes on the fancy parts of all these draft
announcements ?  Personally, I find MIMEd messages very annoying because I'm
forced to hit RETURN (not just "any key") several extra times for each
message.  {Luckily, it's clear that I'd never have time to read any of these,
so they get tossed in the bit bucket almost immediately.}
