   The principle the arbitrary precision that comes from continuum
is swamped by just about everything else so building a machine
based on it is practically impossible?

  I wasn't talking specifically to you, I was talking to James 
Donald. It's conceivable that little green men also exist,
do you have a particular example in mind of your non-algorithmic
phenomena?

    Your turn. I already layed out the definition. I can quote it from
as many automata theory texts as you like. One can not simply change
the definition of algorithm just because one doesn't like it. If
you do, you're no better than dear old Ludwig.
