C'punks,

Several of you have asked *where* my proposed privacy would be held.  The
answer is "cyberspace," natch.  It would be "free" to you, but TANSTAAFL
(There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lecture).  Duncan and I, however,
retain the right to charge you through the nose for personal consultations
or services.  The "when" questions will be answered as soon as Duncan and 
I can come up with a good plan of action.

Thanks for all the positive responses.
