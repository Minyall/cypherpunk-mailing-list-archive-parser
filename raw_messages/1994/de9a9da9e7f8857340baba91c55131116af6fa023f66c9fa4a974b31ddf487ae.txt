Maybe I can save you some trouble. Here is a "strong" 1024-bit prime
and generator that I've been using for Diffie Hellman key exchange to
set up keys for IP packet encryption. 

For a "strong" prime p, (p-1)/2 is also prime. This is thought to make
the discrete logarithm problem maximally hard. --Phil

Generator = 5

You're welcome to verify that this is indeed a strong prime; this should
be considerably faster than searching for one from scratch.
