I second Hal's suggestion to route Detweiler's traffic through Xenon's
remailer.

(Xenon - the point isn't to keep Detweiler off the net. We all know
that's impossible. The point is to keep Detweiler from getting remailers
shut down by abusing them. That's why this is particularly unlike
censorship; Detweiler's goal is to keep all people from using remailers.)
