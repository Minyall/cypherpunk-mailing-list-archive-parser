I'm pleased to announce the release of an unofficial version of PGP v2.6ui
that allows for key generation up to 8176 bits, thanks are due to Tom
Rollins for his diligence compiling the code and also to Mathew at Mantis
Consultants in the UK for bringing us all up to 2.6ui. Said material, 
including source codes and an associated signature, can be found on 
ftp.netcom.com look in /pub/dcosenza for the following: 

                pgp26ui.zip        --> DOS release
                pgp26uisrc.zip     --> source codes
                pgp26uisrc.sig     --> sigfile for pgp26uisrc.zip
                tom.asc            --> Tom's public key, you'll need this to
                                                  check the sig

This patch level is not endorsed or supported in any way shape or form by 
MIT, so usage of this program might put you in violation.

A couple of notes: keys that are larger than 1264 bits will not be readable
by previous versions of the software, so users who are interested in larger
key lengths are encouraged to move up. Also, considering the enormous amount
of time it takes to generate a 4096 bit key on a 486 (10 1/2 hours), an upper
limit of 2048 or thereabouts is strongly recommended.

Enjoy everybody and

Ever forward,

David
