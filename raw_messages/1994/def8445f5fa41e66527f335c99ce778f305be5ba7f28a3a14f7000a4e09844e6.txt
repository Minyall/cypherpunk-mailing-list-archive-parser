If you're using PGP for non-commercial use, IDEA is free because it's
licensed for non-commercial PGP use.  I'm pretty confident that you need
to get a separate IDEA license with any new product you use it in,
commercial or not.

I have the e-mail contact address somewhere, and can post it if need be.
