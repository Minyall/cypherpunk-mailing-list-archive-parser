Hypothetical of hypothetical situations:

        - User has ISDN
        - User has PowerMac 8100-80

Needs a *secure* connection.  Does any one know how I can chain
it up?  Is there a T1A connection to an Apple Nubus 90?  Can I
get a little bit of interference for a little privacy?

Sorry to be the bother and thanks in advance.
