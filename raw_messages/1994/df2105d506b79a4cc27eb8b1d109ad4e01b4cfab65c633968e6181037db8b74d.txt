Windows Magazine Uncovers Word "Time Bomb"

    Ever wonder if someone could read your mind? Well, if you use any
Microsoft Word version 2.0 through 6.0 you may have unwittingly provided
someone with your thought processes. If you ever create documents which
are sent digitally, be aware that your client might be able to read your
earlier drafts.
    This is due to the fact that in Word's default mode, with options
Prompt for Summary Info off and Allow Fast Saves on, deleted text portions
are retained in the internal document structure. This enables anyone with
a file viewer to check your earlier passages -- such as a lower price you
were originally going to quote. (Incidentally, you can do the same thing
with the Macintosh version and a utility like CanOpener. -- Ed.) By turning
Prompt for Summary Info on and Allow Fast Saves off, you can prevent a
potential disaster. Since this is not a bug, Microsoft says there is no fix.
