Lots of patents are so absurd they would be funny, if they weren't so
dangerous.  Being sued for patent infringement isn't funny.

If you think there may be a problem with the system of software
patents, I hope you will read the League for Programming Freedom
position papers.  You can find them on ftp.uu.net in /doc/lpf.  The
principal position papers are look-and-feel.text and patents.text.

If you decide you agree with the LPF position, please join.  Joining
is easy and doesn't take much of your time.  You can find a membership
form in the file lpf.join.
