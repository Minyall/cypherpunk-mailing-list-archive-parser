Yup, its real hard to get EFF membership so check those credentials,
folks.

That document contained SO MUCH unexpected information we can see why
you cared that much.

I'd suggest using the phone. Call all the numbers in lexicographic
sorting order starting with 201-221-0001 and work upwards. Happy
dialing.

Remember, the lightbulb contains the seeds of its own revolution.

A classic -- I can see why he wanted it.

We would ask that from now on you file your reports by typing

cat report >/dev/null

We will receive all the important contents of your reports far faster
that way than via email.

Thank goodness you aren't thinking for someone else!
