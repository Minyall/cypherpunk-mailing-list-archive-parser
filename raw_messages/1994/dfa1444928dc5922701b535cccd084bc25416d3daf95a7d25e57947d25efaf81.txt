Convenient fires are a rather common in Australia.

Rupert Murdoch used to keep his records in old uninsured
wooden buildings.  These burnt down with the utmost regularity.


Was the DFAT building also old, wooden, and uninsured?

(Oh, I forgot, it is only taxpayer money, so I guess the
building was probably new, expensive and uninsured.)

As I recall it was ASIO, not ASIS, that bombed the Sheraton, not
raided it -- (one hopes that they intended to "discover" the bomb,
but failed to "discover" it in time) -- or am I mixing up 
two different incidents?
