   I spoke in an earlier post of the #freedom channel on the Internet
chat. A brief description of #freedom. They interactively send messages
to each other in code. The code is fast & they seem to be talking
fluently to each other. This would seem to be an interesting matter
to Cypherpunks.

   I have been asked for more info. on the #freedom channel. I don't
know anymore than I've already talked about except that they are not
a hidden or invite only channel. Of course, when you talk to them you
are ignored. Apparently, they ignore other people because their
machines "decrypt" our plaintext to "crypt-like" text.

   For anyone who would like to join the #freedom channel or acquire
their encrypt/decrypt "on the fly" software, I have the following sug-
gestions: 1. get on the Internet Chat system. 2. do a
" /channel #freedom  "  command. that will get you into their channel.
Immediately after getting on their channel, you will get a list of
the nicknames of the users already on the channel. 3. IMMEDIATELY
record on paper, the nicknames. - they may scroll off your screen
quickly. 4. do a " /whois nick  " on several of their nicks. This will
get you their Internet email addresses. 5. Mail some of them requests
for what you want.

   Since the channel name is "#freedom", I would suppose they are
political & may want to share info. with you. If you are interested
in their "on the fly" crypt/decrypt message software & you manage to
get it - THEN BRING IT BACK TO CYPHERPUNKS! The stuff would make a good
post on a Cypherpunk ftp site for freedom software. Note: it is possible
that they may not be sophisticated with cryptography & might not want
to give out their encrypt/decrypt algorithm. In which case, please try
to get them in touch with one of the more experienced Cypherpunks.
Cypherpunks should be able to demonstrate the uselessness of secret
algorithms & in such a case give them stronger algorithms.
