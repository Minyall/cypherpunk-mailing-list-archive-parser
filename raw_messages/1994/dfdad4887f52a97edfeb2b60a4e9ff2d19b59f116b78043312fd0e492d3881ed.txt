FYI, this is a direct carryover from the standard terms & conditions of
a Visa/MasterCard merchant account.  Basically, this is a legal
necessity to process inquiries from the cardholder's issuing bank, etc. 
You'll note that we don't say you have to provide the information to us,
merely that you have to keep it -- that way, if there's a court action
requiring us to provide the information, we can point out that you are
required to have the information.  If you haven't kept it, you won't
have nearly as much of a problem with us as with the government.  In any
event, the most we can do is say, "oh, you violated our terms and
conditions, you can't be an FV seller any more."

What we're doing here, in essence, is allowing ANYONE to function as a
Visa/MC merchant, with the addition of the 90 day hold and a few other
things.  In order to do that, our terms and conditions have to ensure
that you comply with the Visa/MC terms and conditions, that's all.  --
