Fellow Tentacles,
Does there exist lists of Tentacles and CypherPunks who
are U.S. citizens with U.S. email addresses?

Such a list would be useful to code creating cypherpunks
who wish to distribute code widely in the U.S., but who
do not wish to become involved in the Crypto Exportation
hassles.

If such a list does not exist, why not create one?

Yours in Conspriacy
