The correct and sensible thing for Microsoft to do is to put
hooks in their OS whereby a convenient interface can be provided
to any encryption system.

They may well do this, and (truthfully) tell the US they are 
providing infrastructure for key escrow and (truthfully) tell
cypherpunks they are providing infrastructure for crypto anarchy.
and (truthfully) tell shareholders that they are preparing
their operating system for a world of world wide networks.

This would be the archetypical Bill Gates maneuver.

So before screaming at them, let us see what they are doing.
