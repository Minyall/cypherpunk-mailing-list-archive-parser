Adam's points are correct, and I thought of them before I posted the
initial message.

My thinking was that about 90% of all computers sold are Intel PCs, and
to get my manufacturing costs down, I need volume and simplicity.
So by addressing the 90% solution first, I have a larger market without
the complexity of multiple platforms.

Once I've sold thousands of Hardware random number generators, then I can
afford the design effort for other platforms, if they still exist then :-)
