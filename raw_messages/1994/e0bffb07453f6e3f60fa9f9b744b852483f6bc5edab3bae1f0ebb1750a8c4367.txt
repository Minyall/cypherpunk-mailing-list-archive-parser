The original report on CNN said that LLNL claimed their system didn't use
sound for tracking. They wouldn't discuss further details, since the system
hasn't been patented yet.

Sci.military readers might remember that a debate about these types of
acoustic locating systems took place there a couple of months ago.
Apparently the UK has a vehicle-mounted system that they use to sniff
out snipers in Northern Ireland.
