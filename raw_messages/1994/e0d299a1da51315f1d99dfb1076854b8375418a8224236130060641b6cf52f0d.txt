Egad.  I suppose I shouldn't feel too annoyed that out of over fifty
copies of PGP (from the 2.3A days) I've distributed (at my own expense)
to radio amateurs in Australia (for authentication on packet radio),
with two lectures and an article in a national magazine, and
exhortations to call me about any problems, precisely two other people
are using it (but are not signing their messages); and these were
already crypto-aware to start with - sigh...

I'm not going to give up - at least my signature is generating enquiries.
