Technical discussion (aside from being fun :-) is useful in understanding
*what* the government is really up to, how much privacy/freedom is 
being stolen, what things they're telling the truth or lying about,
and how much work it takes to break the systems they're proposing to
implement or ban.  It's also useful for understanding how to build
systems that *do* protect privacy, and for showing how those systems
are generally better technically than the privacy-stealing systems
the government wants us to use.  But as Jim pointed out, getting the
details wrong can lose us a lot of credibility.
