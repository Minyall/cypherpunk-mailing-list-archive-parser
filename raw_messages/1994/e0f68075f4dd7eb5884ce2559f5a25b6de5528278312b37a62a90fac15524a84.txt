I have to mention, yet again, that this sort of phrasing is a product
of the notion that digital cash is somehow a currency. It is not. It
is an anonymous money transfer method. Saying "digicash is not legal
tender" is sort of meaningless -- the real question is "is the
currency being transfered legal tender".
