	I am new to the list and learning rapidly.  However I have a couple 
of questions:

1)  How is it that I sign a message with PGP and still have the message be in 
plaintext?  I know this is trivial to most, but new to me.

2)  I know that there were programs out there that would break the protection 
scheme for ZIP and ARJ files (older versions of both), is there new ones out 
and what are their keys based on?

	Sorry for the inconvenience, but I am trying to learn.
