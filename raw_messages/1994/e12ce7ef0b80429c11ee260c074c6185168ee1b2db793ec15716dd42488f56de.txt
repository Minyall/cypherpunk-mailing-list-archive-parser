I remind the list of Matthew J. Ghio's March 18th FWD of an announcement of a  
highly efficient electronic cash system created by Stefan Brands  
<brands@cwi.nl>. The documentation can be obtained from ftp.cwi.nl in  
pub/brands. I've downloaded it and printed it all out - it's about 100 pages -  
and very interesting.
