What do you mean?  The sources are included with XSPLIT.  The algorithm is
very very simple.

For all chars in input file:
I read a character from the infile called C.
I pick a number MOD the number of files.  I call this X
SUM=0
FOR FILES=0 TO N 
 IF FILES!=X
   Pick Random Number Q
   Write Randome Number Q to File #FILES
   SUM=SUM XOR Q
NEXT FILES
 WRITE C XOR Q to File #X

What exactly did you mean by n of m?  Since at each byte the numbers are picked 
randomly, the stream which holds the XOR'ed sum is random for each character.
So none of the parties holds any more information than any of the others and
it is all useless unless all of the files are joined together.
