Sunday's NYTMagazine had an amusing bit in its "Sunday" column, titled:

HTIJX KTW PNIX

"The scrambling and decoding of electronic communication is one of the 
hottest issues in cyberpolitics.  The Government would like to have
the key to all communications.  Export of cryptographic software is
restricted.  Both software companies and independent groups like the
Cypherpunks argue for the rights of individual privacy."

"All of which makes Microsoft's new Creative Writer software for
children intriguing.  It includes some primitive cryptographic tools
to enable kids to encode what they write ... to hide it from curious
siblings and F.B.I. agents."

What surprised me was the next line -- "Theoretically, this product
would come under export restrictions, even though the code would not
challenge a spy, let alone a bright 9-year-old."

After explaining what a Caesar substitution cipher is, the bit goes
on to note that "Presumably, Microsoft will not face any 
difficulties in exporting its product even though it comes from
the K.G.B. (Kids Games Business) at Microsoft.  On the other hand,
it does instruct the youth of America in the basics of electronic
privacy."

In case you're wondering, the encrypted phrase is "Codes for Kids."
