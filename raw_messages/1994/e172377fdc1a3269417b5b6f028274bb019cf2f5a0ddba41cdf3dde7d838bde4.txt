Mine says it's 2.7. ;-)

I don't like to read this list and see that many posts are about the political
problems with ITAR, patents and copyrights. Actually, I'm just a simple
software type, so I'm glad I read somewhere (here?) that the source to PGP 2.6
will be released, so that we can correct any problems introduced in it for
political reasons.

As to not being allowed to have or use 2.6 in Europe, what makes you think so?
I may be wrong, but I thought the only obstacle was that it may not be exported
to us due to ITAR. Once it's available here there's nothing wrong with having
or using it. I've seen PGP 2.5 flowing through European wires, so I think that
2.6 will come here too (if it hasn't come already).

Which makes this whole mess with ITAR, patents, copyrights and US and maybe
Canada only ftp sites even more difficult to understand for an outsider like
me. What's the point of all this, if cyberspace knows no borders? What are MIT
and RSA up to? Should this be discussed in alt.conspiracy? ;-)

I humbly admit that I'm clueless...
