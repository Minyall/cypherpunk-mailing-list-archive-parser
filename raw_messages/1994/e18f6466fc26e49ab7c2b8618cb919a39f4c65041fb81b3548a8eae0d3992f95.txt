  A fascinating point!  Perhaps Clipper's accomplishment will ultimately be
positive, serving to inculcate upon us all the habit and administrative forms
of routine use of cryptography, albeit in flawed implementation.  Thus when
the algorithm is unraveled, the transition to widespread use of a more nearly
adequate cryptographic standard may well be very rapid indeed.
