Any individual has the right to decide what information to give out.  If that
means the individual has to judge someone else's purposes, then so be it.  The
individual may even try to persuade others not to give out the information.

It only becomes a problem if he's trying to use force--to keep others who
_do_ want to reveal the information, from revealing it.  This is _the_
difference between the current situation, and real police state censorship;
censorship prevents someone from speaking who wants to speak; it doesn't
merely mean that the government itself won't speak to you.
