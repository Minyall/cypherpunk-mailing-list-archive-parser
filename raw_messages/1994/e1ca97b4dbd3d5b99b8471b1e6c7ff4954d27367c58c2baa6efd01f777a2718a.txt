Now that's an interesting idea for contacting people anonymously.
Have a big mailing list where you know certain people are subscribed.
Everyone gets all the mail, but they put a filter on it so that only
mail directed to their anonym is delivered to them.  Or, if they're
really paranoid, they filter them by eye.

But it's so obvious that someone probably already thought of it...
