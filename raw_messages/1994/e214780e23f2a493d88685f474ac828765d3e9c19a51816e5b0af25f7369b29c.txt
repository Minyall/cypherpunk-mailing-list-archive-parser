THAT'S WHAT HE GETS FOR COMPLAINING

    SAN FRANCISCO - Apple Computer Inc., after receiving a
complaint from famed scientist Carl Sagan, has changed the
internal code name for an upcoming model to "Butt-Head
Astronomer" from "Carl Sagan," the San Francisco Chronicle
reported.
    Sagan asked the company to stop using his name after an
article about the new computer appeared in MacWeek magazine, the
newspaper said.
    The Computer is one of three Apple models that will use the
PowerPC microprocessor, which was developed by an alliance of
Apple, Motorola Inc. and International Business Machines Corp.
    For those of tender sensibilities, Butt-Head Astronomer will
be known as BHA for short.
