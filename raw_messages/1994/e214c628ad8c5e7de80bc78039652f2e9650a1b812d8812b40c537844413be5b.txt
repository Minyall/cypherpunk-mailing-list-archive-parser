Goodbye Xenon!

Some parting thoughts:

(1) Stealth PGP -- while the idea is laudable, the "thousand year technology"
    won't last as long as the "thousand year reich" in the proposed
    implementation.  Steganographically hiding messages in "noisy" channels
    like JPEG files is easily thwarted by the powers that be.  They merely
    need identify those channels, intercept them, and retransmit the noisy
    data with their own random noise added, effectively jamming the channel.

(2) Anonymous Remailers -- This world is made up of many different
    types of people, including tight-assed control freaks.
    If they want to carve out a little nook of cyberspace and control it,
    why shouldn't theybe able to?  Why shouldn't they have their privacy there
    too, and be allowed to dictate who can and cannot come in?

    Its all very well to tell them they need locks; but unless and until it
    is easier for them to install those locks than to raise hell, they
    will solve the problem of inappropriate posting by raising hell.
