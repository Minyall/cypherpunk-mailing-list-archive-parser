Well, not exactly the Chron, per say, but...
this morning a new column debuted about computer networks, the internet,
the information highway, and other extrememly trendy topics.

The first column was all about Clipper, and why it was a bad idea.
I didn't bring it with me today, so I'm not remember lots of details.
The writer has an email address on the well (rbr@well.sf.ca.us??).
