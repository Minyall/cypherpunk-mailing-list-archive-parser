You have to submit your application (with appropriate fee) in triplicate
to the admissions committee.  If you pass a background check you will be
allowed to sit for the exam.  A passing score for the exam is 70%.  If you
do not pass you must wait at least six months before re-submiting your
application (with appropriate fee) in triplicate.  Those passing the test
will be sworn in as Official Anarchists (tm).  Official Anarchists are
issued an official certificate (suitable for framing) and an official
membership card.  Continued membership is contingent upon payment of
annual dues.  Breaches of appropriate anarchist conduct may also be
grounds for loss of membership.
