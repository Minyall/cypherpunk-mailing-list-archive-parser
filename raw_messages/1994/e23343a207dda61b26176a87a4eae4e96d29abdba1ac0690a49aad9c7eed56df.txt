We Islamic Fundamentalists are very worried about the exposure of
Allah's children to the den of vipers that Infidels call "the Net."
("The Pit" is a much better name, in more ways than one.)

NYET proposes to create two sorts of accounts on the net: Believers and
Infidels.

Believers would be denied access to all but the blessed groups
(currently, only alt.fan.salman.rushdie.kill.kill.kill). Infidels
would be denied access to all groups.
