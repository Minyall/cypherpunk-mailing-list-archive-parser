This is true.  To equal the strength of a 128 bit IDEA key, the RSA key would
have to be about 3,000 bits long.  This is because EVERY 128 bit number (except
maybe a small number of weak keys) is a good IDEA key, but only specially 
selected large numbers work well for RSA keys.  Of course, I'm not really
concerned that you will factor my 1024 bit RSA modulus by tomorrow morning :).
