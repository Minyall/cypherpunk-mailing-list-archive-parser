That started me down an interesting line of thought...

You can get spread spectrum radio/data modems that do 256Kbits/sec
(Cylink) and can go up to 30 Miles.  It is unlicensed in the US
because it is limited to .8watts (I think).  I believe 10 miles is the
limit with an omnidirectional antenna.  Spread spectrum should be
pretty hard to triangulate on.  Remember that the technology came from
unjammable military radios.

I think you'd have to have a fairly sophisticated scanner to even pick
it up.

Using a creative arrangement, this could provide a good cover for
physical location.  (If you could get the server in the back of a city
bus or something...)
