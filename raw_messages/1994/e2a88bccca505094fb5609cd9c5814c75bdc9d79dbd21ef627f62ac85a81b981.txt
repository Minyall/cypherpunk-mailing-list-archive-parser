C'punks,

David L Womack wrote about several ways he thought the USG could go after 
crypto anarchists and fellow travelers.  While I believe there is much to 
say in agreement with the tools he has identified, in some ways, he is 
still asking the wrong questions.  David wrote:

If you have no *seizeable* assets, the burden--in effect--moves back to 
the IRS

Again, without seizable assets, it is highly unlikely any of this neat 
stuff will be used against you.  Only fat or famous targets are worth the 
government's attention.  They aren't in it for their health.

If your total overseas accounts aggregate under $10,000, the correct 
answer to the IRS is "NO."  For amounts over $10k, well, they have to 
find them first, don't they?  *Insurance* and *annuity* policies aren't 
reportable at all.  Give you any ideas?

Same answer.  They aren't going to fool with you unless you have bucks or 
are a "name."

(a)  You plan to use your "true name"?  (b)  You plan to actually 
transfer the money?  How crude.  Why not just access the goods and 
services without bringing in the moola?  (Paradyme shift required.)

Yes, for those who can't keep their business secret, think of it as 
evolution in action.

While David has done some great *linear* thinking about the problems that 
will face us all in the brave new world of crypto anarchy, something more 
is needed.  All the problems that have been suggested have solutions.  
But they require that we not get canalized in our thinking.  The digital 
domain is NOT the real world rendered in electrons.  It has its own set 
of rules that are derived from its unique electronic/cryyptographic nature.
