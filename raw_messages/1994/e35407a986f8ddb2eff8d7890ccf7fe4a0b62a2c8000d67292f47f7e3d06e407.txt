Hello all Cypherpunks!

I want to set up an anonymous remailer in Norway.
I once had one, but after formating my hard disk - it's no longer 
there.

Why you ask? There are so many remailers as it is? Well, I think that 
it is important to have remailers in different countries. It's a 
little harder for the american FBI/NSA/CIA/whatever to shut down a 
foreign remailer.

But now there is so many to choose from...

What is the diffrence between Hal's, Sameer's, Nates' and hh's 
remailer??

I have seen that hh's? remailer at soda.berkeley.edu can post to 
newsgroups. Do I need a SMTP-NNTP gateway to use this remailer WITH 
the option to post to newsgroups?

Can all of these remailers use PGP-encryption?

I'm sorry if this is newbe questions for some of you, but there are 
surely others who also wants to know.

Thanks for helping me out!

Yours,
Halvor Kise jr.
