C'punks,

Hey, remember, we're all on the same side.

Whoe, lighten up fellows.  You both agree!  *Neither* liberals nor 
conservatives are automatically our friends.  People who are PRO CRYPTO 
are our friends regardless of what political camp they put themselves 
in.  Please, lets not bring extraneous political, posturing onto this 
list.  Liberals or conservatives who want to ban or regulate crypto are 
our enemies.  Liberals or conservatives who support strong crypto are our 
friends.  It's as simple as that.
