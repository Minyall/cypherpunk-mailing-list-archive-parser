	An alias-based anonymous server which does *not* have the
insecurity of Julf's remailer is running on omega.c2.org.
You can create an identity (terrorist@omega.c2.org for example) and mail
to your identity will go through a remailernet path back to you. The
server doesn't know who you are.

	Look at http://www.c2.org/services/blindserver.html and
http://www.c2.org/services/blindclient.html
