   The GNU copyleft is supposed to disallow a lot of for-profit uses.

I think the word you're looking for is "proprietary".  I earn a living
from my commercial, for-profit, GPL'ed collection of packet drivers.
No reason why anyone can't do the same with PGP, absent stupid
software patents and stupid export restrictions.  There's a LOT of
room for adding value to PGP.
