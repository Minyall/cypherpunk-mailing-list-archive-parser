Things "that the government doesn't like" and "serious felony crimes"
are not the same.  People in positions of governmental power have
all too often in the past used that power to harrass others who have
committed no crime.  Remember how Nixon used to sic the IRS on his
political enemies?  And the ATF has a sordid history of harrassing
harmless people, including trying to trick them into committing
technical violations of obscure gun-control regulations.  Often enough,
government officials harrass people who have broken no law, but have
only behaved in a way that those officials WANT to be made illegal.
