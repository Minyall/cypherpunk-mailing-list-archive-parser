Very nice.  Another interesting FOIA victim would be the NSA - while the
designs for the stuff are presumably classified, they may not have thought
to classify the rules for accessing the data, or the plans for
loading keys onto chips (which they had given Dorothy Denning to announce
but have since said the design will be different.)
The design of the "black box" for law-enforcement agency use,
except for the skipjack and maybe LCM-1 portions, may also be unclassified;
if not, then the number of them made, plans/schedule for making them,
cost, plans for distributing, etc. may be FOIA-able.
