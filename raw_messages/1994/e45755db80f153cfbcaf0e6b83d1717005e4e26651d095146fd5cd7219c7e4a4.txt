   I have always been skeptical of this observer-chip approach, because it
   wasn't clear that it was feasible to make a tamper-resistant chip
   economically, and because the specialized hardware that would be
   required would prevent the system from being used on widely-available
   PCs.

Think "PCMCIA" here.. not just laptops, but now desktop systems and
palmtop systems are starting to get PCMCIA slots these days.
