1. Where can I get the latest/greatest copy of SecureDrive?
(I'm a U.S. resident).

2. Can I install Linux underneath a SecureDrive partition --
say, DOS on C:, Linux under SecureDrive under D: and the
Linux swap also under SecureDrive. So that the C: DOS
partition is in the clear, and all the good stuff running
under Linux is hidden on D:.

Much thanks.
