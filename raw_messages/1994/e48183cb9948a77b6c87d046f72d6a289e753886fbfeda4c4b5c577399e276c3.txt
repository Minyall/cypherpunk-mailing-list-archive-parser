The following is a self contradictory statement, if considered to apply for
the time period of the next 20 years as the govenment's policy, and it down
right PISSES ME OFF. Fuck you, government.

>The Administration believes that the steps being announced today
>will help provide Americans with the telecommunications security
>they need without compromising the capability of law enforcement
>agencies and national intelligence agencies. Today, any American can
>purchase and use any type of encryption product. The
>Administration does not intend to change that policy. Nor do we have
>any intention of restrictiog domestic encryption or mandating the use
>of a particular technology.
