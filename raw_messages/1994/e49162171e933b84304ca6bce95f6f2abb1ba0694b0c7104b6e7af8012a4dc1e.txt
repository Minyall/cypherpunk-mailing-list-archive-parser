Summary: Unicorn thoughtfully underscores the need for the defense
afforded by strong cryptography and other means.

He writes:

Thank you.  It's good for a freedom-loving person to be reminded of the
nature of the threat.

The appeal of strong cryptography is that it may help to defend against
those who embrace this deceitful attitude.

It is for _exactly this reason_ that the freedom-loving person forbears
from willful participation.

...which is fine for a person who consents.  The problem comes when he
assumes that the authority extends to his neighbor who does not consent.

Again, this is no doubt wonderful for a person who grants his authority.
The trouble begins when he presumes that his neighbor, too, has granted
his authority.
