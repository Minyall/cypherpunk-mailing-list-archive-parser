Does not everyone get a complete header like the one below from 
Eric's post with incoming mail?  This is presented 
automagically by The Pipeline's system.

I had assumed that because every mail received here has such a 
header that everyone else could also see who sent my mail, 
signed or not.  That is why I have not signed my posts.

BTW, Pipeline does not allow anonymously-sent direct mail -- as 
a take it or leave it policy.  So we cannot manipulate headers 
to forge from this Windows-driven end.
