You might pass this information on to CNN in Atlanta.  It seemed to me
the woman's problem was completely unnecessary give current cypherpunk
techology _in_situ_.  Their number is:

			(404) 827-1500

10:00 to 18:00 weekend hours- 08:00 to 21:00 week day hours.  I didn't have
to wait long to get a live one on the line.  Rates are great on Saturday
as well if you haven't gotten around to dumping AT&T as your carrier.
