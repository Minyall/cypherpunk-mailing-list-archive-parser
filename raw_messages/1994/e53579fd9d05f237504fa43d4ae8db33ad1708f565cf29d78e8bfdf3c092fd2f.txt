They are pretty simple.  Don't sign someone's PGP key unless you have
firsthand knowledge that it is their key.  Implicit in this knowledge
is the knowledge that they are accurately named by the userid on the
key.  This requires either that you have a significant personal
relationship with the key owner (i.e., long-time friend, lover, etc.)
or that you have seen a significant form of photo-id (i.e., their
passport).  You must also obtain the key fingerprint via a relatively
tamperproof channel (i.e., phone call (if you recognize their voice)
or personal meeting).

Yes, we might one day live in a world where every human interaction
takes place between pseudonyous entities that represent one or more
real people.  In such a world, there is no place for PGP's Web of
Trust.  Reputations will have to suffice.

It's less formal than, say, a central Certification Authority, but it
has some formalities that, if broken regularly and on a wide scale,
would render the Web of Trust ineffective.  Determining the identity
of the real person who owns the key you are signing is one of those
formalities.
