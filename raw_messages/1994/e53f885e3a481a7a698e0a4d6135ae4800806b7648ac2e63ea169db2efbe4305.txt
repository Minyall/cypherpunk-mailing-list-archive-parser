If you anarchy boys get some dummies asking, "Hey, how do I PGP?", give 
them my e-mail address, or better, point them to alt.security.pgp where I 
and Gary Edstrom have been posting the "Here's How to MacPGP!" and "PGP 
FAQ" guides. My MacPGP Guide will be of interest even to seasoned MacPGP 
users. I will mail it to anyone, but first look on alt.security.pgp. Get 
these and upload them EVERYWHERE. Thank-you.
