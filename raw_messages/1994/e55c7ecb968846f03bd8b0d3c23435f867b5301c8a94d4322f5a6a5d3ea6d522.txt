I could have sworn I heard something on CNN a few days ago about how
his home PC was also tapped/monitored to collect incriminating
evidence. Listening in with vans full of RF gear wouldn't surprise me.
After all, this is precisely where our abstract discussions of TEMPEST
meet reality.

The moral: If you're planning to pass secrets to the Russians, learn
some tradecraft! (I was amazed at the ineptness of Ames, a senior CIA
guy, in leaving such a trail. And amazed at the ineptness of his
superior at the Agency for not checking up on him (they flutter
employees only every 5 years, and he apparently passed). Finally, at
the ineptness of his KGB handlers for not advising him to avoid things
like paying cash for a house, Jaguar, Mercedes, etc.

Don't _any_ of them read Ludlum?
