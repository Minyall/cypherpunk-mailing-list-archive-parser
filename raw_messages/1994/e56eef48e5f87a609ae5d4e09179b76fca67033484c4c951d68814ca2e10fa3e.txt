Hmm... why is "stuffing articles on a CD-ROM and selling them" not a type
of store-and-forward propagation?  Usenet is not just a bunch of machines
speaking CNews.

I agree that you have a copyright on the expression of ideas that make up
a Usenet post.  However I maintain that by posting them on Usenet you are
explicitly allowing them to be distributed (either freely or for a cost)
by all methods used to distribute Usenet.


I would seem obvious to me that taking a nice piece of Usenet prose 
and publishing it a collection of essays would be in violation of
a copyright.  On the other hand, publishing the same thing in a collection 
of this month's Usenet traffic would not.  People redistribute and sell
your Usenet postings all the time, why would it make a difference if they
do so via CD-ROM?
