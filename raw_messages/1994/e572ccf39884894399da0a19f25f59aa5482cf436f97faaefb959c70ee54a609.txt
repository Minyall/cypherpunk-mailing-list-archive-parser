Of course this means that if you split e-cash transfers into small amounts
to avoid any security problems that could otherwise affect the entire
transfer, you are in the clear. While the logic of this decision is
debatable, it should certainly be sufficient to win in court. Especially
if it is built into the software as a feature.
