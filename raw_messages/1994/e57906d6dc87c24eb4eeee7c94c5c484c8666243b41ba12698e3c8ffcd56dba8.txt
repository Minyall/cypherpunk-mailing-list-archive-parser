You were originally referring to PGP in particular, were you not?

Yes, I understand that your proposal is compatible with a variety of other 
schemes.  However, as you note below, this provides very limited security, 
unless the key is _non_standardized.

"Pseudo-Stego" can be relatively secure as long as a large number of 
different hiding schemes/standards are used by the public.  An effective 
means of ensuring this would be to use the reciever's public-key 
checksum-value as the standard offset for stego.  The large number of 
public-keys available make it rather infeasable for one's opponents to try 
them all.  This, I believe, provides pretty adequate security (assuming one 
strips any telltale headers off the hidden file beforehand).
