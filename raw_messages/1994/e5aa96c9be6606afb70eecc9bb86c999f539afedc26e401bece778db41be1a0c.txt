One idea that I thought about is to simply use frosted glass. The police/
/FBI/CIA/other using the IR cameras don't just want to recieve IR light;
they want it in a coherent pattern. Using frosted glass, the light is 
dispersed in (mostly) all directions. The spooks should then only be able
to percieve some fuzzy shapes. Oh, they'll be able to know if the lights
are on, but for all they know, you are just having a quiet game of bridge.
(I am not absolutely certain about the va .. veracity of this method, but I
gathered that if frosted glass disperses normal light, it should do the
same for IR. The range of refractive indices would be different, and that's
about it.) Any criticisms of this method would be appreciated. Peter Murphy.
