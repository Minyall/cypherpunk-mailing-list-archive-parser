I disagree with this, and I would site as a case and point the fact
that differential cryptanalytic attacks were not "discovered" until
1990 while a relatively small team of IBM cryptologists had it back
in 1974 when they made DES. NSA apparently had it before then.
This is why I would rather find a fast secure mulitple DES method
based on spliting and not have to use IDEA which us so new. Before I
was born, NSA knew all of these things which were not figured out
by the academic community until this decade. (of course they could
also know of some sort of back door, but I think that the fact that
NSA knew of differential cryptography and let an algorithm immune to
it pass while they lowered the key size says something about DES's
security against attacks the academic community hasn't figured out yet.

The bottom line is that NSA has demonstrated that they can outperform
academia without public reviews of their method (LEAFs aside for the
moment [government agencies are after all required to do several stupid
things each year])
