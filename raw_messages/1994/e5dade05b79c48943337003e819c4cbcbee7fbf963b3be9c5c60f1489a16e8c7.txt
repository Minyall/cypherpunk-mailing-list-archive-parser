Anything you can write will be file.  Letter or Op-Ed or slap the NSA kinda
article.  Just keep one thing in mind.  Assume they know nothing about crypto
or the NSA or clipper..  Add tons of Fear Uncertainty and Deception.  Make'em
want to rise up and bitch to Uncle Sam.. 


If you can include quotes from various "Info Liberated articles", please do!

Welcome aboard and loads of help.  Just send me whatever ideas you have in
email to my other account rarachel@photon.poly.edu and I'll see if I can
help you with ideas or provide some "liberated" articles. :-)

Really appreciate your willingness to help.
