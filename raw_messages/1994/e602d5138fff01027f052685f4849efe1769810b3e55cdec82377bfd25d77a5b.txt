The point, Tim, is that you keep conflating a bad MIME read that you
happen to use with the notion that MIME is bad. MIME doesn't force its
users to understand anything about formats, character sets or anything
else. Your mail reader is whats doing that. If you were, say, using
the Andrew Messaging System which now understands MIME, you could
remain blissfully ignorant the whole time of how the underpinnings
work.
