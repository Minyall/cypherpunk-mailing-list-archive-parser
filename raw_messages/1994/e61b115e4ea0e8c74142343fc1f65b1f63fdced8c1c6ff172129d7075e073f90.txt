Thanks Tim, I needed that!

And thanks also for your insightful, albeit less humorous, posts.

PS, just read of your intended departure. Please don't. The list really
needs your viewpoint. There are some vocal, abusive, elitists on the
list who (IMO) haven't a clue how many people are stuck with less than
bleeding edge software, no SLIP access, etc. Without some counterpoint 
they may totally lose contact with the rest of us.
