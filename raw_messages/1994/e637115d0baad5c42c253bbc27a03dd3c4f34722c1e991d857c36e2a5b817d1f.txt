Irritating, and also insecure (system admin intercepts the upload and
replaces it with source of his or her own).

As has been stated, it's a matter of defining a threat model.  IMO,
the most likely threat is from pass phrase grabbing (from a sniffer,
annex box or whatever), which destroys the security of almost all of
these schemes.  Modification attacks are possible, although I doubt
that the lengths I have described would be useful.

As a serious project, though, a personal version of tripwire would
not be a bad cypherpunk project, and possibly a nice testbed for working
out some anti-tampering techniques.

Is there a standard proof for this, though?  I suspect that there is, but
have not discovered it.
