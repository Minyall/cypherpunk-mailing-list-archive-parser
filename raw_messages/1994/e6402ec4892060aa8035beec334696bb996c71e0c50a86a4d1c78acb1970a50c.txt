Perhaps by being more charitable to non-hardcore crypto discussions (Perry),
the list could attract more members.  Large groups are much more difficult
to prosecute (persecute) than small ones (yes I know, it's not how big it
is, it's how you use it).  Personally, I find the social dynamics on this
list *HIGHLY* entertaining and quite informative.
