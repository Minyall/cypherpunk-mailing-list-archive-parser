That would make no difference. This tells us nothing about what
problems that are not in class P are like -- and our question is,
after all, if there are problems in NP that are not in P. The
determinism never even comes into play. Beyond that, the possibility
of such a mapping between P and GUT is so miniscule as to be
infinitesimal, and certainly has nothing to do with the question of
whether the universe is closed (which is what the original poster
suggested), especially since GUT doesn't predict the mass of the
matter in the universe and thus makes no prediction on openness or
closedness.
