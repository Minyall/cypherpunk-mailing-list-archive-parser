Let me add:

We, a concerned citizen group, are investigating *you(r orginisation)*  for 
suspicion of organized child abuse, and would like to keep the aligations we 
have so far private.  Why do you want our private messages put in public

Furthermore, you have nothing to hide, so why do you mind if we 
investigate you?
