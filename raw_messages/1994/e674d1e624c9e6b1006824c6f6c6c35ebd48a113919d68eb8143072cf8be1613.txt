Doesn't this mean everyone can detect that data is hidden by decompressing
and recompressing? If the recompressed file is smaller, you know data was
hidden and it can be extracted using gunzip -s.

In contrast, data hidden in the LSB of sound samples or pictures cannot
be detected. The reason seems to be that gzip compression is non-lossy,
while most stego-tricks work by introducing a sight amount of noise-like
`damage' to the data used as hiding place. You need to loose a bit 
information to make room for the secret data.

So it's a nice idea but it doesn't really work....
