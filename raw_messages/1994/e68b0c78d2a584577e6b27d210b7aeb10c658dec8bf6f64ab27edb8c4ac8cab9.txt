A couple of problems have arisen with my code marketing venture.
Which is all to the good, of course, as the point of the exercise is
to turn up these problems.

Firstly, it seems that the coins I receive will contain something akin to
a serial number, so that just recording the byte sequence upon issuance
of the coin, and comparing with the bank receipts, would be sufficient to
establish the origin of the coin.  Since a bank deposit is normally
communicated to a real email address, then the depositor can be identified.

This being the case, use of a pool for receiving bank statements seems to
be the safest way to go.

The other problem is conversion from one currency (Ghostmarks) into
another (Tacky Tokens).  Here is a business opportunity for someone:
exchange currencies for profit.  Once again, a pool seems to be the best
way to issue the exchanged money.
