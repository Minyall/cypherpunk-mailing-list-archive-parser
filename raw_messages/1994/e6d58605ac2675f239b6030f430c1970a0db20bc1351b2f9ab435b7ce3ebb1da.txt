I hate it when I do this, 4 hours of sleep and a 10 hour work day can do 
that to you.  Forgot to delete the "cc" line in the previous post.

I haven't seen anyone do the IRC spy thing, and I don't quite see 
how it's possible without OP status or a hacked server...
If the masses that have stated that it's possible would like to 
demonstrate, please send me mail as I would be very welcome to see this...
