One problem I see with DC nets is that the government *WILL* hold all 
people involved guilty of conspiricy, then make them prove they are 
inocent.  It would be sufficient, however, to have everyone provide this 
proof of inocence, based upon the sort of thing being discussed in 
sci.crypt under hiding ciphertext in ciphertext.

Roger.
