Who cares what you think you are talking about? You haven't shown much
common sense thus far.

If I have an algorithm that will take any arbitrary RSA key and
produce the private key by a mechanism such as the one you propose,
you are (almost certainly) proposing an algorithm that will factor
arbitrary numbers that are a product of two primes. I can't prove that
right now -- not even sure that I can prove it right now. However,
there are lots of people who's intuitions likely agree with mine. Most
people believe RSA is probably equivalent to factoring.

I'm afraid that given such a function, I can derive the original key
within log[base2](n) operations.
