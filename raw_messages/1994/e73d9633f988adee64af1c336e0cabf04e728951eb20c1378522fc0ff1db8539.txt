There are two curves you have to worry about, one is computation, the 
other is advances in mathmatics.  Even if some great advance was made in 
factoring, a larger key *might* remain safe.  This is the reason, not 
increased computational power.  That is, unless you have proven some 
verry interesting things about factoring numbers and algorithmic complexity.
