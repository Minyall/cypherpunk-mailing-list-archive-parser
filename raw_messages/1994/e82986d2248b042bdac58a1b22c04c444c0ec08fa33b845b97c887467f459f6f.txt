While you guys are thinking about where to take this stuff at the
application level, how about giving some thought to how you might do
it at the IP level?

Since IP is a much more fundamental Internet service than mail, any
anonymity functions we might add to it could have much wider
applicability.  For example, consider anonymous FTP sites that a)
insist on your IP address having an inverse DNS entry, whether it is
under your control or not, b) insist on a user's name and c) log every
file retrieval? An anonymous IP service could effectively put a stop
to this practice.
