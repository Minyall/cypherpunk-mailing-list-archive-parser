Does someone know the location of archives (or preferably microfilm)
containing undeciphered German Enigma traffic? It isn't important
whether it was cracked by the Allies during the war... am simply
seeking some original German traffic to test computer program....
	I have already gone through messages in the journal
	Cryptologia......
	Pls E-mail me if you know of some sources...
	Thanks....
	Larry Harnisch
