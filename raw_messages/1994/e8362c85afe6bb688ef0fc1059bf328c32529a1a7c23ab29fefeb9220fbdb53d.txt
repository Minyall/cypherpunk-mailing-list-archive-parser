  From now on please direct all such messages (as ~I am not seeing
anything, the list must be down...~) directly to the list operators
<cypherpunks-request@toad.com> or <postmaster@toad.com> insted of the
everyone on the list.
  The whole of the 1000++ folks who read/archive the list do not need
to see such 'noise'.
