Uh... Yes, I think experimenting with new ways to run a virtual meeting
is A Good Thing. But... We have a meeting to run. So how about
sticking to familiar tools for the actual meeting, so that we can concentrate
on the *issues* at hand, and schedule the experimental stuff separately.

If we need "rows" and whatever, why not just form a dozen separate IRC channels,
one on each sub-issue, and you can join as many or as few as you like at one
time. Let's not complicate things too much - we have a war to fight!
