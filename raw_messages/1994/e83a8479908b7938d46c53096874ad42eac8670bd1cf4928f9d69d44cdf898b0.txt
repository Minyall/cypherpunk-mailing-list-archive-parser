Abstract: Quantum techniques have been used to develop a system that 
allows two parties to exchange information in absolute secrecy. Quantum
cryptographic devices use individual photons of light and Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle. Eavesdropping causes a disturbance that alerts
the legitimate parties.
