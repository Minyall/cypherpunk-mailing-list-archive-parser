MacPGP 2.6 is now available from the MIT ftp site (net-dist.mit.edu).
It is stored in the hidden distribution directory. Two files are
available. MacPGP2.6.sea.hqx contains a binhex'd self extracting archive
(which contains a Readme file, a detached signature and another archive).
This is the binary distribution.

MacPGP2.6.src.sea.hqx is a similar (signed)archive within an archive.
This file contains the source used to build MacPGP 2.6.

Note: All archives are self extracting. As such they are Macintosh
Applications which contain both a data "fork" and a resource "fork".
To verify the detached signatures on the internal archives you need
to first use the MacBinarize (command-B) option of MacPGP to create
a macbinary style copy of the internal archive prior to verifying the
detached signature. The exact steps to do this are documented in the
Readme file in the MacPGP2.6.sea.hqx distribution.

Bugs should be sent to pgp-bugs@mit.edu.
