The Spotlight *used* to be a really revolting rag; some people I was
talking to recently who were selling it said they've tried to get rid
of the anti-Semitism and racist hate stuff that the Carto folks were pushing
and concentrate more on Truth (or whatever the conspiracy-wacko version of
Truth is at any given time :-).  I didn't buy their magazine to find out
if it's really improved or if they're just saying it, but it was nice to 
hear them say it.

The other magazine called "Spotlight" I've run into is the New Jersey
Symphony Orchestra's program handout, truly a hotbed of radical
something-or-other-ism :-)
