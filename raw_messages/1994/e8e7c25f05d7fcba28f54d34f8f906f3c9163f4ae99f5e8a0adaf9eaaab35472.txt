As I've said, if Sue isn't a tentacle, s/he is posting rather useless
drivel anyway. Frankly I'd say that the evidence is far from
conclusive as to Sue's identity, but it isn't so difficult to note
that random drivel about Ollie North isn't relevant, and that "newage"
(rhymes with sewage) isn't very relevant either.
