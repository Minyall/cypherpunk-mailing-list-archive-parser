When I joined the list, I received a note describing Detweiler, and asking
me not to react to said person.  This seems like good advice.

I have placed "Sue" in my mail filtering program.  I suggest that those who
feel that "Sue D. Nym" is Detweiler do the same, and ignore the person.

If it is Detweiler, he's having his desired effect.
