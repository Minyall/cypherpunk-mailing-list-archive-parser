    I suspect fewer than 1% of all messages have their sigs checked.

What do you mean?  If you mean that fewer than 1% of the signed
messages that are sent to cypherpunks, you're almost certainly
incorrect.  I read over 1% of the messages on this list and if a
message is signed, with either a header signature or a big-ugly-block
signature, it's checked before I get to read it.

If you count seperate deliveries as seperate messages then you're
almost certainly correct, although it seems like an uninteresting data
point.  If you're talking about clear-signed messages sent to the net
as a whole rather than just this list, I think it's an interesting
question, but I can't imagine what you're basing your suspicion on.
