I actually saw this article in alt.privacy, and sort of mentally filed
it.  Then, this morning, I received a note from anon.penet.fi informing
me of my anonymous ID.  I don't use penet, and never sent anything
through there anonymously.

I first thought it might have been a mail-bombing run, but then I
re-read this:

I think this might be a forked attack... trying to flood penet with
traffic, and also outing people who have used penet for anonymous
traffic previously.  This is a good argument against maintaining a
double-blind database (and in favor of systems like soda.berkeley.edu's
remailer with its 'response block' strategy).

Does anyone else smell Detweiler?
