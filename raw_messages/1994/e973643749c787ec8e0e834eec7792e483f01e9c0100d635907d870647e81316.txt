That wasn't the topic of the discussion in question, actually. It was
largely just a discussion on cryptography in general and its
implications, slanted towards anarchists, who were the audiance being
addressed. Most of the population is extremely hostile to anarchism,
so from a PR point of view that talk isn't what you want. Also, it
unfairly makes it look like "cypherpunk" means "anarchist". Now, it
happpens that I am an anarchist, but that isn't what most people
associated with the term "cypherpunk" believe in, and it isn't fair to
paint them that way -- hell, many people on this mailing list are
overtly hostile to anarchism.

I don't want people to think you have to hate the idea of government
in order to like cryptography.

The copyright is also meaningless because a non-person (human or
corporate) cannot copyright something. Certainly an email address
can't hold a copyright. In any case I consider it a little odd that I
would not under your copyright be permitted to sell someone a copy of
my own words.

Lastly, I don't know what was on that disk exactly, but I've started
getting calls from random kooks about it. I find that a bit
disturbing. Did you leave my phone number on it or something?
