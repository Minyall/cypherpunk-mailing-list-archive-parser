I want to tie this in to that other hot Cypherpunks topic: Pretty Good
Nukes.

Even though the topic is nearly depleted, and the sabots have jammed
the list machine pretty thoroughly, how much faster would a fast
modular exponentiation go if the inner loops were encased in a layer
of deleted unobtainium?
