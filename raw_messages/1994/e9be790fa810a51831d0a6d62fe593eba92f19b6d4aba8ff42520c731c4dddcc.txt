I thought that ANI only was supposed to work on 800 numbers, the 
theory being that since the callEE was paying the toll, he was 
entitled to know who was calling.  So now we have to worry about 
ANI on non-800 numbers, too?

I noticed you changed the last digit from a "4" to a "6" so that 
the number now ends in "666".  Is this some sort of commentary on 
the "number from hell"? <g>
