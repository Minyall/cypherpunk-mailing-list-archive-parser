My Zoom 14.4k modem just caught on fire.  Therefore, there will
be a sudden interruption of my participation in our friendly
Sunday afternoon flame war on children, the Net, and other
related issues.

I found an 11 year old Hayes Smartmodem in a heap of junk in my
closet.  I think it will do 1200.

This is the second time my Zoom modem has burned up unexpectedly
after being replaced under Warranty, in case anyone is thinking
of buying one.
