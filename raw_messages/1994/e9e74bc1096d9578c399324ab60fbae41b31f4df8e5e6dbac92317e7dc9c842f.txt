The Key Generation Bureau plans which Dorothy Denning originally broadcast
(the NSA has since said they've changed, but not said what to)
worked somewhere along the lines of:

- the two keymaster agencies each bring some keying material to the vault.
- the NSA guy puts them into his laptop, and runs a bunch of calculations like
	serialno += 1
	string = SkipjackE(K1, SkipjackD(K2, SkipjackE(K1, serialno)))
	E1 = scroungebits1(string)
	E2 = scroungebits2(string)
	Key = E1 XOR E2
	Burn Key into chip, store En on Keymastern's floppy
	repeat for entire batch
	nuke the laptop
	pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
