This is a problem. The capital gains / alternative minimum tax hit is gruesome.

I agree of the inheritance tax question, but there is still a problem. The only
stock markets that I know well enough to be comfortable investing in are in the
US. That will not magically change just because I get citizenship somewhere
else, and that still leaves me liable for US tracking and taxes.

That's not really it. I have no moral problems with tax evasion, just pragmatic
ones.

I respect your efforts in this area, and don't want to give the impression that
I do not take your advice seriously. However, it is too bleeding edge for someone
with a family, IMHO.
