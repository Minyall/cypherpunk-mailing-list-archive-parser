An issue of subtlety. I made no "commie" claims.

I made no mention of "unfair" or "unjust." As I recall, I used the
term "unwise" once or twice. Others have made similar points about
compulsion and behavior control. (And we should avoid any nit-picking
about how Eric cannot possibly use "compulsion" because it is his
list, blah blah.)

This is a straw man, as I have made no mention of "justice."
