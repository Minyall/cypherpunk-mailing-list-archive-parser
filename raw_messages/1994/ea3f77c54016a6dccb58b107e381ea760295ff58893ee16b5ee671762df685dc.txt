   Mailing that information to everybody in Oregon would be expensive.
   On the other hand, mailing it to everyone in the Oregon legislature,
   the governor, the DMV honchos, and maybe a few other high honchos
   could be interesting, and might not cost that much.....

You're not being sufficiently devious and nasty, Bill.  Mail them
*their children's* information.  Most legislators are old enough to
have grown children, and to be very protective of them.


Dear Senator Foo Bar,

     I have compiled the following information on your 17-year-old
daughter from open governmental sources, e.g. voting records, birth
records, DMV records, etc.  Perhaps the government shouldn't be
keeping these records?

Yours in Privacy, ...
