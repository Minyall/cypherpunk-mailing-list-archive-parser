But what is the reason of the involvement of "law enforcement" and the
"intelligence community" in this matter? I refer you all to the
upcoming conference agenda, the involvement of NIST/NSA, TIS, Denning,
and FBI Director Louis Freeh. Look at the papers being presented at
the conference.

Any questions?

If a system contains "protocols especially suited for eventual 
mandatory use", like SKE, does this of necessity mean that the 
developers intended that it should become part of a nationally-mandated 
open avenue to spying on anyone who uses it?
