Let me repeat:

REORDERING IS OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE FOR REMAILER SECURITY.

ADDING LATENCY IS NOT.

And I don't want to hear any excuses that you can say latency and mean
reordering, because that's self-delusion.  Not only is it false, but
misleading.  Reordering is necessary for security, and latency is a
by-product.  You don't get security by adding by-products.
