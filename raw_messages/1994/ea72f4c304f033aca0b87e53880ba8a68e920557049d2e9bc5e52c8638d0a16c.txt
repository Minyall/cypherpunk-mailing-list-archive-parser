Humans are worth more money, and genotyping will do the same thing, for
cheaper, and with little outcry. Implanted chips means at least a
doctors visit for every humasn in the country; genotyping only happens
like fingerprinting, when you get a drivers license or soemthing. 

I think the underlying concern is OK, but misplaced worrying about
kitty-cats. Cats can certainly be violated, but usually aren't aware of
it ahead of time, and there's not much they can do about it :-)

Consider also they generally *kill* cats they can't return. A chip
implant under these circumstances seems not a problem.
