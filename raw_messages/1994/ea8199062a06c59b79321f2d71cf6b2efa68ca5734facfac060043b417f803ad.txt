I asked various things about non-US citizens and ITAR violations earlier,
but haven't seen my post on the list. Anyway, those questions have been 
answered, more or less, by the discussions on the topic.

A related question: can a non-US citizen file a commodoties jurisdiction
or FOIA request? Directly, through a US attorney, etc?
