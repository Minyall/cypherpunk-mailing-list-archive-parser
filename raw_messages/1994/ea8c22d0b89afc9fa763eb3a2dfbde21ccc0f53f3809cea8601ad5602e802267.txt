	 Although running an encrypted IP stack does require sysadmin
	 cooperation, it does not require a kernel rebuild -- John Ioannidis
	 has built modloadable versions of most of the swIPe software.

Assuming, of course, that you're running a system that has modload.
(Ironically, CERT has recommended that you delete loadable device drivers
from systems that don't need them, as a way to guard against password-
sniffers.)

	 Agreed -- sadly its arriving VERY slowly. 4.4BSD Lite comes with a
	 standards-compliant encrypted telnet implementation, however.

What standards?  There are no RFCs, nor any current drafts, that define
a telnet encryption option.  The last draft I saw was from 1991, and
Internet drafts expire after 6 months.  As I recall, the idea that was
being pushed then was to integrate encryption more closely with
authentication.
