C'punks,

Tim asked about "phone remailers" in one of his recent posts.  Until that 
happens, remember that the anonymous phone cards offered by AT&T and 
Western Union (and others) are almost as good.  This is especially true 
if you "chain" call through two or more different phone cards.  
(Expensive, though.)
