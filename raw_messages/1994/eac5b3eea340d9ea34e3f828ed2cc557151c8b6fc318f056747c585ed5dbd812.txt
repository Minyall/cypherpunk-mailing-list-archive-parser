Operating from the assumption that this work by Shor is realistically
worthwhile, has there been any research into employing similar
techniques for encryption?  In other words, in the "world" of quantum
algorithmics, are there analogs to the hard problems currently
exploited by cryptographic systems in our current Turing machine
"world"?
