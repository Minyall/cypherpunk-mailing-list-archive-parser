I seem to be unable to get Mac PGP to strip old IDs off my key.  I never
get the option to do so, just add new ones.  What's the trick?

"In a Time/CNN poll of 1,000 Americans conducted last week by Yankelovich
Partners, two-thirds said it was more important to protect the privacy of
phone calls than to preserve the ability of police to conduct wiretaps.
When informed about the Clipper Chip, 80% said they opposed it."
