I don't want to leave unquestioned this implied linkage between honesty
and paying taxes, between not paying taxes and ``cheating''.  Sure, for
some, like those Italians mentioned by Perry who willfully accept the
benefits of taxation when they have reasonable alternatives, such a
linkage would apply.  The legitimate tax resister, however, is simply
someone who declines the offer made to him: ``I don't want your
steenking benefits, and I'm not liable for your steenking debts.  I'm
certainly not responsible for any _compelled_ benefits.''

I see nothing honest about willfully paying taxes to, or otherwise
cooperating with, any institution which, by expropriating the fruits of
the toil of unconsenting victims through taxation, has stolen more
wealth than any other criminal organization ever seen on the face of the
earth.
