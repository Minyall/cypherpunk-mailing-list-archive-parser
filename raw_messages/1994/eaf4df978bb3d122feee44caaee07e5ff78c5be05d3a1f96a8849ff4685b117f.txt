Herbert S. Zim, author of over 100 children's books, including "Codes
and Secret Writing", died at age 85 on December 5th in Plantation Key,
Florida, where he has lived for many years.  He had Alzheimer's
disease.

I mention his passing because he wrote the first book I ever read on
cryptography, which I read in 4th grade in 1964.  If it weren't for
Zim, I might not have created PGP.
