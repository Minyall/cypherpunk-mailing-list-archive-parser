If the Bekenstein Bound states that no infinitely fast state changes occur
then it is proved wrong by the electron orbital shift when it absorbs a
photon.

On my post yesterday about EM fields, QED, etc.; sorry for the confusion,
I read it this morning and groaned. Perhaps it was the glue which permeated
the building yesterday (repairing stairwell outside my office) which caused
my brain to become stupid. I aplogize and agree that I got it bass-ackwards...

The point I was trying to make was that EM fields themselves are NOT QM, their
interaction w/ Hadrons ARE. Leptons themselves (which a photon and a electron
are) are not constrained by the same rules that limit Hadrons because Hadrons
are made from Quarks. Last time I checked Leptons don't care a flip about 
color, charm, etc. The uncertainties which arise in QM arise from the 
interactions of Hadrons. If a system does not involve a Hadron then it is 
pretty deterministic, sorta like a billiard ball. However, there has been 
some research recently (there was an article in SciAm, had a pool table on the
cover) where they were discussing chaos and the pooltable which brings into
doubt even the premise that macro-scale interactions are perfectly 
deterministic.
