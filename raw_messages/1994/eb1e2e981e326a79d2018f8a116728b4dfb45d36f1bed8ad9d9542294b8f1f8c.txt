A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories.                                                               

       Title     : IPv6 Authentication Header                              
       Author(s) : R. Atkinson
       Filename  : draft-atkinson-ipng-auth-00.txt
       Pages     : 10
       Date      : 11/16/1994

The Internet community is working on a transition from version 4 of the 
Internet Protocol (IPv4) to version 6 of the Internet Protocol (IPv6).  
This memo describes the IPv6 Authentication Header.  This optional header 
provides strong integrity and authentication for IPv6 datagrams.  
Non-repudiation might be provided by an authentication algorithm used with 
the Authentication Header, but it is not provided with all authentication 
algorithms that might be used.      
                                       
Confidentiality, and protection from traffic analysis are not provided by 
the Authentication Header.  Users desiring confidentiality should consider 
using the IPv6 Encapsulating Security Protocol (ESP) either in lieu of or 
in conjunction with the Authentication Header.  [NB: All references to 
"IPv6 Encapsulating Security Protocol" will be replaced with references to 
the "IPv6 Security Protocol (IPSP)" if/when such a document appears as an 
online Internet Draft]. This document assumes the reader has previously 
read and understood the related "IPv6 Security Overview" document which 
defines the overall security architecture for IPv6 and provides important 
background information for this specification.

Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type: 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-atkinson-ipng-auth-00.txt".
							
NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.
							
For questions, please mail to Internet-Drafts@cnri.reston.va.us.
							

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader 
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version
of the Internet-Draft.
