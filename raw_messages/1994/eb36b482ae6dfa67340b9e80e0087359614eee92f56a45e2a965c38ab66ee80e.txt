Nevertheless, I think there would be some value to a GrayNet.  There's a
difference between intelligence gathering and analysis on the one hand,
and espionage on the other.  Several businesses in the "competitive
intelligence" arena operate quite openly.
 
And of course, the major players like to work through proxies.

One of the problems here is that business intelligence becomes industrial
espionage partially by way of who is in possession of the information.

In so far as the use of information is determined in part by the motives
of the "spy," those operating a "graynet" would have in their best
interests at least some concept of who they are dealing with, anonymous
transactions may give rise to liability.

In other words, a greynet dealing in industrial intelligence can
effectively become a BlackNet.  In this context it makes little sense
to call such an entity a "graynet"

In so far as the information is benign enough to keep a graynet from
becoming a blacknet, there is no use to anonyminity.

A graynet might as well be an open e-mail account.
