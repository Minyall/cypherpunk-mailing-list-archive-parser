To everyone that requested/was thinking of requesting the big brother 
inside postscript:

The version I sent out individually this morning was buggy; the 'd' in 
"inside" filled in. (Too bad corel's screen image and postscript output 
isn't the same, huh? maybe they fixed that in v4.0?)

I've re-exported it and the NEW version should be up for ftp sometime 
tonight at cpsr.org; Dave Banisar will announce its whereabouts. 


Sorry for the mixup.
