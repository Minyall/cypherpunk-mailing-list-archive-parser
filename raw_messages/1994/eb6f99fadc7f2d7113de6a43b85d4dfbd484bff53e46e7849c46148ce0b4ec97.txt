When I wrote my original message, I was doing it more as an academic
exercise than anything else.  However, I will be moving to Hongkong
sometime in July or August.  I'll look into the possibility of starting
such an anonymity service.  In the meantime, though, anyone living in an
appropriate jurisdiction should feel free to do something like this for
themselves.  Basically, it's just a mailbox operation.  If you get your
monthly charges paid up-front, your risk is very low.  Go for it.
