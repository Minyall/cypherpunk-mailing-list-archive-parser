There was an AP story yesterday about how several states are using 
prisoners to input data about traffic accidents and such into 
databases. I believe the state that they focused on was Arkansas. An 
attorney received a phone call that his SSN was being sold by prisoners 
that had gotten it from an accident report. The state allows people to 
use their SSN as their drivers license number. This prisoners also have 
access to everything else on the report, your license number, your home 
address and potentially your work and home phone number. Does anybody 
know what other states are using prisoners for this type of work? I'm 
about ready to cut up all my credit cards and start paying cash for 
everything that I buy.

Mike.
