funny thing about that. i told a non-cp friend about this when he
first discovered hotwired's policy. he used it for a while, and then
somehow mentioned it on another list (something to do with
publishing), in a discussion with one of wired's folk. she (wired
person) later made the comment that she looked it up, and halfway
through that day there were over 100 hits to that account already.

tells us three things:

-at least this wired staffer was somewhat amused with the prospect
(rather than annoyed, as i had expected). 
-they have a fairly simple way of checking up on usage, by account, by
day. which means they are probably using this data for something
already. 
-the account is well used.
