In article <e92vkKjqRe73075yn@skypoint.com> you stated:

: Does anyone have a valid mail -> usenet gateway for alt.security.keydist?
: I've tried a few and they don't seem to work.


You can use the {usura,remailer}@xs4all.nl for that,
instead of Anon-Post-To: , use the header Post-To: alt.security.keydist ,
(it will -not- be anonymised, if you use simple Post-To: ).

A detailed help-file is available by sending mail to this address with a
"Subject: remailer-help".

Hope this helps,
