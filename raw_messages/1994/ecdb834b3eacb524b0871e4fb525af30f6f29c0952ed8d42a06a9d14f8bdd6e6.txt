    I'm quite sure that every parent . . .

Starting a sentence this way is a formula for disaster :-)

    . . . has a long list of phone numbers s?he would prefer h(is|er)
    children would not call . . . .

There are numbers which I would prefer that my children not call.  I'm
not at all sure that there are any numbers which I would like to
prevent my children from calling.  Doing so would represent a serious
violation of our intra-family web of trust :-)
