The problem w/ the whole N - NP approach is that is assumes that the QM
model behaves as we would expect it to, it doesn't. I think this is one of
those assumptions that are better left un-made. I have worked w/ enough QM
projects throug UT and Discovery Hall (Dr. Turner and Dr. Prigogine) that
I am not comfortable assuming the QM world even cares about the N or NP
issues we are debating.
