C'punks,

That sneaky Jeff Barber has lured me out for one last word; cross
my heart and hope to be assassinated by a digitally anonymous
crypto-murderer.  He wrote:

    I'm sorry that you're signing off this thread,
    particularly since it was you that challenged others to
    "disprove" your scenarios.

That was not my main *challenge*.  My shoot-from-the-hip
scenarios were meant to be illustrative.  I wanted Cypherpunks to
use their powers for good, not evil.  My primary challenge was to
think up ways to defeat digital murders for hire.

Why?  Because:

(1)   Cypherpunks support strong crypto and other
      technological means for securing personal privacy.

(2)   We have enemies who are attempting to suppress such
      techniques by inflaming the general public with
      sensationalistic claims (e.g., PGP pedophiles, Net
      narcotraffickers, anonymous assassins).

(3)   To offset these tabloid bugaboos, it is in our best
      interest to solve these "problems" rather than to
      think up new and better ways to create crypto-chaos.

Now everybody can either waste their time thinking up really
neat-o keen-o ways to whack innocent spouses, business enemies
and rich uncles, or you can support strong crypto and privacy by
thinking up ways to mitigate the potentially negative
side-effects of crypto-anarchy.

Don't forget why we tune into the Cypherpunks Channel.  Let's
keep our eyes on the prize.  I now say adieu to this thread for
the second, and last, time.
