Its plenty radioactive. It just isn't fissionable. Not all isotopes
are fissionable.

Actually, depleted uranium tends to be used in place of lead in rounds
used for things like Phalanx (sp?) anti-missile gattling guns. Its
also used in some sorts of armor. I don't think anyone in their right
mind would make a shell CASING from it.

Because its a real issue. Lots of nuclear material is floating around,
and some of it is going to end up in the hands of terrorists at some
point. However, as I said in the second message in this thread, this
will not be a reasonable excuse to stop strong cryptography, as anyone
with the resouces to build a bomb can also buy or build a good
cryptosystem.
