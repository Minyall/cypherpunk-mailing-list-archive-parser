You just sent mail, cc'd to cypherpunks, so he knows where we are for
spamming purposes, to what appears to be king-hell spammer of the
universe...

The original posting seems to be from someone who was warning us about him,
and included it as a public service for reference purposes, though I'm not
sure what it has to do with the cypherpunks' charter...

Sending a reply to that vitriol back to the list probably won't do any harm
(you may get ribbed for not reading the headers in the message, maybe), but
sending it to *him* with a "cc:cypherpunks@toad.com" on the message might
have been a bad idea, yes?

Pissfights with Detweiller about the central purposes of this list were bad
enough, but a fundamentalist jihad we probably don't want.

Be careful with that "reply to all" function...

Cheers,
Bob
