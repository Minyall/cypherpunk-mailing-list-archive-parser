Depends entirely on what it's pointing at. The actual throughput for
a single transponder on a conventional Ku-band DOMSAT is more like 45
megabits/sec.

Because of fiber, satellites are fast falling out of favor for high
capacity point-to-point links. They're now used mainly for "thin
route" traffic, especially to remote or mobile locations, and for
broadcasting.
