At the risk of repeating what Tim's said in the past, shellscript
wrappers are useless to people who use Macs, Windows/WinNT, and so on.

At the risk of repeating what Tim, Perry, and several others have
said, using PGP- with or without shell scripts- on a machine which you
do not physically control is also risky.
