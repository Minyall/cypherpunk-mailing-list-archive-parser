National ID Card Hearing 8/3/94

Barbara Jordon, Chairwoman of the US Commission on Immigration Reform
will be testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee tomorrow
on the Commissions recomendations on verifying workers are eligible.

Drafts of Ms. Jordon's testimony reveal that the Commission has backed
off its initial proposal to require a national id card. Rather, the
Commission will recommend a pilot program for the 5 states "most harmed
by illegal immigration." It appears that this "pilot program" is only an
attempt to limit initial opposition to the proposal with a
future plan to implement it to other states as possible. In fact, when
the national id proposal was first floated, the plan was to implement
it step by step. Assuming that this will include Florida, California
and Texas, a sizable percentage of the US population will be affected
by the proposal.

The Hearing will be held in Hart Senate Office Building, Room 216 at
10:15 am
