As another thought, would there be interest in compiling a list
of cypherpunks who agreed to be included, their occupations,
and any notable experiences such as "Served for 3 years on the
Foreign Affairs Committee" or whatever.

With tools like a "press kit" and a directory of members we will
become viewed as a cross-section of America, citizens with a
point of view shared by many, contributors to the general welfare
of society rather than a bunch of fanatical computer geeks that
haven't given anything to society.

   (well, maybe...it's a tough battle.)
