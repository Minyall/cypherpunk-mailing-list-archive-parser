Is "the real world" a typo?  I suspect you mean something like "in cyberspace".
I'm not familiar with the line of reasoning you're referring to here.  I suspect
it's a large topic.  Does it rest on the assumption that cyberspace and the physical
world are largely disjoint?  I think they're not.  Activities in cyberspace often
"are about" or "have influence on" the real world.  Sometimes vice versa.
Doesn't this mean laws can't be divided into those about the physical world
vs. those about cyberspace, but must in fact be about both?
