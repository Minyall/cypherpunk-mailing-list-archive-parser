Some of us have a lot more respect for humanity than these words of
fear express. People like to talk to each other. That's all. Get out there
and talk to people instead of gobbling up the media's attempts to tell you
people are evil if you set them free to be themselves. The only ones who
are evil are those too greedy or at least to narrow minded to see that it's
time to bring the rest of the species up to our standard of living. It's you,
the "good guys", who are forcing the unfortunate to turn to crime. It is
this actively artificial scarcity that causes groups of people to band
together to either fight those who do not have enough, or to fight those
who do.

"Peace and Love,"
