Several weeks ago someone mentioned a bug in the fifo_destroy function.
At the time, I couldn't find it. The bug finally showed up. Fifo_destroy
was freeing some memory and then immediately reading it. This caused
problems on systems with fancy memory management, but not under DOS or
most Unixes. I just sent an update to csn.org. fifo.c is the only program
which has been changed.
