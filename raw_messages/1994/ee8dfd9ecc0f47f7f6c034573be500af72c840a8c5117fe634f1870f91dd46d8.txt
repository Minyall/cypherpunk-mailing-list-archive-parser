This is really the "Mother of all FAQs" - the largest I've seen so far are 
less than 500k! Actually, I've spotted a trend in recent FAQs - they're no
longer a list of Frequently Asked (or Answered ;-) Questions, but a sort of
encyclopaedic guide to the group/topic.

Well, if newbies _read_ this one, the SNR on this list should soar 
exponentially!
