Remember that note that Bruce Schneier sent some time ago about the 
software the NSA was willing to make available for a price?

The NSA is more than capable enough to ignore NSA fodder, I would think. 
If you want to write something that'll get looked at by a human, you'll
have to write the kind of thing that's likely to make you the target of an
investigation: "Tim, the supplier screwed up--the .5 Kg Pu shipment ain't
gonna happen. Though I guess you know that from reading the papers. I
think I can find some from Sergei's friend, but he's getting worried that
Mossad might be onto him. Found a sweed deal on 50 mg of *very* high grade 
U235. Too bad we can't use it with our detonator." 

Don't expect people to do that in numbers.

Besides, what terrorist savvy enough to use the 'net is going to be 
ignorant of PGP? Or not be paranoid enough to find out about it?
