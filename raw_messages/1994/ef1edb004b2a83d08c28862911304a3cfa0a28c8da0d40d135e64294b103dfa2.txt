They have yet to outlaw accomodation addresses, voice mail systems,
answering services, pay phones, the new phone parlors, the new phone cards
(buy one from Sprint inside a Hallmark Card at your local Hallmark store), etc.

It is very hard to outlaw something that everyone has or can easily do --
ie. switch voice, data, or physical mail.  It is currently easier to send
communications than it has ever been.  Mere legislation is unlikely to
reverse this trend.
