| specifically geared towards uncovering weapons of criminals (or

|  
| This is another absurdity in the "War on Drugs" and "War on Crime."
| More government-sponsored "wars" are undoubtedly on the horizon,

| I suppose things will get worse before they get better.

Personally, I find the idea of government-owned housing alarming and 
indicative of a growing trend within the government. "Big Brother knows 
best."

Vile and Nauseating.
