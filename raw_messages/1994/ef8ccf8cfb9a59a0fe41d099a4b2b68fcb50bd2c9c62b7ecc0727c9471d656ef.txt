My sympathies to you. Others, too, on this list have no respect for 
privacy, as they post private e-mail to the list with out permission, but 
make threats in private unposted e-mail. This especially applies to those 
who violate privacy and make threats under pseudonyms at places and 
servers that don't support finger or netfind. It is ironic, but sadly 
this is what the "notorious" Detweiler was teaching us.
