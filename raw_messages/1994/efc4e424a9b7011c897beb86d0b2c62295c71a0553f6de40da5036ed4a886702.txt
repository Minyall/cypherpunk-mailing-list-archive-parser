I had come across a reference to this in Tim's CYPHERNOMICON.

Was this whole project a giant scam?  Has this been objectively
demonstrated, or just suspected/believed?

Having read the new URL this group has placed onto the Web (don't have
it handy or I'd post it), it seems that the project is still alive and
well, and "trying to pay off old debts."

Could someone bring me up to speed on this group?  On the surface, it 
would seem that there is a lot in common with their objectives and the
general Cypherpunks "philosophy". (quotes because I understand the 
diversity of thought in this group.)
