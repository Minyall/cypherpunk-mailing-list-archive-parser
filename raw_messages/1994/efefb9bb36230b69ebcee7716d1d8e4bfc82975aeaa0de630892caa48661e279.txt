I don't know what 'slocal' is, but I've got a kill file; if these messages
contain some identifying pattern, I should be able to filter them out. 
Throw me a few of them and I'll tinker with my setup; also, give me some
warning about what they'll look like so I can pick them out of the 'normal'
mix of inspired brilliance and warped lunacy that passes for Cypherpunks
message traffic...... :)

[Zing! Off on a tangent.....]

Stop me if you've heard this...
This looks like a neat opportunity to play with digital money. Note that I
said _play_. Apologies to all, but my eyes glaze over when I read too
deeply into postings about authenticated foo bar prime number anonymously
deniable recursively repudiable ching fong quux blat zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz......
However, if you wanted to send me (n) digital coins, electric cents, donkey
farts, or whatever for every (k) noise messages I send/receive, I can see
where it would be fun to try to spend them. Everybody else could try to
steal them from me, I could try to spend them over and over and try to 
counterfeit them (perhaps asking for skilled help), and we could fiddle
around with Monopoly money to our hearts' content. I'd buy things, somebody
would produce goods for sale, we'd screw up the whole 'economy' repeatedly,
and you digital-cash types could write enormously complex and elegant papers
about the whole thing.
