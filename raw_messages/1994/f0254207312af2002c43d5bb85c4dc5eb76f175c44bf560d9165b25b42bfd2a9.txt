While I personally have no bitch with LD's posts (I just delete 99% of them)
it would seem that a service provider, like a restaurant, can say

  "We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone"

It's a free country - (or at least buyable) - the remailer operators should
have a right to deny service to anyone they care to.  If the person they
deny service to doesn't like it, they can use a different remailer.  Or
start their own remailer.
