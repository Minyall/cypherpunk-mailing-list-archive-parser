  I, too have gotten a similar message, and only after sending my first 
message to the cypherpunks mailing list.  I most certainly *DID NOT* send 
any message using the anonymous contact service and I DEFINITELY want 
that code name killed.  I'll send the code number to Julf in a separate 
message.  Jim, you are not alone!
