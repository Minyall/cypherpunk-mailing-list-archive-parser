From my reading of the materials that Doug posted to the list, it
appears that strn uses materials which are mostly intrinsic to the
message base in order to rate articles.  Those ratings which are
shared seem to be binary in nature, simply to include articles in
virtual lists of articles.

The 'strn' package described might be a good place to start for a user
agent, but it seems not to have the social goals that the ratings
proposal I have in mind does.
