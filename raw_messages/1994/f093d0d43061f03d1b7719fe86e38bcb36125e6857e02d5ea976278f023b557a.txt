This IS a flame.

It must be nice to be a sysadmin of a net where you have the time to run
around and make sure all your users have access to MIME-aware mail agents.
I only manage 50 users on three flavors of U*NX using 5 different terminal
emulators, and just can't seem to find the time.

Maybe I can talk the tax-payers of CA into paying me overtime to do this.
Gee I'm really sorry I couldn't add a graphic to this message.  I guess us
neanderthals just don't have it together.

BTW, with your superior sense of technology, I'm quite shocked at the lack
of signature on your missive.
