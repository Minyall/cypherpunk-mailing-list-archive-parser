Alan -

  - Not at all clear that Berne applies to electronic mail, even of a
    personal nature

Copyright exists from the moment the work is set down in concrete form. Are
you arguing that email is not concrete?

   - Not at all clear that postings to a publicly-read list like this
     are not equivalent to speech in a public place (ie not necessarily
     copyrighted)

Ah. The old "if the NFL has to remind us that its broadcast of the superbowl
is copyrighted, so do you" argument.

Okay, let's try this on for size.

Copyright 1994 Jason Zions. Permission to copy and transmit for the purpose
of propagation of the Cypherpunks mailing list in email or local-newsgroup
(usenet) forms is granted; all other rights are reserved.

   - Not at all clear what the status of private communications is vis
     a vis publication.

But this isn't private communication.

   You can't just wave your hand and say the magic word "Berne" and thereby
   prevent someone from archiving, reposting etc your messages to this list.

Law is a complex thing, isn't it. I'd better go back and reread the code and
current decisions. I'm spending more of my time tracking the CompuServe MIDI
copyright actions, though.
