You can only go two ways with this, either of which is self defeating.

1>  All potentially damaging information, by virtue of it's potential 
"wrongful use" shall be banned.

2>  All information clearly going to be used for the "wrong purposes" 
shall be restricted.


There is simply no other way to restrict information as you propose.

The result in 1>, I think is quite clear.

The result in 2>, requires some ONE, some GROUP to decide what is and is 
not A> "clearly going to be used for," B> "the wrong purposes."
Of course, now I want to know, what "objective" (read subjective to 
conventional wisdom) tests are going to be made to determine these 
criteria, who is going to make them, and who will enforce them?

You end up with either a cut throat thought police regime, or slightly 
less offensive paternalistic censorship.  You choose, what is it you want 
to have?

A> complete amorality in that everything is restricted, (which is what
restricting anything with potential harm essentially means), B> select
morality, imposed by criteria lacking any objective element, as such
criteria must always be subjective, or C> complete amorality in that
everything is allowed.

This completely evades the point.  Your question refuses to acknowledge 
potential differences in the application and structure of morality.

Evades the point, applies a silly analogy to Mr. Norton cracker, and then 
couples it with a crack about his potential age and mental facilities, a 
crack hardly as inappropiate as mine last night.

Unless your Christian and unmarried.
