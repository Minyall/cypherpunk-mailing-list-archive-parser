A question about offline digicash:

Is it possible to arrange digicash as follows:

If A, the original issuer, issues a unit of digicash to 
to B, and B gives it to C, and C gives it to D, and D,
gives it to E, and E cashes it with A,  --  and
everyone colludes except C and D, it is impossible
to prove that C got this unit from D.

If A, the original issuer, issus a unit of digicash to 
to B, and B gives it to C, and C gives it to D, and D,
gives it to E, and E cashes it with A,  --  and
C double spends it to D', who then gives it to E'
who then attempts to cash it with A, -- then A
will detect the double spending and rebuff the attempt,
E' will complain to D', and D', with information
supplied by E' and A, can then prove that C dishonorably 
double spent the money, without discovering that C gave 
the money to D, and hence without discovering that D 
gave the money to E.
