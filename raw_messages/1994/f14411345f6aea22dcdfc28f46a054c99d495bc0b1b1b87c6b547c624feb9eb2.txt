	If the system is well designed.  I sent the following to Phil Z.
back in July to address exactly this problem.  Hopefully, it will be
in pgp3.

	(Of course, I should have said 'untrusted network.'  If the
local CPU really is untrustworthy, you might be running a comprimised
version of PGP, etc.)
