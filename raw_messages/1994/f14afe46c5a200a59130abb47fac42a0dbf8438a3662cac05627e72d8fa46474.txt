  Cell providers should be scared of this.  I saw the OKI 900
  the first time on a news clip on either one of those "Educational
  type" shows or a CNN-(like?) news clip.  The typical nerd was there
  with billions of wires coming out of it saying how simple it was
  to hook it up and after it was wired to his computer he could
  simply decode another ID and rewrite his phone with that id and
  Joe Schmoe would get the bill.  Made it sound VERY simple to
  make the world think you were Joe.

  Heck, I'm scared to get an account since I could become a 
  Joe!  (1/2 :)  )
