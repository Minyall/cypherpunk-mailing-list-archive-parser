I've seen the Hadron. It's an impressive, fancy, TEMPESTed, MIL-SPEC
box. When I opened it up, I found an ordinary, production, amateur
packet radio TNC (terminal node controller) speaking AX.25.

Kind of scary when you think about it. :-)

What would normally cost a ham about $150-$200 probably cost the
government about $5K each.
