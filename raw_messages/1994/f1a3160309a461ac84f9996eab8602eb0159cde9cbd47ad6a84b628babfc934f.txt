You need to read more carefully.

Take it slow this time.

I prefer the civil system with a high degree of party autonomy OVER a
"highly institutionalized, standardized, process that could only be
provided by big government."

I am not, and have never been in favor of big government.  Where you get 
this idea from any of my posts is beyond explanation outside of your 
careless review or misunderstanding.

As for my position on anonymity, I have posted long and hard on the 
subject, and I don't think you will find anything in my posts that is not 
a pro-anonymous position.
