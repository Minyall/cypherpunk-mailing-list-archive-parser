But they'd still be in your logs, unless you immediately delete
or encrypt your logs.    If you keep logs to help debug your
system snoop-proofing those logs is a good idea.

Also CFSing mail spools just for regular e-mail is a good idea,
to help enforce the ECPA.   I hope this becomes standard policy
on the Internet.

(Of course, don't forget SecureDrive available for DOS).
