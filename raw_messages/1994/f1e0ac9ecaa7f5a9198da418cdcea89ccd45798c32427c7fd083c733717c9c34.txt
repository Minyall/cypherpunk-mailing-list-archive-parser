Hello,

  Does anyone know how to get MacPGP to sign with a different secret key then
it's orginal one? I have two different keys in secring.pgp, but MacPGP refuses
to accept the new one. I even made two seperate secret rings (one for each)
and when I try the ring with the newer key in it, it tells me that it can't
find my other key. This is fustrating for me. 2.3 lets me pick my key, and 
2.6 will only let me use one. Anybody have a solution??? 
 
                             Thanks in advance.


ps - I wish MIT had come out with a MacPGP2.5 release.
