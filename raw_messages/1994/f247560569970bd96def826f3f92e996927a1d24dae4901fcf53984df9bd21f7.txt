     That says as much for BW as it does for NetCash. I've read a few
issues of BW, and have found it to be about as useless as most of the
Ziff-Davis publications. Anyone care to suggest a magazine (or other form
of trade rag) that gives unbiased information (or at least as close as
possible)? Z-D lost my subscription to both PC Mag and PC Computing, for
different reasons. The one overriding factor in both, though, was the
Party Line approach to reporting.
