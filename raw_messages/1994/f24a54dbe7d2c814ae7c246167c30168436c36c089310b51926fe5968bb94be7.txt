Count me in.  I can take information from the U.S. and Canada and send to 
the Bahamas and Switzerland (and any other country for that matter).  
Additionally, I believe I have a fairly safe way to route messages.  The 
only problem is this: would the lag between mailing the email and the 
financial transaction going through diminish the return on the 
investment?  Perhaps that is something to consider.
