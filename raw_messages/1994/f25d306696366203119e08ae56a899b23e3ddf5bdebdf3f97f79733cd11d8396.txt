I believe that government employees are drawn from the general population
and the distributions of their attributes are roughly the same as those
of the general population.  'Sanctity of government' is not a phrase or

Fanaticism and other types of inflexibility and to be found among
government employees, among the general population, and in fact among
most groups of any size.
