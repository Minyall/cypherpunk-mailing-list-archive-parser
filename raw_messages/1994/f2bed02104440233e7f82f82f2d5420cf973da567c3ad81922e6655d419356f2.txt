I think we need to distinguish between encrypted *storage* and
encrypted *communications*.  Voluntary key escrow may make sense for
encrypted stored business files, but communications is a different
story. Since there should be nobody out there recording packets, there
is no need to back up or escrow the keys used to encrypt them.
