Yes, sure. Maybe someone out there is trying to do something like
that. I also suspect someone out there is experimenting to see if they
can blow up buildings with their psychic powers. The question is, do
you have any rational reason to fear that either group will succeed?
Are the odds that you will be killed because all the protons in your
brain undergo spontaneous decay higher?

Fine. However, you are, you realize, a fool. There is no point in
building a house with 3 foot thick steel doors and walls made from
paper. After 2^10 or 2^11 bits or so the key is no longer the weak
link, and is not what people will attack since it no longer has a
reasonable possibility of success. You are entitled to your opinions,
of course.
