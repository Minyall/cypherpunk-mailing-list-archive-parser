Tonight on a Very Special "Thoughtline" I'll have Tim May, discussing
coming social changes due to crypto-technology, including things such
as anonymity, e-cash and dreaded national ID cards.

6 PM on 89.7 in the Bay basin, or check your cable listings.

And no jokes about my air name, please.  Gotta have it; union rules.
