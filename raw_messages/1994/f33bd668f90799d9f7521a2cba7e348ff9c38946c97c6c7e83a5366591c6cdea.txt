I disagree that a cypherpunk should be expected agree to commit 
everyone towards arriving at a consensus over whether anyone who posts 
to the list should sign their messages, or that the list owner should 
be expected to submit to their conclusions simply because that is what 
they agreed among themselves he ought do.

It's a matter of (anarchist) principle.
