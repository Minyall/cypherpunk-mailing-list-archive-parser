I agree that an infomercial is silly, but I disagree that secure
phones don't have an extensive market. If they were cheap enough,
people would want the feature just for the hell of it. Ultimately, it
won't add more than a couple of bucks to the cost of a phone -- and
the "ultimately" in this case is less than a decade away. I'd say that
most people would pick up a cryptophone if it only costs a couple
bucks more and is transparent to use.
