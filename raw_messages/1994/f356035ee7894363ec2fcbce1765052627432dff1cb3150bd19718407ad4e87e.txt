Me too, but I suspect the asshole just sent a 'who cypherpunks' request
to majordomo@toad.com.  I've stated that I think LD has an anon account
at nyx.cs.du.edu, where the list is set up as a newsgroup.  Anyway, can
someone point out the procedure for asking Julf to delete my account in
the way that's least painful for him?  I suspect he's overwhelmed with
such requests...:-(
