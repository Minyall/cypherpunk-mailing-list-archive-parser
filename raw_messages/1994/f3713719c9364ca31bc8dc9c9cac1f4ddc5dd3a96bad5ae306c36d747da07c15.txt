I'm having a nightmare about a Microsoft-like domination of global
communications, complete with SPA police, etc.

Unlike the government, Microsoft and McCaw Cellular both depend upon a 
customer-driven market for their acceptance.  They must convince their 
customers that they are better than the competition in providing a 
similar service; they must adjust this service to the customer's 
requests & preferences or lose the account.
