Maybe because several people have been arrested in Germany and Russia
over the last week or two.  According to the UK press a group at a
Russian nuclear weapons facility were stealing tens of kilos of the
stuff, and one guy supposedly was willing to trade a kilo of plutonium
for 70 bottles of vodka.

Occasionally coverage in the press does reflect events in the real
world.
