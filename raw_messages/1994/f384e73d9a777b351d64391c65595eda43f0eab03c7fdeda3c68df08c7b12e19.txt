BTW: What's the FBI, Cops, etc. supposed to do when their "suspect" is
aware that they're being watched?  Do they knock down your door and
stop you from attempting to foil their investigation because they have
a warrant??  Or do they just go home with their tails between their legs?
<-

They get a real attitude and start to break the rules because
"Now we're gonna get this smart ass and show him good."
"Yeah boss.... right."
