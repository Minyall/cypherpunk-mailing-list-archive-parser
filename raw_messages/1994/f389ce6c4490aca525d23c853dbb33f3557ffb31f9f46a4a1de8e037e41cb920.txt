What would be cute would be to roll-your-own enigma using a series of
standard Unix filters.  It would seem moderately straightforward to
maintain rotor files which are fed into tr, while using cut's and
simple appends to move the rotors.

I'd like to see them go chasing anyone by removing that set of standard
Unix utilities.
