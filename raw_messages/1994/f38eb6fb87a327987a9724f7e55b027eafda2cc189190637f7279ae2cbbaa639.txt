Because it isn't cheap, first of all. If you wanted to run a
completely secure internet, for example (a problem I am currently
working on) the cost of all those RSAs really DOES show up, and fast.

Because using a 2000 bit key already is a sign of madness -- an 8000
bit one is beyond the pale (doesn't anyone understand exponential
blowup here?)

Because if you have a polynomial factoring algorithm doubling the key
size will no longer provide any real protection for very valuable
data.

Because once your RSA key is big enough the conventional key you use
becomes the weak link and any increase in the size ends up being
rubble bouncing.
