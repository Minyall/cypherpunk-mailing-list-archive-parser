Sorry, but this is no help.  It's impossible to distinguish Agents
Provocateur from merely incompetent people.  You need to deal with the
latter, and so the former fall out in the wash.

If the cypherpunk movement is to be an effective non-violent force, it
must realize that secrecy is no help.  The best designed action will
work even if your enemy helps you plan it and carry it out.  Karn's CJR
is an example of this.
