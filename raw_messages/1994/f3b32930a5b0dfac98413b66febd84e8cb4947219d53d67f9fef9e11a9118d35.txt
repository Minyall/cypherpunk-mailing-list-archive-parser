Given a connectionless network absolute delivery is impossible (well, not
completely, but just about...)

What makes you think that it doesn't?  You should check out Enabled Mail (I
think that is the name of it...); it is a set of MIME extensions that would
use a "safe" subset of Tcl to create triggers that can be set for message
receipt/delivery or for when the message is read.  I used to have a pointer
to the proposed system, but you should be able to find it by poking around
the comp.lang.tcl FAQ or asking over there.
