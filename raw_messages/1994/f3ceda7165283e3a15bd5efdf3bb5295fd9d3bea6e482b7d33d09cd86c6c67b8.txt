I like a lot of what Tim May says. I don't think he starts out to flame on
purpose.

I forgot something important about netiquette when I got into that flame
fight with Tim. If you ignore the first salvo, flame wars usually never
happen.

BTW, Gary, as a former Alaskan, the remark about rabbits and moose still
makes me laugh out loud... Don't know why...

Apologies ad<in>vance for the wasted bandwidth.

And now we return you to your regularly scheduled cryptography...
