	 As Tim mentions, lots of people have talked about doing this, but few
	 actually have.  Nevertheless, the device is still needed and no one
	 has done it.

	 I estimate you could sell 500 at $50 each within four months if there
	 were PGP support for it.  And I'll give you advertising space on the
	 archive site.

	 Real random numbers should be a standard part of every computer.

Absolutely.  Given a choice between a hardware encryptor -- even a
public key hardware encryptor -- and a true random number generator,
I'd unhesitatingly choose the latter.
