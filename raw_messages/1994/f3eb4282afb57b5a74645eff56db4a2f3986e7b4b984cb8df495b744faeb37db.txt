It may just be that it's early and I'm only on my first cup of coffee,
but are you suggesting an inverse correlation between the quality of a
submission and the presence of a signature, Tim?  While I'd agree that
many of the quality list members don't sign their articles, I don't
think I can make the leap that signed messages have no useful content.
Please tell me I misread you.

Or perhaps just a lowly 486 running DOS and UUCP.  But I heard that
Cypherpunks Write Code, so I wrote PGP support into my signature
controller.  I have signed all my email for 2 years, and all net traffic
for nearly a year.  Gearhead?  Perhaps I am.  But this ain't no Porsche.

Which only underscores the need for better tools for the existing
platforms.  Yes, I'd like everyone to sign their traffic.  But it's not
always possible when the tools to do that are either non-existant or
arcane (which means I'm in agreement with Tim on why he doesn't sign his
traffic).

Tim, just for fun, what tools would need to appear to make it possible
for you to sign your traffic?  Maybe a description will inspire some of
the Macheads out there to get hacking.  (the astute reader will note
that I'm not suggesting new tools to the erstwhile Mr. May, as has been
done so often in the past)
