                   Title:  Tracing Traitors
               by Amos Fiat, Tel Aviv University

                           Abstract:

We give cryptographic schemes that help identify the source of a leak.
Such schemes are relevant in the context of pay television, and easily
combine and complement the broadcast encryption schemes of Fiat and Naor.

Joint work with Benny chor and Moni Naor
