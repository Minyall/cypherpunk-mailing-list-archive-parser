Subject: "FREE MONEY" spam via remailer

Is this the first spam to go via an anonymous remailer?  I bet
penet is swamped right now, trying to process the tens of thousands
of flames.  Seems like Julf might want to implement a spam
detector inside the remailer, preventing the stuff from getting
posted from there in the first place.
