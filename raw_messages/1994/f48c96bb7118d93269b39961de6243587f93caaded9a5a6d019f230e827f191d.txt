The strips are part of a program by the Feds to gradually
introduce features into currency which cannot be replicated on
high resolution digital color copiers.  I know of no technology
that would allow the strips to be detected at a distance which
would also be inexpensive enough to use in every bill and pose no
health risks to the person carrying the money.

Sounds like an urban myth to me, but I am willing to listen if
someone wishes to provide an plausable alternative explanation.
