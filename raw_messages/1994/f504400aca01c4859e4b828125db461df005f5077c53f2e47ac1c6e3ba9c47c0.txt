	The plutonium trigger is set off using conventional explosives
to implode a hollow sphere of the material. While this technique is
superficially similar to the gun-type triggering used by U-235 fuelled
bombs, the geometry prevents the Pu-239 from fissioning prematurely.
	The tritium is used as a neutron source - it releases neutrons
when sufficiently motivated to do so.
