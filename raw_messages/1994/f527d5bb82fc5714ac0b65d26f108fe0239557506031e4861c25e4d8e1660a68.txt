|
| I can think of a couple reasons to want other people to be more secure.
|
| 1) The more people protect their privacy, the less profit there is in
| privacy invasion, so that there will be fewer people doing it and
| the techniques and infrastructure of spying might develop more
| slowly.

It seems that the more people protect their privacy the greater the 
profit will be in finding ways to invade that privacy. When all kinds 
of information is available in more or less public places there is 
little, if any, reason to pay people to get this information. On the 
other hand if your information is closely guarded then it costs a lot 
more to get that information.

|
| 2) The more people protect their privacy, the less privacy afficionados
| will stand out from the crowd.
|
| 3) The more people buy privacy, the more developed the market for
| privacy techniques and services, and the more private ways of doing
| things will be available and easy to use.
|


Definitely agree with you on these two points.
