Just in case it confuses people, when you are doing Matt's general
attack that interoperably works with non-rogue systems, you find via
exhaustive search a LEAF that corresponds to your selected
Session Key/IV pair. IV synchronization problems only show up if you
are using the less general "feed the LEAF back to the same processor"
trick.
