However, it can be done in advance, and you can conceivably reuse
forged LEAFs.

I've come up with what I believe to be a pretty good algorithm to
prevent this problem. I would like to patent it so that I can then
charge exhorbitant sums of manufacturers should the technique be
incorporated in a future EES design. Anyone know where I can find a
cheap patent attorney?
