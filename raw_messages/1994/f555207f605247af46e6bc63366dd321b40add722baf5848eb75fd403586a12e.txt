That is called the 'jacket' in all the years I have handled weapons that is
the only correct term for it. The casing is where the powder goes.

We were not talking about artillery pieces in relation to the comment by me on
this issue. I know little about artillery, I do know about tanks and aircraft
because they are a life long interest for me.

The pieces in most cases are simply slivers of metal that breaks off the
inside of the tank because of hyper-sonic shockwaves.  They are not molten
and do not in general cause a fire. Other than a lucky hit on a live
round with the ammo door open there is little chance of starting a fire.
