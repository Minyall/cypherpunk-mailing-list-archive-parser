I did a research paper on Computer Generated Random Number Sequences in
1991.  Included are the results of testing numerous popular generators.
The code used for testing the generators is also available if one
is so inclined to do some testing of a particular generator.  (The only
thing is a thorough test to determine the limits of the generator can
take many hours of CPU time).

Perhaps later this week I'll post the paper and see what the response
is.  I'm always a bit apprehensive to post.  Never sure what the
response will be.  Maybe someone will think it's interesting.
