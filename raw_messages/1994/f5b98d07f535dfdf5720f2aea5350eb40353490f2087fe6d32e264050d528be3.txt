Basically, there is *no* security whatsoever in cellular phones, at
least with the current analog FM technology. If you want privacy,
you'll have to provide it yourself on an end-to-end basis. Not only
does this require that the party on the other end to have a secure
phone, but it greatly reduces reliability since most dialup modems
don't perform very well over cellular radio paths.
