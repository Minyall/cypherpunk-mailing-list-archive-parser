   This is sick. According to this, I cannot teach foreigners about
   cryptography in the U.S. -- even about the open literature. This is a
   grotesque denial of my first amendment rights.

When this issue came up in a discussion on export control issues with
my employer's export control guru, he said that they basically never
bothered to enforce this in the case of open courses at colleges &
universities (because they knew it was unenforceable and
unconstitutional).
