Saw it on a bookshelf here, yesterday, for AUS$86.00.

Next to it was anoher book on Cryptography, for $97.95 by "Rhee", I didn't
have pen/paper to get the details down, but it was hardback and seemed to
be a good compliement to "Applied Cryptography" as it delt (almost purely
from a quick browse) with the theroies and mathematics of it, rather than
giving C source code for bits and pieces.

Are either of these worth their weight in gold ? (so to speak)
