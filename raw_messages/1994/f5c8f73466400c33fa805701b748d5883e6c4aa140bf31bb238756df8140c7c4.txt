Add my name to the list of supporters of HR 3627.

The truly appealing thing about cryptography is that it places enforcement 
of the Fourth Amendment completely in the hands of citizens, regardless of 
the wishes of a sometimes hostile government. We should be exporting the 
Fourth Amendment far and wide. I wish technology could accomplish that for 
all ten in the Bill of Rights.
