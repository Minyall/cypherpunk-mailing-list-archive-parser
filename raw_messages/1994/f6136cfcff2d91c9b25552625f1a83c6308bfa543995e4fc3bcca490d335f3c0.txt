[..] Law enforcement authorities also say they are looking for no  
more authority than they already have--. [..]


Perhaps LE is not asking for more *authority*, but they sure are  
asking for more *capability*.  If LE had the capability to do  
everything they're currently authorized to do (wiretaps, search and  
seizure, follow people, undercover officers, sting operations, obtain  
financial records, public security cameras, etc), on a nationwide  
scale, the US would truly be a police state.  It's not so much the  
amount of "authority" that is keeping the US from being a police  
state, it is LE's level of capability.  Don't give LE more  
capabilities.

One person's opinion,
