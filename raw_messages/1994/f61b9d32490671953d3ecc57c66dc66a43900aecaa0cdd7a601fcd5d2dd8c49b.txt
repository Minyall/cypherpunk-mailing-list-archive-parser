Well, a rating system like the one I think Eric is talking about would
disassociate "people" (the authors) from their post... so for example
in the future when everybody is using anonymous remailing services to
participate here and elsewhere, you would be able to read messages
from "people" (pseudonyms on digitally signed posts).  Of course, the
anonymous remailing services would prevent you from figuring out the
true author, so you can't filter for people in the manner you
describe.

Then you could pay attention to mail from Pr0duct Cipher and Deadbeat,
who have kept their identities secret, but filter out other
"anonymous" messages.
