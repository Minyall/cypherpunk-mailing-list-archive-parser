I got this out of newsletter I received a few days ago.
Hopefully it isn't old knowledge yet.


   Crypto Chip Debuts

National Semiconductor has released the iPower encryption
chip, which was designed for use in PCMCIA cards and provides
a reange of security features.  The chip can encrypt data via
multiple enryption algorithms, and will self-destruct upon any
tampering attempt, using a self-contained chemical.  Cards that
use the iPower chip can also provide additional functions
such as tracking user access times.  The iPower division is
based in Santa Clara, CA. 408/721-8797.
