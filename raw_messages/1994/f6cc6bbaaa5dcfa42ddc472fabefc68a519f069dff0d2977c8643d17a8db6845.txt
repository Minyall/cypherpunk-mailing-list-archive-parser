True; it is more expensive to do a brute force search over the IDEA
keyspace than it is to factor a 1024 bit number using the best known
factoring algorithm :)

I did some calculations once and I think the crossover point is
between 1500 and 1600 bits, at which point factoring becomes more
difficult than searching.
