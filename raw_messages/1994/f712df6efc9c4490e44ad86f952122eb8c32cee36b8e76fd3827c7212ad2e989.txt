Ah, now I understand, thanks. Actually, now that I see what you're getting
at, this _does_ seem like a good idea. I think moderated newsgroups can
be useful in some circumstances (sure, including a fundie newsgroup), and
it would be nice to have a cryptographically secure system of doing this,
that cant' be easily circumvented like the present one. 
 
And I agree that scripts using PGP do seem capable of doing this, rather then
writing some new software. This actually is quite a good idea.
