Hey guys-
	Can anyone tell me what the latest version of Ripem for the Mac is, as 
well as where I can find it.
	Also, does anyone know when MacPGP 2.5 or 2.6 will be available?
Reply to either question via private mail as I am no longer on the list :(

Neon-
	Mail me if you did/did not get my post to you.
