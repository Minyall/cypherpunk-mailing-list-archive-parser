This is embarassingly wrong, Robert.

Have you actually looked at one of the Rockwell chipsets in real use,
Robert? They have "all in one" solutions these days. Getting cheaper
than what they sell is almost impossible -- you cannot achieve savings
by "leaving things out" because there is nothing available to leave
out. With the cost of a codec to do something like QCELP and the chip
to do the encryption, you are going to be at least as expensive as a
normal modem anyway just for the parts to manage that component of the
work.

I'd be very suprised to see your price predictions come true. I'd be
less suprised to see a secure voice product becaue the mechanisms to
build such things are well understood and hardly revolutionary.
