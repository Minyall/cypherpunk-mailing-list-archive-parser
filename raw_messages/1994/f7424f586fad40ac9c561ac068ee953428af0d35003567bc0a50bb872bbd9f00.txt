I will point out something that I didn't quite understand myself but
have since discussed with Matt Blaze in some detail -- LEAF checksums
are tied to session keys. You CAN do this in advance but only if your
key exchange will permit you to generate your session keys in advance,
too. Obviously, reusing forged LEAFs requrire requires reusing sesison
keys.
