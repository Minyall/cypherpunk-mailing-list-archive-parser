Dear Mr. Knight,

I am not interested in "tearing apart" anything, I was just participating 
in a discussion. Ad hominem attacks are really unjustified. Even though 
you have a hard time understanding my arguments, I have refrained from 
calling you stupid, until now. You are not only stupid, but silly. "I'm 
glad your're not a politician" is a non-sequitur, and is certainly 
irrelevant to the discussion. Further, this whole discussion is entirely 
"academic", since there is absolutely no case law on this particular 
subject. So if you are so excited about it, collect your pennies and hire 
an attorney to enforce your copyright, I'm sure my brethern could use the 
business.
