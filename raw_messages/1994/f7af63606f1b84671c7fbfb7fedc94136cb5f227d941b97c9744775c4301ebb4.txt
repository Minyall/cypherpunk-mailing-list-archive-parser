Check out the story "CIA to pay $410 000 to maligned female officer" in
Thursday's SF Chronicle (http://sfgate.com/new/schron/dec-08-94/mn1199.html).
The interesting part isn't the stuff about sexual harassment.  The
interesting thing were paragraphs 8 and 9:

>For example, Brookner was accused by the CIA's inspector general of
>drunkenly pawing a male subordinate at a 1990 Christmas party at her home in
>Jamaica. 
>
>But the government lawyers defending the CIA then said that the man was not
>a subordinate, but a high-ranking Drug Enforcement Administration official
>who attended the party. 

Why would there be a high-ranking DEA official at a CIA Christmas party?

Hmmm.
