Matt's attack doesn't require knowing where the checksums and unit IDs
are in the LEAF. Nor does it provide any insight into cracking
Skipjack itself, which would be required to learn the family key. He
simply determined that the chip will accept 1 out of every 65,536
randomly chosen LEAFs, which is a large enough fraction to make a
brute force search for one quite practical -- especially since it only
need be done once.
