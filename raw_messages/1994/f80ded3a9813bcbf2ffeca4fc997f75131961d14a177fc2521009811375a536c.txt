Or then again maybe they were chopped up in little pieces and are buried
in a hefty-sinch sack somewhere in the Nevada desert.  Or maybe they were
forced to watch an endless stream of bad T.V. sitcoms like T.J. Hooker
until thier brains melted and ran down the sides of thier faces.  Or
maybe they just commited suicide becuase they just couldn't deal with
all of the guilt...
