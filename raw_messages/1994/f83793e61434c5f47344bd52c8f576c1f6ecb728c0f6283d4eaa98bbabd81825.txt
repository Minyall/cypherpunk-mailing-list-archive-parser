She's not asking you to have polite consideration because "we" women
think of "ourselves" as "victims"--She's asking you to show respect and
courtesy to everyone in the forum and the forum because we think of ourselves 
as part of humanity.

The "we" is in quotes because it seems to cause massive flamewars whatever
the context. i.e. We are against the Government, We have no respect Your
Opinion, We are Victims of Manhaters, We are Victims of Thought Police, etc.

Why is everything in our society in terms of "Us vs. Them"? This can't
even be called a society. It is a battlefield.

Here's hoping the positive vibrations of the Jupiter-trumpet will beam into 
OUR lives and wreak a positive transformation.
