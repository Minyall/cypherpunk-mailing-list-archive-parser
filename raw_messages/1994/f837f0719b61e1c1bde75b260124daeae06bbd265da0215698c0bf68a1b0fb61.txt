   These constraints imply there is some bank-like agency that creates and  
   signs "official" game cards.  

Cards are a conserved quantity, and digital money protocols apply to
any conserved quantity.  You would need one currency for each card type.

Another interesting thing about MTG is that since each player has a
separate deck, and not a single shared deck, all the problems of
dealing out of a shared deck are gone.  In fact, you can play the game
entirely with one-way functions, I'm pretty sure.
