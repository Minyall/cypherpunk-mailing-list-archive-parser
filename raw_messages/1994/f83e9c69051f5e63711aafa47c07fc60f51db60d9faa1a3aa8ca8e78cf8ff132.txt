	I don't think the net will ever be a huge monolithic entity.
I suspect it will continue to be very much like the phone system.
There are PBX's and large switches, some in and some out of the US.
Some are owned by governments, some by schools, some by large
companies.  There is no monolithic "phone system," but many.  Almost
no one thinks about them.

Politics.  From the greek "poly," meaning many, and ticks, a small,
annoying bloodsucker.

Have you signed the anti-Clipper petition?
