Our govenment has NEVER been very economical!

True, a good hose or pretty woman in the sack would loosen me up.
Except for my old key that hangs out on the pgp-key-servers.
Too bad, Lost that secret key...

Say, that sounds like a good deal !
Where could I buy that.
Wow, hang out at Charles Schwab, or Meryll Lynch
and get account info...

Well, I work for C3-Telos and we make several lines of ruggedized
portable tempest capable equipment (like the one I am typing on).

I don't need an 8000 bit key, but, I don't want the pgp-key-server
barfing on a 4096 bit key that I feel I need.
How can you put a price on someones life. You don't know
there situation. (think about OJ and fooling around with his wife)

So you or I won't try the crack. But then there are all those people who
are being paid from tax dollars to do nothing else but crack.
And all those high priced computers paid for with tax dollars
to do the cracking with.
Do you think they will just close up shop and sell off the equipment?

Yes, there are flaws. (some call them design compromises)
Why known text in the Idea data area?
Why CFB mode vs CBC mode?
Peter Gutman's SFS documentation makes reference to a class
of weak IDEA keys. What are they? And what do they do?

I don't advocate that you play the lotto.
I am pointing out a fact that the lotto people use/say/claim to get
people to play their game and thus give them money.

I agree almost 100%
