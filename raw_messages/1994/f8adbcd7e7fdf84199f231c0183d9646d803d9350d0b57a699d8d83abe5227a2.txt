I asked before setting it up, expecting and getting a positive
response.  My remailing header makes it clear that I remailed it,
which was a concern.  As long as traffic does not become outrageous
(i.e. more than my typical mailing-list traffic :-), there should
be no problems.  Administration here consists of a bunch of
undergrads; YMMV.
