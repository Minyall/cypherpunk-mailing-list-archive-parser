By the above headers, your ELM mailer is advertising itself as being MIME compliant.

Being MIME compliant is very easy.  If you find any part of mail you
don't understand, whether it is a picture, sound, or whatever, you
are just supposed to give the user the opportunity to write it to
a file with the uu-like-encoding that MIME may have done undone.

The most current version (draft-ietf-822ext-mime-imb-00.txt) has image
audio and video body parts defined including jpeg and gif under image
but, as I say, you don't have to really understand these formats to be
MIME compliant.  I think all this stuff is also in the current MIME
RFC also.
