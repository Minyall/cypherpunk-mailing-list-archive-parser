Your local budget espionage shop (Radio Shack) still has a selection of
scanners that pick up cellular and cordless telephones.  A friend picked one
up to listen to normal police/fire calls, but hasn't been able to lay a hand
on it since his wife is always listening to the 'soap opera' phone calls. 
Often times she'll tape them.  People are unknowingly giving away voice
mailboxes, credit cards, and account information all the time (DTMF).
