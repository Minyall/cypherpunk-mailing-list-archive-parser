Hi all,

I checked the Austin, TX phone book and found only 1 Tim(mothy) May.

Considering that Austin is in the 350,000 range one might extrapolate
the odds from there. In the Travis County area (where Austin is located)
there is estimated to be 1 million cbu's ...

Take it for what it is worth.
