I didn't say much on the 4th ammendment, but did mention it
in csn.org:/mpj/cryptusa.*

My main argument was that the ITAR violates the 1st ammendment.

By the way, the above mentioned ftp site has an "export controlled"
area for crypto software and information.  Don't let lack of a
distribution point stop you from writing crypto software.  Send
me some mail if you are interested in distributing a quality,
strong crypto program in the USA.
