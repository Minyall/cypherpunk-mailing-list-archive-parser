I would say this can be extended and made a general rule.  You should 
always take some reasonable ammount of time(say 5 min) to encrypt your 
most sensitive messages, even if you have a 12 crays and a connection 
machene.  The algorithim can be viewed as giving you an economic 
advantage, and worying over spending $.01 vs $.0001 is not just stingy, 
it is dangerous.
