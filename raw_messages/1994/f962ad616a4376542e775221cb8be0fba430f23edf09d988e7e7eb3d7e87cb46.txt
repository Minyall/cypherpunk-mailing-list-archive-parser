It does not matter who the true identity associated with a
public key is.  My proposal is only that signatures
be checked for consistent identity, not true name.

Requiring true names would be most uncypherpunk.

So it would be up to the nym to get his true public
key to the list, not up to the list to discover the
correct public key that signs a posting by a nym.
