Anyone know anything about this?  How secure is this? If you have to have
2 "identical" lasers to pull this off, sounds like this would not be very
secure, since there must be a pretty wide margin of error (I mean, how
"identical" can 2 lasers be?)

    Instead of using mathematical codes to scramble and unscramble
messages, Georgia Tech physicists are devising a way of sending a message
with electronic noise generated by a flickering laser. By connecting
identical lasers over fiber optics, the same random pattern of noise is
generated at both the sending and receiving end, and the receiving simply
subtracts the noise to uncover the message. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution

"In a Time/CNN poll of 1,000 Americans conducted last week by Yankelovich
Partners, two-thirds said it was more important to protect the privacy of
phone calls than to preserve the ability of police to conduct wiretaps.
When informed about the Clipper Chip, 80% said they opposed it."
