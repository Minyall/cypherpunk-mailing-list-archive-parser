The biggest problem I see with your scheme is that it won't remain secret
for very long, and the government will probably just ban all CD imports
as a result. And possession of a CD player or CDs (even "legit" ones)
would be enough to send you off to kamp.

There's a practical problem here. Audio CD players generally provide
no easy way to get the raw bits into a computer (SPDIF interface cards
exist for PCs, but they're rare and expensive). And I haven't yet
figured out how to get a CD-ROM drive to read the raw bits off an
audio CD; I suspect it requires munging the firmware in the drive,
which makes anything you do highly manufacturer specific.
