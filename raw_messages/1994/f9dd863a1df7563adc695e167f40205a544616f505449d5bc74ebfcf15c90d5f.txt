Maybe its the lack of people begging you to repost dozens of articles
on a list with several hundred members that should send you a signal.

Personally, I find the reposts irritating but not devistating.
However, I suspect that when you repost things, you are doing so with
the hope that it will be of use to people. If no one finds it of use,
you should consider whether or not you are actually doing anyone a
service.
