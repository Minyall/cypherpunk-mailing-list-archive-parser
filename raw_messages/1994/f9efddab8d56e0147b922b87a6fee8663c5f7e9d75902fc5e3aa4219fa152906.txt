The new models, the 350 and 550 do indeed have a currency recognition 
feature based on color. I was talking to a serviceman--interestingly, as 
with all crippling features, this one creates problems, as certain images 
become uncopiable if the color they use is upsetting the canon. The 
service man said that often the offending object may be copied simply by 
placing a sheet of acetate between the imaging area and the sheet to be 
copied.

I used to be skeptical of this feature--someone here conjected that it 
would be based on color. they were right. Smart.
