   Has California has recently begun fingerprinting welfare applicants  
   to help detect attempts at welfare cheating?

Yes...  Was on all local news channels for a day or two.  They were asking
applicants whether they thought it was an invasion of their privacy.  Some
said yes, others no, nothing surprising.  Can't remember the name of the
project or who's technology they're using...  Searching for matches takes
'only a few minutes', future plans include links to other agencies, *for ID
purposes only mind you* :) and faster matching...  Be great if someone with
more detailed info posted...
