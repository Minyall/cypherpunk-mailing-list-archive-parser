Well, you've got an opportunity for a Learning Experience, then :-)
Assuming you've got access to a Unix machine you can run things on,
it's not hard to set up procmail or majordomo or the old, simple, reliable
netlib stuff that ran the netlib@research.att.com (and maybe still does?).
Since you're posting from MIZZOU1, you're at least behind a mail server
run by somebody else, so I'm not sure how much control you have.....

If you want to roll your own crude mail-reply system on Unix, it's
really not hard, using some simple shell programming and the
sed batch editor equivalent to "ed" and the : commands of vi -
when you receive a mail message, you stick it in a file,
then use sed or whatever to find the "From:" line so you know
who to send it back to, and lines that look like your command set
(e.g. "get foo"), stickthe appropriate stuff into a mail message
and send it back.

If you want to do all this on DOS, well, good luck :-)  Look at teh
tools you've got available for handling mail, and get yourself a 
copy off Eudora or Waffle if you don't have either of them.
Then you're on your own.
