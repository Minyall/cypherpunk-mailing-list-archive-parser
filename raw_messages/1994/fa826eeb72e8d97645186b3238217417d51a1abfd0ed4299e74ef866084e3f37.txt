Can I remail using say the hh@soda.berkeley remailer TO an anonymous address
of anon.penet.fi? Say an1234@anon.penet.fi. Normally you CAN send mail to such
an address, but if you set up an X-Anon-Password then you must use it. So if
someone sent mail to password@anon.penet.fi via one of your remailers, then
no one else could mail to anon penet fi via that remailer!

Is the solution to use na1234@anon.penet.fi instead of an1234@anon.penet.fi?
Might you instead work out a deal with Julf to do this switch for your
remailers? Or build it into your remailers yourselves. This way someone could
send mail to an1234@anon.penet.fi, and your remailer would swap it with
na1234@anon.penet.fi.

Am I missing something?
