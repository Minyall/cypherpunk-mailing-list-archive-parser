According to a fax I received:

_____ begin fwd ___________

CLIPPER COMPROMISED?  "Security Insider Report," a monthly newsletter 
published in Seminole, Fla., has reported that government officials are 
seeking to determine whether former CIA employee and alleged traitor 
Aldrich Ames may have sold information to the Russians about the 
government's secret key-escrow technology used in Clipper Chip chipsets 
and Capstone Tessera cards.  The secret key-escrow technology, dubbed 
Skipjack, can be used to encrypt network voice and data.

This was faxed march 17, and consisted of part of a xeroxed page from a 
publication; unfortunately I cannot tell what the publication is.
Some other headlines on it are "ARDIS aims to simplify radio-based 
messaging", "Vendors curb wireless hype", "AnyLAN, anytime, anywhere", 
and "Cheyenne prepares fix for ARCserv users woes".  Next to the Cheyenne 
article is a round logo that says R.A.F. in large letters, and with the 
following cirling the logo: Network World's Reader A[missing] Force.
"[missing]" means text that is cut off.  Anyone know what publication 
this is, and which issue?  The page number is 2. My best guess is it's 
Network World.  Any corroborating stories?
