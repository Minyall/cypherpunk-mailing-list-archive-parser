These are the LETS systems, Local Exchange Transfer Systems.  They
seem to have been most successful in places of high unemployemnt as a
way of increasing liquidity for services (mostly).

So it seems that the money supply, that is, the amount of liquidity
available in the system, is not zero, but something else.  There
certainly are some interesting questions here, in particular the
effective exchange rate between the national and local units of value.
