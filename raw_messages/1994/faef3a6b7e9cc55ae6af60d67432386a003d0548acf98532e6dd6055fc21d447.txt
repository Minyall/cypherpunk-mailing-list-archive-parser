I've written for SOF and know one of the contributing editors very well.
The trouble is, I'm not sure the threat to strong crypto is close enough
the the SOF mission objective.

                                               SOF may seem to be a

I'm not sure I would agree with the characterization given of SOF.  Many
people still hold the mistaken belief that SOF is a magazine about mercs.
In actuality, SOF is an intelligence publication, very similar to "Aviation
Week and Space Technology."  They have ass-in-the-grass correspondents
wherever there is military confrontation or the threat thereof.

This is certainly true.

I'll talk to my SOF friend and see if we can come up with an angle.  As
of right now, I think we might be able to get one article.  If so, I
think the best approach would be to tie it to strong crypto like PGP as
a tool for mercs and wannabees.
