Thank you very much cort for the pointer.
TO ALL: I have installed yarn v0.65 I think, whatever is current, and
although it will decrypt and check sigs ok, it does almost exactly
*nothing* when asked to encrypt or sign outgoing stuff. (ok, so the disk
drive light goes on and it makes a little noise, but that's it.) Does
anyone know what I've done wrong??

Happy Hunting, -Chris.
