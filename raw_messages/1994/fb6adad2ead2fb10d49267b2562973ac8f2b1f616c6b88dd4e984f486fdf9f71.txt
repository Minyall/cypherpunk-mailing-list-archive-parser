  Yours truly has been stung. Someone used rjc@powermail.com to create
a penet address. Since I have never used that address to post
anywhere else except cypherpunks, the spoofer is probably on
cypherpunks. I thought it might have been caused by a penet'er
being subscribed to cypherpunks but a similar thing did not
happen to my other accounts.
