Count me out. Yes, I like to participate in physical Cypherpunks
meetings. Yes, I like to participate over e-mail. If I really have
to, I can waste time using IRC. But I do *not* have enough patience
to hang out in any cute virtual restroom line in some virtual bar
in some virtual game... We already have enough of the dreaded
freenet virtual cafe stuff around - it's like using virtual punched
cards.... Ack!
