No, but hopefully the standard can be extended (officially or unofficially)
to include them, even if only a relatively small fraction of organisations 
will use the privacy-protection extensions initially. Hopefully once some 
organisations are doing so they'll have a real competitive advantage over 
those who want to collect marketing data.

Don't worry - as soon as it hits the streets in Europe I'm sure a
number of us will be ripping out the RC4 code and implementing real
encryption systems instead.... (assuming it comes as source code, 
otherwise we'll have to upgrade the normal Mosaic source instead
once the standard is settled).

Overall, I think it's a good thing, and hey, at least it isn't using 
Clipper !
