put it int he file that pops up from the FTP server when you switch to 
that directory, am not sur what the file is called, but like when you 
switch to the pub/Linux directory on sunsite, it gives youa  rundown of 
what Linux is and all.  Then the person would hav to hack access to the 
FTp server to change that.  And I assume ti is easier for the maintaner 
of the FTp site to keep track of that one readme, then it is to keep 
track of the readmes in all the ppackages.
