Hi--

Two questions for you this morning:

1-Does anyone know what is going on re: the development of a version of
MacPGP for the PowerPC? Although the exisitng version does work, I am looking
for a native code version.

2-With the recent announcement by MIT, is there any development of a version
2.5 for Mac...680x0 or PPC?

Thanks

regards,

- --Mitch
