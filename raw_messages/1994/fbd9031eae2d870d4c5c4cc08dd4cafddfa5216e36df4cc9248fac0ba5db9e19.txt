Be careful with this line of reasoning.  If you market PGP to a crook for 
the explicit purpose of keeping his illegal activities hidden from the 
cops, you violate at least two different laws.  It's like selling lock 
picks to a known burglar.  You could be prosecuted for conspiracy, aiding 
and abetting, and whatever they call interference with a police 
investigation nowadays.
