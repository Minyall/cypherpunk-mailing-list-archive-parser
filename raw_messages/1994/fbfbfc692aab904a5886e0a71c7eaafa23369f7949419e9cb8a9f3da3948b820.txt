The use of cryptography makes it virtually impossible to know anything.
If everyone used to PGP to communicate. I mean everybody in the whole 
entire world. There would be no possible way to ever know what is going 
on. OKay. WE could do that, but guess what. You might as well get your 
self your own arsenal of weapons because if you can't trust the govt. 
you're going to be only trusting yourself. IF that's what ya want, do it. 
But I want to live in a world where I can at least step outside and 
breathe in the fresh air..
