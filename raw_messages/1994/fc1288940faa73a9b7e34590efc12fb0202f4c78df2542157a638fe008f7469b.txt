I find it fascinating how complimentary cryptography and AI are!

I wonder if anyone has actually gone to all the trouble of 
developing some kind of binary CFG?  It should be easier to design 
than an equally effective human-language Turing-complete CFG.

What kinds of "incomplete" attacks could possibly work against
Mimic functions implementing Turing-complete CFGs?

Can't you simply use a Turing-complete CFG, and meta-CFG?
Do such things exist on computer media?

Why not just ask an AI?  :)

Do you know if anyone has ported either of those over to anything
other than the Mac?



Good to have you join the discussion, BTW...
