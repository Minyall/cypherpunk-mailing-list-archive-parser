Correction today:

"A headline in Science Times on Tuesday about attempts to 
create thermonuclear fusion by aiming sound waves at 
microscopic bubbles misstated the process involved.  It is 
high-temperature fusion, not cold fusion."

Note:  The NYT advertises an email address for "comments on 
published articles about science and suggestions for coverage":
