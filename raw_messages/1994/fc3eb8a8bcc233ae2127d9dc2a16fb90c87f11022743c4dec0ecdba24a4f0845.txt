I have a contact with some potential influence inside the IRS, especially on
matters of purchasing and new technologies.  If someone would care to write
up a *short* precis covering both (a) why Skipjack-based PCMCIA cards are a
bad idea and (b) what other alternatives can be purchased in a comparable
time-frame and for comparable cost, I will send this info to my contact.

All the world's a stage and most of us are desperately unrehearsed.
