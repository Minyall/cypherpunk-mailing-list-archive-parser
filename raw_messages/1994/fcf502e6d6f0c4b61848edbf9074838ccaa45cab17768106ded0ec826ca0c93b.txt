You don't "charge". You buy a pre-paid card for a set amount of money or 
minutes. For example Safeway was selling "certificates" good for 30 
minutes of long distance for $5. Then you dialed the providers number, 
entered your certificate number, then dialed in the number you wanted to 
reach. Much like using MCI 14 years ago. Using a phone booth, would add 
security. I don't know what type of logs would be kept by the provider. 
Obviously if they kept a log with caller id info plus the number dialed 
then they wouldn't be very secure, espicially since the fact that you 
dialed the provider would be recorded. If a pen register was used on 
your line, all the info. dialed in would be recorded, including the final 
destination number. This would of course be true of a wiretap also. Pen 
registers are more common than full scale wiretaps. Use a pay phone, in 
concert with the pre-paid cards for maximum security. But of course, the 
security of the line on the other end is not guaranteed either. Thus, the 
need for non-clipper voice encrption asap.
