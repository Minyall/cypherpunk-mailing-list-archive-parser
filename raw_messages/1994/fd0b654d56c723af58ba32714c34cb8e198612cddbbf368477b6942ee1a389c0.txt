The IETF's IPSEC working group is specifying a security protocol for
use at the IP layer called IPSP that should provide the encrypted link
portion of what you want. A implementation of an earlier experimental
standard called swIPe is widely available. The idea behind these
things is to encrypt all your IP packets so the higher layers can
assume security to some extent...
