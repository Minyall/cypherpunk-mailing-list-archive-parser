	There's something similar to this in ftp.germany.eu.net:/pub/networks
	it's called inet, or something similar. basically you set it up 
to run on a site, and dependig on which port of said site you telnet to, 
it bounces packets to somewhere else. so, at ports 2000-2010 on toad.com, 
you have 11 different anon-irc servers, 2011 has somewthing else, and so 
on. I'm sure that someone could hack up the source code to inclde 
anything you damn well want.
