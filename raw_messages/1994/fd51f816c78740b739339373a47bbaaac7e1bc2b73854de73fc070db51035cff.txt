Hear, hear! An increasing fraction of my e-mail is non-ASCII, and has
this MIME (or whatever) stuff in it. (The Smalltalk list I'm on is
about 50% like this.)

I suppose some messages make use of it, as Eric Blossom's just did (in
allowing retrieval of more stuff, somehow), but a lot of the
"offending" messages just seem to be non-ASCII for the hell of it.

Like Lewis, I find myself to easily delete the message and move on.
(I'm debating just deleting the messsages, which are marked "M" for
Mime, before even starting to read them.)

Personally, I like simple ASCII. No fancy fonts, no embedded graphics,
no Quicktime movies I have to watch, etc.

Just my views.
