I thought extra useless junk traffic was one main objective of a
remailing network?   The more the better..  As far as the idea
that an eavesdropper could tell which remailers you are going to
use - they already know.  They can ping the same sites you do
and as long as you ping *every* site you know of, instead of
just the ones you'd like to use on any given message, this
doesn't give the spooks one iota of new information.

As long as the key isn't trusted just because it was in the
newsgroup - this sounds workable.  Or, each remailer could have
a mailing list of addresses it sends the "i'm here" message to. 
Again, this gets the spooks no new information - if you use a
remailer even once, you have to assume that if some one was
watching closely enough, they *know* you used the system, and
they *know* your chosen destination received a message from the
system.  They just can't figure out who sent what to who.

This seems backwards to me - I think what you want is local
software that is smart enough to figure out the state of the
remailer-net.  You needn't rip apart nor rebuild the whole net,
just write some code :)
