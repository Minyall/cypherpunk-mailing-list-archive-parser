A similar one they use at the white house uses a card system.  The card 
has an internal clock that is synchronized once to a clock on the system.
The card uses a special algorithm that changes the password every second 
or so in sync with the main system.  When you plug into the system, it reads 
your card, and if it is in sync, then you are allowed access.
