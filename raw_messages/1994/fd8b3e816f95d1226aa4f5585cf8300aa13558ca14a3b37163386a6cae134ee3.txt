Hi,

pgp allows to encrypt a message for multiple recipients
by listing all recipients at the command line arguments.

If there are no recipients at the command line, pgp asks
for the recipient. Is there any way to give multiple recipients
to this question? pgp doesn't separate on comma or space.
I need this for calling pgp in a script where it is difficult
to put the recipients into the command line.

Thanks
Hadmut
