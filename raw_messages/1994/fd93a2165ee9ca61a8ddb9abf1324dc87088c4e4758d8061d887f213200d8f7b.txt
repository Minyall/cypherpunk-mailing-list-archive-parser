Yeah, this is getting pretty far afield, but if you want to see what
IR floodlight/camera combinations look like, visit Disneyland. That
park probably has one of the most extensive video surveillance systems
of any place readily accessible to the public. (I expect Disney World
is much the same).

IR cameras are everywhere in the inside rides, especially in dark
areas where visible floodlights would ruin the dramatic
effect. Perhaps the easiest place to see them is in Pirates of the
Caribbean. Just turn around and look backwards, and you'll see video
cameras mounted overhead next to dim red lights.

Other rides where they can be easily seen include People Mover (never
crowded), Haunted Mansion and Space Mountain.
