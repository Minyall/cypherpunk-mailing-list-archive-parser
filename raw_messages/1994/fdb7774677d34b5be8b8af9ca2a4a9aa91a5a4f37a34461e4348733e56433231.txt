So what are the problems with PGP 2.5? If this is legal in the USA
(& CA), and interoperates with 2.3(a) and 2.4, what's the problem?
Doesn't that satisfy short-term needs adequately?

It seems to me that if PGP 2.5 is any good, PKP might have blundered
mightily by allowing MIT to release it to the world at large, and are
now trying to "rectify" the problem by burying it as best they can.

So, again, what are the problems with PGP 2.5, if any?
