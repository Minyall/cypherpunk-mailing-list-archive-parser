   But Clipper NEVER claimed to be good enough for the government's info!
   As far as I know the description was that it was to be used for "sensitive
   but not classified info" and as such it's not good enough for the REAL
   secrets.


  The scary thing is that unless someone were informed by a group such
  as the c'punk list they would buy his babble fairly easily.  Shoot, I
  combed it with such an awareness and it still ALMOST sounds convincing.
  It scares me when they can get on TV and tell the public "Clipper is
  good because..." and spout this or some similar argument and we on
  the other side of the issue can only tell our friends and a few computer
  types via news groups and mailing lists.  In general that American public
  is gullible and would buy this drivel.
