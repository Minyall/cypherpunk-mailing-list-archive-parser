What a load of amoral rubbish.

Cypherpunks is a group whose members believe in the application of
technology to PROTECT privacy, not to violate someone else's.
Once you assume that capability implies right, you're on very
shakey moral ground, but that is exactly what you are saying in this
post.  I find that position repellent, and I would be very surprised
and not a little disappointed if you find many others here who felt
the same way.

Possibly.  IMO, what the original requester was asking for was so
repulsive and immature that the responses so far have been mild.
