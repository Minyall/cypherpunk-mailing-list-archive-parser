Eric & James, how about taking the "You're flaming me !" "No, I'm just
insulting you !" portion of this debate to private email ?  I sincerely
doubt that very many people on the list give a damn about any of the above
jousting.

Actually, I find it mildly amusing, myself, in between the Netscape 
thing, and I'm also picking up on logic, game theory, and white spaces.

Except I don't know what "De mortuis mentis, nil nisi Latinum" means 
("the brain dead can't understand Latin"?)
