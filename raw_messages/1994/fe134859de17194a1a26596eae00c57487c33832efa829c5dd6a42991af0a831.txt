About the EFF Wiretap Bill:

-----------------
The bill makes it a crime to possess or use an altered telecommunications
instrument (such as a cellular telephone or scanning receiver) to obtain
unauthorized access to telecommunications services (Sec. 9).  This
provision is intended to prevent the illegal use of cellular and other
wireless communications services.  Violations under this section face
imprisonment for up to 15 years and a fine of up to $50,000.
-----------------

I commented on this before but feel like repeating myself: So an alt.2600
tec-addict makes some hardware hacks on his cellular - and gets 15 years
in the slammer for catching some airwaves. A punishment scale suggestive 
of a very repressive state! And why outlawing it in the first place? What
is crypto for?
