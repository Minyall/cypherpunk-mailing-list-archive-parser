Also useful would be a Clipper in-circuit emulator -- a pin-compatible
head connected by cable to the computer of your choice, where you could
do whatever you wanted to the data, in software of your choice.  I suspect
that such a device is relatively easy to construct.  It could even have a
real Clipper inside it (possibly the one you took out of your 'phone), for
use when you wanted to pretend to be doing what the powers that be wanted
you to do.
