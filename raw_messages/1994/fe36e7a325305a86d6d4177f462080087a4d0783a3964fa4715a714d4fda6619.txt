I don't see a huge problem here with keys being added, unless someone
starts sending the keyserver's databases to the remailers in an effort to
crash them. 

I can only think of one way around it -- recompiling with the key-adding 
procedure commented out (at least for the version the remailer uses). If 
you need to add keys, use the version you've already compiled.
