I have made submission of a short text which details my thoughts relating
to a mod function attack. 

I am under no illusion about the complexity of mounting a factor attack.
I do see the mod function as the next natural hole to look at the algorithm
through. I can find no work relating to periodicities in the mod function
and it occurs to me that such relationships might point the way...
