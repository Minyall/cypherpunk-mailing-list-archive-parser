You might want to get  a match coprocessor for the LC.  The ci has one,
and that's probably your problem.  (I'm not sure if the LC can take one,
though!)  If my memory still works after the two pints I just had, the LC
has a 68020 without any FPU.  You might want to upgrade to an LC III and
find out if it has an FPU.   I believe neural nets use floats, no?  If so
you will most certainly need and FPU if you want decent speed.
