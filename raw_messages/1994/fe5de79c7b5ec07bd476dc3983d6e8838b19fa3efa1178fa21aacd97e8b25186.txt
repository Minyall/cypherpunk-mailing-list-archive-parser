From the L.A. Times Sunday 6/19

Fugitive Relied On And Was Undone By Cellular Phone
...
Law enforcement officials subpoenaed the company ( AirTouch Cellular )
for assistance in tracking down O J Simpson.  Technicians began
monitoring calls made to and from the white Bronco.
...
Even if an eyewitness had not spotted the vehicle, such monitoring would
have made Simpson's capture inevitable.
...
Technicians in the tracking station can, if necessary, track a
particular call back to the cell site from which it originates.  But the
monitoring can not be done unless the phone is in use. [ Is that true? ]
