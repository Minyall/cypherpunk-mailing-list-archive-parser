Since it's perfectly legal to *import* crypto code to the US, that's simple -
ship it back to the US to check if it's correct.
You also do checksums for each page and maybe each line,
and have them run the checksums to make sure they've typed the
page correctly as well, but use the ship-back-here method for final diffs.

Meanwhile, since much of crypto is eventually about economics,
it's worth pointing out that you can probably hire typists in Russia
who speak English and C well enough to type it in accurately,
and pay them an amount of money that's small here and quite large there.
I don't know if Russia has crypto import/export laws?  There's certainly
Russian crypto software available in the West.
