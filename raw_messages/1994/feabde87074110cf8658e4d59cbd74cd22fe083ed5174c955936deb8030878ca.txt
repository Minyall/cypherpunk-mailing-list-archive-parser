swIPe, which is a proposed network layer security protocol for the
internet, may be read about in documents available from
ftp://research.att.com/dist/mab/

A swIPe implementation should be available to the public very soon.

Various work is being conducted to produce a security infrastructure
for IPng.

These aren't actually general secure IP implementations -- they are
usually more ad hoc than that.
