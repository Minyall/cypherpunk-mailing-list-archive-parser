There is a current freeware Windows interface that works ok, but it
is not truly integrated i.e. it fires off a DOS background session
and stuffs parameters incl. your passphrase.

A DLL or VxD would be the better solution.  (A VxD has no DOS memory
overhead.)

If you were interested, once you have the DLL or VxD you could use the
Microsoft Office developers kit (currently approx. $49 on CD) and integrate
PGP into Excel-type applications, Word-type applications, Powerpoint-type
applications, and *microsoft mail* type applications.  I say "type" because
unlike the current links (OLE etc.) the developers kit gives you objects
to incorporate in your programs, including but *not* limited to Visual
Basic or Visual C++.
