 CYPHER_REBELS" ELECTRONIC BOOK (CEB) 8 - I GUESS I'LL JUST HAVE TO DO
 IT MYSELF!

Fellow Cyphers - rebel/punks,

  I have decided to do the CEB myself. I am going to post it on
Cypherpunks about once a month & on other lists as well. The CEB will
exist as an often updated & posted file. I now need contributions
of text.

   I need the WNSTROM steganography program internet source location &
a concise write up of it. I also need the same for PG shell program. I
also need a concise write up of how to use remailers, how to chain
them, etc..

  The CEB will be an up to date source to show locations of best
privacy software, essential information, & electronic privacy concerns.
