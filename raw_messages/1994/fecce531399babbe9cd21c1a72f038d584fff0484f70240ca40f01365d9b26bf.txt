The fact that DT allows real-time monitoring of conversations is secondary;
the interesting effect is that it creates (to steal from .. Burroughs?)
"the policeman inside", who *does* watch us at every moment. Surveillance
can cause the subject to become his/her own watcher, an autonomous unit of
self-suppression. This is the real danger of Clipper and DT.
