We had one (which I was at) and there might have been a 
second. For some reason, there hasn't been any 
follow-up in the last six or more months to them.

There was a second meeting -  I set it up, sent out several 
notices, received around 11 replies, then only 4 people showed 
up (2 were co-workers from MS).  Maybe it's because it was a 
rare sunny day and everyone decided to go sailing, I don't 
know, but I decided there was not enough interest for me to 
continue making all the effort it took to get people to meet.
