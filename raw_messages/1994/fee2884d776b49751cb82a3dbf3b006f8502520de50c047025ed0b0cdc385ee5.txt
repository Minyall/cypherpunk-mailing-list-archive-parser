Ok, so what you are saying is you don't want your phone taped just 
because your coworker is under investigation.  This is a reasonable 
objcetive, but...

Wait a second, they would notify those that have been victimized?  Are 
you serious?  Do you have one case in the history of the united states 
where they have done this?  I think it is better to keep it out of their 
hands totally, and it would be beter to identify the person doing the 
taping, not the person being taped.

Ok, so you would, if you had to register your key, also demand that all 
communication devices be registered also?  I don't like this idea, I have 
a right to communicate and I don't need the governments permision to use 
the phone.  I think you are selling away everything with this proposal.

I fail to see how you identifying yourself every time you have to use a 
pay-phone could possibly lead to a protection of your rights.
