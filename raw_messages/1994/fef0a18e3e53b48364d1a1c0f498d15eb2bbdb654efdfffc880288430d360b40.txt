I have recently been participating in a thread concerning anonymity and 
pseudonymity on the Internet.  Somebody was complaining about trying to 
find somebody and they were logged in with an uncorrelatable alias. 
(Fishman = Don Johnson????)  The person was asking for a rule that 
everyone log in with an alias that DIRECTLY correlated them with their 
"real world" (relative term) pseudo.  Yuch!!!!! 

What I was wondering was if any of you law hacks out there new anything 
about the following comment regarding phone books

A professor of communications has brought up the fact that it is illegal 
to use a pseudo in the white pages of the phone book.  Is this the case?
Help!!!!
