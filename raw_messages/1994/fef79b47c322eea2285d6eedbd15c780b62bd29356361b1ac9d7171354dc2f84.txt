I don't proprose to "prevent" any company from exploring key escrow. I
just don't see why law enforcement, intelligence agencies, etc. have
anything to do with this, and I am very worried by the arguments I
hear about "legitimate needs of law enforcement" and "export laws."

So what about this statement you made earlier:

I have the same concerns, I just don't see how it would be possible to 
cause a company to "commit" itself to not doing this, i.e. preventing 
the company from including SKE in its products.
