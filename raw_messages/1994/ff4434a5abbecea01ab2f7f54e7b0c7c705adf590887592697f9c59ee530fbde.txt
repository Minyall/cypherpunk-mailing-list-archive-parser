If anyone is interested, I do have some logs from tonights Cypherpunks 
virtual meeting.

It's not a perfectly clear file, as it has lots of help requests in it (I 
don't know MOO too well, but the substance is still there. 

If you want it, just drop me a line and I'll get it right off to you.  It 
is about 90k big.
