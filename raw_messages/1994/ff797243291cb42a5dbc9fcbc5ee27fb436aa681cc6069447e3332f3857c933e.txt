gives one the  ability to classify, anatlize, and synthesize 
information for all languages.  The course consist of 30 
lessons.

taught. These  movements are casily memorized. Then 12 hours of 
instructional theory relative  to sound and stress will be 
given. The remainder of the course will be used to  fine tune 
the okills learned, also,computer cleboration of 
phonostenography  gives one the opporunity to leurn this new 
technology at one's convenience.

    During the two month course, the principle of the 
confluence of symbols  will be brought to perfection, along 
with a unified method of recording  appliable to all languages 
in the world including Japanese and Chinese.
