First off, thanks for passing this along.  Ms. Denning's comments have
some, shall we say, disturbing implications in re this "target system".

Somehow, it's not surprising that the current implementation must be
told explicitly to forget a key.  I wonder how many keys a decryptor can
remember at a time, as well.

But the "target system" references are even more sinister.  They seem to
describe an online system for retrieving and using escrowed keys.  Such
a system might be viewed as the data equivalent of the FBI's Digital
Telephony initiative.  And as we all know, where there is an online
connection, there may be a vulnerability.  Remembering that escrow
release will need only an affadavit claiming that a court order exists,
how susceptible to spoofing will the system be?  And if it's on the
Internet (which is, after all, the Highway 101 of the NII), will the
promiscuous packet sniffers be able to snag Clipper Keys on their way to
the spooks?

Can I turn my telescreen down now?
