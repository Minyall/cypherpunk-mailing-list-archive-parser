I'm using a version of ELM which claims to be MIME-compliant and usually is,
but all I saw in Peter Cassidy's message was a collection of random-looking
extended-ASCII characters. Usually when something arrives in a locally-
unsupported MIME format (like Amanda's GIF a while back), I just get an
"unrecognized format" error message. I didn't see any error messages at all
this time, just a meaningless jumble of characters (different, incidentally,
from the PGP-cipherptext-like characters Tim quoted).

We have enough dumb flamewars raging on this list right now; let's not
revive an old one.
