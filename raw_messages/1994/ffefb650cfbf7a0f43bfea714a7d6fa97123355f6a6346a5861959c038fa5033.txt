Folks, with the political climate the way it is in the US at the
moment, I think the EFF pioneer award has to make a political point
as well as a technical one:  I'll be nominating Phil Zimmerman.  I
hope others will too.  Without Phil's pgp program, all our efforts
against the Clipper chip would look very hollow indeed - he's given
us a flag to rally round in the name of freedom.
