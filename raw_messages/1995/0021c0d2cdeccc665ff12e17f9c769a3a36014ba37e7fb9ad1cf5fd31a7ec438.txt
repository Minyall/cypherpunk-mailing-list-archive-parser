The company I know definitely is on this is Digital Biometrics, Inc,
located in Minnetonka, Minnesota.  Their device is called a SQUID (and
no, I don't know what the acronym stands for).  About 8" long and
roughly 2.5" squarish, it has a lens in front where the subject's thumb
is placed, and scans the lens with a laser.  It's not quite in
production yet, although prototypes are under construction.  I happen to
work for the company doing the machining work.
