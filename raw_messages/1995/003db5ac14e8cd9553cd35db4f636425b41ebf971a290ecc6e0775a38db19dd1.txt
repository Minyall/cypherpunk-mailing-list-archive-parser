Point taken.  Dubois was referring specifically to the current California
grand jury investigation in association with U.S. Customs.  He said that
this grand jury has until June '96 to issue an indictment or...uhhh...get
off the pot.

I suppose Phil could be charged by some other entity with ITAR/DTR
violations relating to the "export" of PGP, and I'm not sure what would
be the date of this putative violation:  the date Phil gave the program
to others, allegedly "knowing" that doing so would result in its export;
or the date PGP actually appeared at overseas sites.  I suspect I'm not
the only one confused by this, considering the convoluted, baroque and
outdated laws involved.  Mebbe somebody oughta ask Sternlight...:-)
