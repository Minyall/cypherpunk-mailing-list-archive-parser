Perry, would you please knock off the drone of snide remarks about me? I
mostly don't respond to your posts. You often make very good points, but at
other times you demonstrate a shrillness and apparent lack of socialization
that I find appalling.

Your snide remarks are, to use your own rhetoric, "wasteful of bandwidth."
They are also tacky, childish, and pointless.

You are often quick to say "What has this got to do with Cypherpunks?," but
you yourself are perfectly willing to rant on about Nietzsche, the East
Germans, and Louis Freeh. Physician, heal thyself.
