Using the above protocol, payee anonymity will not be compromised by 
collusion between the bank and the payer, but the payee and the bank can 
collude to identify the payer!  (This reverses the situation in normal 
Chaumian ecash, and of course in certain circumstances may be preferable.)

This collusion can succeed even if Alice (the payer) reblinds the coin 
she gets from Bob before asking the bank to sign it, because Alice must 
withdraw the coin after Bob gives it to her and before returning it to Bob.  
Bob can ask the bank to record the names of everyone who withdrew money 
during that period, and after two or three repeated transactions can 
narrow the list of possible payers down to one person.  (This is reminescent 
of the time-correlation attack on remailers.)  In the original protocol 
this isn't possible because Alice can withdraw the money ahead of time.
