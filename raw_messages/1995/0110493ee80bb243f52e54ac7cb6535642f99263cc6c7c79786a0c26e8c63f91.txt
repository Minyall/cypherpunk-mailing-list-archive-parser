I'm going to be in D.C. for the CSI show next week (Nov 5-8), and would be
interested in getting together (dinner, beer, whatever) with other folks
interested in cypherpunkish things.  If a number of you respond, I'll try
to coordinate some sort of group event if at all possible.

Send me mail, give me a call, or stop by booth 111.
