My gut & scribble-on-the-back-of-a-napkin feeling about this class of 
attack is that it could be a problem for smartcards (almost certainly), 
and possibly for non-routed networks (possibly - napkin was too small  
:-), but is not going to viable on internetworks where routers are in 
use; if a packet enters a queue at any point in its path, then the 
transit time will be quantised by the time it drains the queue, which is 
basically controlled by the time it takes to drain previously queued 
packets; this will destroy any microsecond level correlations that may 
have been leaked. Ron is supposed to be doing a presentation at WWW IV 
later this week - hopefully he'll give his opinion on this.

Definitely a really neat hack, even if it isn't always practical.

p.s.

 Someone mentioned adding random timings instead of padding out to a 
constant time. This won't work (adding noise doesn't destroy a signal - 
just increases the effort needed to isolate it)
