I beg to differ. Remember the "Seven Dirty Words Case"? (I think WBAI/Pacifica
v. US, year?...). WBAI-FM in NY played George Carlin's "Seven words you can't
say on television" skit and was taken to court. The court ruled that there
were some obscene things which could be censored, but other things were
indecent so could at most be relegated to late night hours (and they've
struck down laws banning indecency 24 hours... I think some stations are
suing with the claim that such relegation constitutes censorship).

Don't remember their exact formulation, which isn't very exact anyway.

Perhaps it was deemed too indecent to be on an archive site. Hell, they
cooperated plenty with the government on this.

It's a sad day when you might expect AT&T to stand up for your rights more
than the EFF...
