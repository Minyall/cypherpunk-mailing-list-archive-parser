1) Usually more net connected hosts.
2) Lack of adequate sysadmin attention/knowlege.
3) Vague and poorly enforced site security policies.

This is of course a generalization, but corporations seem to
have more money and time to throw at security. On the other 
hand, it's common at Universities to get a new Sun/SGI/whatever,
hook it to the net, and run it without spending a lot of time
configuring it.

Just because a University has a CS department doesn't mean that it
is more secure. Even if security is an area of study, it doesn't
mean that other departments benefit from the research.

I don't know what University sites you're referring to, my experience
has been that on the average, .edu sites are less secure than .com
sites.
