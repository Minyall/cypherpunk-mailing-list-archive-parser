This is the worst possible situation, because it equates to a licence
to harass for the police.  If you obey the law, then you are at a
disadvantage compared to people who are not bound by it because they
are ignoring it, and who can because they are doing government-friendly
things; but if you break the law, then you can be prosecuted.
