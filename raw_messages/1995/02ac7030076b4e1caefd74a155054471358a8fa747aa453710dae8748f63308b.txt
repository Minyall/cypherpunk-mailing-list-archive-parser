	Consistant pricing.  The knowledge that any app I develop
using RSAREF can be made into licensed for commercial use product for
a set, known, published fee.  This would be the biggest win for
Consensus.

	Another really big win would be to add more entry points to
the code to legitimize Wei Dai's excellent Crypto++ library, which has
to jump in at all sorts of unpublished interfaces.
