I'm having some trouble getting ESM to work under DEC Ultrix.  Has
anyone gotten this to work?  My first problem was that Ultrix doesn't
understand one of the constants passed to an ioctl.  With the help of
a Linux box, I got the value of the constant and plugged it in.  
	Now ESM compiles, says randomizing........, then does a carriage
return and just dies.  Ctrl-C doesn't work, Ctrl-Z doesn't work. 
Further I know that it's dying somewhere before the ioctl.  Anyone one
know how to make this work?  For reference,
