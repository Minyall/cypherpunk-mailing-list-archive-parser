Yes, you've finally cottoned on to the secret NSA routing trick to 
cleverly tap all traffic. Really clever the way they use two hosts in the 
132.222 Class B network. Strange that traffic from EUNET should be using 
that network, especially since it happens to be listed in the whois 
database as being NET-EUNET-X25.
