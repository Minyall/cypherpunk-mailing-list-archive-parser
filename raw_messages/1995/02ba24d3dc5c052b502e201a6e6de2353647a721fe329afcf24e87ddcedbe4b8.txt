It may be necessary to remove the ECM mailing list from the MIT
computers (no big surprise here).  The issue isn't the overwhelming
traffic volume on the list; rather, the concern that it might violate
some MIT regulation.

If anyone wants to take it on, please contact me ASAP.

Thanks,
Rich
