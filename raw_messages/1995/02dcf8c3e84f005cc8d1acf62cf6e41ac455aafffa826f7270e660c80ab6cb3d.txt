I keep telling you people.. if you keep giving Fred the attention, he
is never going to go away. Its blindingly obvious that he doesn't know
his ass from a hole in the ground, but if you keep telling him that,
its just going to encourage to post more, post more frequently, and
make a bigger fool of himself then he already has. Just ignore
everything he says. Make a proc-mail script to send his mails to
/dev/null or sends them through the text-to-hick filter. But whatever
you do, do *not* send him money, do *not* feed him, and *never* *ever*
no matter how much he begs, nt matter how much he pleads, *NEVER*
reply to this man's messages.

We need one of those little posters like the "Do not takes checks from
this man" ones in the grocery store.
