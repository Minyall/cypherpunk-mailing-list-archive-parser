You can't use the random method if the CRACK is using a sequential search.
It just doesn't fit !
You can't ACK something which has not been allocated to you.

However, if a CRACK were to be using random, the above would be useful as a
"progress report" as the rate of reports indicates how well the search is
going.
It would also allow more equal sharing out of the prize money, as on
average 2**15 "possible" keys would be found, and the first finder of each
would receive a fraction of the prize.


I don't know enough of the theory -- is there any limit as to how many
"partial" matches there could be in a single "segment" ?
(currently brure{ssl,rc4} stops on finding a match. They would have to keep
 going, and might have to return upto 2**16 partial results ??
)
