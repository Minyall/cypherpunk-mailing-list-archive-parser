I've never looked into doing this. I've placed a copy of my
lynx_bookmarks.html in my ftp directory at Netcom, full pathname of
/ftp/pub/tc/tcmay/lynx_bookmarks.html, so if anyone knows what
combination of incantations involving http:, www, netcom, ftp, etc. to
include, you can access it. (It's chmod 755, so your can read and
execute.)

(If it works, share it with at least me.)
