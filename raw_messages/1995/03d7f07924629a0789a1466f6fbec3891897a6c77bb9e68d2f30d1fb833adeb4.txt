Whoops.  You are absolutely correct.  Pardon my brain-damage.  I
was thinking wall clock time, as you indicated.

Yes, you are correct.  It's better than taking a fixed amount of wall
clock time, but definitely not better than a fixed amount of user
time.

As Paul mentions in his extended abstract, there is actually an easy way
to fix the problem without hurting either latency or throughput much. 
If you blind and and unblind around the modular exponentiation, it
appears impossible to perform this attack.  Because you don't know the
inputs to the exponentiation operation, you can't make any predictions
based on those inputs.
