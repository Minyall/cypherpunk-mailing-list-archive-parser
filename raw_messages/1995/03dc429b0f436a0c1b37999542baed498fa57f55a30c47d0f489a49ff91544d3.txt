I am far behind in my C'punks reading and am likely to get farther
behind before I catch up, so perhaps this is well-known or dated. 
However, the recent revival of reputation discussion reminded me of a
very interesting claim made by Miller & Drexler in "Comparative Ecology:
A Computational Perspective"
(http://www.webcom.com/~agorics/agorpapers.html).  I'll quote from
section 4: 
> ... Trademarking of services and products enables producers to establish
> valuable reputations. The lack of this mechanism in biology [17]
> contributes to the relative sparseness of symbiosis there. 

> 4.4. Food webs and trade webs 

> Biological and market ecosystems both contain a mixture of symbiotic and
> negative-sum relationships. This paper argues that biological ecosystems
> involve more predation, while idealized market ecosystems involve more
> symbiosis. Indeed, one can make a case that this is so even for human
> market ecosystems-that biological ecosystems are, overall, dominated by
> predation, while market ecosystems are, overall, dominated by symbiosis. 

> In human markets (as in idealized markets) producers within an industry
> compete, but chains of symbiotic trade connect industry to industry.
> Competition in biology likewise occurs most often among those occupying

This collection of Miller&Drexler papers is very much worth reading if
you haven't run across it yet.
