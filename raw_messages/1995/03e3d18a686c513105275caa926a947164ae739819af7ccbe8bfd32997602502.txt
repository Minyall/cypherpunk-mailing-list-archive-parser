Has anyone run the Nautilus 1.0 secure telecom software in a DOS box
under OS/2?  When I've tried it, it starts up, audio saying "welcome
to Nautilus" comes out of my speakers, and I'm prompted for a
passphrase.  The problem comes when it tries to connect to the
modem. 

It comes back and says "Remote failed to connect" followed by
"Resetting modem...".  Then the software exits.  It never even takes
the phone line off the hook.  Other DOS comm software works just
fine in a DOS box, so why not Nautilus?
