	I rather figured there was miscommunication here.

	My point is not that MITM has no solution and that time should
not be wasted but that context (in many cases out-of-band contact, but
not necesarily) is an important factor when dealing with MITM. A
context-free situation is not a very useful thing to look at when
trying to solve MITM -- MITM should be looked at in context-based
situations.
