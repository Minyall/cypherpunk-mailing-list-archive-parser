There is nothing in U.S. law that prohibits anyone from using a
cryptographic product, much to the frustration of the NSA, FBI, etc.
That is why they try to forbid speaking about it by pretending that
communication of information is exporting something.  There is a law
that forbids exporting munitions without a license and that is the
basis for the ITAR regulations.

The funny thing is that a law forbidding the use of cryptography just
might be constitutional--though I, for one, am convinced that it would
not be--while forbidding communication of information about
cryptography without a license is a blatant violation of the First
Amendment of the United States constitution.
