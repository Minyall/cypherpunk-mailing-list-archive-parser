It's true that, in general, the "burden" of demonstrating whether a
system is secure should fall primarily on those who claim it is rather
than on those who claim it isn't.  It's also true that PGP, for
whatever reason, is treated with a degree of reverence that is,
perhaps, unwarranted.  I, for one, would be much happier to see
greater vetting of widely-used programs like PGP.  But that does not
mean that one can expect to be taken seriously by simply throwing
darts and seeing where they land.  That would mean that essentially no
hardware, software, algorithm or protocol could ever be considered
trustworthy by anyone for any purpose.  There is a difference between
raising specific concerns and making vague, wild, unsupported claims,
which is how what you wrote below reads to me.

No one knows how "prove" anything substantial, much less the absence
of backdoors, for anything but the most trivial software and
algorithms.

Your attempt to cast a near-defamatory shadow of suspicion over the
individuals and institutions who wrote the software, without raising
even a single specific concern about something you've observed about
the code, invites more questions about your own motives than those of
MIT or its staff.  It seems reasonable to ask you to put up or shut
up.

ties to the spook community than you seem to think MIT has...
