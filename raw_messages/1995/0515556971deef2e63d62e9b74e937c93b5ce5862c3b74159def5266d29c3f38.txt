I posted something to this effect ages ago:

ftp://wiretap.spies.com/Gov/World/australia.con

The same directory contains constitutions and charters of many countries,
from China to Slovakia, as well as the covenant of the Hamas, and the Magna 
Carta. Other useful data on Wiretap include various UN documents, international
charters and treaties, and loads of (particularly US, but also other) 
legislation.
