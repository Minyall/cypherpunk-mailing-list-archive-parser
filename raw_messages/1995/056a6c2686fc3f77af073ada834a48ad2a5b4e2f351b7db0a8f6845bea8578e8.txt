I mistakenly interpreted the original posting as "outgoing only."  Incoming
mail must certainly be saved; however, backing up an outgoing mail spool on
a busy machine is senseless.  By "busy", I mean "that machine which serves
as a mail server".

Outboxes change the situation, but they are not universal.

This brings up an interesting point, namely: where is your email secure?  If
the FBI or security agency of your choice decides to clamp a legal hold upon
the machines upon which you work, they surely wouldn't be so foolish as to
forget about your home machine over that frame-relay or ppp/slip link.  In
such a situation, telling people to use any mailbox at all is useless unless
they encrypt with a relatively secure encryption package, z.B. pgp.

This is a problem, and almost certainly more of a problem than security
agencies demanding your backup tapes.  There's also no way around it; the
only solution is encryption.
