We already have a secondary 1024-bit modulus in the spec. The question is
whether the problem is better solved by allowing parties to use private
moduli rather than by filling up the spec with additional moduli. Remember
that the original reason for specifying a particular modulus as "required"
is to guarantee some minimum degree of interoperability, not to meet every
possible threat.
