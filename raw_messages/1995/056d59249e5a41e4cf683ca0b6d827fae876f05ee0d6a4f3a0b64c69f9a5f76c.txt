Well, I guess I can now say the same thing. A new Remailer is available 
at hroller@c2.org. It is Cpunk, PGP, Hash, Latent, and Cut, I believe. 
This is one of sameer's Remailer-In-A-Box and should be just about the 
same for all c2.org remailers. If you have any problems please report to 
the same address. Have all mail forwarded to my other accout....
