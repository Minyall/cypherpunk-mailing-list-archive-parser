Its worth mentioning that the state of Bavaria (Bayern) is the most
conservative and one of the most Catholic provinces in Germany. There
was an article in Zeit a few months ago about a division of the police
investigating on-line crime, although at the time it was more BBS and
Video Text related. As a former resident of Bavaria, I am not one bit
surprised at these scare tactics.
