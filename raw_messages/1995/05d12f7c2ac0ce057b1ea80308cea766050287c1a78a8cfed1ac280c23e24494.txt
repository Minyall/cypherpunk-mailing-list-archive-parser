All of these security measures are implemented by Netscape in the
current release.  Specifically, Netscape Navigator 2.0beta2
includes all the applet security precautions detailed in the recent
comp.lang.java posting.  Netscape has been shipping the fixed
applet security model for over a month(since 2.0Beta1), and
Netscape and Sun continue to cooperate and work closely on applet
security issues.
