There are java ports in progress for several OS's. Linux is among them
and there is a special mailing list for the linx port of java. Check the
sun home page for porting information, mailing lists, and new developments.

By the way, the current version of Java is Alpha2 release. Expect interface
and programmatic changes before a real version comes out January time frame.
