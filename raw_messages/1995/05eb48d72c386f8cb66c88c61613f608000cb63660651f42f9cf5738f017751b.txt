Actually, the real proposal (http://www.clark.net/pub/cme/html/no-ke.html)
is to have them give me their public keys.  I would sign and post them.
The world's citizens would then add them to their public keyrings and, when
they feel like volunteering GAK, would include these agencies as
crypto-recipients -- on a per-message basis.

No meetings -- no hassle -- nearly 0 cost -- and the gov't could have GAK 
tomorrow.
