   that's why we call them vulture capitalists.  I know a few who would 
sell their own mother, several times, even after she died. I think Rock, 
Perring, the Davises, and a few more were gentlemen; but, as a group they 
certainly do not deserve much respect after each pact they make with the 
devil.  Once the big banks and insurance funds started supplying the 
underlying capitalization, the whores really moved in and made it what I 
refer to as evil money.

   you dont need to believe the New World Order is calling the shots to 
see where the banks are coming from.
