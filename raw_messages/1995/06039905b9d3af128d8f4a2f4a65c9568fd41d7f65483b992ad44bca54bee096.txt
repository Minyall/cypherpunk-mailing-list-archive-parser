which claim no responsibility for telephone conversations. With millions

if I didn't want to be bothered with it, if I felt it might complicate 
my ability to make money on the superhighway, that's the argument I 
would make," he says, adding that a failure by the government to act 
would be "an open invitation to some of the hardcore pornography getting 
into our homes."
