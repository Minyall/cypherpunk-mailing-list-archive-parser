My dearest Perry. 

I am not Fred.  I am not he.  He is not me. Got it??  We aren't even in
the same category or the same country.  Fred's an American, and I am not. 

Scary, isn't it??  A non-American ...

Oh ... and a Happy Ho Ho to ya, Perry.  My own best wishes. (just in case 
you didn't get my email, which wished the same, I mean).

And _none_ of this changes the fact that AT&T and Netscape are my 
personal nominees for the "Christmas Net Scrooge" award.  

Anyone willing to second, that??
