Too late.  The news (in the form of a call from John Markoff, New York Times)
came to Dave and me first thing this morning.

In other news:

unssl.c is presently in the /pub/cypherpunks/incoming/ directory
on ftp.csua.berkeley.edu.  Remember: you must be a "US person"
to download it blah blah blah.  It will (hopefully) soon move to
a more suitable location under /pub/cypherpunks.

The HP on my desk seems to like compiling it with "gcc -O3 -o unssl unssl.c".
YMMV.
