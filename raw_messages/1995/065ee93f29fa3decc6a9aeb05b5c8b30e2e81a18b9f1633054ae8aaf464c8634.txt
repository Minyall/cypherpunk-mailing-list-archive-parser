Uh, you managed to delete the part of my message that said precisely this 
- i.e. that conveying information to a third party with which you have 
no expectation of confidentiality estopps you from later claiming said 
information as a protected interest under the fourth amendment.

You also deleted the citation to the case.  They aren't my words, they 
are those of the supreme court.  (The GAK bit was my extrapolation of the 
concept into the realm of key forfeiture)
