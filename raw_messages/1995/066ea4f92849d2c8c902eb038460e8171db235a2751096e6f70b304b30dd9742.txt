I'm using Netscape 1.1N under SunOS 4.1.2.

It turns out that the same (or a similar) flaw resides in the Open Location
input routine -- perhaps this merely coincides with the code called when a
URL is clicked. Anyway, pasting a URL with an overlong domain name a la Ray's
example causes two things:

(1) Part of the Open Location window widget, below the entry box, gets
overwritten onscreen with a portion of the entered URL.

(2) Netscape crashes with a segmentation fault (no core dump that I can see).
