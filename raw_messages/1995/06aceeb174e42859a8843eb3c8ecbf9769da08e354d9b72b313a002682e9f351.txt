It would depend on what the license agreement said.

But why not just write a wrapper which strips out the 88 bits of plaintext
key?  (A "leaf blower" if you like:)  If you could get the author of slirp
to include it in his distribution, it would definately get used.  All you

is properly secure when using slirp, and here are the diffs..."
