	If you have some personal data that includes your patient
number, why not have a card that instead lists your important data?
"This patient is diabetic, alergic to amoxicillin, and has Gold Cross

	The amount of important data that an ER needs is small.  There
is small benefit to building a huge infrastructure to get that data
carted around.  Also, in ERs, the computers are often authorized the
same way everything else is: a nurse will tell you to leave if you
don't belong there.

in casino chips.  Its sttaggering.  Its an alternate cash system, with
a huge float, astounding velocity, and very little fraud.  Transaction
costs are low, clearing is instantaneous.  The comparison is fairly
clear.
