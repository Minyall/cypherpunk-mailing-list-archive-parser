I began composing a reply precisely to this effect, but was stopped by the
words "They list...". If the address appears in some standard Compu$erve
email directory, then this was hardly a major transgression.

Allow me to suggest a compromise. If some enterprising VV fan would volunteer
to collect fan mail from c'punks, then forward it all, everyone involved
might be fairly satisfied.

Disclaimer:
I'm not familiar with the details of CI$'s fee schedule; if one pays by sheer
volume and not number of messages, then obviously this approach won't alleviate
the burden. Maybe then someone could volunteer actually to ask VV whether/how
he'd like to hear from fans....
