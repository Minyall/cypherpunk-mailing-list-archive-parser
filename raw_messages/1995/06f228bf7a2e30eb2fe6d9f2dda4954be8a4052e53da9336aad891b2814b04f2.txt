This seems like good news..

e.g., cable systems are installing phone systems on the cable and
doing transactions via the cable (pay per view, home shopping, etc.)

A fear of mine was the Clipper was intended as the encryption standard
for all of this. Since AT&T appears to have a chip set that uses
RSA I consider this good...

Assuming it doesn't have escrow, etc.

Recall one of the major current vendors of cable converter boxes has
licensed clipper. (I forget which one).
