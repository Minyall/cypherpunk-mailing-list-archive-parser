A frame-up, I bet! What bothers me is that the it makes sense from a
certain twisted kind of view. Discrediting the group that actually
is a problem when it comes to ITAR, and recently has had good
publicity. And Tim being one of those who spotted Clipper coming,
early on. 

And the punch line; 
  "Look the terrorists and the crypto anarchists are the SAME guys!"


(Tim, not that I agree with your political views, but many Swedes
are like that. ;-) )

Why is it that my conspirational sides has blossomed once I joined
this group? I've posted more severely conspiritional posts recently
than I've done in my whole previous Inet presence. I gotta stop. :-)
