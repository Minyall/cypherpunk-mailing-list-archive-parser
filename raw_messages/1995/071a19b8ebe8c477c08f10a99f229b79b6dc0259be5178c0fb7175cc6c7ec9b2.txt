What you are missing is that you should not say
  "I want to send my credit card number to Egghead Software"
you should say
  "I want to send my credit card number to 12 34 56 78 9A BC DE F0"

The certificates you'd want are:
  * informal correspondence from your friends that 12 34 56 78 9A BC DE F0
makes good widgets/gadgets/whatzits.
  * a Consumers Association report saying that 12 34 56 78 9A BC DE F0's
widgets don't have sharp edges like 13 25 36 47 58 69 7A 8B's do and
that 43 65 87 09 41 61 BA ED's are less efficient (eg "Choice" magazine).
  * possibly a certificate from the bank that 12 34 56 78 9A BC DE F0
is a merchant (if using traditional CCs).
  * or a certificate from a guarantor company saying that if
12 34 56 78 9A BC DE F0 doesn't deliver they'll return your money.

Yeah, I just can't imagine myself at a party introducing myself
"Hi, I'm 08 04 26 6D 01 CD AB 8A  25 A9 E2 86 AD 13 C1 BA".

Then again I never was good at parties...


To start a new sub-thread: what if the man in the middle is actually
a behaviour-modifying parasite? At that stage even a physical meeting
won't do you much good (the parasite may be otherwise asymptomatic).

It's probably more likely than having 30 FBI agents assigned to your
case...


Hope I'm making sense... (well, they say that hope dies last, no?)
