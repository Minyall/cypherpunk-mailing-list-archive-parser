Hey! Lay off the divine Ms. G!

There's actually a big difference between labelling and censorship, 
though there's always the danger that once material has been labelled, 
Ralph Reed and his merry gang of cross burners will try to ban 
information bearing certain labels (the ol' gateway effect).

Of course, if the labeling information isn't signed, the it's useless. 
Oh, and if people vote on labels, you really, really need secret voting 
protocols; this information can be very sensitive if it can be tied back 
to the voters.

p.s.
 What if instead of approving or banning drugs, the FDA instead just 
issued labels, and left the choices to the customer and his or her 
insurance agency...
