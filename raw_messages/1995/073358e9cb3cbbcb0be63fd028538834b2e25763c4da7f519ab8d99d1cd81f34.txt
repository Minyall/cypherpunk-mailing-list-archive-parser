On the other hand, it costs nothing by most people's standards to use
a 1024 bit key, so why not use one? I find that there is only a point
in using low security for anything in particular when there is a
perceivable cost to it -- if the cost is typing a different number
while doing key generation, I don't see why one should suffer the
tradeoff.
