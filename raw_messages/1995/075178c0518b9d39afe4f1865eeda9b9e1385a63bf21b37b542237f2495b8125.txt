	Hi there, 
I read about this list in the Electronic Engineering Times, so I scored PGP as soon as I could.
My ?? is this: When I create a document on M$ Word or XL and then PGP it, how could I eliminate the plaintext left in the swap file?  Now, I understand the PGP -w command but that only wipes the original
plaintext. 
	My other ?? is if my disk is seized by the S.S. , how easy would it be for  them to recover
old plaintext messages? 
	Thanks,
	Eric
