The kindly administrative assistant there will take your name and address
and send you a hardcopy of the ITAR regulations.  I don't know about
overseas mailings.  I also imagine you will have to wait until the current
US budget stale-mate is resolved.  (Thanks to digest-reader walt@osf.org
for the phone number.)
