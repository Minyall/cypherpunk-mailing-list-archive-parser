JAK (Judicial Access to Keys) sounds as though it wouldn't give the LEAs a 
chance to pre-emptively snoop on message traffic before prosecution, unlike
POTS wiretaps and Clipper. I don't see the govt. ever favoring such a
scheme that doesn't help the LEAs to "gather" evidence to justify an
indictment. They will probably skip JAK instead <ducking ;>....
