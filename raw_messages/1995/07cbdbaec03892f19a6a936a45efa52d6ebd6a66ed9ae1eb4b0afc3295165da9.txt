I wouldn't be so sure.  There are lots of "creative" ways to, in effect, 
extend the statute.  My personal sense is that DOJ eventually wants to 
get this over with, so presumably would not attempt to be so "creative."

The "usual" statute of limitations for federal crimes is 5 years, but 
conspiracy, RICO, bank fraud, tax offenses, and no doubt others that 
don't occur to me right now, muddy the 5 year statute.  Bank fraud, for 
example, has a 10 year statute.
