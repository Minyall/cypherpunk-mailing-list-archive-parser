TCL solved my specific problem at that time.  Unfortunately I haven't
studied Java.  PM's comments (as usual) intrigue and bother me; I
need to study it.

TCL's biggest problem is that it's slow -- it's designed to be used
in the parts where speed doesn't really matter -- and it sounds
like java sovles that. 


Perry -- do you have the same basic objection to Safe-TCL that you do
do to Java?  I would think so.
