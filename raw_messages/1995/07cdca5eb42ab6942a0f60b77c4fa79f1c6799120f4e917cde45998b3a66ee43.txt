   "2 Groups of Physicists Produce Matter That Einstein
   Postulated."

      By chilling a cloud of atoms to a temperature barely
      above absolute zero, scientists at a Colorado laboratory
      have at last created a bizarre type of matter that had
      eluded experimenters ever since its potential existence
      was postulated by Albert Einstein 70 years ago. The
      creation of this Bose-Einstein condensate -- named for
      Einstein, and the Indian theorist Satyendra Nath Bose --
      was hailed yesterday as the basis of a new field of
      research expected to explain some fundamental mysteries
      of atomic physics. A Texas group later produced similar
      results. The achievement should allow physicists to peer
      directly into the realm of the ultrasmall.     MYS_fit
