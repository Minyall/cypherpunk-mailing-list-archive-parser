	As has been pointed out, this would prolly doom geting export
approval for version 2.0.  However, let's keep the developer/publisher
out of the loop.  How about someone developing a 'binary diff', using
the functionality of nm to find subroutine entry points, and then doing
the binary diff from those starting points?  Presumably, for most of the
program the diff would mostly be changed entry points, with the bulk of
diff being the crypto module.  Then the bdiff gets exported, and
bpatch-ed into the export binary.  Of course, this wouldn't work if they
strip the binary, but who is going to force them to do that?
