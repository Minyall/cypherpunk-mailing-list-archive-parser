   11-5-95. NYPaper Sunday Magazine:

   "Making Microsoft Safe For Capitalism. How do you restrain
   an 800-pound gorilla?" Cover story. By James Gleick.

      If the software giant has its way, it will soon be in a
      position to collect a charge for every airline ticket
      you buy, every credit card purchase you make, every fax
      you send, every picture you download, every Web site you
      visit. It's time to draw the line. But where?

      'Anything not a direct lie or clearly illegal is O.K. to
      do if it advances Microsoft's tribal cause,' Mitchell
      Kapor says. 'This licenses the worst sort of
      manipulations, lies, tortured self-justification and so
      on.'
