On a social mailing list that I'm on, two things have been noticed in 
the last week:

	1: Somebody's roommate (a Green Beret) has been called back into
		6 months of active service.  He was not told where he'd 
		be.

	2: GPS fine positioning has been turned off.  This is only done
		during times of military operations (such as the 'invasion'
		of Haiti and the Iraq Massacre).  It's also been highly
		correlated with Pentagon pizza deliveries.

Anybody else have any clues as to what's up?

No overt crypto relevence, but some parallels to traffic analysis could be
easily drawn.
