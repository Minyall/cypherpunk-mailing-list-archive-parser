  It will be available as it has been in the past, which means unsupported.
That means that if you have a bug, and you try to call us for help,
we will not provide it.

  We have never officially responded to bug reports on Linux.  We do not

not fix bugs that are reported via our feedback page.  It doesn't mean
we will fix them either...
