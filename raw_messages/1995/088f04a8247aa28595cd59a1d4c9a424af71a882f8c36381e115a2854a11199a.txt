	According to a couple of friends who are evaluating use of GPS
for precisely locating radio transmissions the usual selective availablity
dither is still turned on and there have been no public announcements
about any changes in the status of the C/A (public) part of the system.
The P code part of the system is only available to the military and
announcements about it may not be made from the usual USCG BBS that
carries stuff about the civilian signals, but they know nothing about
any change in GPS status recently, nor has there been any change
in the amount of dither or its (random) nature.
