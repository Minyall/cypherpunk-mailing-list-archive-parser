I've heard that A.I. does not discuss political persecution as much in
the countries that are doing it, since they do not want to offend the
powers-that-be in that country, though they will note a case in another
country.  (In other words, if A.I. did note the PRZ case they'd only
discuss it outside the United States.)

This is just speculation though...
