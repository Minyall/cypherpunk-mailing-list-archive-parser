So if 70% of Usenet follows this scheme a handful of forged cancels can easily
cause melt down.

I can post a handful of articles and forge the From line, and create my
own Cancel-lock headers by "rolling the dice."  I can then get their mailbox
bombed by forging cancels.  A little more complicated then "sendsys-bombing"
but not much more so.
