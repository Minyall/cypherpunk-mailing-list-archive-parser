In other words, you'd like to retain an excerpt from the message with the
signature still intact?

Problem with that is how do you prevent one from creating a clerverly made
excerpt that distorts what one is saying (but has a valid signature)? It
seems your example does this very thing.

Better to quote the unsigned portion but retainthe original signed message
as evidence that the excerpt is Ok.

That's the problem, of course.
