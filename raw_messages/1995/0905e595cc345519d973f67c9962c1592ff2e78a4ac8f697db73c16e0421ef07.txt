I am familiar with this argument and agree. In the discussed case
the alleged abuser had only used one remailer (on a site that keeps
logs world readable at that!). Laziness, I guess. There are ways of
multiple chaining for the lazy, though: C2 lets you pick the chained
sites by clicking on a web-page (but does it encrypt??).
