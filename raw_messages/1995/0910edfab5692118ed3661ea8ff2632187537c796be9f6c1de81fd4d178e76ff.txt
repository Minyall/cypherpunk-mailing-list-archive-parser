I talked to somebody from RSA yesterday, and she said that they
issued a press release yesterday that she expected to see in the
papers today (I didn't see it) and would be on their web site
"soon" that would explain their position.  They say that the
arbitration agreemment maintains the status quo pretty much,
and while it doesn't limit what RSA can do, it severly limits
what Cylink can do.

I think that what RSA needs to do is hire Cylink's PR agency...
