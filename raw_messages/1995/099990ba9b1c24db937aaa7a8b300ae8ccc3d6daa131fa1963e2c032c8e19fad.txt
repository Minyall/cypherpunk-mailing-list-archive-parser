Assuming that this isn't contradicted by other parts of the legislation,
doesn't this outlaw distribution "to computer networks" software for
everything from compression to data structures to TCP/IP to ROT13 to PGP? 

The bad part is that they might "compromise" and, by the time its over 
with, it still outlaws non-GAK crypto. At least when its overly broad it 
has a better chance of getting laughed out of court.

The United States Government *is* this stupid. If you are unfortunate 
enough to live within U.S. borders, welcome to hell. *heavy sigh*
