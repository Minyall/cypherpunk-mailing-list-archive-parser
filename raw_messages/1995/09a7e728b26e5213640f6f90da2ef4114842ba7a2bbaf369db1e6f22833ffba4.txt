  Just a quick note to chime in. The OSF just did a deal with Sun
to port Java to several platforms. The OSF is opening a "web mall"
where you can grab software objects and run them. Expect to Java
*really* take off in about 2-3 months. Every business on the net is going
to want a Java shopping-client-basket on their web-mall/web-store.
