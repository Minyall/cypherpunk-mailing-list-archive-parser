This might be a minor thing, but could people posting to the mailing list
please make sure that the Subject line doesn't say "re: your mail".
  it really slows me down to have to check manually what the actual
subject was or if it was directed to ME but put my addres in the cc 
instead of the To.


Thankyou.
