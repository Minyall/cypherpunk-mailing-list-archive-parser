Yeah, this is really an excellent idea, that I don't see happening any time
soon. Although of course if anyone wants to write code for such a beast,
that would be really excellent.  If someone gets around to writing it,
it'll happen, but it would be a fairly big project, so I wouldn't hold my
break.  Safe TCL, anyone?
