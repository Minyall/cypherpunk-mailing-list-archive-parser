	From the Yale Computer Center:

	Got an idea for y'all, from the heart and mind of Elizabeth 
Walker, with whom I live.

	 Let's set up a web site where someone can submit a letter that 
will be automatically sent to every senator, congressperson, elected and 
appointed federal official. If we run into trouble, we can scale it down, 
narrow the various target areas...

	Also, we could write our own letters, post them, and if someone 
wants to resend it, they could do so at the click of the mouse.

	Example, someone logs on to the Freedom Speaks webserver, and is 
greeted by the message, "Welcome, enter your message for Federal 
officials in the box provided, then hit the submit button." 

	"If you would like to submit one of our pre-written letters, just 
click on any of the ones you see below." 

	For those without web access, we could set up a mailing list to 
do the same.

	 I.e. to send a message to all our elected and appointed 
officials, send message to freetheworld@gateway.net. From there it gets 
spooled everywhere. What do you think? I could probably do it somehow, 
but someone with access to better resources and knowledge of cgi-bin 
might be better for the job. If anyone is interested in this project, let 
me know...
