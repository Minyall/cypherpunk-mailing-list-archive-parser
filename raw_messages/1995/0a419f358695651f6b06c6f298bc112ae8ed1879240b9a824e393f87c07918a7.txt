The NSA doesn't really bother me all that much, because all they've managed
up to now is to slow things down (by about 3 hrs. in the case of PGPhone).
But what happens when someone who HAS mastered market psychology gets into
the game?

Here's a prediction:  within one year, we will see the advent of Micro$oft's
"Not So Bad Privacy".  It'll be a secret algorithm with either GAK done by
Micro$oft itself, or a flat-out trap door.  ANY communications with a 
Windoze box or network will have to use it, or loose the market.  About the
same time, Justice will suddenly 'loose interest' in its various 
investigations of M$.  Micro$oft will probably give it away for free as part
of the Windows 95.702 upgrade. 

At this point, the NSA's 'speed bump' becomes Micro$oft's 'brick wall'.  And
while some of us will continue to use PGP and other strong crypto, the average
American will have kissed off ALL of her privacy to the tune of "... you make
a grown man cry."
