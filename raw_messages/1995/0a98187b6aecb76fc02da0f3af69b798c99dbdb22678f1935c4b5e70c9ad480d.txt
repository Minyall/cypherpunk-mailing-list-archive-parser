	Well, you corrected it, but you didn't admit it, at least not
here, and it makes people who made comments on the _original_ version
look like fools.  Next time when you quote a corrected article, please
note that it's been corrected.  The difference between an AF captain (4
years of service) and a Navy captain (17-ish years of service) is
substantial when when judging whether they could be considered
'whizzkids' in this environment.
