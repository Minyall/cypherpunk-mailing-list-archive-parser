A more famous statement on key certification authorities:

    And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor,
    free and bond, to receive a mark on their right hand, or
    in their foreheads:
    And that no man migh buy or sell, save he that had the 
    mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
