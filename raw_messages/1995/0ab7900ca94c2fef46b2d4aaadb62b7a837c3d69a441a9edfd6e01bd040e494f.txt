Indeed -- Ta.

I'm seeing calls from calpoly.edu and albany.net taking less than a second.
Are you **REALLY** worried about wasting that sort of time, when even a single
segment usually takes a quarter of an hour even on the faster machines ?

I don't think a second's overhead (practical with local cache) is significant.

Sure, but I'd prefer you allocate single segments .....

Sure.

[ Getting down to the implementation details
  1) it would be hard for brloop to know that brutessl is 3/4s done.
  2) I can't think how to do prefetching in a safe way, and without disc use

No.

If you gave me code which would guess how long the request for the next
segment will take, and then know when brutessl is that many milliseconds from
completion, and can tell that brloop isn't going to die within that time,
sure :-))


If someone supplies info for my "PS3:", I can generate central stats on what
%age of Hal3 was wasted waiting on the server.
Otherwise, brloop users will have to scan their own logs (if enabled) and work
it out (latest brloop happens to log when brutessl starts and finishes).
