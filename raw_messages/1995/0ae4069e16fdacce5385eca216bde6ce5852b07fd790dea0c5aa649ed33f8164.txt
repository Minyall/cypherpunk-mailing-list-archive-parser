I see no reason why they should not be as ``illegal'' as the
crypto-with-a-hole sillyness.  Pointing to software is a pretty
effective way of disclosing it, and disclosing cryptographic
software--apparently including holes--to foreign persons without a
license is a violation of the ITAR.

Of course, the ITAR itself is illegal as it applies to cryptographic
software, but I agree that one does not want to be the defendant in a
criminal case based on those unconstitutional provisions.
