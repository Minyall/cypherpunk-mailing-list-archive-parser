Depends on the counter people. The local RS here the clerks don't care
much about it and will enter a random number. A local Service Merchandise
does the same thing, but they're pesky, so I make up silly names to test
the wits of impatient teenage mutant cashiers.  (They also used to have
a computer where you enter your telno. and place orders to pick up at
the desk... I don't think the system bills you automatically but the
employees probably won't like it when you have them get 10 wieght sets
out...)
