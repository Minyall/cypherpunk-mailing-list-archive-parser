Unfortunatly, the lusers here are brain-dead and don't care about 
anything.  They don't even know the first things about DOS.  We do have a 
couple of geniuses who think they know Windoze (or want to learn it) who 
occasionally play with the icons and groups: one such genious once closed 
a group window, then claimed someone "erased it."  What a dork!  The 
worse is that I have to clean up after them no matter how stupid they are.

Well, the loopback is only a single IP address.  If they used that, every 
net.entity would have the same IP.  Not too good. :-)

Nope, sounded right the like the Apple MacinTalk II Pro voices.  They've 
got some really cool voices, some even human sounding.  Check it out if 
you get a chance.  Real intonations: you can hear the voice flex, etc.  
There are some voices that follow songs or other tones.  (i.e. Big Ben, 
Bells, etc.)  They sound like they're singing.

Yep.  Those be the same machines where I dropped my Cypherpunx PC EXPO 
V2.0 disks.  Just left a few dozen infront of each machine as I used 
them.  Sort of the sleight of hand that theives use to lift stuff; only I 
didn't take, I put. >;-)

Say, what's on this BBS anyway... (send me email, enough noise on this list.)
