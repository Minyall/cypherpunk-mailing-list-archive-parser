There is a class of people called "idiot savants" who contain people who can also solve such
problems by inspection - their IQs are often much lower than 100, so that
blows Albert's theory.  These so-called "idiot savants" can easily factor
100 digit numbers.  The ability to solve such problems is not tied to IQ,
as there are many such people with IQs of 150+ who cannot solve them.
