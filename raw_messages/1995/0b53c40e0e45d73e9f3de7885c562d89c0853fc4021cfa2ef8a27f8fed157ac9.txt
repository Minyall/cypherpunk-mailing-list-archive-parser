   Right. Some other common ones are ".." and shell meta characters
in paths. Also, accessing files that you don't have permissions
to. Even if the server is perfect, the setup could be bad. For
instance, if you use CERN's Authentication scheme for protecting
URL hierarchies, do not put the passwd/group file within the
hierarchy. I've noticed this before on some servers, like

http://www.isp.com/company1/passwd   contains the passwd file for the
http://www.isp.com/company1/   URL directory. Although it is convenient
to store the passwd file within the hierarchy it is protecting, care
must be taken to make it unreadable by normal HTTP requests. It's better 
to put it in a configuration directory somewhere where no server
has access to. (I've seen this mistake plenty of times)

  A barebone's web server is a pretty simple piece of a software compared
to a browser (or sendmail), so it should be possible to make them
much more secure.
