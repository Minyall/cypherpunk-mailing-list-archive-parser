PACs are to politics what mutual funds are to investing - that is, a
mechanism for investors to diversify their holdings, and to allow for the
managers of those holdings to use their expert/specialized knowledge to
achieve better returns (at the cost of some frictional skimmings-off) than
individuals would on their own. 

But I'm not sure what this has to do with C-punks any longer.
