Sorry:  I got flamed for laughing at Perry's rather silly statement
that unix is as easy as DOS.

They asked me to produce evidence.

Since I was working on my unix Sun Sparc Station 20 at the 
time  (with extreme reluctance), and I had just used
what unix folk humorously call their command line editor, 
so I suffered from explosive vomiting, and vomited all over 
the cypherpunks mailing list.

After the first bout of explosive vomit, I returned to work, whereupon
the unix "High Performance" files system lost one of my files,
producing the second round of explosive vomit.
