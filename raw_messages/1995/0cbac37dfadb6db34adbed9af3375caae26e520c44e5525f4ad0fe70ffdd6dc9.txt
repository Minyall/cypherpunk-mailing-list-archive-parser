I never finished my own implementation of IPSEC because I didn't have
time, but I am now in possession of a fully functioning version for
4.4BSD derived systems that was developed at NRL. I'm going to have it
integrated into the NetBSD source tree very soon.

I really encourage Wei and anyone else who's interested in this sort
of stuff to participate in the IPSEC work so that we can try to put
all our effort behind the one standardized solution -- it will make
interoperability much easier at the very least!
