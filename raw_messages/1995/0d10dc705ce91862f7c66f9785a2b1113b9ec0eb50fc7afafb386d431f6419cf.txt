This isn't an enterprise. The government is not a participant except
by their own desire to interfere.

	One reason to incorporate a probable opponent into something is to see
what methods the opponent will likely use. For instance, their debating points
would be nice to know in advance (to the degree they aren't already); while
cyberpunks don't have much access to the mass media, that on the Net
(where a lot of the initial potential users are likely to be) is another
matter. Getting clues to their likely legal strategy may also be valuable.
	On the other hand, letting them know too much may be a problem... of
course, I'm _certain_ the NSA, etcetera get copies of this list.
