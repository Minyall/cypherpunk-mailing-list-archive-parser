Hmmm...this leads to the "unobnoxious anonymous remailer" concept.  I am 
under the impression that most cases of people getting upset about anon 
remailers is when they get threatening email from them.  

One could require that all email going through a remailer must be 
encrypted (perhaps with a universally known key).  That way when Joe 
clueless users gets encrypted mail he doesn't expect, he probably is too 
clueless to go find the key and decrypt it...

This would require the remailer to examine entropy of messages passing 
through.  Anything not random enough gets tossed.
