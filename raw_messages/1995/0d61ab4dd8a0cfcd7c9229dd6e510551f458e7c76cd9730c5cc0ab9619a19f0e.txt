CSI's most recent _Computer Security Alert_ has a listing for:
Cryptographic specialist for a San Diego based firm.  Headhunter's
address is: vfalcon@onramp.net

(I know this is isn't jobs.misc, but traffic having been relatively
light, I'm passing this on to others who may be interested in
crypto, but aren't on CSI's mailing list.  Now back to frequency
hopping radios and Anti-Fred)
