Concidering that they do give out a fair amount of shirts, they might
actually be doing this now.  (If it was for bugs they would owe me quite a
few shirts. ];>)

If they offer you a shirt, ask for one of the "Mosaic Communications
Corporation" t-shirts.  (The one with the old version of Mozilla on the
back.)  They are evidently considered a status symbol at Netscape corporate.
(And, no, you cannot have mine.)
