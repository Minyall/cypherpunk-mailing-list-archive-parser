	"allegedly". Well I suppose you don't need to break the HP
firewall to get past it, so I guess that could be an appropriate
statement.
	(I adminned a few of their firewalls for a short time on
contract while the person who was normally in charge of them was
away. Calling it a firewall is a stretch of the word-- They allow
telnets from sites at berkeley.edu and stanford.edu with reusable
passwords, for one example.)
