But, what is a good DES target to attack??  SSL was a great target
because it is both visible and because it has a well
defined open specification that made it easy to determine 
exactly what to attack (unlike Microsoft Access).

I know someone who *used* to be in the ATM transaction 
business, but is no longer.  Is the code from a credit card
reader DES encrypted?  We could be possible "tap" the serial
port between the reader and the modem and get a byte 
stream in that manner.... but then again, my knowledge
of those beasts is pretty limited.
