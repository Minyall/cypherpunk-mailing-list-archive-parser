Actually, when I read the above I thought of Quantum Mechanics, 
but I would expect you'd need special hardware for that.
(In fact I'd expect you'd need special comms lines for that, but
certainly at least the equipment at the two ends.)

Still, who knows what surprises QM can provide?

In which case calling it a "telepathic key exchange scheme" might
be quite appropriate :-)


However, Occam's razor points to cluelessness.
