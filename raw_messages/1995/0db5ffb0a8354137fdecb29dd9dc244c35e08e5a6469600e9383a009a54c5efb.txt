Excerpts from : St Paul Pioneer Press, Jan 29, 1995

"IRS plans to collect more data on individuals to nab tax cheats"

a "vast expansion of secret computer database of information it
keeps on virtually all Americans" will include "credit reports,
news stories, tips from informants,  and real estate, motor vehicle
and child support records, plus conventional Govt financial data"

"Any individual who has business and/or financial activities can
expect upgraded agency reports to be put to IRS auditors promptly"

Here's the kicker: "Although agency officials concede that some of
the data collected will be inaccurate, taxpayers will not be allowed
to review or correct it"                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
So much for the FOIA.
