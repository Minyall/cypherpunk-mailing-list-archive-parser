	This shows that Netscape will probably, after much bad press
and sleepless nights on the part of netscape developers, become one of
the best secure programs out there.
	The cypherpunks will have won because there will be a secure
program available with the backing of lawyers.
	Netscape will have won because their product will be the best.
