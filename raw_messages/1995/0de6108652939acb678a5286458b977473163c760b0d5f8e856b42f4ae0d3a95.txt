I think you envisage communicating with a few other revolutionaries,
drug trafficers, etc, whereas I envisage a future where every man is
his own bank and his own credit rating agency.

More immediately, any extension to the web of trust to enable it to
function for anything more interesting and important than
logical-to-physical identity (and who gives a tinkers damn about
logical-to-physical identity) will require a real database, or
will be painful without a real database.
