Photuris, which likely will be the standard way to do this sort of
thing on top of IPsec, also suffers from the problem, but I suspect
the next version of the draft (number 9) will have it fixed.

More interesting is the fact that a number of NSA vetted protocols
seem to have the flaw. Obviously, they either didn't know or didn't
say anything about it to the folks designing such stuff...
