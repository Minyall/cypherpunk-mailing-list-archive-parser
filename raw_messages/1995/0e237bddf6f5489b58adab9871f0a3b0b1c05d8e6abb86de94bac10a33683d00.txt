Disregarding the "quantum properties of light" issue, if Eve can listen
in on every communication between Alice and Bob about their keys, then
doesn't she have enough information to reconstruct the key herself?

The way I understand the system, in order for Alice to have Bob's key (and
vice versa) they each have to transmit a considerable amount of data about
their keys.  Even if those data are in the form of "twenty questions," neither
knows anything about the other's key at the start.  Is there something
painfully obvious that I'm missing?

Exactly.
