MS-DOS? Selectively overwrite data not alloc'ed to files?  Try this:  I do it
all the time:

open a file for output
write garbage to file until the disk fills
delete file
do it again

... what could be simpler?  This will fill all unused allocation units with
garbage.  Do it until you feel comfortable.
