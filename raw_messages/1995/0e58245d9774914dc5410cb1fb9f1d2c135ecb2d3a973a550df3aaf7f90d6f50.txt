I hope that this is false.

Even if one had genuine artificial intelligence, it would be impossible
to detect all viruses, only particular viruses and classes of virus.

If Java is secure, virus scanning should be unnecessary, indeed 
impossible, because there could be no code configuration capable
of acting as a virus.

If virus scanning occurs, then it is possible to write a virus in Java,
then Java is inherently insecure.
