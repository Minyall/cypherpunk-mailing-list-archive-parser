This is an example of reasoning by extremes, which always becomes 
reductio ad absurdum.

Unrestricted individual freedom leads to unrestricted freedom of 
`private' corporations.  Private corporations uncurbed by society's law are 
autarkies: internally totalitarian, externally predatory, as amoral as 
amoebas.

Is this the shape of the future you seek?
