Well, I don't have the PGP 'conventional' encryption format memorized, but  
there is probably a constant after the IV that is prepended to the data.  The  
constant is used to determine if the key is correct.  Since the conventional  
encryption runs in CFB mode and there is a full block of random IV at the  
beginning of the file, it is extremely unlikely that a key could be found  
that would properly decrypt only the first two blocks while leaving the rest  
unreadable...

Not really.  Even if you could find an IDEA key that would produce the  
desired output it would be hard to find a passphrase that would produce that  
key when hashed.  One of the properties of one-way hash functions is that it  
is difficult to find a plaintext that produces a given hash.  Hence the term  
'one-way'....  Even if you did find a passphrase (which, if MD5 is strong,  
would require something like 2^64 operations), it would likely be long, have  
8-bit chars, and would be impossible to type in.  It would be tough to  
convince anyone that it was the real passphrase.
