That's a feature, not a bug.  Unless the group was moderated, I predict
the S/N ratio to be <= 0.  Witness the crap in alt.2600.

The mailing list, as someone said before me, works as a limited
pre-screening system.  Given the nature of the list's focus and
discussion, I think a newsgroup would end up being a stable attractor
for the clue-deficit crowd.  Not something I'd find useful.
