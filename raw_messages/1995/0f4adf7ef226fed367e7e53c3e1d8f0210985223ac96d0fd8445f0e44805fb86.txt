I've said it before, and I'll say it again.

My opinion is that stegonography "standards" are useless. Anyone can
try unpeeling the GIFs and see if something interesting shows up
inside. That means that the only useful stego suffers from the defect
that symmetric key cryptography suffers from -- you have to have made
serious pre-arrangements with the counterparty.
