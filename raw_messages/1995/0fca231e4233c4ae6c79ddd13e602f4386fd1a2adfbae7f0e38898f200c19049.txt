To provide payee anonymity:

Enterprising cypherpunk, Ed sets up the Ecash Remailer.

Alice pays Bob e$15. Alice is anonymous.
Bob sends Ed the e$15
Ed cashes the e$ into his ecash mint account, withdraws e$13.50
then pays Bob those e$14 .. Bob can now spend those e$ at will.

	Bob is now anonymous.

	This requires some trust-in-Ed, but Bob could be anonymous
from Ed just as Ed is anonymous.

	Perhaps this is the scheme lucky mentioned. I will have to get
an account and implement it.
