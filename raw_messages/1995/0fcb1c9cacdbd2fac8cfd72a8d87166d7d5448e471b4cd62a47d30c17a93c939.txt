Japan-CIA

   	
Tokyo (AP) -- Japan said that its relations with Washington 
could 
be seriously damaged if a report that the CIA spied on Japanese 

representatives at auto talks proves true. The New York Times 
reported Sunday that the CIA eavesdropped on conversations 
between 
Japanese negotiators and automakers during the talks in Geneva 
this 
year, reporting the results daily to U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor. According to the report, Kantor was provided 
with 
summaries of conversations between Japanese bureaucrats and 
executives from Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. Toyota 
called the alleged eavesdropping ``unthinkable,'' but refused 
to 
comment further.
