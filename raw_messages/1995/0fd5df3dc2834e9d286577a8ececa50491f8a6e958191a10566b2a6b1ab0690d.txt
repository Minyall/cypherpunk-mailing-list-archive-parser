	The anonymous remailer at jpunix.com is going to shut down 
permanently shortly after I send this message. I spent my holidays 
fighting spams, running out of disk space because of spams and people 
sending HUGE binaries, and running out of swap space. 

	I have come to the ultimate conclusion that the Internet is not
mature or developed enough for remailers. The intended purpose has been
completely ignored while abuse is growing almost geometrically on a daily
basis. I have concluded that running a remailer on the Internet is like
giving a bunch of terrorists a nuclear bomb and then telling them "But
only use it for good!". There just doesn't seem to be much point in
thrashing my disks and computer to aid somebody in net abuse. I hardly
ever (never) see any use of the remailer for the purposes it was intended. 

BTW as I type this, mailgate.mail.aol.com is hammering my port 25 every 
30 seconds. The contents of the spam being passed thru my system 
essentially says:


          THIS IS A MAIL BOMB!!
          **** BOOM ***

See what I mean??
