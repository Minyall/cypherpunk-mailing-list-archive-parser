As many of you probably already know, the US Postal Service is creating
a national public-key infrastructure for individuals (I've never heard
any mention of Corporate identities, not to say that there won't be any).

A few weeks ago the General Services Agency of the US Gov't had an open
working session of their Security Infrastructure Program Management Office
(SIPMO).  At that session they announced a pilot program for electronic
filing of federal tax returns, using the USPS infrastructure.

The URL in the subject line has not yet been updated to discuss the pilot;
right now it is basically an overview of SIPMO.

Anyone know more?
