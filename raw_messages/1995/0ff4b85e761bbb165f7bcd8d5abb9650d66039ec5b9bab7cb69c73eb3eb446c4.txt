I think I can answer this question because I was an obnoxious little
hacker with an Atari 800 when I was a kid.  The only thing I did not
have was a modem and an Internet connection (thus ability to read
sci.crypt.research etc ...)

I did have arbitrary precision math libraries (although I did not
have any engineering concept of "libraries"), and I had written some
non-trivial scrambling code (it's not RSA, of course).  I am, by no
means, a super-smart person.  Therefore, it is not a stretch to
believe that kids today can perform powerful encryption in the
privacy of their own homes.

Therefore, to Bill G and his "prophecy": "been there, done that" ...
(Apologies to those who hate that phrase; I hate it too, but it is
so obnoxious that it gets the point across.)
