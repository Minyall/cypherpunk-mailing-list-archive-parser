I'm halfway in the coding of a simple anonymous WWW proxy, but before
going any furter, I'd like to know:

 + If this has not been done before and is available ? (and where)
 + If there is any interest
 + Chaining would be a imo good idea (ie cli <-> anonproxy1 <->
   anonproxy2 <-> ... <-> server) but how would you manage to tell
   your favorite web browser to add in its header something like
   Http-Proxy-List: anonproxy2, ...
   An alternative would be to have a database of avaibale (running)
   proxies and that the proxy itself randomly choose a next route ?
 + A way to solve previous pb and to add in encryption (but would it
   be fast enough for web browsing ?) would be that each user runs a
   local proxy (that could be optionnaly used by other folks) that
   would do pgp encryption/decryption, 'routing' selection,etc...

Would ppl with mail remailers and/or W3 experience comment ?
(or tell me the pointer toward the already solved, already implemented
beast that would do the above)
