This point may have been raised before, but anyway, unless you're using a 
swiss-bank issued credit card for a numbered account (if that's at all 
possible), or a bogus name on the card, why would anybody want to use 
something as completely traceable as a credit card to pay for a remailer 
or a data haven?
