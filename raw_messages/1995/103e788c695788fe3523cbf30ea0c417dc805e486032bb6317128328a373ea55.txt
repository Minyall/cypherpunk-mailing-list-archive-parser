Yes, and I suppose everyone got the message I stupidly sent to the
list rather than to majordomo trying to figure this out...sorry.

This list is supposed to be gated to a Nyx newsgroup via
cypherpunks@cs.du.edu, as I recall, but is also being sent to
cypherpunks@nyx.cs.du.edu, and to a couple of individual users:

apoulter@nyx.cs.du.edu (Alan  Poulter)
cypherpunks@nyx.cs.du.edu
jannis@nyx10.cs.du.edu
cypherpunks@cs.du.edu

I'm not sure if this is related to the crash; I was getting a few
double postings from mnemosyne before the crash, but they seem to
have increased.  I've Cc:'d the sysadmin at DU, but removing the
cypherpunks@nyx.cs.du.edu subscription might be in order.  BTW,
mnemosyne is the news server at DU...

If it keeps up, I have no doubt someone will forge an unsubscribe
request...:-)  Anyway, maybe Hugh and/or Andrew can solve this in
a less hackish manner...
