Never heard of such a disk.  However, I'm not sure it can be disabled as 
it's in CMOS, and it the PS/2 (Half a personal computer?) I remember with 
this password crap didn't even do a floppy seek, so if they don't read 
the A: drive, how can there by a boot admin disk?  (I may be wrong, but 
that's what I remember.)
