A big problem with Netcom is it that it has no web server,
and its ftp server is totally overwhelmed.

I use nw.com for my web pages and netcom for everything else.

Big bandwidth webservice at reasonable rates

Does anyone have a better suggestion?  I have been shopping
around for a reasonably priced 28KB SLIP connection.  Have
not found one yet.
