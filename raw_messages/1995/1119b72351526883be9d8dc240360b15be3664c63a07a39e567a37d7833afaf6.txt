Indeed, that's the way the C version works now:

[from README.client in the Mixmaster distribution]:
# Mixmaster uses the same source & binary for the remailer program and the
# client program. Setting up a client, however, is significantly easier.

It would be interesting to see how the market would react to this. There
might be quite a bit of reluctance to take on the liability of a remailer
operator just to send an anonymous message (maybe that's a good thing ;)

Some mechanism would need to be worked out to tie delivery of each message
to satisfactory performance of its true originating address, without making
it much easier for an opponent to tie a message to its point of origin.
