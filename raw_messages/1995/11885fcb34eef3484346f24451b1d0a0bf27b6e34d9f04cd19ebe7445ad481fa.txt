A reference for Mark's paper on Millicent is
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/pub/Conferences/WWW4/Papers/246/">The Millicent
	Protocol for Inexpensive Electronic Commerce</a>
Of all the various payment protocols I've seen, this was one of the few
that studied the available protocol bandwidth before designing a protocol.
Folks with an engineering slant should appreciate the work here.

I would be VERY interested in URL's and summaries of Micali's talk.
(I really wanted to go but after spending most of the week at the WWW4
conference I had to commit serious time to being anchored to the office.)
