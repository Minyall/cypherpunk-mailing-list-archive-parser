HP LOBBIES FOR EXPORTABLE ENCRYPTION PLAN
Hewlett-Packard has developed an encryption strategy with the French
company Gemplus SCA that they're hoping will pass the tough scrutiny of
U.S. export controllers.  The plan takes a two-pronged approach -- an
"encryption engine" that works in conjunction with a code-making formula
that can be adjusted to any level deemed acceptable by the U.S. government,
and a policy card that would be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the
State Department. The flexible system is designed to adapt to changing
government policies, and could even accommodate a key escrow system like the
Clipper chip. "There was a lot of skepticism when HP first proposed it.  But
it looks to me that they are well on the way to the next step," says a
former encryption specialist at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology.  (Wall Street Journal 27 Sep 95 B7)
