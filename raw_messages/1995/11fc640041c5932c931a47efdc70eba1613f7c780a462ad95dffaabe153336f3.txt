All obscene things are censored on broadcast radio & TV.  
Massive penalties for broadcasting obscene material.

In the U. S., you have a first ammendment right to indencent speech.

The question of a late-night "safe harbor" for indecent speech on the
air is about when children are likely to be listening.  First
ammendment rights apparently don't apply to children who are listening
to the radio.  

Right now there is a "safe harbor" from around 10pm (or is it 9pm?)
thru 6am, but this changes regularly, usually as a result of "case law"
(someone being prosecuted under next month's rules, not this month's)
