	That's bullshit. Netscape can't control every user's entire
environment. It's Netscape's job to produce a secure product. If the
users of said product decide to shoot themselves in the foot by
configuring it insecurely that is there problem. It is in Netscape's
best interest to make it difficult to configure insecurely, but
impossible to prevent.
