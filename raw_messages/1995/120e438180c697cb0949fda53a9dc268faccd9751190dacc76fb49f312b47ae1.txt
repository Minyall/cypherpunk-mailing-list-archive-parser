The response does *not* need to be signed.  If you want rock solid
authentication which you can save for later use in court (e.g., buying an
airplane?), you might insist on a digital signature.  However, all you need
is for the path from the person who knows (AmEx's computer) to your cash
register to be trusted.  There are lots of ways to establish trust.

E.g., you could encrypt the path with a session key (triple-DES) chosen by
the cash register and sent at the beginning of the day to AmEx using AmEx's
public key.  Now anything coming back under that symmetric key is
effectively authenticated.

OBJECT IDs are by no means even a sensible way to achieve this end.  SMTP's
tags work very nicely, thank you, and they allow people to define their own
for private-joke extensions to the protocol.  (I did just that for e-mail
access to the TIS DRC.)
