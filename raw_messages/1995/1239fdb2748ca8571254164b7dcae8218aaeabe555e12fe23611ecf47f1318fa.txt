We are studying kerberos, the security system implemented by MIT's Athena network.
Has anyone started, considered, imagined or completed any similar security 
systems, preferably using public key cryptography (as opposed to a single 56-bit
DES key)?  

Please mail any responses to beckman@cs.hope.edu.
