I think your backup is a lot older than 2 days old, as a "who cypherpunks"
request showed this as my list address:

....
talon57@well.sf.ca.us
tcmay@netcom.com (Timothy C. May)
tentacle@hclb.demon.co.uk
....

I haven't been subscribed as "tcmay@netcom.com" since mid-June. Since
mid-June I've been subscribed as "tcmay@sensemedia.net".

Why did I get this message at my sensemedia.net address if in fact "who
cypherpunks" shows my subscription address is only at Netcom? Beats me. I
checked and I am not subscribed under both addresses, and a grep of the
"who cypherpunks" list doesn't show a sensemedia.net address for me. Maybe
the "who cypherpunks" at 16:21 today is a different backup list than the
supposedly 2-day old list.... Something for the X Files, perhaps.
