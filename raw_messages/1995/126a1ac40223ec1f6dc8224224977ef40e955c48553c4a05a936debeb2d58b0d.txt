But you miss the costs of your time.  You have to find the right
dumpster, you have to dive, you have to find the slip, you have to walk
across the street, you have to make the call.  Time, as they say, is
money.  For a criminal enterprise to make money, they have to not only
get the cards, but use them and then resell the goods for cash.  The
sheer size of a criminal organization that could handle the sort of
codebreaking we are talking about would make it possible to buy goods at
wholesale prices, so the profit on stealing goods and reselling them on
the open market is far less than the savings an individual gains by the
effort.  Then there is the potential cost of people getting caught, etc. 
that has to be figured into the overall cost.  Criminal enterprises have
high overheads.

It costs you 10-15 minutes of time, and it probably saves you a few
dollars of phone charges.  If the chance is only 1 in 100,000 of
getting caught and convicted to 5 years in prison, the amortised time
cost is another 25 minutes, not including legal fees.

But you still have to get the magic numbers.  Maybe it takes a bribe,
maybe it takes dumpster diving, but whatever the deal, it all costs
money in the form of time, overhead, etc.

The point of the parallel processor is that the cost is about $1.45 (or
whatever) per card number, not thousands of dollars.  The results are in
computer-ready form, so that you can charge directly over the Internet
and have a fully automatic system for theft.  No large number of
employees, no phone bills that get traced by the FBI, only an Internet
link that moves from provider to provider, account to account, city to
city, country to country.

It's true that breaking into computer systems is cheaper for small
numbers, but as a big business, the labor is too high for this sort
of attack, and the results are too unpredictable.  Taking credit card
nuymbers over the net is a lot more ammenable to the economies of scale
required for big codebreaking efforts.
