If I understand your usage of "anonym" correctly, I think you are clearly wrong.

An anonymous agent who has no persistence (no past history, no continuing
history, no expectation by others of future history) probably has no credit
rating, no "reputation."

However, an anonymous agent _with_ a persistent presence can have a credit
rating or reputation. Many examples of this, e.g., Pr0duct Cypher, Black
Unicorn, S. Boxx, and others.

The "linking with a unique person" is not especially important, IMO.
