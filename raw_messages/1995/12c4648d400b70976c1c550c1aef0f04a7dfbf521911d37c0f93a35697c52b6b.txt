That can't possibly be considered under U.S. law to apply to
foreigners talking to foreigners abroad, and if you are really a
lawyer you should know that the mere fact that the law doesn't mention
its jurisdiction doesn't make it unlimited. The statutes of New York
State say that I can be prosecuted for running a red light. No where
at all do they say that the red light must be in New York State, but I
suspect that it would be completely impossible for the NY State
attorney general to get any court, in New York State or elsewhere, to
hear a case that I violated New York law by running a light in
Turkmenistan.

Do you actually call yourself a lawyer?

You appear to be ignorant of the most basic facts of our legal system
-- knowledge that I, as a complete layman, am completely comfortable
with. I wouldn't pretend to be able to practice law, but even I can
smell utterly insane readings of the regulations.
