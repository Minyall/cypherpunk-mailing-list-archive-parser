What do you mean by "technically superior"?  What technical merits
does MOSS have over PGP?  It does have a better protocol with which to
integrate it into mailers, but it is only a transmission protocol, not
a security mechanism change.  Worse, MOSS uses X.509, which requires a
lot of overhead for certificates.

On the other hand, the MIME-PGP protocol can provide the same
integration functionality as MOSS and still allow the use of the
simple PGP certification structure that already exists.
