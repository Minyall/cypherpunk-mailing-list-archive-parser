Thanks for your info about _United Kingdom_.  In addition
to it, tell me please about _Japan_ info if you can.

P.S.
Now I am match interested in crypto-related info about the
US and Japan.  Few weeks ago, I read articles on a Japanese
computer-related biz mag.:

 (1) a software company has imported RSA's BSAFE toolkit,
 (2) the US gov. has eased ITAR reg. off at last month.

If you have more info or more exact info, please tell me.

Thanx.
