> demagnetizing pads they use at department stores and libraries

How exactly does that system work?  They can't instantly 
demagnetize something with a quick tap on a pad, can they? Also,
what are they demagnetizing?  Is it a strip embedded in the spine
of the book, or is it just in a sticker on the outside? For
instance, how do they do it to magazines (or do they? they
go through the process with magazines, too, or is that just
because they don't know better?)?
