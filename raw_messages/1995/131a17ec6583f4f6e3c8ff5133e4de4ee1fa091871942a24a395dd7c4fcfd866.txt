It is however a violation of the ITAR to disclose cryptographic
software (including algorithms) to students ona a J-1 visa, but not to 
someone who has a green card.

It is--if the ITAR is constitutional--a serious felony to give J-1
visa holders access to strong--and to weak--crypto, but no one has
implied that they are not entitled to use it.  Nothing in the law of
the United States says that foreign persons can't get crypto, it is
just a felony to disclose it to them (within or without the United
States).

: The laws about "showing a foreign national" certain items do not

The ITAR distinguishes between foreign persons, who are not U.S.
persons, and U.S. persons who are either United States citizens or
have a visa admitting them to permanent residency in the United
States.  The crime at issue is disclosing cryptographic software to
foreign persons.  And whether one is a foreign person does depend on 
what type of visa one has (if one is not a U.S. citizen).
