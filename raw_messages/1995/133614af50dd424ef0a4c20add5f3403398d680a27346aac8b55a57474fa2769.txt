	ATTENTION: The anonymous remailer operators at vishnu.alias.net
and spook,alias.net have decided to activate the reordering option on both
the Type-I (original cypherpunk) and Type-II (MixMaster). This means that
there will be at least 5 messages in the outbound queue and they will be
delivered randomly.
