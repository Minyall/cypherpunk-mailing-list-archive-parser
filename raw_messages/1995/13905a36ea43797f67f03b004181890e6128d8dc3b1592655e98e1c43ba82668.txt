Without commenting on the quality of anyone's contributions to this mailing
list, let me remind you that Dr. Fred Cohen received his Ph.D. after writing a
very innovative thesis on computer viruses, a classic in his field. He has
every right to call himself "Dr." if he wants to.

In my experience, people who get so hysterical when a Ph.D. calls himself or
herself Dr. are invariably Ph.D. dropouts who wasted many years of their lives
trying and failing to attain a Ph.D. and are bitterly envious of those who have
succeeded.
