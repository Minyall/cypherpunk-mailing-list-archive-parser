Umm.. To which keyring are you referring at MIT?  If you mean the ring
at ftp://toxicwaste.mit.edu/pub/keys, then that is because toxicwaste
is no longer the pgp.mit.edu keyserver.  The name pgp.mit.edu is now
pointing at another machine (which I do not maintain).  For access to
the keyring, send email to pgp-public-keys@pgp.mit.edu -- that is the
supported method of access.
