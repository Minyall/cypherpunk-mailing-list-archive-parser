This is elegant and great...

Why don't we add to the todo list the following:

Let's package up a number of the self-contained services, code, etc.
into a bundle that can be installed all at once (say on a Linux
system :-) ) and call it the 'CypherStation' release.

We can try to reach a concensus for standard service naming/access
methods and create a federation of these things.

It should have minimize bandwidth, minimize cpu, minimize storage
levels of service to allow different levels of users to have
different possible impact on the machine.  (Ie. : local, paying,
regional, unknown, domain, etc.)

I know that those of us running Internet services would devote
a little of our imaginary free time.

We could have a string to identify available services and versions:
CypherStation/.01/Serv:RTAmAh1.3  Where each service could have 
versions that differed from the release.

Just some raw thought.
