Usenet may be provide good untracability for the recipient, but the if the  
sender desires untracability she needs to use a remailer or some other  
service to get the message into Usenet.  Also, the recipient needs to know if  
and where to look for the message.  If the recipient isn't anticipating the  
receipt of a message untracably, or doesn't care if 'they' know she is  
receiving the message, then Usenet isn't necessary.
