The definition is not entirely up to "community standards". I think the
court definied it loosely as 'material regarding sexual and excretory
functions' which appeals to "prurient interests".

Anyhw, they have enough of a national "standard" for the FCC to crack
down on broadcasters who breach the rules.

Of course geographic community standards are problematic too with
telecommunications since postal inspectors from Tennessee can call
up adult bulletin boards in California...
