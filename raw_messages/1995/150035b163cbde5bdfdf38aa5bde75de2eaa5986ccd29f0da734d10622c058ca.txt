I favor a FAQ, but only if each individual answer is attributed to a
specific person and others can answer the same question with possibly
a contradictory answer (but may not refer to the others' answer, that
just makes it quoting and flaming).  Perhaps organized as a hypertext.
Everyone has an HTML browser now, right ?
