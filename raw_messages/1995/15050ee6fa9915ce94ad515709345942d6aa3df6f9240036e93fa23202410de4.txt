Talk about a self-answering question...How else could it be done?

I can think of only one problem with the idea,
it's called the Bill of Rights.
[If there is anything left of it after this session of Congress.]

Agreed. As well as steganographic software of many kinds
to hide this terrible "crime" we all love to commit, for
the peace loving among us...

BUT [and I hope this doesn't happen.]
I fear that the anarchy resulting from this kind of statist
idiocy will lead many (otherwise peaceful) folks to think that the
only good tool to fight this nonsense is a good shotgun. 
Of course, then we can simply outlaw those, too.
