I think you are referring to the so-called "exculpatory no" exception, 
which says that it is not a crime to say no on a government form when 
saying yes would admit a crime.

That exception has been given some validity in some Circuit Courts of 
Appeal, but not in the Sixth Circuit where I practice.  Perhaps others 
can comment on the Ninth Circuit, et al.  If the issue has made it to the 
Supreme Court, I'm unaware of it (although I'd almost certainly know if the 
doctrine was accepted by the Court and the Sixth Circuit therefore 
overruled...)

Morale:  It may still be important *where* you are, ahem, less than 
completely forthcoming.
