The main difficulty is that it is extremely hard to prove to yourself
that you are amplifying a quantum phenomenon and not deterministic
noise from the rest of the circuits in the machine or outside it. As
I've said repeatedly, its nearly impossible to get this wrong with a
radiation detecting mechanism, but its very very hard to get it right
with most common mechanisms.
