In Garfinkel's book, he talks about the risks of running PGP on a 
multiuser system where others (sys. admins, eg) have higher levels of 
authority than you do.  I have PGP installed on my pc and if I want to 
use it, I can save the message in ascii, then upload it to the server 
where I have my Internet account, then mail it.  maybe not entirely 
transparent, but at least it seems to me that the convenience of running 
it on the server with something like Mr. Wilcox's BAP is not worth the 
added risk.  Besides, how often do you need to use it?

Yes, it exists, and I'm using it now.  I've tried competing products and 
found this to be the cleanest, smoothest and easiest to install.  I have 
no personal, commercial or financial interest in this product.   It does 
"auto-pgp" for pine, elm and tin.
