	You're wrong.

	You can setup Procmail to detect if something is signed
	with PGP, and if it is, to run a script which determines
	the authenticity of the signature.  If the signature is
	not authentic, the message goes to /dev/null.  That way,
	even if Carol is using intercepted messages from Bob, Carol's
	messages won't be accepted or seen.
