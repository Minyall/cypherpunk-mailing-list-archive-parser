Bob:

  I was looking for a web site for Shawmut/Fleet Bank and could
not find one.  But I did come across this which I thought might
be of particular interest to you...

            http://www.llnl.gov/fstc/index.html

It is the Financial Services Technology Consortium (FSTC), which is a
consortium of financial services providers, national laboratories,
universities, and government agencies who sponsor and participate in
non-competitive collaborative research and development on interbank
technical projects.

Cheers,
Will
