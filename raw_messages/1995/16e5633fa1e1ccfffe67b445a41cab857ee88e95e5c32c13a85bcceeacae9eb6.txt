Thanks, I stand corrected.  As I said, I really don't understand at a 
basic level how it works.  These factoring projects are, to me, an 
interesting sociological experiment.  Of course, to do this correctly, 
you need software that is easy to use. :-)

So, the ability to run a program in such a fashion that as much is 
automated as possible is a "Good Thing{tm}".
