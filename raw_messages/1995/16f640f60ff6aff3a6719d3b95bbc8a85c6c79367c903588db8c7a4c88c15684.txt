The problem is there are still people and organizations that use 512-bit 
RSA keys.  The DOE recentedly awarded Intel a contract to build a 
computer with 9072 Pentium Pro processors.  I doubt that it will be used 
for factoring keys, but if it were, it will be able to factor a 512-bit 
number in a matter of months.

The boundary delimiting "truly large" problems and merely extremely 
expensive ones inches up all the time.  Less than a decade ago people 
thought factoring RSA-129 was a "truly large" problem.
