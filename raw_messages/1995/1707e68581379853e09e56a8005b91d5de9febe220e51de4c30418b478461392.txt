There was a fairly large article about this in Helsingin Sanomat, the
largest newspaper in Finland, some weeks ago.  It was quoted as being
originally from the New York Times.  (I have the clip saved at home
and can check the date if anyone is interested.)

I do find it rather shocking that the most powerful country in the
world sets industrial espionage as the primary task of their
intelligence services.

Now talking about those crypto restrictions worldwide and the real
reasons why the United States is driving them...
