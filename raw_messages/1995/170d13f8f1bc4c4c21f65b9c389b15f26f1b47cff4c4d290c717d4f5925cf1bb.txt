You wouldn't happen to have gcc under DOS would you?

Or anyone else with djgcc for DOS?

What would be really nice would be a 32 bit DOS executable, which is
very hard to obtain with any PC software, and compiling it 16 bit
suffers a huge performance hit.

In search of a 32 bit DOS binary,
