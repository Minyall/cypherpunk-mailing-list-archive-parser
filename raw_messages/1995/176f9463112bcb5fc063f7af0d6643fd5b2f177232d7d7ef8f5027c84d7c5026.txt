What crypto functions are considered modern and usable?  The list I have
right now is:

RSA
IDEA
DES
3DES
RC4
RC5
BLOWFISH
MD4
MD5

(and FLAMINGO, a trivial test case, which consists of xor'ing every 8 chars
 with "flamingo".)

Pointers to code for any other schemes will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

	-- Todd
