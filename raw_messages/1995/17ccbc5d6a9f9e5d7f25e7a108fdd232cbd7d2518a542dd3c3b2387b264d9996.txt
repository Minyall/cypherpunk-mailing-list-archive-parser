I may be a bit behind the times, but I have a question
about the "ban crypto-anarchy" legislation as well as
the Exon amendment:

Isn't legislation in this country supposed to start in the
House and _then_ move to the Senate for approval?

Why are all of these bills going in the opposite direction?
