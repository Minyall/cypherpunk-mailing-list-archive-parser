What prices have you got listed? Is the equipment sensitive enough to get 
lots of entropy from a normal environment or do you need artificial sources
of radioactivity? (easy, safe and cheap enough to get?)
Got any clues on random bits vs. time?

Someone said this was discussed before, I caught the thread on the 
detector being listed but not any discussion of the product itself. Could 
anyone post an approx date so I could go look it up on the archive?
Gracias.
Interesting stuff.
