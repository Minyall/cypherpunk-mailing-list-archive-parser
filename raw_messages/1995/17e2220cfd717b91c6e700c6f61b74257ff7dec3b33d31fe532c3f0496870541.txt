Perry and members of this list,

I want to publicly apologize to Mr. Metzger. On reviewing the events of the
day, it seems that I misunderstood a post by Perry. It seems that I was 
missing a previous post that was being referenced. As to the 
misunderstood message, I have to now agree with Perry and his reponse.

Please accept this apology.

Dan
