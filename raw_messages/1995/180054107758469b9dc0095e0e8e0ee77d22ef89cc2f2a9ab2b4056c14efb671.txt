Long for the good old days of bang-paths, 300 baud acoustic couplers
and UUCP maps?  see http://www.lne.com/lemay/writings/curmudgeonnet.html

Close.

Where we're headed is mail filters with PGP imbedded (PGP 3 will
make this much easier) that check incoming mail for a valid signature
for certain PGP keyid/fingerprints and pass that mail along.
Other mail that doesn't match gets tossed into a 'junk' folder
or thrown away if you really don't want to talk to anyone that you
don't already know.
