The article failes to point out that this system - actually one much 
larger in scope already exists as Treasury's FINCEN system, headed by a 
former Army AI expert. FINCEN sifts all the bank transfer manifests and, 
last I looked, had stuck tentacles into other agency's databases to 
further collate and refine its focus - now toward locating potential 
targets.  FINCEN was only supposed to be marshalled for Justice 
Department investigations of suspected money laundering. Next, it'll be 
used to auto-author warrants and indictments. . .
