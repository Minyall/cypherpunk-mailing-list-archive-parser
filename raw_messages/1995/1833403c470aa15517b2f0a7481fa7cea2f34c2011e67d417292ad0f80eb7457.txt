If you don't care then why are you flaming me, instead 
of deleting all the posts which I have clearly labeled 
as being what they are.

As to why it is vast and voluminous pile of shit, the 
answer is because unix is a vast and voluminous,
and I was flamed for failing to to give examples 
of how unix is user hostile.

Any report on the defects of unix is necessarily lengthy.

I would send off a letter, and get back to work, then 
immediately unix would bite me again, and I would jump
in and send off another letter.  The letters kept coming
because unix kept biting me.

If I had been working on my PC, which refrains from wantonly
destroying files and presents the most used options near
the top of menus, etc, I would have peaceably ignored
this whole silly issue.  Indeed I would not have been able
to think of a single concrete example of unix user hostility.
