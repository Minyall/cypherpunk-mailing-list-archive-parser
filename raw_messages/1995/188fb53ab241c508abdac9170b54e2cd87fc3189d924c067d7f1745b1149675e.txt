Yeah, it probably is. Then again you can probably use a dummy
description, no?

However, that doesn't get around the fact that anyone intercepting
the packet who knows where it came from will immediately see straight
through payer anonymity.

A Source Close To Digicash That Did Not Wish To Be Quoted
once described them as 'crown jewels' (competitive advantage).

ASCTDTDNWTBQ then appealed to Digicash's track record.

I certainly hope that this genuinely is not Digicash's official opinion.


Thank you for once again showing the futility of security by obscurity.
