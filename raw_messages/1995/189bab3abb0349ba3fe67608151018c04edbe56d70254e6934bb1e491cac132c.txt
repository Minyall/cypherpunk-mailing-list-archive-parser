Yes.  Unless it could be shown there their was an expactation of privacy 
in the transfer, or that there was an understanding that you intended this 
to be a confidential matter.  Or in the alternative, that the 
relationship between you and the third party is suggestive of such a 
confidence on its face.  Remember this is a ex post ruling.  The police 
will just come in and take the information, you have to fight it AFTER 
the fact.  It sounds fine in e-mail to ask the question "How will they 
get in" but in real life it becomes a much less realistic proposition.

Yes.  I have seen holdings which indicate that information given to an 
employer, where there was no obvious expection that it be kept 
confidential, estopped 4th amendment protections to its introduction when 
obtained without a warrant.

Hardly.  See above.  It hinges on the nature of the relationship and how 
it bears on the expectation of privacy.  The supreme court has ruled that 
the relationship with the phone company does not meet such a standard, 
and one can assume ISP's apply the same way.  I could go on spilling out 
holdings if there is enough interest.

Again, because of the nature of the relationship.  There is an 
expectation that a conversation with an attorney is one of the most 
private exchanges you can engage in.  As for rare exceptions, I'm not so 
sure I would term them rare.

It essentially prevents you from claiming you really had a demonstrated 
privacy interest in it, unless there are other circumstances to indicate 
such an interest.  Think of the court as saying "How the hell is this 
private if you told maggy and fred?"

I don't know where you came up with the lawyer example.  I don't know 
that anyone was claiming that one could break the attorney client trust 
on this basis.  However, I think, as a tangential matter, a court will 
examine very closely a claim that keys protected by such a trust can not 
be used as evidence.  To hold this so broadly would be to tell the 
criminal he merely needs to give the weapon used in a crime to his 
attorney to prevent its introduction.

You also need to make a distinction between a 4th amendment matter (which 
is the issue at hand) and the seperate and distinct protection of the 
attorney client relationship.
