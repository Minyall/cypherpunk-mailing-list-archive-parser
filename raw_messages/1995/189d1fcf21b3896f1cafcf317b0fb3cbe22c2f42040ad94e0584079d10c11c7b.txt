Well, since we already require 56-bit DES in ESP in the interests of
promoting basic interoperability, wouldn't a 512-bit prime be
similarly sufficient?

Again, I'm *not* going to recommend that people use it, only provide it
for those who simply cannot use larger moduli for whatever reason (export
controls or CPU limits).
