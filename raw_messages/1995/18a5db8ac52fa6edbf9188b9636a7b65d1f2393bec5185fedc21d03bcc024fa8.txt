        I wanted to oh so thankfully thank all 15 of you who so calmly and
straightforwardly set me straight on this subject. I must apologize for my
dire misdeed in presenting this to the list. Maybe you could all form a
lynch mob, come on down to good ole Tennessee and beat this poor ignorant
Hillbilly to death, hang him from a tree, and burn a few crosses while your
at it.


         READ: Rude.

         Thank you.
