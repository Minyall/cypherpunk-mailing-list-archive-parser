Common, Ray!  floor(sqrt(p))! would work fine....  ;-)  Seriously, at 
least 1/4 of the numbers between can p and 0 prove that p is prime.  So you 
try for a while.  If you don't get it, you can flip back.

I apologize for being so vague.  I don't have the paper I read a couple 
years ago in front of me.  You might contact your local math department & 
ask...
