Well, if you can run CGI scripts, it's very easy: you simply check
the USER_AGENT field, and then send different versions. For an

	http://www.cs.monash.edu.au/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/~jirib/no-Mozz

You can make the script more or less drastic according to taste.


Can't *anyone* write a simple shell script any more?
