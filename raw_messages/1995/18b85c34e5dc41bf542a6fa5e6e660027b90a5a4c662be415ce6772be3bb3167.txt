Hi.  PGP 2.6.2 compiles out-of-the-box on Linux.  In fact, Linux is my
personal development platform at home, so I make sure that it works.
Just "make" in rsaref/install/unix, and then "make linux" in src.

If you are in the US or Canada, you can get PGP 2.6.2 from MIT.  Here
are the instructions:

The file ftp://net-dist.mit.edu/pub/PGP/README contains instructions
on how to download PGP 2.6.2.  Included therein are Binaries for DOS
and Mac, and the sources for DOS, Unix and Mac.  To read these files
you should log in with username anonymous and use your email address
as the password.

Alternatively, you can use the WWW interface to get to these packages.
Just connect to the PGP-form web page and follow the instructions:
