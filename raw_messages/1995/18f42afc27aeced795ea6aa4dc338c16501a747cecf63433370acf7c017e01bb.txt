It has come to Our attention that Our FAQ, the Da Judge-L FAQ, is being
distributed amongst the rabble.

We are not amused.

The so-called Cypherpunks List, having been a party to this illegal
and "most heinous" distribution, is hereby invited to appear in our
Chambers on the morning of Tuesday, 29 February, 1995, at a place of
our choosing. Defense will be heard, and then the guilty will be
punished.

Royally Yours, 

Da Judge-L
