We received the transcript of October 20's oral hearing from the court
stenographer.  It's up on the EFF Web site at:

http://www.eff.org/pub/Legal/Cases/Bernstein_v_DoS/Legal/951020_hearing.transcript

This is from Dan Bernstein's case, which is trying to get the crypto
export laws invalidated as unconstitutional.  This particular hearing
is about the government's motion to throw the case out of court
because the courts don't have jurisdiction to decide the issue.  Some
of it is deep legalese, and some of it is quite readable.

There's still no news from the judge on what her decision is, or when
she will decide.
