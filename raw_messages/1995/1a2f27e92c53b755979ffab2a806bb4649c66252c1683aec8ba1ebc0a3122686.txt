US News of January 23 has a cover story on "policing cybersapce", another
drumbeat about "the growing threats to your privacy and property in the
information age." 
 
Not much new for this group except to enjoy another Spielberg gremlin of
Jekyll and Hyde cryptography, fearful remailers, slippery digicash, stolen
services and personal data, smuggling, terrorism, child pornography,
Tennessee BBS, "cybercops" and such. 
 
Featuring the FBI's Kallstrom and Tafoya and FLETC and Financial Fraud
Institute and Clipper and protective wiretaps, with supporting roles for
Kevin Mitnick, Bruce Schneier, Mike Godwin, Marc Rotenberg, John Perry
Barlow, Esther Dyson, Robert Corn-Revere. 
 
And, a cartoon on how to teach parents fear of the Net for their children. 
 
Cypherpunk is not sited, I think, or is it steganoed?.
