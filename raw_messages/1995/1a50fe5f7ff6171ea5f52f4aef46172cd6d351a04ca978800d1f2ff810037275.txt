      And you've just proven yourself to be "a little bit slow";
hypocrites, at least, can change their ways. This discussion is about the
effects that Jim Clark, someone who is assessed as a billionaire and who
heads a Wall St.-bedazzling multibillion-dollar corporation, can have on
USG crypto policy; yet you would get into a tawdry comparison of "personal
failings." I will continue not to trumpet the specifics of any
crypto-promoting illegalities which I may or may not have engaged in, and
I'll thank you to do the same.

      BU was right: there's gotta be a self-help book called something
like "Learning to Say YES!" that would provide you with a more appropriate
.sig.
