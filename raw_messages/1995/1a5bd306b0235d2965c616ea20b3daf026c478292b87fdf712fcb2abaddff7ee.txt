i'd be happy to get forwarded the skirmishes around my existence. Anybody
save them?

i'm not on the list because i'm writing 2 books, but i have root in the
solar system, true, and i did come up with the name cypherpunk one morning
as i was washing my cat... hit me like a meteorite... cypherpunk... yes...

mumble
