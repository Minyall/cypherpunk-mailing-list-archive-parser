That's where somebody, e.g. Microsoft or the Church of Scientology, gets 
US Federal Marshals to seize your computer.

Article <46j4t6$6od@newsbf02.news.aol.com> in alt.religion.scientology is 
a good article by Adam S. Bauman of the Los Angeles Times. You might find 
it interesting, but not quite relevant enough to post the whole thing 
here.
