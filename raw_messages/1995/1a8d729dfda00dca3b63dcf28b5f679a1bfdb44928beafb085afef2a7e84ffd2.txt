Ray;

This is evidence that, as I said, they have plenty of buffer overflow
bugs. So much for the protestations to the contrary.

My suspicion is that if you used a customized HTTPd that allowed you
to shove arbitrary data into your URL, you could get the victim's copy
of netscape to fandango on the stack and do nicely arbitrary things to
the victim -- like executing "cd ~/; rm -rf ."

A "Hack Netscape" T-Shirt for the first person (Ray, here is your
chance!) to find an exploit using this! Though your demo shouldn't do
anything bad. Does everyone think Ray should get a shirt no matter what?
