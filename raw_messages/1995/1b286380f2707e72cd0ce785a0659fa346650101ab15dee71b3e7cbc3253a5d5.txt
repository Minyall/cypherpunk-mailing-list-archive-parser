The problem here is that it is probablistic when they are 
going to be able to unlock it.  If the search space will take a
total of 10 years to exhaustively search, there is a 50% chance
that they will find the key within 5 years, 10% chance that it
will be found in 1 year, etc.  So, if you are lucky, it will
be found in about the time you want it to be.  If you aren't it
will be found in a few milli-seconds.

There is also the problem that your intended recipeient will
need to expend just as much work as your advesary to decrypt
the message.  This might not be a disadvantage in the case of 
a "broadcast" message, but otherwise it might be.

Good idea - but I would say not pratical....
Now, if we just had an objects between 1 and 10 light years away 
that you could bounce lasers off of...... ;-)
