My $0.02 on the 'strict security' on Schiphol (first one to cash in 
gets it) based upon personal experience:

American airlines (Northwest, United) have very strict security when 
departing from Schiphol. Interviews, men with rifles, queries on who 
packed your luggae, etc. But all the crap I drag around (200+ kilo's of 
exhibition equipment full of custom built hardware, large batteries, 
transformers etc) has never been opened.

However, you should try flying a different airline: KLM, Lufthansa, etc.
No interviews, no guns, just friendly people.
