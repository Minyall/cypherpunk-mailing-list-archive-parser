Usually the Economist does take pains to get their facts right, and to 
print corrections if errors are reported. Recently they have been making 
a few more mistakes than they used to in their net coverage (most amusing 
mistake was making John Curran CTO of BBN instead of BBN Planet). 

They did come to the right conclusion on the payment standards issue, so 
they do deserve at least a B-.
