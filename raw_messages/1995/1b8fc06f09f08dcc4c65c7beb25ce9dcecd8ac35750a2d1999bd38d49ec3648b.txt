Agreed.

We very much need a command line interface to S/MIME, to use in remailers
and also for other kinds of testing/hacking. I hope one is forthcoming
soon.

Raph does indeed have some input on the matter. I am currently rewriting
premail from the ground up, and am about 700 lines into it. One specific
design goal was the support of other types of encryption, including
Mixmaster and MOSS in the first release, and hopefully others as well.
Basically, I'm waiting on a command line S/MIME implementation as
described above, most hopefully as free software.

In any case, the new premail is _much_ more modular, so plugging in
experimental email stuff should be pretty straightforward.
