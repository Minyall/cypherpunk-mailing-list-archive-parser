I hope this is not extremely already know,... but, seeing on the list
a sig with someone claiming to have the 'last' prime, I played a bit
this nite and searched for the *first* alphabetically sorted prime
(once written as spelled, sorted like with unix's sort)
dependending on the language :

Easiest: English : 11 : eleven
A bit more fun : German : 811 (dunno how to write it, but it starts
with an "a")
Exotic one : slovenian: 10019 desettisocdevetnajst

And..... the tricky one, which I hope is the good one (challenge: find
one 'before') :
French (and possibly spanish/italian,...too) : 105 105 000 105 167
(it spells cent cinq mille cent cinq milliards cent cinq mille cent
soixante sept) [note that 'billion' is not used for numbers in common
language, and that soixante-dix has a - and not a space :-) ]

More languages ? better results anyone :-) ?

Regards

ps: I used gnu MP lib for my hack when I hit the 2^32 limit, but it's
rather slow... (ok, its prolly due to my lasy prime algo too, but...)
is there some well-known fast mp lib to play around with primes ?
(should I look and extract PGP's ?)
