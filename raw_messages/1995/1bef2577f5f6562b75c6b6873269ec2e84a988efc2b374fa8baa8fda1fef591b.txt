  My question is, how portable is it, and does it work over TCP/IP rather
than just modem connections (I suggested this about a year ago)? My ideal
implementation would function on the following architectures:

Unix: can be used through either /dev/tty?? or Socket (probably want
to use UDP). Works on Solaris, IRIX, AIX, NetBSD/FreeBSD/BSDI and Linux.
(audio devices are all proprietary)


Windows: uses Window's sound card device drivers, works via either 
comport or WinSock 

Mac: uses Mac sound drivers, uses Mac modem port or MacTCP

I'm looking for someting that has the look and feel of Internet Phone
(but ported to multiple platforms) with encryption.
