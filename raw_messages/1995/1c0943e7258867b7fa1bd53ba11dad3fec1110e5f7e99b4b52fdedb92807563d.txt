Two other possibilities: (1) It's merely an independently produced 
cryptosystem disguised as a "leak" to save its creator the trouble of 
asking experts to analyze it for him/her.  (2) It's a misleading / 
intentionally "wrong" version of something, "leaked" by a government 
official of whatever ilk to precipitate a legal investigation of 
Cypherpunks, remailers, etc.  (ie to show a judge to get wiretaps, etc.)

I'm skeptical of (2), but it occured to me, and one can't be too safe...
