UDP won't get through most firewalls.

Build in support for non-transparent firewalls (ie: telnet gatekeeper,
c sys port).

Handle getting access to skronked protocols by using the standard telnet
port and logging in as 'skronk' to get access to a service multiplexer.

Just some suggestions to deal with realities of availability.
