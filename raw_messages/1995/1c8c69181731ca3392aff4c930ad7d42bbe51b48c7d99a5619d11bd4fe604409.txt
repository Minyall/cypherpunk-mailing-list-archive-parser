I have not used it for this purpose, but ssh claims to do "Secure X11
sessions."  

Actually, I'm interested in what the cypherpunks think of ssh in
general; I'm not able to do a strong analysis of the code myself.  If
it does everything it claims to do, it's a very powerful tool;
however, I don't know of any in-depth studies of ssh security.
