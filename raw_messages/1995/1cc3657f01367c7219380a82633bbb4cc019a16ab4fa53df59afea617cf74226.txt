If Jeff decided to leave, I don't think he'd have much trouble 
getting something else - I'd be surprised if he wasn't employed the 
next day.

Of course, if Jeff's got any stock in Netscape, he'd be nuts to leave 
- unless he values his principles more than he values his stock.  No 
insult intended.
