  I've heard that when a machine that already has Internet In A
Box, Netscape Navigator personal edition, or some other internet
software with a stack and dialer is upgraded to Win95, the win95
installation may somehow disrupt the functioning of the winsock
or dialer.  I've also heard that re-installing the application
will solve the problem.  I've never seen the problem myself,
and don't know anything about any subpoena...
