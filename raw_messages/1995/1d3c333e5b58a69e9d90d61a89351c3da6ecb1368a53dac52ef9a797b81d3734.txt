I don't think that was a smart thing to do. Your real email is now 
registered in some database in Finland - how difficult would it be to 
retrieve it? From what I remember organizations like Scientology had no 
problem getting real emails from anon.penet.fi when they reported that 
anXXXXXX was causing trouble... couldn't the same be done for your account?
If that single system becomes compromised one day all the accounts could be 
posted on some web page somewhere and it would be a simple matter of 
looking you up! Signing your message with PGP and using Mixmaster would 
give yourself an identity while still keeping you anonymous.
