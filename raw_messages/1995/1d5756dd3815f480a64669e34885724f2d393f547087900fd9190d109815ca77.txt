    But looking at the ftp sites, I do see the 20b1J for SunOs4.1.3.
    Yey!

Actually it says 4.1.3_U1.  Does anyone know (a) what's the U1 mean
and (b) if, as I assume, it is an upgrade which the local powers that
be have decided against adopting, should I have any expectation of
this binary working under an older, non-upgraded, 4.1.3?
