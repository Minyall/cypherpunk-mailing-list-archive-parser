I am not saying it is so I am just speculating

Windows ?

Microcode of big host systems like the one from IBM?

Each mainframe comes with a line attached. Customer
typically don't have the faintest idea what is going on 
that line. I know one customer who stuck a printer 
there and though - now we will see ... well he ended
up with printouts he did not have the faintest idea
of their context.

Now does anyone has real evidence of possible
backdoors?
