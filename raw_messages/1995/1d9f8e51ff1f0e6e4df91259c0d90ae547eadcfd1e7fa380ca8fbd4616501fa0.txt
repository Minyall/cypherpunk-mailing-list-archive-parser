The probability of getting an ACK back is indeed small :-((

yes -- this is why all the WWW pages and my messages to cypherpunks say
"please get the latest code" ...

I fear so :-((

Whew !

brclient 0.13 is now out to try to track down the problem which is causing the
comgestion ...

It seems that old brloop's keep calling the server, and sending HELO, COMM and
then QUIT (Greet, Introduce, Part) i.e. not actually do anything :-(
[ Some only manage "HELO" or "HELO COMM" ]

These systems are hammering the server, and I suspect are the cause of the
congestion. I have added more logging to brclient 0.13, and it has caused the
problem to disappear ...
