So much for guaranteed security. There is one question on my mind. Why do
today's programs have to try to do it all? Why the heck does a
wordprocessor have to ship with a compiler built in? Not to mention that
there seems to be a disturbing tendency to "feature" automatic execution
of arbitrary code submitted by third parties.
