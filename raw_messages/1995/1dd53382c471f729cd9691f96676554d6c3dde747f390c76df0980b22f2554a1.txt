Yet Another Alarmist TV Show About Child Molesters on the Net:

During their coverage of an NFL game on Sunday, the Fox announcers plugged
an upcoming episode (sometime this week) of _New York Undercover_. They
used a depressing line like "Think the Net is a safe place to play ?  Think
again !"  Apparently the show will portray a child molester luring kids via
the Net, etc., etc. "In a story pulled straight from today's headlines !"

Anyway, the mainstream media trashing of the Net continues. Check your local
listings.
