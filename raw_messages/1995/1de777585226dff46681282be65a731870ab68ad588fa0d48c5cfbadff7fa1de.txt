No -- If you ask for 2 segments, then when you are 50% done, it is OK to ACK 
the *FIRST* segment.

I thought of that, but:
1) for the same server load, it doubles the number of unACKed segments
2) if process A is lagging process B, then when process B finishes and is idle
   waiting for the server, process A will run faster and thus reduce the lag.
   This will make the processes drift into phase.
   I'm not convinced one way or the other.
