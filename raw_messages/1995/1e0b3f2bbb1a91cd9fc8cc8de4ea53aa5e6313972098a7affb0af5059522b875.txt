  Why did I know you would be showing up in this discussion?  You
wouldn't be related to alice de 'nonymous would you?

  I don't believe that Netscape claims to be some magic bullet that
will suddenly make your system secure when you install it.  We also
don't claim that it will detect viruses.

  Dont you think we've wasted enough bandwidth on this?  I'm sure
most readers of this list are sick of it by now.
