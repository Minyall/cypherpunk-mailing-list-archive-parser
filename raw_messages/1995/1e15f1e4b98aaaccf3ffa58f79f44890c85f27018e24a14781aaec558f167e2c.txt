If you can read Russian, you can read pornography on soc.culture.russian. :)

I too fail to see the cryptorelevance of this thread... Unless alt.sex.stories
is used for steganography... Alice wants to send a secret message to Bob, so
she posts a porn story to alt.sex.stories, where the key phrase is "That was
the best sex I've ever had", which sounds like a mild hyperbole to most people;
only Bob knows that it really means "the bomb is scheduled to detonate at
midnight." But what's it got to do with writing code??? :) :)
