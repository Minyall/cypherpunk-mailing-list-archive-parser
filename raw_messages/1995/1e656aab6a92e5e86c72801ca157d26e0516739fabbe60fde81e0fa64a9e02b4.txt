Given the enormous difficulty of ensuring security in a world of
ubiquitous distributed computing, I'm as big a fan as any of formal
methods. But Tim's post hammers home the big fault of formal methods:
the possibility that people will come to rely upon them. I have
paranoid visions of people finally accepting formal methods in a decade
or so, and then becoming dependent on them... forgeting the enormous
potential for error that will always exist in such systems.

If somebody told me that intentionally letting a few violent criminals
free each year is a good idea because it would keep me on my toes, I
would think that person is an idiot. But I'm not entirely convinced that
it is a bad idea to avoid formal methods because they could breed
complacency.
