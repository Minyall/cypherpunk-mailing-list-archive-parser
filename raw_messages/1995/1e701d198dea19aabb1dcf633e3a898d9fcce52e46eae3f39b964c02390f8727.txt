There has been a lot of debate about setting up of annonymous Web proxies. There 
are many thousand already deployed. Any Web proxy which does not keep logs is 
effectively an annonymous Web proxy.

Just download the CERN server and run it.

The point about monitoring such sites is an apt one. Iwork under the assumption 
that I am monitored because if I was a spook I would be monitoring me. Most of 
the discoveries of security holes arrive at my door sooner rather than later. I 
would have monitored the communist party for the same reason, it was one of the 
the most obvious place for the soviets to attempt infiltration, the other being 
the authoritarian establishment right.
