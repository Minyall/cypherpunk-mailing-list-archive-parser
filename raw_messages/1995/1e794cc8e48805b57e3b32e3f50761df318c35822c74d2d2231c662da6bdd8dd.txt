  Phill Hallam-Baker summarized it best. I advise anyone interested in this
issue to read up on pancritical rationalism (a favorite extropian topic of
debate). "The Retreat to Commitement" by Bartley (?, sorry, can't recall
at the moment, the book is not with me) is a good writeup of the subject.
At the lowest level, even the basic axioms can be cricitized.
