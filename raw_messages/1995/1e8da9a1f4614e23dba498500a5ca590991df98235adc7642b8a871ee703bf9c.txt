  If the law requires GAK, then I believe that we will implement it rather
than just disable encryption.  We are taking a position against GAK and
will continue to lobby against it.  We are planning to continue to do both
US and Export versions, so I don't think that the government's ploy of
trying to lure companies into weakening their domestic versions will work.
We released a 128-bit version of our product almost a year ago, at a
time when many companies were providing only weak crypto in their domestic
products so that they didn't have to trouble themselves with two versions.
We are actively lobbying in washington to get clarification of the
current regulations so that we can provide the US version via an "export
controlled" FTP or HTTP download.
