Does anyone know the ostensible justification for this?  What section of
the ITARs do they point to when they say "this is illegal"?  I've perused
an online copy of ITAR (no, I haven't read all of it -- I have other
things I want to do this year :-), but I can't find a section that could
be construed to support this contention.
