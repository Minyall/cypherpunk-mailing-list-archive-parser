This becomes highly speculative.

My inclination is to say that it would hinge on the conditions under 
which you tendered the key to the legal department of your employer.  
This is a question of law, and would probably depend as much on the judge 
as on the circumstances.  Remember, 4th amendment rulings AGAINST the 
prosecution are very tough for a judge to make, because they usually mean 
excluding evidence key to the prosecution's case, and most often they 
arise in circumstances where the defendant looks guilty as sin.
