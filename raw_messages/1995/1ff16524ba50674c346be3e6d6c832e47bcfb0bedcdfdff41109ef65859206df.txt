I think that a press release would be hard, based on the fact that there
is no central organization here on the cypherpunks list. I know that in
times past, Eric Hughes has been quoted in the press, as well as Tim, and
perhaps others (forgive my lack of memory), but there is no approved 
spokesperson because there is no organization.

Does anyone know exactly how the press contact thing works? My impression
is that a reporter/journalist stumbles on to someone who knows something 
about a particular area, and is willing to be interviewed. Then the next
time a story comes along that deals even slightly with that subject, the
reporter will tend to contact that person.
