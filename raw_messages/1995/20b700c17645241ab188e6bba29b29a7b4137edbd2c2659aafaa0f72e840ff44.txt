According to a squib in the local tabloid:  Clinton has approved a plan to
ease export restrictions on the sale of supercomputers.  The decision is
expected to be announced today; it follows DoD recommendations.  The
wording is funky enough to be interpreted a couple of ways, so here's a
quote:  "Under the revised policy, U.S.firms will be able to sell billions
of dollars worth of high-tech computers to civilian customers around the
world.  Currently manufacturers must seek licenses from the Commerce Dept.
to sell a computer that can perform more than 1,500 million theoretical
operations per second."  Does that mean no more licenses, the mFLOP limit
has been raised before license required, there is no limit but you still
need a license?

Answers today/tomorrow when the policy comes out, I guess.
