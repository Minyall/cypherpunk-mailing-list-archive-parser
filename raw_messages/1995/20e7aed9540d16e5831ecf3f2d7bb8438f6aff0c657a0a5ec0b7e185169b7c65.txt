Hey, guys!

I need to get MBONE access in New York City or nearby this weekend in
order to deliver a presentation for the Cypherpunks meeting this
Saturday on IPSP. If anyone in New York can provide such access,
please get in touch with me ASAP; the site that I thought I could use
has sadly become unavailable...
