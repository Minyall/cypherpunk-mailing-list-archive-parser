Indeed. Who now recalls Jaron Lanier's virtual reality company?

(In retrospect, Jaron's error was in not finding a way to take VPL public.
VPL was the Netscape of 1990. But will Netscape be the VPL of 1992?)

Let the record show that I was not one of the tens of thousands of people
calling their brokers trying to get in on the Netscape IPO. (Though getting
in at the IPO price and selling out the same day was obviously lucrative
for a lot of folks.)

Special note: My ISP has changed its domain name from "sensemedia.net" to
"got.net" (as in "got milk?"), so I have to again ask you all to bear with
me and use my new e-mail address, "tcmay@got.net".
