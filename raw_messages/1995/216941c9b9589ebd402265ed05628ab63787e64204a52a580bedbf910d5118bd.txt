Ah yes, but the vagarities of crypto don't lend themselves to real-world 
analogies so easily. With crypto schemes, if you use double-encryption, 
you effectively halve the amount of time needed to crack them. This is 
because of the "man in the middle attack." Schneier talks about it in 
Applied Crypto, and I am sure others on this list know the technical 
details better than I.

What Schneier says has been proven to be secure is, instead, a triple 
encryption scheme. Using two different keys, it goes something like this 
(if memory serves):

	Cipertext = P1xorEK1 -> C1xorDK1 -> C2xorEK1

Where P1 is the plaintext, EK1 is encrypt key 1, and DK1 is decrypt key 1.

That doesn't look right the longer I consider it, but the basic idea is 
there. Encrypt, decrypt, then encrypt again.
