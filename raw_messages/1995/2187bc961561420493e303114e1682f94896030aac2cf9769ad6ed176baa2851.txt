You would have to collect quite a few cancels just to get one pair of valid  
hashes for a message you want to cancel...  You don't even need to collect  
cancels from control; you could just start hashing 128-bit strings until you  
got one that hashed to M2.  The catch is you would have to hash on the order  
of 2^64 strings for MD5, for instance.  That's a lot of hashing to cancel one  
article...  It's likely going to be much less work to try to guess the  
passphrase used to generate M1.  There is also a better than average chance  
that the target used the same passphrase to lock multiple posts...
