In a german weekly news magazine (Focus 34/1995, p. 178-181) I read an
article about industrial espionage. It is said that the secret
services have lost their main task when the east/west cold war had
gone. Their new task is the industrial espionage. The russian, french,
and american services were referenced in the article.

It was said that Pres. Clinton had given a speech while visiting the
CIA HQ in Langley/Virginia. He allegedly said in this speech that obtaining
industrial informations has the highest priority and this were the new
task for the spies.

Can anyone confirm the quotation?
