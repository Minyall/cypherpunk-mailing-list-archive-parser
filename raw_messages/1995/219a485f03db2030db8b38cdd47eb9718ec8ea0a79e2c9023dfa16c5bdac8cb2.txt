	Go read the GNU license.  Nothing prevents selling the programs, 
nothing prevents selling modifications of the programs.  The major 
restraint is that you have to provide source.  Now, from what I read of 
the page, that is being done.

	Personally, I would prefer to see the whole thing given away, and if I
had done it, it would be.  But he (or his contractors / employees ) did
the work that went into modifying it, and if he want's to sell that
work he bloody well can.
