I have an old, forgotten PGP key for which I would like to issue a
revocation certificate (or maybe I stole somebody else's with an identical
name; who could tell?). I can put the key on a Mac, PC, or UNIX machine
(various flavors). I think I have a pretty good idea what the middle of
the passphrase contains, so I'd guess there are only about 2,000
possibilities to be explored. 

Anybody have code for any platform for cracking this? Alternatively, I
could just give you the key and wait for the answer.
