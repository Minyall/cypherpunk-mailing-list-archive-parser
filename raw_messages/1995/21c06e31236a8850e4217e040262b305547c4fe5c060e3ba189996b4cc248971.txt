Does this mean that a Linux version of Netscape will no longer be 
available, or that it *will* be available but unsupported?

That all depends on what you mean by "support".  If you mean "we will no 
longer make Netscape available for the Linux platform", that's not 
support.  If you mean "we will no longer respond to bug reports for 
Netscape on this platform" then that's discontinuing support.

Please be more specific in your postings?

As a project manager and developer, I have constructed many a business 
case for the development and/or support for products - such a case could 
easily be made for Linux support for Netscape, irrespective of what you 
mean by "support".
