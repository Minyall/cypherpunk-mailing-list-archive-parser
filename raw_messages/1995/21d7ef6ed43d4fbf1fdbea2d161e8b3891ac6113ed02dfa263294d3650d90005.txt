Not a real attack- cos it's just a Denial Of Service, but it is kind of 
amusing... 

Windows NT has an interesting property in its handling of TCP connection 
establishment. NT has a small limit on the maximum size of its listen 
queue - it also handle queue overflow in a different way to BSD derived 
stacks. Instead of just dropping the connection request, and allowing the 
client TCP to retry automatically, NT sends a RST packet that aborts the 
connection. 

Ok, you can shutdown just about anything on the Net right now, and there 
won't be a real defence possible until IPSEC starts getting installed, 
but microsoft makes it much too easy.
