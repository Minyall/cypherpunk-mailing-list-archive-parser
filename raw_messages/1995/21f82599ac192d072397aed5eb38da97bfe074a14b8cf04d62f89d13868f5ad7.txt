Some software needs more than others.

Central Points desktop for windows -- a very complex and powerful 
product, had quite low help line costs.

On the other hand the messy and confused windows internet utilities,
produced by diverse people, often crudely ported from Unix by 
shareware operators who could not afford the time and effort 
for a proper setup program, or crudely ported by people who may 
have been Unix experts but most obviously were not windows
experts, (example: ftp softwares terminal emulator) are a total 
disaster, and this is why the help cost for SLIP lines is so 
high.
