Provided they know at least one person who does, they might well ask
that person to come and verify it for them.

Then again the tampered-with version might not mention PGP-signatures
at all (unless you use it widely in your publicity).

You wouldn't want that to be your only argument, but it helps...

If you mention all over the place that the program is PGP-signed
to foil {cr,h}ackers and viruses (*), chances are a lot of people will
ask their one colleague or friend that does know PGP to verify it for them.

Footnotes:
  (*) well, gotta use the four horse{wo,}men, no?
