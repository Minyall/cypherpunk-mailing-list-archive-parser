Here's the cypherpunk rewrite of the movie...

...bought the clipper codes from some guy at the DOJ for $100.
(gets a discount rate - normal rate is $200)

No need.

All the banks are using DES, which has suddenly become strong again.
(only for another 10 years, of course)

..hacked the account from some guy in Microsloth network security,
who doesn't know yet that anyone else is using it.

It really is annoying to try to break 40bit keys realtime. Why couldn't
they have been only 32 bits or something...

Using Weidei's TCP tunneler to submarine his computer so that it
_REALLY_IS_ under that domain. (After all, someone would probably
suspect kgb.com or UofHack.edu.ussr domains)

Re chat with graphics: isn't X great?! Have to remember to hack
into a T3 though, this lag is really slowing the feed down... Makes
the movie longer, ya know. Plus, techies will get a thrill if movie
shows doom being played remotely.

There you have it. Suitable for any cryptoanarchists' night out.

PS: Anyone know about ML, the IMAP mail program? Just installed the
new version at home and noticed I haven't seen the PGP hooks in the
configuration like I did on earlier versions. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
