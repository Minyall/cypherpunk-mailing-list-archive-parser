	"anyone knowledgeable enough to be comfortable with the
crytography knows that gambling when a house cut exists is a lose."

	These people would not be the target market.

	My figuring is that the target market for lotteries would be
your average joe home web browser, and your gambling addicts, of
course. These people would not be caomfortable with encrypted open
books, but I don't think that encrypted open books is really necessary
to run a lottery which provably doesn't cheat. (Perhaps not
*provably*, but reliably enough that people will play... )
	High stakes lotteries may not be suitable but a slot-machine
low-stakes system with perhaps a $1/play and a 40% chance of winning
*something* (maybe not the full $1.00) could satisfy people enough
that they will keep playing, and tell their friends about it. The
target market here is by no means people who understand that house cut
gambling is a lose.
	The reason to have an ecash casino/lottery is two-fold: A)
Make ecash take off. B) Make lots of money.
