Well from Netscape perspetive as far as I know you need nothing. Basicly
when the browser finds a new CA that it does know about it promts
the user and through a series of dialog boxes the user chooses to trust
it or not. (Well that is theory, and what netscape release notes say, since
I dont have access to an SSL server right now, and would need to figure
out how to make my own certificate, I havent tried it).
