Here is an excerpt:

 Since Microsoft Corp. products are usually robust, I was looking 
forward to seeing what type of security features the company implemented 
in 
Windows NT Workstation Version 3.5. But after walking through the system 
with Microsoft product managers and developers, I was dismayed to find 
how 
woefully short on security features Windows NT is. 
     Despite the fact that the U.S. government is expected to certify 
Windows NT as a secure operating system, Microsoft's first serious 
venture 
into security is not very impressive. Windows NT may pass muster with the 
federal government, but it does not meet the real-world security needs of 
corporations running complex, heterogeneous networked environments.
