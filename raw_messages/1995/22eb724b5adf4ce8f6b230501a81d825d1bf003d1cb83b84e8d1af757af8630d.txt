I'll ask a more specific question:

What happens if the chronology goes like this ?

(0) Alice invents a snaffleblort.
(1) Bob invents a snaffleblort.
(2) Bob files for a patent on a snaffleblort.

From what you said, it would appear that Alice's prior art won't count when
it comes to considering the validity of Bob's patent claim. Is that correct ?
