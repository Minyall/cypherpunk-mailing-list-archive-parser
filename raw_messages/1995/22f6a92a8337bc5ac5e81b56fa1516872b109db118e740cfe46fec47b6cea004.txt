I will be appearing with  Goeff Greiveldinger, he of the Justice Dept, at 
a discussion of commercial key escrow next Thursday in Bethesda.  Anyone 
with fun questions I should throw at him should contact me...

Please note that the ostensible topic of this discussion is *commerical* 
key escrow, not Clipper per se, so I have to be diplomatic....
