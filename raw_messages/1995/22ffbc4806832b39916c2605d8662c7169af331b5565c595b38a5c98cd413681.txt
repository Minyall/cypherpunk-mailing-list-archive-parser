| This morning, one of the University's publicity people
| <rls@pio.urel.berkeley.edu> forwarded Marketplace (a radio show)
| and CNN (sending a camera crew) to me.

Ouch - had a good night's sleep, did you? :-)

| I've also received email from various people, including someone who
| works in security at the Pentagon.
| 
| I wonder if I should tell them I'm not an American?
| 
|    - Ian "but I'm Canadian, so that's the same thing, right?" :-(

Too bad, you should have been a Swede, like me. Wouldn't it be fun
to say something like; "Well, I'm not allowed to reveal this weakness
to any American, since I'm not allowed to export munitions!"
