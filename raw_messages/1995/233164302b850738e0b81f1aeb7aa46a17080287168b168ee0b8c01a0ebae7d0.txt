And more importantly, what exactly is the GAK issue worth to netscape 
types?  Don't spout that trash about not being able to put food on the 
table.  Salary cut, maybe, temporary job search, maybe, but poverty?  I 
hardly think so.

So, for a 15% reduction in salary and 30 days of job search, is it worth it?

Answer for yourself.  That's where you really stand.
