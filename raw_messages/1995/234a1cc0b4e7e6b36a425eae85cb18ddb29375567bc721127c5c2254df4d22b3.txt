How do I know PGP IS secure? I don't. That doesn't mean I don't use it or 
don't trust it. PGP was designed and written by a human, who by it's nature
is NOT infallable. The name says it all.... PRETTY GOOD; not REALLY GREAT 
or UNCRACKABLE, just pretty good. 
I think the simple fact that I am not in jail (Knock on wood....) attests 
to the fact that the algorythm, RNG, works Pretty Good. (There's them 
there words again)
