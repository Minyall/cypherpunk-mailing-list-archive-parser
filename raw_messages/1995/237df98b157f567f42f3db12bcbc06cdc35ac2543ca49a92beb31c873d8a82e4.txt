Actually, no, and I'll tell you why.  My only interest in this product
is that you're flogging it as a one time pad, and just calling something
a one time pad doesn't make it so.  From all that's been exposed so far,
it looks like it doesn't match the standard definition of a one time pad
in standard cryptologic works.  Maybe it's something <like> it, and maybe
not -- but if they're saying it <is> a one time pad they should be
prepared to prove it.  Reading their warmed-over press releases doesn't
interest me at all.

Except for one thing, i.e. this line from the last blather:

>The encryption is not done by using an encryption algorithm.

'Nuff said for now, I think.
