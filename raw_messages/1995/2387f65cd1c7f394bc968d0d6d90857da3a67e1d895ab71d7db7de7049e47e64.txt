It didn't exist until recently. Neither did utilities for moving

Oooh, sorry. You don't get to have it both ways. If you can talk about
third party utilities, then I get to point out that there are dozens
of cool third party file browsers. If I don't get to talk about third

With make from third parties. If you want make on unix to do something
different, you can just get the sources (for free usually) and get it
do do anything you like.

And guess, by the way, where make was invented -- hint: not Microsoft.
