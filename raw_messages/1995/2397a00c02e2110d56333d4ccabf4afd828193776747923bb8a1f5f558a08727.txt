I'd like to also volunteer to do the linux port, whether it be
coordination patches, hacking code, finding people, whatever.


Also, if other cypherpunk subscribers feel that this topic
is inappropriate for the list (not likely) or that it would
generate too much traffic for the list (?) I can create a new
majordomo list dedicated to the effort in 10 minutes.

The aforementioned 'To Do List' could be the signup message
you get when joining the list.

Just a suggestion,
David.
