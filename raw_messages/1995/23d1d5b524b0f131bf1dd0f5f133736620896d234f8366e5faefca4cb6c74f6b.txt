Actually, what you've just described is general commercial paper, not
just a bond. Anything that lists a sum certain in money to be paid on
a date certain (with various other parameters, too, like a place) is
negotiable commercial paper. Checks, notes, and other instruments are
all commercial paper. They are not, by the way, certificates in the
sense that I suspect you mean.
