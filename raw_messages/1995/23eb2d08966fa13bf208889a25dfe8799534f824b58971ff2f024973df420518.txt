Hey, don't go for constant time, that's too hard to get perfect.  Add a
*random* delay.  This particular crypto-flaw is pretty easy to fix. 
(See, I'm not *always* arguing the downside of cryptography!)

It is worth noting, however, the extent to which "secure" cryptographic
protocols keep needing to get fixed one last time....  -- Nathaniel
