COMMUNITY CONNEXION TO OFFER REWARD FOR REVEALING HOLES IN ECASH

October 23, 1995 - Community ConneXion, an internet privacy provider
in Berkeley, California, announced the extension of its existing
"Hack" contests to the electronic cash system announced today by
Digicash bv and Mark Twain Bank.

"The ecash deployment an important step towards making internet
commerce more than just a curiosity," said Sameer Parekh, President of
Community ConneXion. The contest is meant, as with the other "Hack"
promotions being run by Community ConneXion, to encourage the
examination of the security of the ecash system so as to reveal holes
before they are exploited by a criminal element.

Community ConneXion hopes that the inquiry being done into the
security of these products results in a secure infrastructure for the
new paradigms provided by internet commerce. "All internet commerce
systems thus far released have been based in old, out-of-date,
insecure technology, such as credit cards. DigiCash is the first
revolutionary system which can change the way we do business," said
Parekh. "If the move to internet commerce does not radically improve
the way people do business, then we have not taken full advantage of
the potential inherent in the technology."

Details regarding the Hack DigiCash promotion are available on
Community ConneXion's webserver at http://www.c2.org/hackecash/.
Contest submissions should be sent to hackecash@c2.org.

Community ConneXion is the premier internet privacy ISP. They offer
anonymous accounts, remailers, and psuedonym servers, in addition to
the standard ISP fare of webspace and dialup IP access. Information is
available from http://www.c2.org/ or from sending email to
info@c2.org.
