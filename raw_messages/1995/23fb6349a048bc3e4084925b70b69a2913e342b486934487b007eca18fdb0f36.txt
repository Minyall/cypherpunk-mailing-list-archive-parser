If I understand Java security correctly, the applet can just send data back
to the server it was loaded from, but can't read random files on the
machine it runs on (even if the user running it can read them).  Java is
beginning to become cluefull about the idea that a program is not the same
as the person running it, and should not have the same privileges.  In this
area, most OSs (inluding Unix) are totally clueless, which is why the
Orange Book has mandatory security requirements at the "B" and above
levels.
