They have a nice friend (the author of Spyworld would say outpost) right here
in Ottawa at the Communications Security Establishment. They (CSE) seem to 
have done some recent spying on the opposition parties and Quebec 
separatists (so I vaguely recall having read in several places. I haven't 
gotten around to Spyworld yet). It was rather funny to see them 
recruiting on campus. If you're ever in town, they're just a bit past 
Carleton U. on Heron. (it doesn't say CSE on the signs, but the guy at the
gate will tell you so)

Try <http://www.cse.dnd.ca> it's a tad sparse, but entertaining all the same.
They have very friendly recruiting brochures. Like NSA, they're also an equal
opportunity employer (;-> ).
