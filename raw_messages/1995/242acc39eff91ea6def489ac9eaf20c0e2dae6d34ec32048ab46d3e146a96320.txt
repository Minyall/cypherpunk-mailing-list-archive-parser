	Yes, this is possible.  No, I'm not going to take the time to
write a fix now, but, we both know its not tough to prevent.

	Take the hash of the pgp signed message, use it to filter on.
I'll occaisonally add text outside a signature (literally, a
postscript), so filtering out everything outside the signed text is a
bad idea.  You might get a few spams, but not hundreds.  Its tough to
ensure that mail always has an envelope that matches the key.  I still
use a key that say adam@bwh.harvard.edu, but most of my mail is signed
with an adam@homeport.org key.

	Cryptography can't solve social problems.  It can, however,
transform them into tougher problems for the anti-social.
