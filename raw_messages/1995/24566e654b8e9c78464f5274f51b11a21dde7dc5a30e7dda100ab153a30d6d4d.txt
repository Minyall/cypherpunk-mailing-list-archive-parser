Sure, there are possible fixes to the various problems. I'm not saying the
Caribbean will shut down, only that this will likely increase operating
costs, in at least some of the areas, and will frighten off some investors.
Human nature.

The model need not be physical sites in these locales, of course. But even
maintaining a business office in some of these locales will be a hassle.

(This is where I expect the usual folks will jump in and shout "On the
contrary!" Note however, how few of them actually live in St. Barts, or
Anguilla, or Curacao, or the Bahamas.)
