	Can we get the text of the actual speech?

Unless Netscape officially issues a statement on their home page, and
as a press release, saying that the press coverage was wrong and
Netscape is *against* any and all forms of GAK, then I think we should
assume that Netscape official position is in favor of GAK, and speak
out about it as such.

	It is very damn close to the wire. Even though the speech may
have been misreported, it is the reporting that affects public
opinion. Even if Netscape has no current products or plans to release
products implementing GAK, in light of this press coverage, unless
they issue a statement saying they are against GAK, then they are for
GAK.
	I haven't given up on Netscape, yet-- I'm waiting for an
official word.

	Jeff: If Netscape comes out in favor of GAK, will you leave?
(Wait until February, at least, of course..) You don't have to answer
that to me, or the list, just think about it, and answer it for
yourself.  Do you think "anyone else" there would leave, as you say
below that they don't want to go down history, etc...
