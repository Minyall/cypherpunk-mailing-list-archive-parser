It strikes me as rather foolish to mail off anonymous copies to several
individual recipients (Matt, Perry, Tim, ...) in addition to the list, if
S1 is a real leak. Why aid the traffic analysts by firing off multiple
messages through the remailers ?

BTW, the code has been posted to Usenet by a Frank Falstaff -- look for
message ID <40b8tk$cj4@news.xs4all.nl> in sci.crypt (Wed, Aug. 9, 1995).
His article refers to a message ID (namely <40b50l$oa8@utopia.hacktic.nl>)
that differs from the message ID of the copy sent to c'punks. So it looks
like there was at least one additional recipient. That's a minimum of 5
originals so far....
