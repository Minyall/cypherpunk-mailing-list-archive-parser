 Let's all take a deep breath here. If the Grassley bill becomes
 law, this sort of talk may have merit. At this stage, it's too
 strong.  So far the only declaration made is by one or more 
 Senators, not "the government".

 Sadly, the American Bar Association project that is writing model 
 legislation for this has been delayed.  A public discussion 
 draft, which should really move the ball forward, is not going 
 to happen until after our next meeting in August.  Expect 
 something published on the web in mid-September. Model 
 legislation is needed to sort out liability issues, for example, 
 without which large companies are afraid to enter the business.
