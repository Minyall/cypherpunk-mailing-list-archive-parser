These international conferences are usually held in pleasant
tourist spots, and most of the participants usually members
of QUANGOs -- nominally private organizations that directly
or indirectly receive large amounts of government funds.

The major tourist attraction of the Phillipines is of course
the large number of whores available at very cheap prices -- many
of them extremely young.

Now the American religious right receives very little money
from the government (as yet) so I doubt there are too many
US Christian rightists attending the conference.

Both Australia and England have government established
religions, so I expect there was a major turn out from
those two nations.
