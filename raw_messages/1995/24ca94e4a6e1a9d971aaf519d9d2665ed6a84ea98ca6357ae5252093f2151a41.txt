I have *already* downloaded, checked,... pgp years ago, and I did
multiplatforms cross tests,... so all I need is a pgp signed stuff
(obviously i need your (netscape's) pgp public key too, but I think
that a "massive" distribution, that is : mail on a couple of mailing
lists, your site, newsgroup, eventually adding fingerprint by phone
for the paranoid, would ensure that your key is indeed your key (it
can probably take few weeks before it's "sure" (you'll get feedback if
key have been tempered somehow)
Or easiest even manage that your key is signed by some well known folk
(PhilZ,...))

See my point ?

ps :imo the later your start, the harder it'll be to be "sure" of
something. (reputation of a key takes some weeks/monthes,...)
