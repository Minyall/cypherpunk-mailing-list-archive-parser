While channel surfing around 6PM today on Christmas day, I saw 
President Clinton announce the grave international threat 
posed by terrorists, drug dealers and money launderers wielding 
computers (Only three horsemen -- he left out child pornographers.)

He was immediately followed by an Expert In Television Expertise, 
who told us that computers were getting more and more powerful, and 
doing more and more things, and that Something Must Be Done.

The Expert did not actually use the phrase "The first Amendment was never 
intended to protect modern assault presses using cop killer computers", 
but that was the message.
