Wrong!  First of all, Jacques Chiraq (French President) and the majority of
the French parliament are conservatives.  Secondly, a statement like
"the French are Socialist" is a (untrue) generalization.  You are probably
thinking of Francois Mitterand ("socialist"), who became French
President in the 80's, and the first French Socialist President ever.

Chiraq, by the way, is the genius behind the recommencement of
