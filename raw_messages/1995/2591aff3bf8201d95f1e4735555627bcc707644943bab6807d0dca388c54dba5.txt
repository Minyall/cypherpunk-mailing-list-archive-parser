(And Tim reports the same).

Huh.  Since I only use lynx and arena, I haven't seen this.  But I'll
take y'all's word for it.

Since I'm about to toss hypermail out the window and replace it with my
own code (that I'm working on anyway for a consulting gig -- one of
the benefits of running the archives is having a test-bed for large
archives), you can reasonably expect the problem to go away in the
not-too-distant future.

I'll probably ask for people to test the new HTML when it's ready.
