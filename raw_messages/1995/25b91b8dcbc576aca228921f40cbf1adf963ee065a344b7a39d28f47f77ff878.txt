If this is an example of the depth of your research, then we
certainly don't have to worry about anything else in your post.
The peasants were economic assets, and their destruction was
regarded as a standard practice of war. Try reading Barbara
Tuchman's 'A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous 14th century.'

[I must admit, however, that the idea of Bush and Sadaam Hussein
having it out has a certain appeal - battleaxes in a blacked
out cellar sounds appropriate.]
