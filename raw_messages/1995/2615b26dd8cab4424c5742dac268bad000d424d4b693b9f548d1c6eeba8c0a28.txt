Bill Stewart asks what follows from "prohibit".  In the model I am, um, 
hypothesizing, CAs that play by the rules are entitled to certain safe 
harbors shielding them from potential liability (e.g. can't be sued if 
their certificate was used in a transaction that went bad through no 
fault of theirs).   No other behaviour or act is banned, but other, 
private, alternatives may suffer a coompetitive disadvantage since they 
would lack the certainty that they could not be sued.
