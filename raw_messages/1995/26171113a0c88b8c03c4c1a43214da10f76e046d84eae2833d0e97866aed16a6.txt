I totally agree with this. There are an awful lot of GPFs I've been experiencing with 2.0 that I never experienced with 1.2, and I am still trying to figure out that cause. The first one happened like 5 minutes after I ran the program whilst it was loading the Netscape homepage! Another irritating one that should have been caught is the download time indicator. When I download a file, the estimated time taken is shown in hours!

These trivial problems are really quite inexcusable, and should've been caught with good quality assurance before it even went out the door.
