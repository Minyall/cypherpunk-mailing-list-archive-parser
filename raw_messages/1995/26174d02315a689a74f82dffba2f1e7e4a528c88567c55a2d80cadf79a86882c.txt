What your talking about here is a cypherpunks intelligence capability.
If you think we are thought of as subversive and distasteful now, just 
wait to see what happens if anyone on the list outs the kind of

There is a internet lore that says the more valuable and insightful a 
given article is, the less response it gets.

I hope this is right, as most of mine tend to be ignored.
