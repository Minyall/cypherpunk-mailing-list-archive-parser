I am starting to have trouble believing you are a lawyer. Are you
actually telling me that treaties which explicitly indemnify
transshipment customers against local laws are superceeded by lower
level laws, in spite of the supremecy clause of the constitution? That
might be what the state department would tell you, but I'd have
trouble believing even a lobotomized mongoloid judge would let that
stand. Treaties are treaties, period.
