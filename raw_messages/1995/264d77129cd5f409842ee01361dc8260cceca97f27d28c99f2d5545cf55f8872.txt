Allow me to add some more partially informed speculation about unreleased

The graphic encryption patents I found a couple of weeks ago (cited here then) 
describe a method that I don't believe would be susceptible to a "jigsaw"
attack like this. The patented method specifies encrypting the image bitmap
bit-by-bit (it suggests XORing with a (P)RNG stream). So the square
granularity would fail your second criterion for the applicability of a jigsaw
attack. 

However, I only have circumstantial evidence to suggest that the PrivaSoft 
software actually uses the patents I've seen.

Perhaps PrivaSoft Inc. could comment on which patent(s) (if they have already 
issued) form the basis for the use of encryption in their product ?

One last note: I would certainly have a hard time applying a jigsaw attack to
the sample ciphertext image at http://www.privasoft.com/images.html (and
enlarged at http://www.privasoft.com/scramima.html). Maybe it would be easier
if the plaintext image consisted of a picture with more macroscopic structure.
