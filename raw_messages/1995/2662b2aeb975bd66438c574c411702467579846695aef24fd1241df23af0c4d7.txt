This was on the Info-Sec mailing list and appears to be a request for 
help in cracking some sort of execute-only wrappers on MicroSoft 
Word-for-Windows macros, the concern being that the macros need to be 
defused if they're malignant.  If anybody wants to, they may respond right 
to: njb@csehost.knoware.nl <Niels J. Bjergstrom>.

. . . .

>All the macros are made ExecuteOnly, meaning that they are compiled or
>encrypted so that the Word macro interpretor can execute them, but they
>cannot be listed or edited. Does anyone reading this list happen to know
>where we can find a cracker or disassembler for ExecuteOnly Word macros? It
>is of vital importance that we are able to read malignant Word macros, and
>any help will be appreciated.

>encryptor/compiler. We haven't looked at this yet. For all we know it could
