Hmm, I use:
  taking-in:
	seed = MD5(seed,new-data)
  giving-out:
	MD5(seed)

(where every giving-out is preceded by a taking-in). Is that OK?
If not, why not and how can I improve it?

Why? I guess to keep track of how much entropy I believe I have...

That's a safe authentication mechanism? I don't think so.
But you need a secrecy mechanism, so I guess that's where you'd
add your auth.

The boot-strap is done only once (at install time) so it's not a big
problem to ask for lots of random text from user.

Good, I thought so.

Sorry, have to go now, rest later...
