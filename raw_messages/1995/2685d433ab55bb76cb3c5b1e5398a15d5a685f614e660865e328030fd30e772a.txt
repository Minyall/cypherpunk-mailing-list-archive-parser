I am writing a series of atricles - one per month - for Network Security
Magazine, and am putting lat month's article up as they publish the next
one.  Probably 20% have appeared on bugtraq, etc.

All I am doing is going through the TCP/IP protocols (and other such
stuf) one at a time, writing a short piece on each, describing the most
obvious holes, giving some ideas of how they have been/can be exploited,
and describing in general terms what we might do to fix them.  Next
issue covers NNTP - then comes a 2-month (I think) issue on TCP as a
protocol (lots of holes there) - then whatever strikes my fancy next.  I
figure it will take a few years at this rate to get through the most
important protocols and services.
