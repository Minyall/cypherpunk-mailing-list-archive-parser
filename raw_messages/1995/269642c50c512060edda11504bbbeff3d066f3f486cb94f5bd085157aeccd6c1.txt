Learn to spell my name. It is on my .sig, my keys, and in my userid.
We blockheaded, Irish Catholic Americans are damn proud of our name.
Farrell's (along with other cheap Irish labor) built the railroads
from Chicago west.  Please spell it correctly, even if you are flaming me.

I doubt that this clown deserves a response, but...

There were a number of cypherpunks there. I can't speak for all,
but I expect movites include:

- attempting to clarify vague and confusing wording so we could
understand what they wanted.

- seeing that working with them, rather than yelling at their stupidity,
has a higher chance of getting results.

- we got to meet influential folks from industry who agree with us.

- some of us aren't completely apposed to CKE. I think it has value.
If we could convert their plan for GAK into CKE, it would be a big win,
well worth the effort.

- they are going to promulgate a FIPS PUB standard next week, whether I like
it or not, and whether I help or not. It is better to have that standard
understandable and clear than fuzzy and subject to subective evaluation.

- getting preposterous misstatements into the formal Federal Register so
we can quote it back to them in the congressional hearings. Mr Geoff
Greivelddinger's words should be handy to quote, for one example.

- there are lots more, but I doubt that I can convince this clown.
