I can tell you in general terms -- I don't write MIPS assembler
myself. However, I will point out to you that you use an ancient
Sendmail, and that it uses syslog(3) on user produced data, and that
syslog uses a static buffer. Trick sendmail into logging something
very big, and you can do what you like. The 8lgm people wrote a demo
for Sparc as a proof of concept.
