I have to agree.  When I first moved to Austin Texas, the rates for
cable were not too bad, we were in an area that had a choice between
two cable companies.  After a couple years, a third company, a wireless
company came into town.  I then moved to Plano Texas, outside of
Dallas, and was absolutely SHOCKED at the cable prices.  Of course, in
Plano, there was ONE cable company, and all the channels except
broadcast channels were scrambled, so you HAD to get the cable box.  In
Austin, I could use the VCR tuner.  The only scrambled channels were
the premium channels.  The service in Austin was better and about 2/3
the cost.  I definately feel that competition is a MUST!
