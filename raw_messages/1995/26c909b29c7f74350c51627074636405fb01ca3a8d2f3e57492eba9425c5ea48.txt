   "The 'Intranet'. Internet Software Poses Big Threat to
   Notes, IBM's Stake in Lotus."

      Hundreds of firms are achieving similar groupware
      linkups with simpler, cheaper systems on the World Wide
      Web. Dubbed "Intranets," these private networks combine
      text, graphics and even video to distribute news, answer
      employee questions, update personnel records and connect
      far-flung workers. The Intranets link a total of about
      15 million workers. These private networks are far
      different from what most Internet fans see -- the public
      "home pages." These setups reside on company-controlled
      servers shielded from the public Web by a security
      "firewall."

      The Web has an "open" design that all programming
      developers can use in common, as opposed to the "closed"
      and proprietary designs of Lotus Notes, Novell's
      Groupwise and Microsoft's Exchange. That lets Intranets
      accept traffic from incompampatible computers more
      readily, making it easier for customers and suppliers to
      tap in, and for users to draw data from old mainframes
      and minicomputers.
