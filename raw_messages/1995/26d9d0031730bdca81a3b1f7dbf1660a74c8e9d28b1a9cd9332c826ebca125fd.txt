Church of England in Australia was, and I believe still is, government 
funded by the Australian government.

Furthermore when my kids went to government school in NSW, Australia,
they were taught Church of England religion by my neighbor, Mrs Law, 
in school, in the classroom.  

If it quacks like a duck ...

I was unaware of the portion of the constitution that you mention.

I suspect that the government and the church are none to clear on it
either.
