Nothing about the ITAR is unambiguous, but since what is forbidden is
``exporting'', which includes ``disclosing to foreign persons'', and
since use is not forbidden, it is hard to see how what you suggest
could violate the ITAR.  (And I don't know of any other U.S. law or
regulation that it could violate.)

On the other hand, it may violate French law, which, or so I
understand, does forbid the use of crypto unless the keys are made
available to the French government.  But I really don't know anything
about French law.
