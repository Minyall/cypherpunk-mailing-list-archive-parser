Hmmm - I got it yesterday, so it did go out.

[much interesting work deleted]

It sounds like any application using RC4 with random session keys
should start by testing session keys and rejecting any that
start with 00 00 or 03 FD; it means doing 2**-15 more random key
generations, and reducing the brute-force space by 2**-15,
but it's a pretty small reduction.
