Sounds good. Here's some nitpicking:

(1) If you don't mind announcing that you've exported the software from
Canada to the Netherlands, why not just put it up for ftp at a Canadian 
site ? 

(2) Acronym overload: try to avoid calling your toolkit "PCT", since M$
already has some security protocol called PCT....
