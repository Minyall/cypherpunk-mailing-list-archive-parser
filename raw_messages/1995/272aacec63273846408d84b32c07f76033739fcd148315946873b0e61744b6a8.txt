	Granted, the US Govt doesn't run the US-based root servers.
But, if an Internet 'Decency' law was passed, they certainly could try
to threaten the US-based root server maintainers to make the cascading
threats.  And, as I understand the way DNS resolution works, address
requests go down to your root domain then up from the other root domain,
i.e., for me to find out what c2.org's address is, my system requests
from:
NS mpd.tandem.com
NS tandem.com
NS com
NS org

If this is correct, if the com NS has the entry for the org NS, I won't
be able to resolve those names.  Of course, explicit IP addresses and
/etc/hosts entries would still work.
