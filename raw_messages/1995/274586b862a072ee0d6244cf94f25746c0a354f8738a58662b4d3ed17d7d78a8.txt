Yes. What you have then is just an elaborate cipher that is not a one
time pad. For it to be a one time pad, the numbers must be truly
random and generated only once, period.

If PGP is good enough for use as a source for cipher keying material,
then you needn't use it as a one time pad -- just use PGP directly. If
PGP isn't good enough, it certainly isn't good enough for use as
cipher keying material. In either case, it is NOT NOT NOT a one time
pad if it isn't truly random numbers -- that means physically random.
