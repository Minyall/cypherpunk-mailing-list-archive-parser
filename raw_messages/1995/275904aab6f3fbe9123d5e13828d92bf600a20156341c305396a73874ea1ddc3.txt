Jim Bidzos, President of RSADSI, attended our special "Clipper" meeting the
weekend after Clipper was announced, in April 1993.

I'm not saying this in defense of RSADSI and their patent situation, just
to note that they are not "dreaded."

No doubt Carol meant this tongue-in-cheek, but I think it important to
remind folks that things are not so black and white as to allow
demonization of such companies, at least not based on what has come out so
far.
