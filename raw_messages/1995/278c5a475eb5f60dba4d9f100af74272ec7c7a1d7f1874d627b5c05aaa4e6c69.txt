Be _very_ careful if you try this.  After all, it's an invitation for anybody
who runs the dictionary to use a crack program on the convenient list of hashes.
(If you use the same hash as the password file, you haven't risked _too_ much,
but using something fast like MD5 invites people to use their pre-computed
"MD5's of a million wimpy passwords" list.
