You know, Mr. Harmon, you can just keep posting my private mail to you
all day, but you WILL start to annoy others after a while.

[Just to be clear to others, this is the first of the several messages
on the topic I've posted -- Mr. Harmon has been forwarding my private
replies to the list. I think it all makes him look bad, but some
people have no sense.]
