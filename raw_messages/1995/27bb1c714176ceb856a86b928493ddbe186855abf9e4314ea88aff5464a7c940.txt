If Netscape really does go the GAK route, I will unilaterally
do this to the Cypherpunk Archives (or something similar, like every
request flashing up briefly and then client-pulling the GAK pages).

I've been told that many media-types go to the archives whenever c'punks
make the news.  How much of an effect do y'all think it'll have if they
can't do it with Netscape?

Shouldn't be too hard to hack this into Apache.
