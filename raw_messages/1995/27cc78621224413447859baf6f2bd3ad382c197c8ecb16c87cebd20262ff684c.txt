Ethical I would definately agree with.

Legally, I'm not so sure of. The applicable law would appear to be the 
Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986. The law does allow 
administrators to see messages in the normal course of their job, as long as 
they don't reveal that information to a 3rd party (except law enforcement in 
the event of a criminal act)

This protection is probably strongest with a company you purchase Internet 
Service from, probably lesser so with a University, since there is less 
obviously a customer/seller relationship, and almost non-existant with a 
business, since there isn't a customer relationship, and the systems are owner 
by the business.
