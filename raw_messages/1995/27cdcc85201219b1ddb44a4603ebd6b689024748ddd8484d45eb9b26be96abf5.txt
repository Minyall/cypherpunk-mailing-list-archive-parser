Plus the processing cost would place a tremendous burden on the 'net.
Transmision goes both ways, not just from the posting machine to the
rest of the world.  Every site 'transmits' every piece of news posted
to the newsgroups they carry.  Every intermediate site, especially
the backbones, 'transmits' email even in not generated from or
addressed to that site.
