It also captures Tim nicely. I'll point out, though, that exchanges
like that can be handled properly or badly. Doing it right means
answering truthfully but in a way that explains your position rather
than alienating the audiance.

When you have time to answer questions like that (TV isn't a medium
suitable for this) the right way to answer the last one is to do
something like referencing Thoreau. By the way, I like the opening of
Civil Disobediance so much I thought I'd post it.

         I heartily accept the  motto, "That government is  best
    which governs least"; and I should  like to see it acted  up
    to more rapidly and systematically.  Carried out, it finally
    amounts to this, which  also I believe--"That government  is
    best which governs not  at all"; and  when men are  prepared
    for it, that will be the  kind of government which the  will
    have.
