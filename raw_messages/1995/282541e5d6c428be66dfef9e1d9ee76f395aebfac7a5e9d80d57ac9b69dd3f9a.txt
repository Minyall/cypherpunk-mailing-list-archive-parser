You may want to send these guys back to do their homework.  For corporate
communications, crypto is not new.  Messages have been sent in cipher over
telegraph lines since the civil war.  Ask if a trade secret becomes exposed
(in the legal sense) if it is transmitted over telegraph lines in code.

I fail to see what the difference is between enciphering something in dots
and dashes and enciphering it in 1's and 0's.
