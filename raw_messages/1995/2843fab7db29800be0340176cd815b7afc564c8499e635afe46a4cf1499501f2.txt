This is a well made point, and I certainly do not claim to be one
of those who has an internal understanding of the political process.

I submit that the frenzied coverage of the presidential campaign
*severely reduces* the required knowledge, means and money, needed
to raise issues to the fore, and that furthermore, a lot of the "means
and money" that you mention are used for communication and organization.

Of course, an organized campaign on the Net is essentially free,
but for the cost in time.  It is my opinion that the political power
of the Net is just starting to awaken, and that a perception of
impotence in the political process, is just that - a perception.
