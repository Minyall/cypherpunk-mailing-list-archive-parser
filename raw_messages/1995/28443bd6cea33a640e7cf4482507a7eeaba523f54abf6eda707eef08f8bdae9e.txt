   (Btw, Bal, is Netbsd1.1 stable yet? :)

Seems stable enough to me, although I've only been running 1.1 since the
official release a couple of days ago.  I was able to trigger Scott
Westin's LiveScript with a Linux Netscape binary in 1.1's Linux
compatibility mode.  That's stable enough for me.

Oh, and PGP 2.6.2 built right out of the box :-)
