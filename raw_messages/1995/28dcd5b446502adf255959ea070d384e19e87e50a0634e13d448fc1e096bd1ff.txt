I believe you meant 2DES?  I've not heard of a meet in the middle
attack on 2-key 3DES better than brute force of a 112-bit key.

Even for 2DES, or for 3-key 3DES, doesn't a meet in the middle attack
require on the order of 2^56 words of memory?  This, as a practical
matter, makes a brute-force attack much more difficult than it would
appear at first glance.
