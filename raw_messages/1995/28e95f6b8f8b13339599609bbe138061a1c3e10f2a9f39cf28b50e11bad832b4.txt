I suppose you could, with some variant of Shamir's secret-
sharing scheme.  I'm not familiar with any specific
applications that do this.  (But that's irrelevant.)

That still doesn't address the basic issue - that the government
has NO RIGHT to access our _private_ keys.  If you want to
assume a fairly paranoid threat model, each of these different
agencies will instantly combine their parts to generate the
whole key.  If you trust the government, it might work.
Personally, I trust the government about as far as I can
throw the typical Man In Black.
