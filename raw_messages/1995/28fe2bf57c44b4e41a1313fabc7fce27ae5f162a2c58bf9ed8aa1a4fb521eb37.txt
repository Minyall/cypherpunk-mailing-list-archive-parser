The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, FinCEN, is well known to readers
of this list. If you grep for it in my Cyphernomicon FAQ, you should find
references in several places. I first learned of it in 1990, and have
followed it as best I can since. Not too much has been published about it.

It's an interagency working group, with participation by Treasury, State,
FBI, CIA, IRS, Justice, etc.

A good overview of it was in an early issue of "Wired," and is likely
available at the HotWired Web site.

FinCEN's Web page is:
