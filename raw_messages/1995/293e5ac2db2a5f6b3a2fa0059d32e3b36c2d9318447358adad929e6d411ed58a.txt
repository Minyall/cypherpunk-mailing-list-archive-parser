The point is, Netscape CLAIMS to provide security - Miscrosoft doesn't.

On my machine, if you replace copy with delete, it will be detected
before it does the delete, and, unless you are very skilled, when I tell
it to copy, the corruption will be automatically corrected.  This is
because I use an "integrity shell" - something you guys at Netscape
probably never heard of.

The point I have been trying to make that many on this list seem to ignore
again and again, is that Netscape makes the security claims.  If you don't
provide effective protection, don't make the claim.  If you want to make
the claim back it up with something other than media hype.

All of our opinions are our own, and my opinion is that Netscape (not you) is:

	- making inadequately supported claims about a nebulous
	thing called "security".

	- using it as a basis to get people to invest millions (billions?)
	of dollars.

	- plans to use it to move millions, and eventually billions of
	dollars over the Internet, potentially placing a fair chunk of the
	world economy (I'm mot kidding) as well as individual privacy
	(and thus freedom) at risk.

	- may succeed unless people who do understand the implications
	find a way to fix the thing.

These things concern me, so I will stand my ground regardless of the
flames and ask, yet again, for someone at Netscape to tell us what you
mean by "security" when you make claims about it (I won't repost my
questions from a few days ago since you have already ignored them) and
why your claims are strong enough for a big chunk of the world economy
to rest on it.
