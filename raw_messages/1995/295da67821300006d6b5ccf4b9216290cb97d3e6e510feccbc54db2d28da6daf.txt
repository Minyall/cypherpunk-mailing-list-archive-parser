The governments of the affected islands will have to make some tradeoffs -
do they allow providers of these services to operate freely, bringing in
new telecomm facilities so they can get the revenues from (let's keep the
Minnesota AG happy) gambling and other private-communications trade,
or do they leave their telecomm monopolies in place, so they can get the
telecomm revenues which get into government coffers more quickly?
Is there enough market to convince them to open up, which will attract
more services?  How much does being first matter?
