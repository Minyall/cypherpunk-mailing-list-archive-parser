The recent Netscape beta bug mentioned here raised a technical question?

Anyone here have a pointer to an applescript, frontier or macperl script
for monitoring what programs do to your system folder and desktop?
Otherwise, I'd better write one.

It'd be a good way to learn more about the behavior of apps.

Thanks and happy holidays,
