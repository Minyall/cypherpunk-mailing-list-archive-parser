Could someone PLEASE netmail me some _known reliable_ gates that use the
straight netmail address format (alt.whatnot@bosco.kollege.edu)?

All of the old reliables are shut down and none of the ones listed in
the last remailer helpfile I got work either:

group.name@news.demon.co.uk
group.name@dispatch.demon.co.uk
group.name@bull.com
group.name@cass.ma02.bull.com
group.name@paris.ics.uci.edu
group.name@crs4gw.crs4.it
group.name@berlioz.crs4.it
group.name.usenet@canaima.Berkeley.EDU

NONE of these work, or were nonfunctional when I tested them, anyway.

I use the other gates like mail2news@utopia.hacktic.nl with the
Newsgroups: field format, but the straight address format is useful for
some other purposes.

Thanks.
