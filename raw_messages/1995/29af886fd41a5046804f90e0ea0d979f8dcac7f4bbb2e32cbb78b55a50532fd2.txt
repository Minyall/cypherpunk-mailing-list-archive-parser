Er, Newt was the one who railed against the Exon censorship bill, and
who's said in public that clipper is unrealistic.

Anyway, there is no observable difference between Republicans and
Democrats on the issue of wiretapping -- most statements that
Republicans are worse are based on wishful thinking by Democratic
sympathizers.
