The CJR for the t-shirts was not frivolous.  Not in the least.

Letting the NSA/Dept. of State off the hook on this one leaves them with
wiggle room.  The goal of filing these CJRs is to find out just where the
NSA/Dept. of State draw their lines, and to _force_ them to draw lines
where they'd rather retain flexibility.  At the very least, we can point
out the rather strange ideas they have about what constitutes speech, for
the PR value, during the splashes of media attention silly CJR rulings
generate.

Even more useful: other things remaining equal, a rigid agency is safer
to deal with than one that retains the flexibility to selectively harrass.
