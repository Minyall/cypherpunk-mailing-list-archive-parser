   what differentiates a "data haven" from "reasonably secure offsite
   storage"?

Right now, that's easy.  Data havens don't exist, and prototype code
for reasonably secure off-site storage does.

The key distinguishing feature of off-site storage is that it stores
data only as bits, structured and segmented, but not interpreted _as_
anything but bits.  A data haven, on the other hand, holds things that
someone disapproves of, otherwise there's no need for a haven.  _A
fortiori_, if someone disapproves of it, it must mean something.  Raw
bits don't mean anything, or rather, they can mean everything.
