You grossly misinterpreted my remark.  I believe that socialist-statism
exhibited by the current US gov't is about to crack due to overspending
and technology.  Whether it will go peacefully or not is another question.
I stand ready to defend myself if necessary, but I prefer to kick the
statists in the ass by deploying strong encryption.  When information
can flow, the statists lose.  They know that; witness the frantic effort
to outlaw encryption.  Too late, though.

I'm writing code to hasten the end of the statists.  Just what are you 
doing besides hiding behind anonymity?
