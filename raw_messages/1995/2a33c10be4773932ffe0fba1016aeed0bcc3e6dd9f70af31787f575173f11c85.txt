	I saw the IW article that Light Ray saw in the RISKS Digest,
and, while it raises some valid questions, it in turn has some internal
problems.  For example, the IW author apparently doesn't understand the
difference between a Navy captain (O-6) and an Air Force captain (O-3),
dismissing the whole story because a Navy captain would be far to old to
be a 'whizzkid'.  Problem is the story said it was an Air Force captain,
and a newly pinned AF captain would certainly be young enough to be
considered one in the military culture (had I stuck it out through ROTC,
I would have been able to make captain at 24).  While the ET article
looks like it was written by someone who didn't understand the fine
details of what happened, the IW article looks like it was written as
military smokescreen.
