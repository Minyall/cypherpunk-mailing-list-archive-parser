AOL will, however, accept a bogus name, address, and credit card number
(as long as the checksum is correct) for the initial ten free hours plus
however long it takes for the first bill to bounce. 

America "On Line" will also accept direct debits from an untraceable bank
account (for this they charge a little extra). 

This is not to say that I have tried any of this (though I have), nor is
it to say that anything on AOL is worth your time anyway.
