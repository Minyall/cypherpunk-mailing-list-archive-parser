It's a well-known idea. My FAQ has a section on this, and the Cypherpunks
archives have many mentions of this.

For the newcomers, here are some of the issues, very briefly presented:

1. Incorporating a "Geiger counter tube" is nontrivial. A solid-state
detector does the same thing, and is a better approach.

2. Incorporating Am-241 or other alpha emitters in microcurie levels would
require licensing, regulatory oversight, etc., etc. Don't count on it.

3. Data rates are fairly low. Anything that "clicks" at high rates (> 1K
counts per second) would be too radioactive to ship.

4. Zener diodes and other random noise sources are cheaper to build, more
consistent in output, and easier to integrate into actual products.
