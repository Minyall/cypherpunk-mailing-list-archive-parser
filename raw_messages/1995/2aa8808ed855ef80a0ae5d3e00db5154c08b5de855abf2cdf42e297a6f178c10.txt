I tried posting this a few days ago, but it evidently got lost because of
the problems with the list. Anyway, I've uploaded my random number generator
number generation code for the Mac to:

ftp://ftp.csua.berkeley.edu/pub/cypherpunks/randomness/MacRandoms.sea.hqx

This file contains Colin Plumb's randpool code, my Macintosh wrapper for
it, and a nice 68K assembler implementation of MD5 as a bonus. Enjoy.
