In the subsection that explicitly mentions crypto, it says that it's
unlawful to put (non-GAK) crypto on an open net, "regardless of whether such
software has been designated non-exportable". If the phrase "nonexportable"
means the same thing in the context of this subsection, then provision (b)
would only seem to apply RICO to stuff that already falls under ITAR.

For whatever it covers, this provision conveniently makes you liable for the
actions of others. I could see quid pro quo between governments coming into
play here. They can get practically anyone connected with a foreign country 
to click a button on a Web browser, download PGP half a dozen times, and then
hit you with 7 counts of racketeering. Hey, they could run a net searcher
daemon that automatically snags a heap of copies of anything it finds that
looks like a non-GAK crypto app.
