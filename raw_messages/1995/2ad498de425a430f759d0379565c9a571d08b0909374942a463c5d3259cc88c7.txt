I find this argument totally unconvincing.  No risk is unbounded.  The 
worst thing that can possibly happen is that a nearby star goes supernova 
and completely destroys the earth.  Yet markets handle this 
low-probability risk quite well.

The direct cost of a break-the-bank catastrophic failure is bounded by the 
amount of capital the bank has.  This is because the market will not 
accept more liabilities (real or forged) from the bank than its capital.  
There may be other indirect costs resulting from dislocations, but these 
should also be proportional to the size of the bank.  Therefore your 
argument is really against centralization and for diversification and 
distribution.
