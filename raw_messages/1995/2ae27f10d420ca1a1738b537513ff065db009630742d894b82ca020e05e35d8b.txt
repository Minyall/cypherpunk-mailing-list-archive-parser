  I seem to remember a product from Sony last year that had a CDROM 
drive in it, a small LCD display, and a minimal keyboard. I think it 
was meant for reading encyclopedias or something.

  What would be cool would be a small device like this with a Magneto 
Optical drive in it. Generate yourself a large one-time pad and off 
you go...

  Or, you could have a secure messaging system (running a stripped 
down version of PGP) that could connect to a host via POP3 protocol 
(thru a internal modem of course)  handle your mail, etc.
