I wish we could get off the subject of the kiddie porn , it makes me 
wonder what people on this list are doing when they are not mailing out 
letters. Not to flame ,BUT it is such a serious issue and we all as 
adults and approaching adults should not treat it as an academic issue . 
It is the most victimizing of all crimes and I think of speak for some of 
us when I say that it would be better if we all found a way to get back 
to discussing the problems of cryptography as related to we not 
pornographers.
