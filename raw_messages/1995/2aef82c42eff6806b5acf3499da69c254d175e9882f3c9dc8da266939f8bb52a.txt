  I just verified in GDB using a stack trace that the Netscape overflow
bug I mentioned is indeed a static stack buffer overflow. It trashes
the stack.

  What this means is that in theory, it is possible to get a simple
URL, if clicked on, to execute some code on someone's browser.

  Now the hard work begins...


Happy Hacking,
