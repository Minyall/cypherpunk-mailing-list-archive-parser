Sometimes there's little difference.

I was referring to my previous point, whether or not you're
*individually* liable, "somebody" always pays.

Agreed. Fraud/defaults cost billions too, the billions I propose
spending would be a one-time, rather than yearly, cost.

I was thinking of some piece of hardware the clerk could hand you,
but "shoulder surfing," by the clerk or by other customers, will
always be possible, just as with ATMs or phonecards.
My idea isn't perfect, just better than the present reality, IMO.

Agreed. My idea *is* imperfect. Social engineering works well.
I just don't want to let the great be the enemy of the good,
and the credit card fraud situation now is intolerable.
