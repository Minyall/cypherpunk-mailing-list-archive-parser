Everybody who receives mail from cypherpunks@toad.com received this
message becuase the message was addressed to 
cypherpunks@toad.com.  Apparently someone may have 
joined this 'group' or service and used the cypherpunks address as 
the e-mail address.  Mayhap the cypherpunks@toad.com / cypherpunks
userid/password. 

This would be my guess, of course.

Does anybody know what this service does?
