Mostly because I'm looking at having bumper stickers made, and partly 
because I'm testing a procmail script :), I want a few suggestions for a 
good slogan for the C'punks, something that would look good on a bumper 
sticker... stuff I've come up with so far is like:

sub rosa - Cypherpunks 1995
Support your local Cypherpunk
Privacy isn't a crime (I think I stole that from somewhere)
Ensuring privacy isn't a crime

And that's about it.... you should see by now why I'm asking. :)
