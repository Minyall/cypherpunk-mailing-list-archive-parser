  As soon as PGP 3.0 is released I am planning on incorporating PGP into 
Pine, and start putting it into more programs, to increase the usage of 
encryption things before they go out.
  I am planning on adding a chat ability to a browser, and hopefully that 
will be encrypted, as well.
  Take care and have fun. (from a lurker)
