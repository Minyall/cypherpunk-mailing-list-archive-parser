harumphf.  (1) I'm not "local" -- as I plan to argue in my cameo at the 
next Sun User's Group confernece "cyberspace is not a jurisdiction" 
[apologies if you meant local == USA];  (2) as it happens, I'm nowhere 
near my law books at the moment, being telnetted from abut 1800 miles 
(I'd guess) away....so I'm unable to oblige right now.
