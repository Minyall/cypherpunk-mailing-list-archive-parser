Obviously it was significant enough to take.  It was also a perfect 
opportunity for Netscape to express concerns about the future of the 
technology, which is in netscape's interest.  The astute deal maker would 
be happy to work with the NSA on his own terms.  Instead, it 
would appear that Netscape is working FOR NSA on their terms.

I'd be interested to know what a 'government liason person' is.  It 
sounds to me like an 'in house lobbist.'  There is an old joke in the 
beltway about in house lobbists.

I also would like to know why you are actively lobbying for 
'claification' rather than 'modification' of the current policy.

Netscape seems to be taking the position, "We'd love it if you'd let us 
do X, but we are happy to roll over for whatever."  and  "By the way, 
what is the rule on exporting software again?"

I am impressed that some effort is being made.  I think it in the form of 
'too little, too late.'  But hey, who am I?
