i don't think i can help you at all but i do have it running on my linux 
box.  i compiled it as ELF with gcc 2.7.0 and libc 5.0.9.  unfortunately, 
i just tried to compile it again and it didn't work.  i'm not sure what 
i've changed since then but i have updated some libraries and bin-utils 
so who knows.

anyway, i know other people have it running too, it just seems really 
touchy to me.

sorry for the lack of info/help,
