  Go to http://java.sun.com and join the java porting list and also the
linux porting list. Suffice it to say, it is being worked on by many people.
The next port coming out will be for the Mac. Linux will probably be right
after that. The problem with porting HotJava (and Java) is that it uses
Solaris Threads, and if your operating system doesn't have a lightweight
process/thread library, you have to port one, or write your own. Secondly,
HotJava uses OpenWindows, and third, it relies on some Solaris specific
memory mapping tricks. (I've heard, there's also some endian problems)
