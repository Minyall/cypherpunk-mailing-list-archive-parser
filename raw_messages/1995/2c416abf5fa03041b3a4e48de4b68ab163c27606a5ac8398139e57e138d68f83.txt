If I have to pay for each key that I use, then
I have a particular key in mind for my one time 
pad.  It's a single (trancendental) number that 
starts with a decimal point.  It's the binary 
equivalent of the decimal number:

.012345678910111213141516171819202122......

I promise to only use this one key, and I'll just
select a random offset into it for each message.
