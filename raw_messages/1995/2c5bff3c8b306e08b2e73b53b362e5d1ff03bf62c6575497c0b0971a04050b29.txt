  Most of the unix machines do the same thing.  On SGI machines
that have the hardware cycle counter, its value is used in place of the
srand48(usec), lrand48() sequence.  BSDI the code used srandom and random.

  On windows and mac the first 32bit seed is seconds since 1970, and the
second 32bit seed is the "tick count", which I'm told is the number of
milliseconds since windows started.
