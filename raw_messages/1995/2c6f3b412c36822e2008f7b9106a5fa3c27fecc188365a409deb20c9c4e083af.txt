IANAL, and I know absolutely *nothing* about what a CJR should look like.

I don't think this is accurate: I guess this applies to the book
which contains several algorithms. As far as I know, the RSA alg.
comes from one source at one time.

Perhaps somebody should make IDEA shorts?

Then it would be interoperable with PGP...
(Would tooooo. You just have to remember what the header is.)


Hope that makes sense...
