A public key *is* "very probably unique".  A "randomly selected" 1024 bit
prime number has a specific amount of entropy in it.  The likelihood of
two users world wide "randomly" choosing the same such prime may be
precisely determined (assuming you can figure the entropy).

Who needs a KCA to certify it?

The real benefit of the KCA is as a means of linking the key with a unique
person.  As I've commented before, anonyms have no meaningful "credit rating".
