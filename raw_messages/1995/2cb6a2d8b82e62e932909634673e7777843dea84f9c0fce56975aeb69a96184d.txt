I'm all for believing or not believing based on your understandings, but
this is not the same as slander or irresponsible behavior hidden behind
false identity.

I'm also in favor of anonymity, but not for the purpose of slander. 
There are a lot of good and valid reasons for anonymity, and I believe
that it is a basic requirement of freedom, but we will lose the ability
to be anonymous if enough of us abuse the freedom.

> Don't blame anonymity for your own or others' inability to think critically.

I don't and didn't blam anonymity for this.  I blame people who hide
behind anonymity as a way to be irresponsible without apparent recourse. 

Evaluating statements and giving your opinion is not the same as making
insluting, untrue, and crude remarks about individuals.
