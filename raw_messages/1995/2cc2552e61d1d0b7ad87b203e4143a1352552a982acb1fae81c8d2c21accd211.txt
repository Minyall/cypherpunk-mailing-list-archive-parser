Based on the recently posted announcement, it is not at all clear that the
following is accurate:

	The OSF is opening a "web mall"
> where you can grab software objects and run them

Can somebody confirm or deny this? It makes a big difference. A few additional
ports won't significantly enhance Java's adoption as the standard for secure
interplatform network transport of executables. This has been a done deal
since Netscape announced that it was licensing and Sun committed to Mac and
Win95 ports.

On the other hand, a Java object brokerage service sponsored by OSF
including a few basic object support services could make a substantial
difference in the pace at which Java class libraries develop.
