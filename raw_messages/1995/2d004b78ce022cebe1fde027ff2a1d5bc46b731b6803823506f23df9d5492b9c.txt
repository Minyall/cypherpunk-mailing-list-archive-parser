I meant that on-line certificate issuing, notary and similar services where
data is submitted to a system for processing/RSA encryption are subject to
this for of attack.
Parts of the SEPP/STT protocols appear to require this of merchants and
customers.
I retract my comments about ecash/echeques - I'm not sure of the
implications there yet.
As for SEPP/STT - another nail in the coffin, me thinks.
