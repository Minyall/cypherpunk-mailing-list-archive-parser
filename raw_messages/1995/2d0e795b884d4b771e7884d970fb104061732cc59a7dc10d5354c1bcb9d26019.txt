Speaking of RSA129, we were talking on mn.general about how interesting 
it would be to try another distributed RSA attack at a larger key (the 
number of 512-bits was thrown around).  Are there currently any plans to 
attempt another one of these?  I'd love to get our MasPAR cracking on 
something.
