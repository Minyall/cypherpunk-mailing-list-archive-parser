  I'm not sure what exactly you mean by "cover the cost".  Our server
customers WILL NOT have to pay verisign for new certificates.  We will
tell all of our customers to generate new keys and get new certificates
ASAP.  We are putting the version number in new certificate requests
so that verisign can reject requests from people who don't have the
new version of the key generator.

  Server operators will also be able to set up their servers to detect
unpatched clients and redirect them to a page that will allow them
to download the patch.
