ENCRYPTED ON-LINE FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS

are being offered by a Bahamian company, Offshore Assets
Reconciliation, Ltd.  As predicted by *SI*, the computer
encryption technique called PGP would result in commercial
services providing electronic transactions that are
indecipherable by any government agency.  OAR is in Nassau, and
can execute PGP instructions to move cash from bank or brokerage
accounts to bank, attorney, or escrow accounts.  It is equipped
to function throughout the Carribbean and in 20 international
financial centers such as Isle of Man, Bermuda, Cook Islands, and
Vanuatu.  For more information contact OAR at phone: (809) 356-
2039, fax: (809) 356-2095, e-mail: 71522.2715@compuserve.com. 
OAR is the first of many such services to come.
