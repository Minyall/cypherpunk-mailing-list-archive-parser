Hi--

Eric Messick and I will be holding the Decemeber C'punks meeting at
our geodesic dome in the Santa Cruz Mountains.  It will be a
combination meeting and holiday get-together.  It will be happening on
the usual c'punks saturday, Dec 9, but will start at 4:00 pm instead
of the usual noon.  A more spirited announcement will follow closer to
the date.
