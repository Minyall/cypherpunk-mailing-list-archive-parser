PGP of course looks up keys by strings in addition to numbers.  A widely
accepted practice is to use <joe@foo.com> in the user ID which allows the
lookups to be by internet address.  PGP was intended for use beyond the
internet, such as in bbs's, fidonet, corporate networks, etc., where DNS
style addresses may not be useful.
