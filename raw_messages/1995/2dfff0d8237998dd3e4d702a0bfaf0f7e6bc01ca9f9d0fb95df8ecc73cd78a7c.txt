I don't see whats wrong with removing any checking done by PGP.
(ie don't keep a checksum or whatever) After all, they can't prove
that you didn't just encrypt a pgp +makerandom file.

Obviously, I would not want to use this "feature" in some cases,
so make adding a checksum be an extra command line option.

The new feature would of course not be backwards compatible, but
there is no way to disable the "feature" and no way to attach
loud alarm bells.

Of course, you are then faced with giving them a key which you know
will decrypt the file to gibberish. Ideally, you would steno the 
encrypted file.
