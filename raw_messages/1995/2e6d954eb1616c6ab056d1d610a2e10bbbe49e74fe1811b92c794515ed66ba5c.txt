Ah!!!

Then here's my next alternative attack.

By a 100x100 Transputer (about \$120,000 to make one) and program it to
crack the SSL running 10,000 parallel computations.  If it takes 2 years
for the whole keyspace for each computer, it takes 1.75 hours to span
the whole key space.  Taking a 3 year write-off time and spending
$30,000 per year for maintenance, this comes to $70,000 per year, or
$14.08 per cracked key.  If I do 1,000 keys in parallel, that reduces
the cost to 1.4 cents per key.
