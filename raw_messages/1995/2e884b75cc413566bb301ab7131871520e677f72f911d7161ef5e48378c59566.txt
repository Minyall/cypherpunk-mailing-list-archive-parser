yes, they support one level of proxying, but not several as far as I
know (so chaining must be done by the proxy itself as I suggested
below)

Reverse path is not a problem because WWW works with a bidirectional
connection, so you get the answer to you query on the same path as you
send it (its client <-> proxy1 ... (<-> and not ->))
