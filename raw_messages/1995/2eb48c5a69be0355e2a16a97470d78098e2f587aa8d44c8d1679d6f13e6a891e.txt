You can't have multiple processes running on a Mac. (Unless the application
has a different name -- for example, you *can* have two different copies of
the Netscape application, named "NS1" and "NS2", set as the default "helpers" 
for a) news and b) HTTP, should you want to do that...)

What ICeTEe does is send an Open AppleEvent to the browser application.
If it is running, it responds by opening the URL in the browser. If the browser
isn't running, it starts the browser and then opens the URL. The INIT
(extension) patches the System "TextEdit" routines, which are used in most
apps with limited need for text processing. The name of the INIT comes from
its authors, who wrote "InternetConfig", and because it patches "TextEdit".

This isn't to say that Java isn't cool :-)
