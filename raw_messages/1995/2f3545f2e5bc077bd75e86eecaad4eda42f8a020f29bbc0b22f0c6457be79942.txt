Suppose you have Alice, Bob, and Mallet. (Mallet is the convention for
the MITM, right?)

	Suppose Alice and Bob are communicating privately. Suppose
that Mallet is one of Bob's personalities, because he suffers from
multiple personality disorder.

	How is this different from where Mallet is actually Bob's ISP?

	Even if Alice & Bob were talking in person, privately, Alice
doesn't know that she is also talking to Mallet. My point is that
given no other context, there is *no way* to know for certain that you
are communication with the person you have in mind.

	Or suppose that Bob is a drug user doing a plea bargain. He
agrees to have his communications monitored via MITM attack to get a
lesser sentence. He buys drugs from Alice and Alice gets caught.

	The thing I am emphasizing here is the necessity to have some
sort of -context- when addressing MITM. In a situation without
context, MITM is not an issue. In a situation -with- context, MITM is
an issue.
