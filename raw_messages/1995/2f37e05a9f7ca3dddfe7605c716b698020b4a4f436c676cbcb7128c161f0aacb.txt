Not a chance I'd take this bet!
1) My e$ haven't arrived....
2) If there were a serious risk of you losing, I know you're a good
law-abiding guy, but you might have a "friend" who would help you out by
exporting it in a hurry :-)
3) 24 hours sounds like a reasonably safe upper limit for the export time.

Storyteller makes no choice - soon you will not hear his voice.
His job was to shed light, and not to master.      RIP, Jerry
