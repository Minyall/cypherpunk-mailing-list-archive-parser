I'm no lawyer, but I believe that technically the ECPA allows them to view
mail when it is part of maintenance, which could be in the "normal course of
their job[s]" but I think it means that if they see mail while maintaining
(ie, bounced msgs) it's Ok to read it but maintenance doesn't mean outright
monitoring of mail.

Then again, what does the ECPA say about monitoring message traffic? That's
essentially what they are doing, and likely they will rationalize it as
being to save their own skins.  It also might be the work of a SysAdmin
and the school administration would be entirely clueless about it.  Another
possibility is that a hacker (the same who got ahold of the file?) put in
something to monitor it... (my knowledge of Unix is little, though...)

I've heard some nasty stories about boards and a couple of I-Net providers
who charge for access but reserve the right to throw someone off the system
without refund (it's often in the terms of many account applications) for
various no-nos.
