  You can find some documents about s/mime on RSA's web site:

	http://www.rsa.com/ftpdir/pub/S-MIME/

S/MIME is basicly a mime body enveloped in a PKCS7 message.  You can
find out more about PKCS from:

	http://www.rsa.com/ftpdir/pub/pkcs

The implementation guide recommends using rc2-cbc 40-bit for content
encryption when there is no way to determine the capabilities of the
recipient.  When you do know what the recipient can do, it recommends
using RC2-CBC with a longer key or DES-CBC.

For key encryption support for RSA with key sizes of 512 to 1024 is
required, and support for 2048 bit keys is recommended.  A minimum
key size of 768 bits is recommended for US users.
