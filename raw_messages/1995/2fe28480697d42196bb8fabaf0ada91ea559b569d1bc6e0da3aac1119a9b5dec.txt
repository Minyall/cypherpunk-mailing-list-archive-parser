I forget the name of the show, it was on Tues. night (last night) after
Pacifica (around midnight)... I wrote and sent the message while I was
hearing it.  I stopped after bleating out the message and listened to
some of the show, which was about right wing militias, Weaver case, Okla bomb,
etc... turns out I missed the short part where the person being interviewed
(duh, should've written his name down) mentioned PGP, which he also said
stood for "Pretty Good Program".  Wish I had more details of the show...

(BTW, I'm temporarily off the c'punks list)
