I am currently considering using Lotus Notes for a group-ware solution
where security is of great importance.  I have studied Notes
documentation regarding thier implementation of the RSA encryption
library, but it leaves some unanswered questions.

If anyone on the list has knowledge of the following items, I would be
very gratefull.

1)  What is the key size used by the USA licensed version?

2)  Considering RC4 is a proprietary scheme, have there been any
concerted efforts to validate it's strength or lack of?  If so, could
you give a pointer to any documents I could review.
