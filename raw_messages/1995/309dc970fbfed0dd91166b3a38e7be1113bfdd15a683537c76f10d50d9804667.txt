Lycos only has a database of abstracts of the archive (which is still 
commendable) and the other databases have smallish local archives of the list. 
There's no way to do a compleat search at present (other than manual labor and 
writing 'bots). A true search engine at the site would be a godsend. 
I presume that people who post want their posts read.
