And yet people like MIT get approval for the release of PGP this way.

It is clear that 
1) the government will (verbally?) clear the "PGP procedure" when pushed.
2) they need to be pushed.

If anyone from MIT is reading this, it would be a real public service to 
put on a web site (a) what the system used for the release of PGP is 
exactly and (b) what assurances (oral, written, names & dates) was 
received from State/Commerce that this was legal.

Publicizing this information would lay the groundwork for APA (or, given
the way the ITAR is written, maybe no...) and 5th Amendment / due process
challenges by other parties unable to get the straight answers they
deserve.
