If you've ever watched Not_at_all_Funny Home Videos or any of the
American Urinal school of tabloid television, you soon start feeling
that the real threat to privacy is not the guvmint, but all of
the yoyos with their little cam corders running around pointing them
at people.

Security cameras in ATMS and at airline ticket counters do more
to threaten you privacy than do FIBBIE wiretaps, and PGP won't
protect you from them. (and usually neither will the courts).
