   12-08-95. W$J:

   "Microsoft to Adopt Rival Tecnologies."

      Gates yawned, "its awakening a sleeping giant."

      "In a fight between a bear and an alligator, what
      determines the victor is the terrain," Andreesen
      shat. "What Microsoft just did is move onto our
      terrain."

      Ellison puked, "the Internet makes strange bedfellows."

      Schmidt shreiked, "Java moola."
