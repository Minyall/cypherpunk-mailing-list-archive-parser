Give it a rest, Doc.  You give all the rest of us Ph.D.'s a bad rep with
this crap.  Of course, if you went to that 4-year vocational school to get
an M.D., I guess that's understandable.

If you are so illiterate that you can't read the ascription (it says right
up there, "said Mike Homer, Netscape's vice president of marketing"), then
why do you (a) waste bandwidth and our time to go through this drivel, and
(b) flame one Netscape employee for not knowing everything you know?  If
there are all of 5+ refereed publications in this area, how about giving
references?  It would take up less space than your recurring venom eruption!
Or couldn't you understand the papers, given that you couldn't understand
the news clip...
