Sorry, this has nothing to do with Netscape's position on GAK:

I'm curious about this. Were Chirac et compagnie simply dragging their feet
on granting a license, have they made an actual policy change, or did they
realize they could do what Damien did ? It would be interesting to see more
information on this development. (There's a paranoid conspiracy theory I
could add to the pile here, but I don't believe it and we seem to be knee-deep
in them at the moment....)
