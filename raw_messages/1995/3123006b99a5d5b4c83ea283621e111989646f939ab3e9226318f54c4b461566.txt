	Actually, it also supports Kerberos (not relevant to most of
us), and PGP messaging.  Although a KCA would be needed before anything
useful came of the PGP support, at least its there.

	However, right now, there are few real alternatives to RSA
based schemes.  Has anyone looked deeply at SLED's procedures for key
authentication?
