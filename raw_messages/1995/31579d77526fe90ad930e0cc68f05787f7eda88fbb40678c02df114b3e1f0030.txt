Well everything is legal in Cuba since there are no discernable laws, only
policies, however at they time that I visited Cuba those phones available
to ordinary citizens had a phonekeeper seated right beside the phone.

On the other hand, no one would stop you setting up a data haven or
some such in Cuba, provided it was strictly off limits to Cubans, 
but you could not set up a bank, because sooner or later somebody 
quite important would help themselves to the banks assets.
