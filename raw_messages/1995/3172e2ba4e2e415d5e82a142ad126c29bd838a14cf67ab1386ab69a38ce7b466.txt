I've got a solution that everyone should love:

Let's go ahead and allow illegally obtained evidence - but let's
make it a capital offense for a law-enforcement officer to 
knowingly violate the 4th amendment.  

Strong 4th amendment protection and another wonderful death
penalty all in one!
