Shannon estimates roughly 1 bit per character of English.  

RFC 1750  D. Eastlake, S. Crocker, J. Schiller,
"Randomness Recommendations for Security" is probably useful.

| Can anyone tell me how many bits of entropy there are per 7-bit ASCII

| key by prompting the user to type N random key presses.  The characters
| entered are hashed down to 128 bits by MD5 for subsequent use as a key.

| What should the value of N be, such that the entropy of the user's
| string does not unnecessarily exceed the entropy of the hash?
