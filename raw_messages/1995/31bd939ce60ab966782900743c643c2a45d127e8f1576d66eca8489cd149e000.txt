	Info-sec heaven is introducing a new mailing list.  Unlike many
of the Internet's mailing lists, this is not an open forum for people on
the Internet to exchange ideas.  Rather, it is a monthly mailing used to
inform readers of new information that can be found in info-sec heaven. 

	If you would like to be informed of new information, services,
search capabilities, protection software, articles, books, and other
information that appears in info-sec heaven without having to come in
periodically and look for yourself, please let us know by sending email
to fc@all.net and we will add you to our monthly list. 

	Thank you for your time.
