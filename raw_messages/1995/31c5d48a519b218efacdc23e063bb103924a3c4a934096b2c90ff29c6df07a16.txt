Actually, if you don't mind only getting 3 seconds into the future,
moon-bounce is fairly simple and hard to tap on the uplink.
Unfortunately, most objects sufficiently far away to use this sort
of technique for practical applications are too small or distant to be 
good bounce targets, and some, like the Sun, are just not real cooperative.
For more expensive techniques, you could always launch a spaceship into a
cometary orbit, figuring out how long it'll take to come back.
