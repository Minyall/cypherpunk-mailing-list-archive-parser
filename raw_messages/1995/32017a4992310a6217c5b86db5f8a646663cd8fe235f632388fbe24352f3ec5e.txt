[Please respond via netmail - I have only intermittant access to list]

Can someone send me a list of functioning mail-2-news gates?

Suddenly, @news.demon.co.uk, which has worked well for ages, is rejecting
posts:

=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=++=+=+=+=+=+=+

	Subject: Article rejected
	Date: Fri, 28 Jul 95 1:36:41 +0100
	Sender: news@dispatch.demon.co.uk

	You do not have posting privileges via this mail2news gateway.

This is troubling, as I have not found another gate that carries my regional
heirarchy.

Also, is there a method by which one can access (via netmail) a list of the
newsgroups served by a given mail-2-news gate?

Thanks for any help.
