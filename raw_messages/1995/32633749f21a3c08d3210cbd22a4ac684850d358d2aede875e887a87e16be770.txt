I have read the EFF analysis of Senate bill 974, which is designed to
inhibit encryption on Networks. I think that it is a thoughtful document
but I am concerned that there has been no action alert produced to tell
people the most effective way to oppose this horrible Bill. People
who are concerned about the bill need to know what Senators could most
profitably be contacted. Also why has no coalition been formed to oppose
this bill? I am aware that many people are busy opposing S314, but
S974 is equally terrible as it attempts to suppress free expression.

I could try to produce an action alert myself, but I would probably make
errors as I am not up on the legal subtleties and the intricacies of
Congress. Could some of the savvy people please write an action alert?
Otherwise I will be forced to take a stab at it.
