When we say 'anonymous video-conferencing' here, I take it that's not the 
same as in videophones whereby you sit there and have your mugshot 
transmitted across to the other party... that would be distinctly 
un-anonymous :)

The thing being, say you set up an anonymous-video-or-otherwise-remailer, 
you have to ensure that people don't manage to get into that as such 
would obviously give away the identities of all parties.  Given that 
people can supposedly hack the DOD computer system, that doesn't seem so 
unlikely, so are anonymous-remailers really all that safe?
