>**This is a test. This is only a test.** The folks behind the book
>  _WebMaster_Macintosh_ have set up a contest to determine how
>  secure Macintosh web servers really are. They've put up a Web site
>  running WebSTAR with a "target" file that contestants must try to
>  retrieve. The first person to retrieve the file wins a year's
>  subscription to MacTech Magazine and a free pass to the next
>  WebEdge conference, and the next two people receive free WebEdge
>  passes. If the challenge of breaking WebSTAR's security isn't
>  sufficient, there's a second Mac connected to the first via
>  Ethernet. This second Mac doesn't run TCP/IP, only AppleTalk, and
>  holds a second target file; retrieving it wins you three free
>  WebEdge passes. The hope is that these tasks will prove
>  impossible, however, should someone break in, that's also useful
>  since it will help StarNine and Apple plug security holes. Contest
>  rules and details are at: [ACE]
