This Mossberg guy, to quote Mrs. Slocumb, really gets up my nose.

With apologies to the last flamewar's participants and MicroSquish
partisans, this bozoid monstrosity has historically demonstrated his
cluelessness and is living proof that no one got fired by buying IBM *and*
Microsoft.

Every few weeks this clown shows up on the Paper of Record for the
Plutocracy of the Planet and positively warps space with his inaccuracies.

He probably learned to code in COBOL. He probably calls a microcomputer a
"terminal".  He probably calls a server a "host". He probably even has grey
hair... ;-).

The brain bleeds. The mouth froths.

Somebody needs to feed this guy's email address to Detweiler with the "tip"
that he's a tenticle of someone around here who's actually cluefull ...

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
