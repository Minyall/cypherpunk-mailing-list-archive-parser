Are there any theoritical tools developed especially for this type 
of analysis?  If so, can anyone provide some references?

Secrecy will of course have to come before anonymity.  I am eagerly 
awaiting Voice PGP, but unfortuanately can't make the Demo Day meeting.  
Will someone please report the highlights?

So, the situation: high-latency, low-bandwidth e-mail remailers
the goal: low-latency, high-bandwidth interactive A/V type anonymity, but 
this seems too far away

Perhaps we can tackle the problems of latency and bandwidth seperately.  
That is, develop 2 sets of anonymity tools:
1. low-latency, low-bandwidth, for use in textual interactions such as MUD 
and IRC
2. high-latency, high-bandwidth, for non-interactive A/V use, perhaps 
anonymous TV broadcasting

I'm not too familiar with DC-nets, but they can probably be used as 
tool set #1. (correct me if i'm wrong) How about tool set number 2?

Indeed, Vinge makes use of such a trick in True Names.  If I remember 
correctly, the technology in the story includes the ability to compress 
full virtualy reality type interactions down to a few hundred bytes per 
second! (maybe is was thousands, but either way it seems unlikely) 
Vinge seems to be a stronger believer of compression.  There is a
similar technology in A Fire Upon the Deep.
