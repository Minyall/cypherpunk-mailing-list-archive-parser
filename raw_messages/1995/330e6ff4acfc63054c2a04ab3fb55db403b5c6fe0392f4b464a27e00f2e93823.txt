Part of my job-interviewing procedure has become grilling a would-be
employer (or whoever is asking for a contractor) about their net
connections.  I've been very pleasantly surprized that most [techie] places
are okay on a perspecive employee being interested in the tech grunge of
net access, and considering it part of the working environment, a benefit,
like gourmet coffee.

On the other hand, HP (that god-awful backwards cesspool of bureacracy) had
full net connections to the outside world (when I was there, since turned
off) but in a pathetic attempt to show due diligence searched our
briefcases and backpacks (but not the contents of the laptops, floppies, or
tape cartridges therein).  Someone's going to have to explain to their
legal counsel that taking paper versions out isn't the most efficient
way... :-)
