I couldn't agree with the general drift much more.

The real objective is to get the customs officials used
to the procedure of dealing the cryptograhic materials.

Your best asset is a good feature reporter and a photograher.

Right now, I don't think U.S. Customs is going to ask you if you
have PGP in your PC if you leave the country, or return either.

They should, and I'd be proud to say yes.
