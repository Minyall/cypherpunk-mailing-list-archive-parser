I have source code to a program called "md5sum".  The comments indicate
that it works on DOS, as well as unix.  It's three source files, a
"main", a ".h", and "md5.c", which implements the md5 hash.

Want it?

P.S.  There's also source code for MD5 in the RFC1321, available
from ftp.internic.net.
