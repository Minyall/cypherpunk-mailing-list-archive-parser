The problem is that the non-encryption program must use the same
interface as the encryption program.  Text compression is often cited
as an example of a non-encryption program that can use the same hooks
as a compression program, but there's a key difference:  the text
compressor *doesn't* need a key.

The encryption tool would have an interface like
    Boolean (*)( DataSource, DataSink, void*);

A compressor written to the same interface would never need to touch
that third argument.  Therefore, the second argument is "specifically
designed" to permit an encryption tool to be used.

You'd need a program which not only *accepted* the additional parameter,
but also *needed* the second parameter.  I confess I have some difficulty
thinking of one.
