I was speaking more secure in that the billing information is much harder to
get.  If someone had the time, money, and equipment to track a particular
person at a specific location making a cellular phone call from a given
number they would most likely already have the means of getting the
information an easier way.

I do agree that letting anyone other than yourself control your personal
information is bad!  It happens all to often.

At least 50% of the cellular carriers are not telco related.  Giving out
cellular numbers and names is a tabbo NONO for cellular carriers.  If
cellular customers start getting sales calls from a company that received a
list from a cellular carrier, the cellular carrier is obligated to refund
the customers bill for those calls if the customer complains becuase the
customer pays for calls comming or going.

I don't feel that cellular is completely private or secure but its getting
much better with the addition of digital cellular.  The problem with digital
is that the conversations are more secure but the information about the
people calling is not.  Digital cellular and PCS offers ANI and a bunch of
other identifying information.
