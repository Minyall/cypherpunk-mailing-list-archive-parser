Yes, I'm interested too, also because cryptotcp looks like a good
candidate as component of my "SafeSox" pet project, to make unmodified TCP
applications secure. Apparently, a sockd daemon could be easily modified
to open encrypted TCP connections to remote cryptod daemons, instead of
targeting remote servers directly. The next logical step would be a
Winsock (or Mac) version of that cryptified sockd, to be run on the same
PC where the applications live (not everybody has a UNIX box on the same
network). No modifications would be required in cryptod: 


Unmod. --- [socksifying DLL] === [crypto-sockd] ~~~~ [cryptod] +++ [server]
Winsock 
Client

--- = local API call
=== = local SOCKS connection (same network or same machine)
~~~ = cryptotcp connection across the Internet
+++ = cleartext TCP connection on the same network or same machine

Another area where I would appreciate analysis by someone more competent
than myself is cryptotcp's random key generator. Even though the
randomizer (in random.c) is called several times, stirring in the pool
also quantities of entropy depending on the time spent during the
establishment of the TCP connection, I doubt that the total resulting
entropy can be that high.  Perhaps, adding some purely local data a' la
randseed.bin (not available to an eavesdropper) would reduce the risk of
the scheme being brute-forced.
