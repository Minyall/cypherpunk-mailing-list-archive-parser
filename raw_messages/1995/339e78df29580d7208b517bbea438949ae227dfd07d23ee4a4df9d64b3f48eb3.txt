Gee, Bob moved -- I wonder how long he's been at MathWorks...
Anyways, Bob Silverman is a known Factoring Guy (TM).  He's been
involved in network factoring for a long time.

The software he is distributing, MPQS, is the algorithm that was used
to factor rsa-129.  Although this is probably not the same
implementation that we used then, it probably is pretty much the same.

I've met Bob; he is not a tentacle. ;-)
