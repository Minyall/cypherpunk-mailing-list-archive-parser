Someone on the Cyberia mailing list has announced that his URL on
legal matters (http://www.commlaw.com/pepper) can only be accessed by
sites which charge a "flat rate." I'm not at all clear what he means
by a flat rate here....is is flat rate per month, or per access, or
what?

In any case, I sent him (and the Cyberia list) a note saying I had
already added it to my home page and that the nature of the Web is
that URLs ripple out, either by linking with other pages or by
publicizing the URLs (as he did, and as I have just done here).

So, give it a browse and add it if you find it interesting. When he
sees a bunch of accesses (assuming his system has logs he can look at)
from sites over which he cannot possibly hope to set policy for, he
may realize the futility of this.

(He can stop accesses, or charge admission, with various means--maybe
not yet fully developed, or with commercial Web servers such as
Netscape is developing--but he cannot release the URL and then enforce
his ideas of who can access it. God forbid we have people trying to
"copyright" their URLs and then collect royalites anytime the URL
shows up in someone's list of interesting places.)
