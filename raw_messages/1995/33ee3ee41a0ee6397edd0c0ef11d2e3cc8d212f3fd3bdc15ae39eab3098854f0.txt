Well, I was quoting a small AP story in a paper notorious for
clipping articles short, so I knew that some [if not many]
circumstances would be missing.  In conversations today at
Potlatch 4 I learned of other circumstances, albeit not
necessarily what I would call "extenuating" ones.  And the
lawyers, of course, will be spin controlling from now until a
verdict.

Not necessarily -- there's lots of case law that the threatened
person need not be present to be threatened.  The people present
are still witnesses.  I agree there's a difference, but its nature
isn't obvious.  Precisely what that difference is is up to judges,
juries and [goddess help us!] legislators.

Irony noted and appreciated -- but it does illustrate the "public" 
nature of the forum.

I was in high school while the Supremes [the real Supremes, with 
Earl Warren, not the bogus nostalgia group currently wearing the 
black robes] were doing the decisions that allowed Joyce and Lawrence 
to be sold in bookstores, and I was taught Shakespeare from a 
bowlderized edition of Romeo & Juliet.  Trust me, we aren't in a 
place remotely like that now [not that there aren't plenty of people 
trying to get back there].

Which is not to say I'm complacent -- when I have money to spare from 
Green work, it goes to the ACLU.  Eternal vigilance and all that.  
And this dude is entitled to presumption of innocence, a jury trial, 
and all the other paraphenalia of procedural liberty.

However, given the information available to date, I see no reason to 
believe that he's been busted for writing "erotic fiction"  rather than 
threatening a woman.  Violence against women is too real, and in 
other contexts courts have held to a standard of what a "reasonable 
woman" might fear.

BTW, does alt.sex.stories presume fiction, or is it pretend truth 
like the readers' sex stories in Penthouse?
