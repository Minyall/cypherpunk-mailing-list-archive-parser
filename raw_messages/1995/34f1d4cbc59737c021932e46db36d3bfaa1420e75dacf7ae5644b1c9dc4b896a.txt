Why "the bank", rather than "all banks"?  If there is a single
cryptographic point of failure in a widely used ecash system,
it seems unlikely that diversity would buy you anything.  The
worry would not be the compromised keys of a single bank, but
rather, say, an effective cryptanalysis.  I would put this in
the supernova class; it may be just as unlikely.
