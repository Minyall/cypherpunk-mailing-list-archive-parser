I remember the trouble I had finding a text copy of the Cyphernomicon ...

So until someone posts it on a site with higher bandwidth, it's available
at:

ftp.goblin.punk.net/pub/docs/cypherpunk.faq.gz  or  cypherfq.zip

We're talking 400K+ over a 28.8 modem, so don't expect much in the way
of speed ...
