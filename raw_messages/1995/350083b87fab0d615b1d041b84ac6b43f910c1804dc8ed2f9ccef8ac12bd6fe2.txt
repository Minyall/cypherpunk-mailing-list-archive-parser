  What exactly is the point of this?  We have:

	1) acknowledged that the RNG used in the server private-key
		generation has the same problem

	2) said that we will provide a patch early next week

	3) said that we will provide new certificates for all customers

	4) promised to make source code for our new seed generation code
		publicly available

  What else do you hope to gain by breaking a server key?  I think
the point has been made.  Is there anything else that you would
reasonably expect that we would do in response to a server key
being broken that we have not already done?
