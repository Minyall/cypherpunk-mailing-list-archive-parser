Points taken. But I belive the are (or will be patches) for CERN to d 
SSL. Check the SSLeay ssl-user mailing list.

While we talking abut anonymous proxies. I always wanted to set up an IP
anonymous proxie using Linux IP tunnel and maybe also IP 
Masquareding. This would allow people to have anonymous Web Servers, etc.
(But as anything it would probably be abused for hacking, etc at no end).
Any commments?
