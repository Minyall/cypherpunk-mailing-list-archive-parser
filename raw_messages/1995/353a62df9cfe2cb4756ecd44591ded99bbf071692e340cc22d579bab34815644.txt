More likely the law will be used when a remailer operator wont play ball with
the local LEA and surrender any existing logs. Then the LEA can simply throw
the operator into a court under this legislation.

If (when?) something serious is perpetrated and planned using a remailer then
they will have the motivation to shut them down.
