Steven Miller, in his "Civilizing Cyberspace," remarks in
his coverage of encryption issues that:

   ... the Administration is trying to split the [GAK]
   opposition by working with private industry groups on
   compromise escrow strategies that would let government
   agents see the contents of decoded messages without
   getting access to the escrowed key itself. [p. 306]

Does anyone know more about this tactic, whether it is
being pursued, or the legal and technical procedures for
decoding and seeing the messages?
