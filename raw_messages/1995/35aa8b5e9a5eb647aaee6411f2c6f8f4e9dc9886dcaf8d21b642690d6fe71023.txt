If people could send me timings for various compilers / flags I'll collate a
table of speeds [see brutessl.h 1.02 for an example -- I tried using different
sizes for the RC4 info and it appears that only ALPHAs really gain by using int]

I recommend that you do not blindly use the above flags -- I just tried it on
our fastest machines (SGIs) and it *REDUCED* the speed from 35200 to 28400.
