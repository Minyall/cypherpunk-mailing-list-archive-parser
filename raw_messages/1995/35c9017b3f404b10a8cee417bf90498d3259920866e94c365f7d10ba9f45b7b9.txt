Ouch! Actually, semper.fi has many times that many readers... ;-).

Rich, you must be the *only* person, (besides myself), who's subscribed to
*all* of those lists. I think if you check it out, that post was germaine
to every single one of the lists in question.

However, I'm sorry to bury you in a snowstorm. Getting 6 copies of the same
thing must have pissed you off, and for that, I apologise.

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
