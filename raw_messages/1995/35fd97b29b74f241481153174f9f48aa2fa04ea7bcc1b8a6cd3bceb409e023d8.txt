Not really... Have you ever been on an X system with host-based
security (as opposed to xauth)? Anyone who has user login rights
to the machine you're on (*) can just telnet in and open windows
on your screen, blink the leds on your keyboard, install
fonts, confine the mouse to a given screen area, etc.

I understand that normally they can get a copy of every
X event you get (and filter them), but I've never tried...

(*) More accurately, any of the machines you can run X programs from.

Mouse events might not be as secret as we would like...
