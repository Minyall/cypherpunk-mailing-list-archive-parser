My original plaintext post of Internet control by spooks has still not been 
posted. I have made 2 posts since that were posted quickly. Are things 
getting BAD!? Could I have fucked up? Do remailers now have a new use? 
Should remailers with encryption be used to spread the alarm to the rest of 
the Internet? My fellow Cypherpunks with bigger Internet mechanics brains 
should check this out. Can the original BLACKOUT post be reposted to other 
mailing lists or will it be censored? Check it out! - Beat State! - Gary Jeffers
