Yup, too busy to automate. After all, if they took orders by email,
they wouldn't need manual intervention. It all makes perfect
sense. Why spend effort to lower the amount of time their staff need
to spend on manual tasks? Makes more sense just to remain buried.

I called and asked the Wired folks why they weren't using PGP. They
said they thought it couldn't be used for commercial purposes. I gave
them phone number for ViaCrypt. They never did anything with it so far
as I can tell.
