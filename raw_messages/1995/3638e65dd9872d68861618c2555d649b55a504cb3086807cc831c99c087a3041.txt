Ron has not mentioned such an event to me and if that were the case I would 
seriously doubt that he would not have been told about it. The only comment he 
generally makes is that he wrote MD5 because "MD4 was making me nervous".

Netscape do not simply use the MD5 of the message, they are using (as I 
understand it) the PKCS#1 standard for makoing the signature. If not they 
probably have severe problems.

NIST and the NSA trusted MD4 sufficiently to base SHA upon it. SHA is preferable 
in many ways to MD5, it has a different approach to extending the scheduling and 
resist differential cryptanalysis. There is a problem with the compressor 
function of MD5 which I dislike. This is fairly irrelevant though since SSL 
allows other digests to be used.
