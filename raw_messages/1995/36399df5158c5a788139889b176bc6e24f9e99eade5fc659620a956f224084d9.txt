If you received a phone call from someone you did not know, who asked you
for your bank account number, would you comply?

If a stranger handed you a floppy and asked you to run the binary on it. 
while connected to the Internet, and give it your bank account number,
would you do so?

If email from an unknown person asked you to download a binary over the internet, 
and run it, giving it your bank account number, would you do it?

That's exactly what is being asked here.
