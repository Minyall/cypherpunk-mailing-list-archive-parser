I am looking for suggestions for features to include in the next version 
of Crypto++ (current version is 1.1, you can find it at 
http://www.eskimo.com/~weidai/cryptlib.html).

Major additions already planned/implemented include speed improvements,
Safer (all the variations), and elliptic curve cryptosystems (over prime
fields as well as fields of characteristic 2).  There is also a good
chance that RSA will be added back, but I'm still waiting for the final
word from the RSADSI lawyer. 

What else do people want to see?
