It's sooo gratifying seeing the err, ever so slightly litigious folks
from RSADSI get a dose of their own medicine.

Does it apply to RSA and hence PGP by way of RSAREF, and a claimed

If so I hope the proud new owners have better marketing sense than to
stomp on their huge advertisment of RSA, PGP.
