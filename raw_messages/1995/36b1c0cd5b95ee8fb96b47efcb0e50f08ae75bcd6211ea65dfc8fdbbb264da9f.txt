Not having access to Electric Pencil 1.2, Sharpener 2.7.1 was able to 
"point ot the correct keypoint", and Leadflow 1.6.5 traced the stream 
of bits to determine this vital message:

Have a nice day today!
And,
A nicer tomorrow!

Why thanks Tim!

Love Always,

Carol Anne
ps FV reports others had same problems. Yet 3 days have passed. 
   Shawmut bank only took 9 hours to fix the big 'double charge'
   problem they encountered last weekend.
