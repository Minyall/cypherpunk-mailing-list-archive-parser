	It seems that they use signatures & hashes; nice work, a good
advance for medical records storage, but I'd ask how keys are managed,
and also what prevents me exploiting the 'hash-only' mode of sending
in what I'm cliaming to be is an emergency.  (Not that these
invalidate the system; they're just interesting areas to work on.)

|    The private code, known only to the individual to whom the information

|    In emergencies where fast transmission is needed, the unscrambled
