a pointer to my PRNG conditioning tools as UNIX processes, to be found
under:

	ftp://ftp.clark.net/pub/cme

These include:

1.	ranG
a PRNG (either MD5 or SWB [subtract-with-borrow]), seeded by stdin and
writing stdout;

2.	ranH
an MD5 conditioner (takes w bytes from stdin, writes 15 or 16 bytes to
stdout);

3.	ranM
algorithm M -- (cf., Knuth vol.2) -- fed by either an internal SWB
generator or a [pipe|file|device] whose name is given as a parameter.

----------------------------------------

4.	ranD
using DES to condition stdin to stdout isn't there, thanks to the ITAR.
I've sent a copy to Mark at ripem.msu.edu.
