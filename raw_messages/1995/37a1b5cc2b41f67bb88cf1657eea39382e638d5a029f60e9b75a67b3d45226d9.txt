I've been watching this gark long enough, I think.

Look. If you're qualified, look at the PGP source and vet it yourself. If
you aren't qualified, figure the market to be efficient in this instance
and assume the stuff works.

Stop wasting our time and bandwidth harassing the MIT folk about whether or
not their code is clean. Such posturing won't wash around here.

Seriously, it may be an appeal to authority, but it can safely be assumed
that PGP is clean, and that MIT is *not* involved with the NSA and the Red
Leptons in a conspiracy to spy on our alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.stoats
postings.
