But (amusingly enough) they can get free testing services from this
aspiring student for free just by providing source code.  Hey, it's fun! :-)
I'm no expert, but you get what you pay for. <grin>

[Psst: anyone wanna offer source code to the security modules?]


I do think their ``bug bounty'' system is an improvement -- at least
they're showing some concern for security, and beginning to admit
that outside review of security-critical code is...well...critical.

Still, I do agree that they really oughta be employing true experts
to carefully evaluate their system, if they wanna claim anything about
its security.
