We've talked about this a little bit on ecm.

Someone from Digicash is on record there as saying that trading in c$ came
as a complete surprise.

The hitch about continuing to honor c$ is that there needs to be a bank.
Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems that the current system does
work on an offline, peer-to-peer basis.  Nonetheless, ocassionally, you
still need to verify that the money hasn't been double spent, and for that
you need a bank.

The problem with being a bank is the price of the bank software, which is
where David Chaum and Co. want make their money.  Thus, the last price I
got (offhand) from David on the phone a year ago was $250k + 10% of net
profits.  Given the cost of hardware, people, lawyers, and if you actually
back the certificates with dollars in a bank of deposit (not being what we
want do to here, admittedly) bankers, and more lawyers.  Could add up to a
mulitmillion dollar proposition.

Of course, it could be done with donated professional time, bandwidth,
hardware and donated bank software from Digicash. But it's hard to see that
happening from here...
