Yes. On the positite side, the readers are likely to take more seriously
someone who's known to work for the company whose products he's discussing.
E.g., if someone writes from Netcom about Java, and I happen to know that he
works for Sun (even in a totally unrelated division), I'll suspect that he may
know more about Sun products than someone whose affiliation I don't know, and
I'll pay a little more attention to his writings.

I agree that disclaimers are worthless. I don't agree that they would satisfy
the lawyers.
