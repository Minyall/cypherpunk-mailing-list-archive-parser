Oh, yeah? No user certificates, no way to verify whats on the other
end. No assurances that you aren't being tricked into using a weak
algorithm because negotiation doesn't take place under cover of
signature. Lots of little potential cracks. Thanks, but no thanks.

This is not to slight your code. I'm slighting the protocol.

If folks want to secure links, stick to clean protocols to do the key
negotiation. I'm a fan of variants of STS myself, Photuris being a
biggie.
