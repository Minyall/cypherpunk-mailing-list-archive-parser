Mr. Anonymous has a good reason to be anonymous -- he's an annoying
fool.

Yes, Mr. Anonymous, we all know postscript is dangerous. Thank you for
this stunning revelation. We've read the IETF documents before, and
some of us even helped write them.

Maybe because you're an idiot and they don't feel that its necessary
to answer. What more need be said?

Those of us who care run our postscript interpreters with all the
dangerous commands stripped out, but given that Netscape doesn't
supply postscript interpreters, its not really their fault or
problem.
