Yea, I did a long time ago.  There was a bug in the code that caused
destroying fifos to do this -- it would free the fifo and then try to
set it, or something like that.  You have to reorder a few commands to
fix the problem.

I've not looked at PGPTools in a long time, so I can't give you any
more detailed information.
