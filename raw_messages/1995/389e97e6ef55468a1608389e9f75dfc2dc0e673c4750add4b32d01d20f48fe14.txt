Pardon my French, but if your lawyers make it impossible to do
technical work correctly, isn't it time to get new lawyers?  I can't
see how offering a reward for reporting bugs could possibly be
objectionable to any rational lawyer.

This can be a VERY useful (and very inexpensive) debugging technique.
Didn't Knuth offer a cash reward to the first person to find each typo
in his "Fundamental Algorithms" series -- and then doubled the amount
each year?

It can also be a very useful teaching tool, in that it encourages
users to explore little-used corners of a system.

I applaud any company that has the guts to do it.
