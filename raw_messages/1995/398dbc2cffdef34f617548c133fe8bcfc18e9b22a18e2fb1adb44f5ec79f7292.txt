The problem is that incoming messages are tagged with the number, not
the string. You can't check the signature if you don't have the number
in your own database. Global databases don't scale. Distributed
databases like DNS do scale. DNS style naming doesn't hurt non-DNS
users, so its a shame that it isn't there -- I, for one, can't specify
PGP style keys in the internet key management system I'm working on
because of this.
