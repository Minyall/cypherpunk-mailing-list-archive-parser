Actually, I was being rhetorical. It was an inappropriate posting.

Thats true, but it isn't a means to keep private investigators from
noticing that insurance cheats are perfectly healthy when they claim
to be horribly incapacitiated, which was what the article was about.

Actually, it was a prosaic example of the lengths to which human
stupidity is taken in our court systems. I'm reminded of the rule that
says you can't put a boobytrap in your home -- after all, a person
breaking and entering could injure themselves with it.

It has nothing to do with cryptography, though.

So what. Nothing to do with cryptography.

Take this elsewhere, I say.
