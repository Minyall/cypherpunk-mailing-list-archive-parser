	This is really frustrating.

	I'm trying to figure out how to use this damn ecash software
to setup a prototype ecash-accepting remailer.

	For one thing, there's no documention.

	Secondly, from what I can tell, it's like PGP. To integrate it
into other software you have to do all sorts of nasty output
parsing. why the hell can't it just produce nice, terse, informative,
UNIX-like output?

	it's late, i'm tired, I'm going to sleep.

	(the party was fun, btw, thanks to everyone who showed up.)
