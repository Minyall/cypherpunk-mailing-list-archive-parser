Amidst all the flames about impure Cypherpunks on the list, about evil
capitalist corporations, about conspiracies involving the underground Grey
Alien bases in Nevada, and amidst the flames about posts not dealing solely
with number theory or ciphers, it's nice to read a post like this one from
David Murray.

The tension between "private transactions" and "traceable transactions" is
indeed at the core of the debate.

Kudos to David on this. I just want to end on a positive note before
leaving for the holidays (the birthday of my savior, F. Hayek, of course).
