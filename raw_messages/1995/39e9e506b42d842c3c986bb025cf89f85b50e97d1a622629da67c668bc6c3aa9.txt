Of course you do (assuming the stupid transitive definition of a
pornopage). 

Start at your home page
    http://www.swcp.com/~correspo/DSC/DarScott.html
--> follow link to "National Instruments" in second paragraph
    http://www.natinst.com/
--> follow link to "Reference" a few lines form the bottom of the page
    http://www.natinst.com/links.htm
--> "WWW Virtual Library" near the top of the page
    http://epims1.gsfc.nasa.gov/engineering/ee.html
--> "WWW Virtual Library" right at the top of page
    http://www.w3.org/hypertext/DataSources/bySubject/Overview.html
--> "Other virtual libraries" near the bottom of the (rather long) page
    http://www.w3.org/hypertext/DataSources/bySubject/Virtual_libraries/Overview.html
--> "Yahoo - A Guide to WWW"
    http://www.yahoo.com/
--> "Entertainment"
    http://www.yahoo.com/text/Entertainment/
--> "Magazines"
    http://www.yahoo.com/text/Entertainment/Magazines/
--> "Sex"
    http://www.yahoo.com/text/Entertainment/Magazines/Sex/
--> you figure out the rest
