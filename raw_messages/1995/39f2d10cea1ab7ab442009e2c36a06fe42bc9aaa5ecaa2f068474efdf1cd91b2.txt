You might want to refer the NYT to the recent study published by
Computer Security Institute (in info-sec super journal on our W3 site).

There are alse several papers there on "Internet Holes" under Network
Security in the same on-line journal.  Every month, another 5-10 holes
are added to those published in this forum.
