   You forgot the NSA's most recent overt act in the PGP conspiracy:  it 
   gets PGP declared a munition, harassing PZ, gets lots of bad press, etc., 
   all in order to make Cypherpunks believe that there is no back door, when 
   there really  is!

   Shhhhhhhhh. Don't let on that you know.  Just go back to Rot-13 encoding.

You forgot to mention that although PGP is "provably" secure, that the
NSA engine for breaking it is a quantum computer built with "borrowed"
extraterrestrial technology.
