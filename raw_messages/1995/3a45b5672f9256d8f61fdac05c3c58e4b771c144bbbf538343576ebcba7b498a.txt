	If you'd like to setup an ecash shop as a merchant, you can
do it this week and have the $300 setup fee waived. (This
is for the $5/month 2% movement fee account-- the most expensive one
they have.) I setup my eshop@c2.org thing using the promotion.
	Information is at http://www.marktwain.com/promo.html

	(The $300 setup fee I think is outrageous, but at least this
week you don't have to worry about it.)
