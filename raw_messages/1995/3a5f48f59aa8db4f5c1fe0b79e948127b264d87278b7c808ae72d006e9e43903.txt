	The rule below involve no loss, and it works quicker
by putting the whole cypherpunks thing inside a set of braces,
rather than checking each message 6 times to see if its from the
cypherpunks list.

	Optimizing a bit more, You don't need a lockfiles on
/dev/null, unless you want to make sure the messages go in as whole
units.  Also, theres no reason to send the whole message, we save time
by only sending the header to /dev/null.  Procmail just frees the
body.

| Apply and modify as necessary. The "kill Perry's replies to James" 
| recipe is a bit lossy, (i.e. it will kill anything that Perry replies 
| to from Netcom on the cpunks list) but we can't have everything can 
| we?
