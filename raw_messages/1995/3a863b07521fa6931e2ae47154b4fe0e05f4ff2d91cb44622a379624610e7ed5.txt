Christ, these guys are so predictable.  What do want to bet that the last
clause of that paragraph was put in, just so it could be taken out?

Netscape, Apple, Novell et al testify before Congress; complain that their
crippled crypto has already been approved for export; they'll lose so much
money in sales, blah blah blah.  Grassley smiles for the camera, says "I'm
a reasonable man", strikes out the last clause.

Isn't democracy wonderful?
