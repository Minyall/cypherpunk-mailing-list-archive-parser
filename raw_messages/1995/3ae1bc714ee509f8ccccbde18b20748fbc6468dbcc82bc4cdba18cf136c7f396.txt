   Is there precedent for
   adding service-by-mail functionality in this way?  

You mean, like MIME?

   (Maybe "Latency"
   might be used in a future extension of RFC822 for some other meaning than
   what we are using it for.)

The command should be Add-Delay: if you want to acheive the result of
some latency.  (Those who don't recognize the double-edged nature of
this remark are welcome to make fools of themselves in public.)
