To the extent that one can believe the comments, it's more than "possible":
they say that the F and G boxes differ in the S-2 version.  One reason for
doing it this way might be to isolate the sensitive actual values from
people doing analysis or development at a grosser level.  That doesn't
explain the [r] bug you spotted, of course.
