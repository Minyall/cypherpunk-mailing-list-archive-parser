I think its simpler than that, a judge simply needs to look at the facts of the 
case, declare the warrants to be void, order the property returned and require 
payment of the 4.7 Million to Wollerstein before the courts will consider the 
matter further.

The problem seems to be that the US courts don't have the balls to deal with this 
type of behaviour.
