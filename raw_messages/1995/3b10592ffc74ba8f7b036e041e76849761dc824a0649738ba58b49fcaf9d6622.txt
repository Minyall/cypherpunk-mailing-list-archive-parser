ANGUILLA CYPHERPUNKS MEETING

The meeting will be held at my house, Sunday Oct 29.  My address is "Old
Ta".  Really, we have only a couple named streets in this country and no
street signs or addresses.  My area is called "Old Ta" because the Old
Water Tower was near me. :-) If you don't know where I live you are
probably off-island, and I can just pick you up at the airport.  You are
welcome to stay the week around the meeting (like Oct 25 to Nov 1 or some
such). 

Anguilla is a fantastic little country in the Caribbean with wonderful
beaches and no taxes.  I have been living here for almost a year now and
just love it.  Right now American Airlines has some specials on that make
flying to Anguilla a bit cheaper than normal.  For example: 

   New York to Anguilla $365.95 rt
   San Jose to Anguilla $574.95 rt

For these prices the tickets must be purchase by Oct 16th. 

Please let me know if you are coming so I will be sure to have enough
space.  If we get too many people we may need some airmattresses or
something.  It is warm here, so sleeping bags are not needed. 

If while you are outside the USA you want to write some software that uses
encryption and sell it worldwide, let me know.  I could put you up while
you wrote it and my company could sell it for share of the selling price. 
Let me know what you are thinking of and how long you think it would take. 

   --  Vince
