No, you *can* put 0x22, 0x3e and 0x2f by using respectively
&#34; &#62; and &#47; html constructs  (&#nnn; nn decimal ascii code)
unfortunatly &#0; is not recognized but you can probaly use any number
substracted by itself or even short lda#0 (depending on the cpu),...if
you need a zero,...(what for ?)

I hope this helps too, btw, anywone having contacts on the 8lgm folks?
they must have experience with that kind of stuff...

Uptodate infos kept on http://hplyot.obspm.fr/~dl/netscapesec/

It seems the anim is working on about every netscape around, except
one folk on linux that reported it didn't crash though someone else,
on linux too said it crashed...

Even if a patch should be availble now, making a demonstration is
still interesting IMO [specially when you know that there are still
ppl around using netscape 0.9x beta, and even ppl 'selling' it in ISP
access packages!...]
