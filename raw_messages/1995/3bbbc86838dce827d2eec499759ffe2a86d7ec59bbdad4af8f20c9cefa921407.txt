	IANAL, but if they have the intent to transfer cryptographic
software, and can 'reasonably' (wonderful precision there) be expected
to know that there is the potential for portions of the transfer to be
routed through US systems, then I'm guessing that it could be construed
that they had the intent to commit a crime.
