Clearly.  I think Time magazine, as they come onto the Internet, is 
realizing that the culture here does not take well to bogus and 
misleading journalism.  The Time reporter who wrote the article on the 
modern militia movement in the US asked on talk.politics.guns what people 
thought about his article - oh my, you've never seen such a flamefest!  
Not to mention the immense amount of pro-firearm opinions on the Time WWW 
talkback area.  For a magazine which has publically announced that they 
are anti-RKBA, I think they are viewing all of this with some dismay.

That is only a single issue - I think as more standard media groups come 
on-line, they will have to choose either to try to destroy the net 
through demonizing it, or change with it into an adaptive reporting 
system with traditional journalistic ethics.
