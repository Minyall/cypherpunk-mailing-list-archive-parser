It is also a matter of funding of course. While development can be donated
time, the rest often takes money. Still, its something to look into.
Handling RSAREF is sapping much of my time, otherwise I'd jump right in,
however I like to always pause before committing my time to endeavors. I
wouldn't mind helping out though. Certainly Consensus probably has some
resources with its own contacts to contribute.

I agree with your points though. Another thing to consider, are some
alternate methods of enterprise design that involve better communication,
iteration of goals vs product, etc. (Actually I need to work on a speech
about this that is coming up soon. Yet another project. :)
