Well, you could look at some existing code.  My remailer is written in C,
with most of the unix-specific stuff being done by shell scripts, so
you should be able to compile some of the C code on the Mac (if you're
planning to write your remailer in C).

Look in:

ftp myriad.pc.cc.cmu.edu /pub/remailer
ftp cs.cmu.edu /afs/andrew.cmu.edu/usr12/mg5n/public/remailer
