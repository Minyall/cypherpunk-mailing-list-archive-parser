This is extremely simple to implement.

Make the pages parsed HTML, check the HTTP_USER_AGENT environment 
variable, if it contains Mozilla, return a message that reads something
along the lines of 'hands off my keys', otherwise return useful data 
(GIFs, whatever...)

Also, remember that Netscape Navigator crashes (or at least version 1.x 
did) on URLs that were very long, and also on pages that contained a 
long string of numbers...

Cheers
