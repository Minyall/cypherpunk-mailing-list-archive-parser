Another thing before I go to bed. On the November issue of Scientific 
American the Essay column writen by Anne Eisenberg is titled "Doing 
Busioness on the Net". Its short (one page), but metions PK crypto, 
touches upon the dangers that online transcations pose to privacy, and 
talks a bit about ecash. Sadly there is no mention of ITAR *sight*
