We've got a box sitting next to the laser printer that receives faxes
and prints them on real paper, which is more reliable (and quieter and
lower-powered) than leaving the computer on, though it does require
leaving the printer on.  But for outgoing faxes, much of what I send
is from the computer anyway, so it's less of a problem (though, without
a scanner, I'm more likely to only fax stuff that I generated on the 
computer than drive to Kinkos...)

Perhaps we also need to build PGPfax?
