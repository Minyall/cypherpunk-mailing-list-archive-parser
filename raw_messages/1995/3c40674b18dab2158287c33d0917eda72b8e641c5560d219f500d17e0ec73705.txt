I'm working on a pre-mailer/PGP shell that works with Eudora for Windows.
You compose the mail in the shell, encrypt it, specify remailer(s), and it
transfers the message back to Eudora.

It's called Private Idaho.  Anonymous FTP from ftp.eskimo.com
/joelm/pidaho11.zip.

There were some problems with the loading routine in version 1.0, but
hopefully I've fixed them in this version.

Any comments, requests, bug reports appreciated.
