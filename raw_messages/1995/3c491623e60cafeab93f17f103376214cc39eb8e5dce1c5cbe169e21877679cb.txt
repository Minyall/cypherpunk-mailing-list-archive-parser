  While an exploit of this attack against our software has not
been demonstrated, and there is some debate about whether it
will even work, we are taking it very seriously.  We've been
working with Paul to develop a fix, which we will implement
even if the attack is never proven effective against our software.

PS - I think Paul was a bit surprised when Jim Barksdale pulled
out his wallet and handed him 10 crisp $100 bills.  :-)
