In list.cypherpunks, Chris.Claborne@SanDiegoCA.ATTGIS.COM quotes
a VeriSign press release:

> Class One Digital IDs: These IDs insure the uniqueness of a name or

I can forsee some possible DOS attacks against the Class One
certificate.  (p'raps I should get mine forthwith?)  And what
protection is VeriSign offering against the misuse of our certificates
(given that VeriSign must undoubtedly hold copies of all the issued
certs).
