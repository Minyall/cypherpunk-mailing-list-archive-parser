Well that would depend on the terms of the agreement to hold the escrowed 
keys, wouldn't it?   And presumably the GAK keyholder will have lawyers 
write the agreement so that it says, in essence, "we will try really 
really hard not to let the keys out, but if they get out, our only 
liability if to say 'Ooops' followed by a heartfelt apology!"
