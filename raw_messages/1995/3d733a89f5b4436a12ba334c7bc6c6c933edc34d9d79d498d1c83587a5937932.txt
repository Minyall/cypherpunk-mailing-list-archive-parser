More Fun from Fred. For those that haven't been following, he
threatened to sue me for quoting an Alice post as "Alice B. Cohen",
and threatened to have his attorneys seize the machines the
cypherpunks mailing lists run on for being part of a "criminal
conspiracy" against him.

Your choice, but it's not a very nice Christmas present to find yourself
in litigation.  I'll give you till Tuesday to reconsider.  If I see the
public apology, I won't call the lawyers.

If I were you, I would talk to those lawyers of yours and get their
opinion of whether it's worth your while to be malicious toward people
in this way in exchange for defending against a law suit when all you
have to do to prevent it is apologize for what you now know to be a
falsehood.
