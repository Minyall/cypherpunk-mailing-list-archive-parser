Er, I don't understand.

I could see why one would want to use a weak encryption system if it
bought you something. However, good encryption systems are as cheap to
use as bad ones. Therefore, why ever use a bad one? If the top of the
line lock costs the same amount as a toy lock, why buy a toy?
