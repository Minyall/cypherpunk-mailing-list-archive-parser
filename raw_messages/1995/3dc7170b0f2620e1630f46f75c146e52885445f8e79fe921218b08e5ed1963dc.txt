Just as healthy paranoia, that's worth persuing.
But I bet the author didn't know what they was talking about.

DH uses "discrete log" as the hard problem, and very straightforward
mathematics.

RSA uses "factoring" as the hard problem, and a very clever back door.

How do you decide if one is based on the other?

# public-key technology with Diffie-Hellman public-key in particular, which

It's still up in the air, isn't it, whether the discrete log or 
factoring is the harder to crack.   My intuition is they're the
same hard.

I know of no problem with DH that RSA doesn't have similar problems.
