FWIW, Sunsite has always had a policy of following the guidelines of the 
American Library Association on both collections policy and use of access 
records. The ALA rules are pretty cool, and have the great advantage of 
being easily understood by administrators (it also means that you can 
rely on the library community as an ally in the event of challenges.)
