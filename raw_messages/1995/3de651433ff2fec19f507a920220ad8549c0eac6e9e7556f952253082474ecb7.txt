Nope.  Not anymore.  Due to excessive fraud, they now check the credit 
card information when you first provide it.

(This made it impossible for a client to subscribe on the day 
after Thanksgiving, because AOL couldn't get through to the credit 
verification through all the shoppers...)

For any nontrivial denomination, this leads me to believe that ecash will 
be verified when online, not offline later.
