The actualy attempt is now over. See http://www.brute.cam.ac.uk/brute/
(which is being updated from time to time). Thanks for your patience.
Could people running old versions please kill any looping clients.

Anyone wanting to try to sort out any remaining problems (NB: the load has
dropped, so only the "hard faults" will remain) should contact me.
