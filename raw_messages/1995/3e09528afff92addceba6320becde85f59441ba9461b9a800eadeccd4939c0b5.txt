I picked up a posting there which I forwarded to another list (skipping this
slightly overloaded one :-) but it was cute/funny -- suggesting a project
for finding unmarked spook buildings in your neighborhood and gathering
a database (on the web?) of such.

It's not a CP topic, but it's related and folks might want to check out
that newsgroup.  (Thanks to r$ for the inspiration.)
