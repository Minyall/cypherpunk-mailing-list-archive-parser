 (A) by striking out `telephone' in the matter above
        subparagraph (A) and inserting `telecommunications device'; 
 (B) by striking out `makes any comment, request,
        suggestion, or proposal' in subparagraph (A) and inserting
        `makes, transmits, or otherwise makes available any comment, request,
                ^^^^^^^^^^
         suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication'; 

This appears to make ISP's responsible for content.

It makes them responsible for something that they cannot 
control without violating people privacy.
