That brings up an issue I occasionally think about...At what point does  
NSA's secrecy become more of a liability than an asset.  Should the NSA  
reveal flaws in crypto-systems in wide use here in the US to protect US  
companies and individuals from attack or should they remain quite so they  
can exploit them in the interests of national security?
