What a ripoff. I'm preparing a solicited security report for a Fortune
500 copy right now. I'm writing it at my usual rate -- which is
exhorbitantly high, but not so high that I'm charging them five
figures an hour to write the thing, and I can't imagine needing an
hour per page, including the title and other pages.
