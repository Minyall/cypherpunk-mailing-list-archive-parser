(Thread name changes, as "Clinton freezes assets...." didn't seem too

I was about to say the same thing! Not to push NeXTStep per se, as it
is apparently doomed for a variety of reasons,  but to say that
popular applications can be--and have been--ported to Unix. Many of
you presumably have first-hand knowledge of this, with apps like
Mathematica, FrameMaker, WordPerfect, etc. on Unix boxes as well as
PCs and Macs.

This is separate, I think, from the issue of teaching secretaries
LaTex...that sounds truly evil. (8-))
