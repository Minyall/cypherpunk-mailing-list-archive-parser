        Since I have begun the project of writing the Remailer for the Mac,
I suddenly realized that I do not know exactly what is expected of it, and
therefore would like some pointers to the specs of a remailer (I have seen
references to padding and splitting but do not know what this is nor how to
implement it.)
TIA,
_jaeson
