Er, um, right.

Well, then, perhaps on-line systems need to consider cash
revocation in case of theft. Actually, this is a no-brainer: just
exchange the cash for some new coin, and the old stuff goes
invalid. Admittedly, this means a footrace for the mugger and the
victim, so I guess the mugger is encouraged to knock you out cold.

Maybe you just shouldn't carry too much cash with you. Gee, that
sounds like good advice even without digital protocols.

Duress PINs liberally sprinkled through the keyspace also drop the
efficacy of brute-force PIN search for the thief.
