If this is so then everything I have read or seen misses this minor point
completely. Every press release, speech, etc. that I see uses the term
pornography, not obscenity. TV preachers, news anchors, newspapers, DA's,
etc. consistently use the term pornography. The state of Oregon specificaly
legalized pornography, not osbcenity. 

I think from a legal standpoint there is little difference between the two.
