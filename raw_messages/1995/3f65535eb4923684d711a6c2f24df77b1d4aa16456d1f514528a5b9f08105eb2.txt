The president needs the approval of the ranking members of the Senate
Intelligence Oversight committee (I think that is the one), and there is at
least one republican among them...  Anyway, several thousand Green Berets
does not a clandestine operation make.  Secret wars are a bitch to pull
off, and with a president with the lack of backbone such as Clinton they
are not going to happen in the next two years.
