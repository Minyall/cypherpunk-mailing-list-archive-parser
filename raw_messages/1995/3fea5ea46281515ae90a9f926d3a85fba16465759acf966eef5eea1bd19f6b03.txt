I agree.  ACKing partial segments is a bad idea.  But, when a client
is given a block of segments, partial ACKing can let poorly connected
clients communicate with the server via e-mail, and still stay busy.
When the client completely finishes half of its segments, it ACKs them
and asks for that many more segments.  The fraction can be adjusted as
mean communications latency to the server is measured.  Ideally the
new segments arrive just as the client finishes the second half of its
original segments.  This way the segments are allocated as late as
possible, letting better connected clients have a better shot at them.
