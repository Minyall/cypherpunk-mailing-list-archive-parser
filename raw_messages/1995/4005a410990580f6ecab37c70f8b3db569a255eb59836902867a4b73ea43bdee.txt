Use the demo digicash; it's not real money, and it's never been
illegal to play for poker chips.  The mere fact that there's an exchange
market for real money vs. digicash play money doesn't change that.  
It'd be nice if you take small bets, since many of us only have $100
or so of play money; quarters should be fine.
