Is this what they call topic drift?

I can just see the parents getting their young daughters into this system.

Boys, of course, can look after themselves. Sure.
(Or do you envision young boys with breast implants?)


ObCrypto:

So, if they manage to make it more appropriate for both young girls and
for boys, are there any counterarguments? (Not for c'punks, for general
population: "missing children" will be hard to argue against.)

  * privacy (worth a try, anyhow)

  * use of the info by the bad guys (the mythical "pretty girl radar" :-)

  * "witness/victim protection" could be made harder by this

  * alternative: the transponder password could be shared secret between
the parents and the state (what combination here?); protects both against 
perverted state and perverted parents...


OK, what have I missed?
