While I was abroad, someone from this list asked me for the address 
for the SOREHAND mailing list, which helps those suffering from 
repetitive strain injuries (RSI), including carpal tunnel syndrome.
I didn't have the listserve info in England, and somehow lost the request 
before I got back.

Figuring, however, that cypherpunks write code, that writing code causes
RSI, and hence this address might be of more general interest, here it is:
