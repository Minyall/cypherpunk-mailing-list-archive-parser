I think this is the correct board to put this message on, but since there are
no messages to read here I might be wrong.  Does anyone know where to locate
the program (algorithm) Pretty Good Protection (PGP) ?  I've read about it in
the local newspaper, in Scientific American and in the alternate news message
area.  It sounds like a good encryption scheme and I would like to explore it's
possibilities.  Thanks for any assistance.
