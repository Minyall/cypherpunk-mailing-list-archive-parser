God, you are an obnoxious prick.

First of all, this is Matt Blaze's pet project, not a product of
AT&T. It is given away for free and you should be happy to get it at
all -- no one is obligated to give you a gift. Have you mailed him a
Linux machine to do his testing on? Why do you assume he even has one?
As it happens, he doesn't, and probably doesn't want to go through the
hassle of paying for a computer and putting Linux on it.

Be happy he's given you anything at all.

Perry
