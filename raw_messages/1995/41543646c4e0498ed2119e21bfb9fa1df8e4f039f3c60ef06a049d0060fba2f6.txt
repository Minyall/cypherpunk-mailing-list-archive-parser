Another related issue is what I'll call "third generation" privacy. This 
exists when I want privacy not for myself or even the person with whom I'm 
communicating but to protect the privacy of innocent third parties. E.g.:  
  
Grandpa is getting senile and I'm communicating with a second family member

on how we should handle the problem;  
  
My friend Jane was just raped and I'm communicating with a mutual friend 
about how we can help her.  
  
The anti-freedom forces have tried to define the parameters of the debate 
inside the boundaries of the "four horsemen." We need to understand that we

do not have to remain within those false boundaries and, in fact, it is 
very good not to.
