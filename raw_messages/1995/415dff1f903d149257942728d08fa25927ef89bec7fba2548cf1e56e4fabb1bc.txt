Bill Gates now has an address for questions  -   
askbill@microsoft.com

He has a column which is published every other Wednesday In the 
local Seattle Post-Intelligencer, where he answers a few of the 
questions which he finds in that mailbox address.   He says he 
will not reply to questions personally (only in the column), 
but you never know  -  a few of you special people could burn 
his ear and perhaps elicit one to yourself (or perhaps even to 
the list!)
