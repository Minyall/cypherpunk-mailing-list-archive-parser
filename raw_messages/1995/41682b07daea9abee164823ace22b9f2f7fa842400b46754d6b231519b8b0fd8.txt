  Regardless of what Markoff implies, we do not intend to depend on
security through obscurity.

  Sigh.  For your information the security code for 1.x versions of
netscape was not even written by someone from NCSA.  The current
security team (which does not include the person who did the 1.x
version) also does not include anyone from NCSA.  While I can't
guarantee that such buffer overflow error don't exist in our
current products since I have not personally examined every line
of code, your generalization from experience with mosaic is bogus.
In the places in the code that I have seen where it looked like such
errors could have crept in, I have found that the correct checks
for buffer overflow have been in place.
