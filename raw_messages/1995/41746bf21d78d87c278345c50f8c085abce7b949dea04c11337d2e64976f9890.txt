For the cyphergroupies of course...they rule!  Some day I'm going to write
a book about the better known, shall I say "famous" ones, and then I'll
be a bazillionaire...oh yeah, that's the other reason I'm on cypherpunks,
to get rich!  (Did I mention fame?)  And they serve a great breakfast too!
You can get anything you want at the cypherpunks restaraunt, ta da da da da
da da, you can...help me help me Mr. Blobby, I think my neural nets are
insufficiently trained! Bzzzt!
