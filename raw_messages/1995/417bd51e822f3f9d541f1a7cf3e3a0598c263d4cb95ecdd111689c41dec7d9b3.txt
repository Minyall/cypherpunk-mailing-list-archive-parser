I might have missed the beginning of this thread, but noting the 
complaints that Lucky Green has made, I would submit that he may be 
dealing with a bank in deep financial straights.  The outrageous actions 
he charges follow exactly a pattern noted here in Austin a few years 
ago.  (During the S&L crisis.)  When banks start charging significant 
fees for mundane transactions, hit the exits at a run!  Ignore the major 
rating agencies, as they get their money from the banks. ;-)
