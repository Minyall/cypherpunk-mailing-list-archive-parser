I was under the impression that "the Communications Assistance for Law
Enforcement Act requires equipment manufacturers and telecommunications
carriers to develop network technologies that are readily wiretapped" (from
Garfinkel's book).  Doesn't a "hardware encryption device for use in lots
of communications devices, including cell phones, PDAs, etc." seem to fall
into that category?

If it doesn't then I have no idea what CALEA is supposed to do.
