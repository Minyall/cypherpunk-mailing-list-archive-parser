        In a November letter to committee members, the NSA
        threatened to prevent the export of triple- DES, citing
        existing US law and potential threats to national
        security (see attached NSA letter).

Oh, no, surely not.  There must be some misunderstanding here -
they *promised* they wouldn't block export of non-Clipper
things.  They wouldn't lie!
