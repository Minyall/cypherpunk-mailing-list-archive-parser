Generating good random numbers is key to operating a solid
cryptographic system. I've argued that computer interfaced radiation
detectors are the optimal way of generating such numbers because they
are hard to screw up -- biased diode noise and other sources are too
easy to misdesign or misuse. Aware is a source of such detectors.
