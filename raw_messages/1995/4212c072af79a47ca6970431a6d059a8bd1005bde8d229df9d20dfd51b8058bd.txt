   "A David and Goliath fight, the battle between Netscape and
   Microsoft over software for the Internet."

      For all of his success in outwitting the likes of IBM to
      become the leader of the world's biggest software
      company, Bill Gates has long said that the competition
      he most feared would come from a software start-up with
      breakthrough, innovative technology. Netscape
      Communications may be such a company. But a war over
      technology standards, which could delay the progress of
      electronic commerce and potentially impede Netscape's
      growth, now seems inevitable. Netscape's hand has been
      weakened by recent incidents in which flaws in the
      security features of its browser software were
      discovered by two "cyberpunks" [sic].
