Connie: "So it's really true that you're an anarchist? That you believe that
         semi-*automatic weapons* and strong *cryptography* should be *freely*
         available to *everyone*? and that strong cryptography on a *public*
         network like the *internet* will bring about the collapse of nation
         states all over the *world*?"

Tim:    "Yes."

Connie: "But, what about *democracy*? What the will of the *people*?"

Tim:    "What about them?"

A little more than 5 seconds, but I believe that captures her inflection
pretty nicely, don't you think?

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
