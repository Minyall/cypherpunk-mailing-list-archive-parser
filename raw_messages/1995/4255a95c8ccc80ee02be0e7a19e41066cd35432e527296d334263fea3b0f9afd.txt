	Strange, Dr Fred, this isn't the 'actual text' I saw quoted in
RISKS Digest - did you 'fix' it so that it was a bit more credible?

Dr Fred's paragraph:

FBC> 100% wrong - he was an insider, he had a great deal of assitance,
FBC> he had cryptographic devices and keys, and he had special insider
FBC> knowledge.  If he was an Air Force captain, he could not have been

FBC> Anyone know of any teenaged AF captains these days?

	Has anyone seen the REAL IW article, so we can tell what was
really said?  The age difference between an AF captain and a Navy
captain is enough that one could be considered a 'whizzkid' in the
military, while the other could not.
