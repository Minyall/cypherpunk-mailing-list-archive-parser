I wasn't talking about replacing the proxy's, but 'playing' them instead
of assuming you could connect directly between the skronked program and
it's server.

In otherwords: Since it looks like we're stuck with visible proxy
firewalls for the forseeable future, we need to start codifying
proxy-relay semantics into new protocol preambles.  This gets us back
to more or less transparent network services.  This is especially true
of non-mainstream methods of access.
