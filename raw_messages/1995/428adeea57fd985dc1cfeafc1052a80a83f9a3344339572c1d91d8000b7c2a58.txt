I'm trying to mentally compare this scenario with the use of a 
cryptographically-outfitted mailer operated through an encrypted telnet 
session. 

First of all, I suppose the browser has groovy bells and whistles to spice
up reading email. Maybe you could run a snazzy GUI standalone mailer in some
windowing protocol through the encrypted telnet link as an alternative. This 
is largely irrelevant to me personally, but could make a huge difference to 
the hoi polloi.

Ignoring such interface concerns, what kinds of situations would be conducive
to the JavaMail approach but not, say, ssh+Elm+PGP ?  Perhaps I'm visiting
someone where there's no local POP for my ISP. The friend I'm visiting has 
e.g. an AOL account. I would like to read mail on my remote account via her
AOL browser. Am I wrong in assuming that I couldn't execute a telnet: URL
with the AOL browser ?
