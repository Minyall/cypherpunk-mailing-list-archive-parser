What you have described is the classic 'man in the middle' attack.
Netscape claims that SSL V.3 is immune to the MITM attack in
appendix D.4 of the SSL V.3 spec. 

You will need to get the 'filter' (MITM) key signed by Verisign.
Or hack Verisign's server-key-signing key.


BTW your 'offer' is silly- this is not a trivial amount of work, and you
would not deserve any credit for coming up with so ordinary an
attack.  Write the code yourself, or pay the market rate for it.
