It's detailed to some extent in the on-line paper about the server.

Right - that's why you have to have timeouts.  Unfortunately, I only
prevent denial of services attacks once things hit the server.  I think
the TCP wrapper also has a timeout on it's request for authentication. 
As I said, the system is not made less secure by the server.  It's very
common for other http servers to start a process, lose the link to the
calling host, and leave processes hung out to dry.  Even without an
intentional attack, servers end up with hundreds of processes hanging
around after a few weeks of uptime.  If you get 1024 hung channels, you
have denial of services on most http implementations.
