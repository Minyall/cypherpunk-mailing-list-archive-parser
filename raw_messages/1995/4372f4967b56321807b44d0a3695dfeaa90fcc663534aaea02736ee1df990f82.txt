I've uploaded the cryptographic random number code for the Mac to 

ftp://ftp.csua.berkeley.edu/pub/cypherpunks/randomness/MacRandoms.sea.hqx

This file contains Colin Plumb's randpool code, my Macintosh wrapper for
it, and a nice 68K assembler implementation of MD5. Enjoy.

(Sorry if this has gotten posted twice, but my original post seems to have
