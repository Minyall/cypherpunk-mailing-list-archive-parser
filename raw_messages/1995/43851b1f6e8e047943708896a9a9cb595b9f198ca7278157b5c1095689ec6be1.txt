   DH code is easy - using PGP and perl you can build a simple one in a 
matter of hours.  

   But: where's the market?  The only people I've ever known to need a 
'data haven' were a group of people who'd obtained the source code to a 
major commercial operating system and used a freenet account and ftp to 
transfer it.  (40 mB+, I gather).  

   I can see building one - it doesn't seem at all difficult.  But I 
don't see how I could be reimbursed for the disk space and bandwidth.
