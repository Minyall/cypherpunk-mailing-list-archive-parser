A generalised distributed compute server would be powerful, a
participant would only have to compile the server and ensure it's
running.  It would compile and run cracking code only if signed by say
four principal participants.

The central coordinator service would want to send the following
instructions (every communique would be signed & checked):
	1) accept code & run
	2) report progress
	3) stop
	4) some management of keys, where perhaps any 3 principal
	   participant keys could revoke or add others for
	   evolutionary purposes.

Just an idea, probably old.
