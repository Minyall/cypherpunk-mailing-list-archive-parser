I'm in the process of moving and getting new phones, and Pac Bell asked me
if it was ok to send my Social Security Number to my long-distance carrier.
I told them "no, but you don't have my SSN anyway" "Oh, you're right, we don't;
can we have it" "No" "OK.  Would you be willing to give us your driver's license
number or another form of ID?  We've just started asking for this recently." 
"Is it required?" "No, it's optional, but I have to ask" "No, thanks"

Sounds like you're right about them getting into the info-selling business.
