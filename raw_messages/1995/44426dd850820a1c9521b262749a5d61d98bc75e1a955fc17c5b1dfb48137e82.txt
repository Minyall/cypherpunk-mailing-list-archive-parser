So if the feds intend to regulate cyberspace, what specific sorts of
regulations are possible at this point?

Forget laws, what is *technically* and institutionally feasible?

Can they just throw out TCP/IP and mandate X25?  Can TCP/IP be "tamed?"  How
can they control private virtual networks that piggyback on the basic
network structure?  

Just questions.  No answers.
