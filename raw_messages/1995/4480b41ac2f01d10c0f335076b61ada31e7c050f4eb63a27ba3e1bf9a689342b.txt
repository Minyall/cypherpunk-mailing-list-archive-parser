But if you "shield the bejeebers out of it," then all the radio receiver
generates is whatever signal manages to sneak through--which, ironically,
would make it _easier_ for an outside attacker to drive--and some amount of
internal receiver/amplifier noise, such as the Johnson noise talked about
here. (Every receiver has an "equivalent noise temperature," recall.)

And if one is left with only internal noise, why not simply use a nice
clean source like a Zener diode?
