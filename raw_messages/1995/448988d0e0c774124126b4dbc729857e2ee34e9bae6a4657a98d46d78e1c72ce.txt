	The release mentioned "computation time". In my book that
doesn't include the setup time involved in figureing out how to snag
the packets, sending the sendmail spoofs in order to approximate the
pid and ppid, etc.

	"time to mount an attack" is not "computation time".

	I'm really not debating with -you- though here, just
describing how the release was inaccurate. I don't deny any of your
statements

	Is UNIX really the most vulnerable? How many bits did the
tickcount account for? Seems to me that guessing just time & tick
would be easier than guessing time, pid and ppid if you are not logged
into the machine in question. . .

	I don't know what your background is, so don't take this as a
personal attack please, but someone who is trained in computer
security and cryptography implementation should *know* to check these
things. Hell, even I would check those things, and I'm not a
cryptographer by any means.

	Again, Kudos to Netscape for the quick response.

	I was referring to Jim Bidzos's comment, posted to
cypherpunks. 
	The release I will be sending out is written much more cleanly
than what I initially posted to cypherpunks.

	Great!

	Ah but who's to stop an anonymous posting. nudgenudge. ;)

	When I wrote that sentence I misread the release -- my
apologies-- my initial reading gave me the impression that the only
thing that was being done was increasing the key size to 300 with no
additional work towards finding sources of randomness, which you have
said you were working on.
