I haven't seen that kind of detail, but here's a piece with some of the
players posted by one member in December.  I don't have the message from
voorhees that he responded to.

Rich has the 3DES ballot results correct. It is currently our for
reconsideration which happens when there are 'no' votes.  It is expected
to pass.  Marty Ferris (Treasury and chair of X9F) chaired the X9F meeting
in Austin - which I attended as well as the earlier meeting of X9F4 on
Home Banking - and reported that the 3DES WI would probably go to Blake
and X9F1.  There will probably be a subworking group chaired by Glenda
Barnes of Cylink to shepard the 3DES along. Several of us will be
participating in the action.  We don't intend to let Blake sit on it or
kill it.  His rantings over some of the DES stuff is based on pure
conjecture and perhaps visions delivered in the night by NSA.  There are
no short cuts to a properly implemented DES system - only exhaustion. Ask
Bihnam and Shamir. The majority of folks (read banks) interested in 3DES
wan to see a two key system and not the 3 key proposed by Cylink for a
variety of reasons.  2key EDE DES produces key strength of 112 and not
somewhere between 70 and 80 as claimed by Father Blake.  The 70-80 is
probably more disinformation from the NSA to make SKIPJACK appear more
acceptable.  Many of us are convinced that Blake is paid by the spooks but
he will not publicly admit that he is.     The 3DES WI originated in X9F3
chaired by Gary Chauklin of the FRB and the 3DES WI was moved from X9F3 to
X9F1 over the objections of the X9F3 members and Gary.  When Marty was
questioned how that decision was made it became clear it was arbitrary and
Marty probably made it himself.  The meeting will be in Feb in Balitmore -
should be interesting.....         watch this space!!!                    
          ... peace ... abe
