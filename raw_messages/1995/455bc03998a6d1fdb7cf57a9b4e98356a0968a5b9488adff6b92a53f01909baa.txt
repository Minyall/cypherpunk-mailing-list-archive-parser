Isn't it strange that the same people on this list who have been giving
abuse to those of us who have been warning you about Netscape - are now
coming to see that we were right all along?

My point is NOT what you may think it is (i.e., that we were right and
you were wrong).  My point is that people on this list are a little bit
too quick to jump to conclusions.  Some of you are now marching off in
opposition to Netscape based on a rumor about what someone from Netscape
said and a report of a grant by the NSA.  This sort of knee jerk reaction
is often inappropriate.

As to the idea of going with NCSA's mosaic, I'm all for it.  In fact,
that's the browser I've been using all along - mostly because it comes
in source form so I can modify it for my less-popular operating
environment, because there's no fee for its use, and because it's not a
hyped up commercial venture with a stock having a price to earnings ratio
of 7,000.
