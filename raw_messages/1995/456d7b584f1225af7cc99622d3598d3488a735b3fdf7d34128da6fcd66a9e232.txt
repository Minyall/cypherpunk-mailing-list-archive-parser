The current (11/95) issue of MACWORLD magazine has two good crypto articles
in it.

1 - Protect your E-Mail by Bruce Schneier
Good introduction for neophytes, the basic how and why. Get some reprints
and give them away with PGP to your nonCypherpunk computer friends.


2 - False Security by Gene Steinberg

They searched for an applications programmer *UN*skilled at cryptography to
try and crack the password protection of the 8 best selling Mac programs.
Quicken 5.0 was cracked in 5 minutes. Adobe Acrobat in 2 hours.
