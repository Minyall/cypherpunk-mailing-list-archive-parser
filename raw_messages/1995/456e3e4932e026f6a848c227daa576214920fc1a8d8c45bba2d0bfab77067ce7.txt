One problem a number of people have reported in DigiCash is disappearing 
money. Several people have reported that if a transfer is misconfigured
the cash can flow out of the wallet, be rejected at the other end and
disappear from the system - i.e. misprinted names on cheques mean lost cash!

This is bad and they report that Digicash did not respond to their
complaints.
