Clinton won on this. The Administration does not appear to have altered its
position on this substantially.

	I am calling Clinton a coward for giving in to the Christian Coalition
and not vetoing this bill due to the censorship portion. He evidently decided
that following his oath of office and upholding the First Amendment wasn't
worth the "porn supporter" criticism Ralph Reed and his lot would direct his
way.
