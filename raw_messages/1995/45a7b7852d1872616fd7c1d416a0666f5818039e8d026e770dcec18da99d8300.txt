You are referring to the ACE/SecurID token card from Security Dynamics.

In addition to the displayed number, you should be prepending it with a
memorized PIN; this prevents operation in case of theft.  The server end
will disable the card after x failed attemps, etc.  Otherwise it is
basically a one-time password system.

I've had a business relationship with these folks for a year or so now--
sharp guys.
