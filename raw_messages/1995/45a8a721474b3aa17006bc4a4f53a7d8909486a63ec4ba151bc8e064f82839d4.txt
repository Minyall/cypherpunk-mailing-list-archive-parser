Ah.  By address space, you mean a set of possible keys, right?
Is there specific software we use to test this 'address space,'
or do we come up with our own?   It seems that there ought to 
be a more exotic method other than a brute force attack.  I
don't know much about cryptography, but if there's a way to
get "feedback" as to how "close" a key is to the real key, then
some sort of genetic algorithm could be devised.  Actually, 
perhaps not, since there are no "genes" envolved, just a 
big number.  Hm.
