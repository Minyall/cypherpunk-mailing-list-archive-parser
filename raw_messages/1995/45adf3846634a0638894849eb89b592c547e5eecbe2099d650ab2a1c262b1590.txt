An 'rmgroup' is a control message used by Usenet when a group needs to be 
removed globally.  Etiquette suggests that only big, important people 
should send these out, but technically anyone can send one.

I followed the Scientology debate with little interest until yesterday, 
when I fired up my newsreader and was asked "Subscribe to new group 
alt.religion.scientology?"  At that point, I knew that the real war had 
begun. :-)

From what I was able to ascertain here, an rmgroup was sent out, followed 
soon after by a newgroup (or two or three or...).  My news server doesn't 
honor newgroups in the alt hierarchy automatically as a rule, but did so 
in this case for some reason.

Urbana-Champaign campus.
