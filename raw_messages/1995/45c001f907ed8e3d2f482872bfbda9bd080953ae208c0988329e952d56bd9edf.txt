  We do owe the government.  They have paid us for Servers and Clients
that support Fortezza.  That is what we owe them.  The money that the
NSA gave us for Fortezza is not very significant compared to what we

  We have recently hired a government liason person to manage our policy

talking to congressional and white house representatives next week.
I don't know if we have made use of any outside lobbying firms.
