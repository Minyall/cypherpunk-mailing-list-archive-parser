I was really considering dropping by the meeting myself, and laying down 
the line in a very resistant manner, but as usual too much research popped 
up at the wrong time!  Imagine having a copy of PGP in a DHL package 
addressed to a cyperhpunk in Europe, holding it up and going "I'm mailing 
this tommorow.  Try putting me in jail!"
