   Won't work!  You can always embed an encrypted message in what 'looks' 
   like plaintext.

So people can write special software that gets their message rejected
by an entropy filter.  This is a disadvantage?  It looks like an
irrelevancy to me.

Seems to me that a quite reasonable condition of use of a remailer is
that what is passed isn't human readable.
