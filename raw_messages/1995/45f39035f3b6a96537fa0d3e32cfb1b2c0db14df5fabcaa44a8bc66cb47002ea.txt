c'punks:

RSA Secure appears to be a neat commercial package: it loads easily, runs fast, and
and generates an 80-bit key using Rivest's RC4. It has an "emergency access"
feature (splittable key escrow) which can, however, be disabled by the user.
Has anyone checked out the innards? Hoe secure is it in industrial/commercial
usage?; against the TLAs?; any hidden trapdoors?
Thanks in advance for your views.
