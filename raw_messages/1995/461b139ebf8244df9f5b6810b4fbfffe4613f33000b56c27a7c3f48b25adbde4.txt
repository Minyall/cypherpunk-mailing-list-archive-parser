I like this too, it keeps the data safe not only in transit, but also on 
the site itself.  So I don't have to re-encrypt files, they are alredy 
crypted, and signed(another good bonus) by the sender or account holder.

depends on how it is encrypted, if they encrypt it too the datahaven, 
using your public key, that argument won't work, BUT if they are suing it 
as a anon drop box, then they can encypt it to another publik key of the 
recipient(an anon key of course) and oyu would never be abl to read it.  
This is a good feature of a data-haven, one that may be able to produce 
profit int eh future if tha is a motive.
