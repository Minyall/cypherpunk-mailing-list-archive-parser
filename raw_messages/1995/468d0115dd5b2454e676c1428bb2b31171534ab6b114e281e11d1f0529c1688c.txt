IANAL, but I find this position to be stretching the limits of
credible grounds for a successful lawsuit.  My reasoning is that most
(all?) patent and copyright lawsuits are based on theft of services or
other forms of lost income.  If you collected a fee for a usage that
was identical in function to one that actually took place, (or even
close) I don't see how you could argue that any income was lost.

Technically he can decide what to allow as the license 'owner'/controller,
but that's different from having standing to sue.
