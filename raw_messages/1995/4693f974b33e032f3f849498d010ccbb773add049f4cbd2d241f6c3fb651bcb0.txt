Yes, looking at Matt's code I think I believe it.

If you look at it that way (the software just generates new bits every
once-in-a-while, like daily) I guess I wouldn't mind.  I mean, heck,
it's not like there aren't 3 dozen other random daemons that pop up
and eat my CPU every now and then :-)  It'd only really be a problem
if it were used as an "operational" source of random bits.
