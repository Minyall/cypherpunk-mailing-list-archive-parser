Phil was complaining largely because in spite of his apparent
cryptography credentials he's a lughead who can't have been bothered
to understand the architecture -- most of his comments reflected a
general ignorance of the process and of the discussions that had
preceeded. He also complained that the transforms weren't sufficiently
generic for his tastes. However, no complaints AT ALL were made about
Hugo's selection of cryptographic transform. We were assured by
everyone that it was the right thing to do, with people swearing up
and down that it was the appropriate idea. Do you want me to extract
the mailing list archives? Every last posting on this topic is on
line.

Actually, Kaliski made an off-the-cuff suggestion that all the other
crypto folks ripped apart, largely because it was obvious even to me
how it could be attacked, and then he backed off.
