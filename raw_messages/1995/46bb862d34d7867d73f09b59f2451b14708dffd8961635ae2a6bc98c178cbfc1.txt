    I was watching CNBC this morning while reading my mail and they had a story
    on the Netscape Communications IPO (ticker NSCP btw).

Apparently the opening price was doubled very shortly before the IPO
(late yesterday afternoon) from $14 to $28.  By lunch-time (in NYC),
shares were trading at $72.
