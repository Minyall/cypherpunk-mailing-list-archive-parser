| 	Buffer overflow seems like a much greater concern when dealing
| with a server. Particularly one which is supposedly "secure", and
| accessing "secured" documents. Even with the server running as
| 'nobody' if someone can implement buffer overflow to get access to
| documents they shouldn't then that would count as a pretty significant
| hack.

	Don't forget system(), which was a major source of holes in the NCSA server.  
Also, CGI scripts, especially those that run under perl or sh, would be a good 
place to look for holes.  Don't forget to see what happens when you put 
semi-colons in the data field of various fields, such as mailto:'s.
