   12-30-95. To update the list of terrorist threats, the Wash
   Post reports on the purchase in May of bubonic plague germs 
   by "white supremacist" Larry Wayne Harris, his bust by the 
   FBI and germ teams, prosecutors amazement that possession 
   of such deadly micro-organisms is not illegal, and the 
   consequent plea bargain of wire fraud with probation.

   The article explains that possession of "terrorist" mites
   is not prohibited due to a legal loophole which allows
   scientific trade in wee supremacists. There are calls for 
   outlawing the meat-eaters by closing the gap in the 
   anti-terrorism bill before Congress. But scientists say 
   how dare you spit in our nanodeath soup.

   It notes that offshore spread is Commerce regulated.

   BTW, why this story now about summer events? For the
   anti-terrorist bill, TLA-plague growth, any germ any?
