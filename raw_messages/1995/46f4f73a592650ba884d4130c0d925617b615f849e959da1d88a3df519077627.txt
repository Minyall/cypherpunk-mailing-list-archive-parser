I knew it was a safe assumption. :)

'Tis a shame, because SKIP is available right now and will, if past history
is any indication, become the defacto standard on Sun platforms because it
is readily available, and the IPV6 stuff isn't, nor probably will be soon
because even those with the source code are not permitted to give out mods
to this source (in the case of SunOS - I believe). However, a loadable
kernel module would be very nice with the IPv6 stuff in it. Unfortunately,
I have very little experience with loadable kernel modules of this scope,
nor the source code to use as a reference, should the loadable modules be
feasible.
