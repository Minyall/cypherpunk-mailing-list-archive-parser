I have created a set of WWW pages at http://www.cs.hut.fi/ssh/crypto
that contains a lot of material and references to cryptographic
software, algorithms, and related information available outside the
US.  I'll expand the pages as I get suggestions for more things to put
there.  The pages will probably be quite stable and I'll try to
maintain them, so it is possible to refer to those pages wherever
references are needed for crypto archives outside the United States.
