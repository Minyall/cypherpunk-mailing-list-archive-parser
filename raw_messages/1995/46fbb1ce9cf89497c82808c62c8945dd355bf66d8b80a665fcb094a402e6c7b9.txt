Bill, I also understood that the Walkers also leaked to the Soviets
details on U.S. submarine sonar operating procedures.

_Anyway_, my point was, if they can't keep _that_ secret, I doubt
they'd be able to keep secret the details/keys for activating the
backdoor on whatever artificially weakened system they're forced to
use (if they are).
