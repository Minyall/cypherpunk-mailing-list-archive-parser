I certainly support this kind of idea, and have for a long time.
Crypto is well-suited for the "small languages" point of view (and the
competing points of view for object-oriented systems, production
systems, etc.).

Anything to abstract away the grungy details and hide them. TCL and
Perl are steps, and Strick (Henry Strickland) has of course been
working on his Skronk system, which does some of this.

Python is another possibility.

Some of the graphical-oriented languages like Prograph might be
useful. And I still think Smalltalk has promise, as many financial
institutions are using it to model and automate financial
transactions, which have obvious similarities to our crypto projects. 

The real obstacles are time and money. Corporations and banks doing
this work can put several people on these projects for several years,
while most Cypherpunks projects have to be fit in between "Data
Structures 202" and "Ren and Stimpy."
