I think it was around March '95. Adam Back(?) cross-posted an email
from sci.crypt (written by Chris Smith and concerning Cambridge(U.K.)
MP Anne Campbell).At some point Campbell posted to the list herself(?)
Sorry,I'm not very clear on this but for some reason I always thought
she wasn't the only MP involved. Yadayadayada... they're a bit like London buses-
nothing for hours then 3 or 4 arrive at the same time...
I've posted this to the list 'cause maybe someone can update the story...
I'd _still_ like to know if there has been any discussion(by MPs) since then 
Sorry about the bandwidth 
kc
p.s. Weather better now its been sold to the French.
