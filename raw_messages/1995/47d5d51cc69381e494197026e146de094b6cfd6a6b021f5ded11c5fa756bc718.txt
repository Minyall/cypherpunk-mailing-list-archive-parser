A secure get-only server for those of us who want security and the
normal functions required by most Web users most of the time.

That certainly increases the security.  Actually, we are now experimenting
with an execution server that allows some level of security while running
executables - have you tried using our secure forms interface?  Probably
not.

Actually, it uses TCP wrappers, which provides a different sort of access
control.

It is a secure, get-only server - as advertised.

Actually, it does redirect, but not in the way you are used to.

That's one of the ways it is made secure.  If you want to change
configurations, you have to recompile.  Otherwise, dangerous config
changes can easily be made - that would be risky.

It doesn't allow access to the whole file system, thus gaining
additional protection from configuration errors, misuse, mismanagement,
etc.

Actually, it's faster (I've clocked it) than the NCSA server.

The claim is that it does not weaken the security provided by the
operating system.  Nothing else.

Right.  It's a SECURE get only http server.  The usual sense of the word
means insecure.

I never boasted it was a prodigious feat at all.  In fact, I published
the fact that it was written in a few hours because I got tired of
worying about and fixing the insecure servers available over the net. 
It is in the process of being proven to meet the security requirements,
which is a prodigous feat (and which I am not doing).

Actually, not true.  The global fixed-length buffers, shared variables,
and lack of prototypes provide protection against allocation problems
which sould result in denial of service, corruptions at near-capacity
load, and other similar security problems.

The error checking on system call returns is quite thorough for the
purposes required.  Where no check is done, it is because the check
is not required.

I realize now that you think that all Ph.D.s program like you do, but in
this case, the style of the program is intended to meet the requirement
of the task.  Unlike many who learned in the "structured programming"
method, I believe that different program requirements call for different
programming styles.  This program is in a style suited to the
requirements which include, among other things, verifiability, small
size, ease of unsderstanding, controls on the flow of information,
integrity, availability, confidentiality, and redundancy.  But at any
rate, there's no accounting for taste.

If it doesn't, it's probably going to be very hard to demonstrate security.

Yet it services more than one request per minute, 24 hours, 7 days, and
has done so without denial of services, corruption, or leakage since its
first implementation.  It's so small it can be verified, it's faster
than the retail brand, and it doesn't have all the holes we keep finding
in tho other servers.  Different strokes for different folks.
