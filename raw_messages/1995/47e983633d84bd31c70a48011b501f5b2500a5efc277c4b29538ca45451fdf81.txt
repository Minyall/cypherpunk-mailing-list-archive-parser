	Precisely.  It reminds me of a talk given by Dr. John McQuilan
(I think it was at one of his High Performance Networks Conferences) where
he said that the big administrative headache for high speed networks vs.
low speed networks was simply the speed with which you could get in 
trouble.....  The analogy holds quite true in physical credit cards vs.
net credit....
