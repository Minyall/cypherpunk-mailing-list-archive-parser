The violation is in the *export*, not the sale.  You're suggestion is
that the US person developing software outside the country evades ITAR.
Mr Froomkin suggests otherwise.  His credentials seem sounder, but I,
for one, would like to hear his reasoning.

If it's true that ITAR makes such behavior illegal, then ITAR not only
inhibits freedom of speech, it inhibits freedom of *thought*.
