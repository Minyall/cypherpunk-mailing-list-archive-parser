After reading http://java.sun.com/1.0alpha3/doc/security/security.html my
(possibly faulty) understanding of Java security is that it will not allow
an applet to speak to IP addresses other than the one it was loaded from. 
I have a question:

Doesn't restriction this prevent an applet from checking some ecash it has
just received for validity with a bank computer?

Thanks - Bill
