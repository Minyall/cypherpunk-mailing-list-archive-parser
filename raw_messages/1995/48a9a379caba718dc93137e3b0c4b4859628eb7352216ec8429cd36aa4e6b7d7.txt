        The US Federal Trade Commission has launched a "Privacy Initiative"
to investigate whether the information collected at websites (either that
affirmatively submitted by a visitor via a form or information collected
based upon a visitor's selection of pages at a site to reflect personal
interests) should be the subject of regulation by the FTC.  
...............................................

	"Hey, we can't just stand around here with nothing to do.
	Give us something to regulate - anything, pro or con; we
	must regulate something."

Dang!
