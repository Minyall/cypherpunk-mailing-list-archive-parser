    figures. I'll give ipsec and ipsec-dev a look.  However, SUN does have
the power to make something happen on the high-power workstations, and the
fact they are making a portable package available in source code is
farther than anyone else has gone. 

    my experience over the last 15 years with Sun is that they do listen 
to outside "noise" and will move forward.  I for one will be contacting 
my Catalyst rep and the software develop group; the time has passed when 
you could get Andy, Bill, or Scott on the squawker.  I did complain to 
Scott about Catalyst changes --I did get a nice letter back, but I doubt 
it was authored by Scott.  Andy resigned last year, and I have not heard 
from Bill for years.

   other than the inferior method v. DH, is there anything else missing; 
I will probably pull the code package of the developers' access machine 
before the week is out just to take a look.
