There is a Win95 driver for the Zip drive that does not a TSR.  It is a
parallel to SCSI driver that is added through the "add hardware" control
panel.  I am not certain as to the order that the drivers load.  I will have
to test it.  (The driver was released on the 9th of this month with little
or no instructions.)

Having encrypted Zip drives would be VERY useful.  I will see if Borland's
latest update for the C++ compiler has any additional information as to some
of the driver interface issues (I doubt it, but it is worth a try).  It is
supposed to arrive "any day now", but it is backordered so who knows when I
will get it.
I may have to spend the bucks and get the Microsoft development disc
subscription again.  It will most likely have the information needed to
convert the drivers to something Win95 will understand.
