To whomever:
  I'm a reporter at the daily newspapers in Rochester, N.Y., researching a 
story on the recent spate of IP-spoof hack events. Supposedly a toad.com 
address was used by a person who broke into the San Diego supercomputer center 
a month ago. What's toad.com? I got your name from a web search that found an 
old communique.
  Can you be any help? I'm simply trying to reconstruct what happened.
