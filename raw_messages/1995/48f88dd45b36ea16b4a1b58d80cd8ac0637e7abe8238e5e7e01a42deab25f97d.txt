A very interesting claim.  Care to tell me what my "false claims" are,
or is it a secret?

Of course.  Let me tell you, though, what the real "beauty" of MIME is: 
It is that Internet mail was upgraded from ASCII-text-only to permit
multiple character sets, images, audio, video, and arbitrary extensions,
WITHOUT breaking any existing standards or software.  It is that
multimedia mail was defined in such a way that it can cross existing
ASCII-to-EBCDIC gateways and all manner of other bizarre mail-eating
paths and still be complete and comprehensible on the other end.  That's
the kind of "beauty" we were aiming at, so if your comments are geared
to any specific technical aspects of MIME, this may be the explanation. 
We considered practical functioning and interoperation to be the
operational definition of "beauty".  -- Nathaniel
