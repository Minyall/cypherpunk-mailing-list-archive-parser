On the bright side, mailto: hyperlinks containing extra-long domain names
seem to be handled comparatively safely in both Netscape and Mosaic. 
(Perhaps they just have longer buffers ? ;)

Neither Netscape nor Mosaic crashes on a mailto:// of the same length as a
ftp:// or http:// that _would_ crash them. Netscape appears to do some sort
of truncation at some point (silently); Mosaic gives you a standard "server
is not accessible or is refusing to serve the document" warning page.

(Netscape 1.1N, Mosaic 2.4, SunOS 4.1.2)
