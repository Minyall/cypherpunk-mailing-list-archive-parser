Colin Powell will be in Dallas at the Taylor's Bookstore out on Belt Line 
Rd. and Prestonwood (right next to Prestonwood Mall).  October 3 at 6 
PM.  I plan to be there - anyone else from the DFW area going?  Anyone 
have any questions they want asked (other than the usual "where do you 
stand on the administration's position regarding the use and exportation 
of so-called 'strong crypto' and the Clipper/Capstone fiasco"?
