I am not familiar with this incident, but I note that state authorities, 
not federal, were involved according to your post.  Was the consent 
decree also filed in state court?  And even if it was in federal court, 
was the legal theory on which the plaintiffs proceeded based on NY state 
law or federal law??

The White House also reads publicly available newspapers and magazines (I 
assume).  How is accessing a Web site different from that?

Is the World Wide Web your idea of "electronic surveillance 
technology"??  I would agree that packet sniffing is a different problem, 
but accessing an open Web site seems reasonable to me.  Would you prefer 
that the staffers use home computers to do this (in an attempt to hide 
their tracks)?  As far as I know, this was all done openly and the Web 
site chose, right or wrong, to reveal the contents of their log files to 
someone.  Again, what about the complaints heard in this forum recently 
about law enforcement's obtaining similar log files from the Web site set 
up regarding the child's kidnapping?

Not only "those in power" but those in the public eye/public figures.  On 
that rationale, Phil Zimmermann is probably a public figure with respect 
to encryption ...

That, of course, depends on what you mean by "us" and "you."
