The reason is, and I do not presume to speak for other individuals on 
this list, the Economist looks at the world from an independent (i.e. not 
owned by one of the major publishing houses, if I'm not mistaken) point 
of view, and is not afraid to pursue different analysis of a topic.

I will also venture that the closest that we have in the US is Forbes.
