With regard to SSL and Netscape not being open to outside developers,
several leading e-mail outfits, including Qualcomm, Netscape, Frontier,
etc., are working on an interoperable secure e-mail standard called
"Secure/MIME," or "S/MIME."

And even if Netscape will not allow outside developers--like J. Random
Cypherpunk--access to the code internals and incorporaton of his work into
Netscape's final compiled code, not surprisingly, there are still numerous
options for hooking in. Hal Finney described some ideas, and I'm sure more
exist.
