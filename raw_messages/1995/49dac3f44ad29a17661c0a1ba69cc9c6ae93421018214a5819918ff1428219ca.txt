| I'm about to implement an OTPasswd (mostly like s/key) scheme to my

| favorite one way strong hash function (MD5), and S your seed+secret
| passwd) could possibly be patented somehow and thus preventing using a
| similar scheme without getting a license (from
| bellcore?),.... if there are any usage conditions/restrictions?,... 

	There is an IETF working group standardizing OTPassword
technology.  not sure how active it still is.
