  I don't think it is a coincidence that Microsoft also made their
major announcements today. I doubt the feeding frenzy over Internet
related stocks and technology is even close to over. Having seen
the new Shockwave plugin for Netscape, I expect Macromedia stock
to go up again soon. (it already went up 50% after the original Netscape
announcement of Director integration)
