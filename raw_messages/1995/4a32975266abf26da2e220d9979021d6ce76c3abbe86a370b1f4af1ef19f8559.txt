There is another technique by which the source is obscured by an
automatic rewrite mechanism.  This provides for both obscuration of the
source and the ability to determine who originated illicit copies.  I
believe it was first implemented by Gimbel Software as part of their
C-terp system (unpublished).  A paper on techniques for doing this has
also been published:
