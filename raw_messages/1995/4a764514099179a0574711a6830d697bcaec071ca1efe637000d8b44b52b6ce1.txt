I'm not a lawyer, though I hang out on the "Cyberia" list and I watched a
lot of the OJ trial. :-}

Seriously, it is hard to "design a promising test case" in this way.
They--the Pennsylvania law enforcement authorities--don't have to take the
bait. They can just do nothing, until an incident arises which provokes
them. Maybe next year, maybe five years from now. Such an incident is
likely to be one that they figure will make for a popular prosecution. One
of the Four Horseman, probably.
