	Going on my past experiences with this sort of situation, I
think the problem is

	a) Oklahoma University is public (seems true from
http://www.uoknor.edu/) 

	b) The state of Oklahoma has an "open public records" law

	so

	c) someone decided that everything stored on the University's
computer system was therefore a "public record" (since the computer is
"owned" by the public), and thus had to be accessible by law.

	This seems to be approximately what's going on:

	"Drafted by Associate Chief Counsel Kurt Ockershauser a year
ago, the policy will make a legal statement that e-mail is running on
state property, Colaw said. He said the policy is not an invasion of privacy."

	Someone needs to explain to him that what he is doing is not
legally required, and perhaps violates the ECPA.
