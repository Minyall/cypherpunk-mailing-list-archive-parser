"Our" anti-GAK position.

I would like to hear Jim Clark say "GAK is bad".

I would also like to hear him, and you, refrain from using the phrase
"key escrow" and instead use the phrase "Government Access to Keys".

I draw your attention to the fact that Bill Gates did not use the 
intentionally misleading phrase "key escrow" in his book.
