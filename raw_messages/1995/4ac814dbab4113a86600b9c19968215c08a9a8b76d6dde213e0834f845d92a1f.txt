Hence comes my response:

I think that both formal methods and defense-in-depth are important
in building an effective protection program.

	- Formal methods are very important for detecting flaws and
	  producing what is commonly called "Fault Intollerance", but

	- Defense-in-depth is important because there are no perfect
	  technical defenses.  This is commonly called "Fault Tollerance"

The most secure (and often highest quality) systems combine fault
intollerance with fault tollerance to produce high quality parts and a
system that continues operating safely even when those high quality
parts fail.
