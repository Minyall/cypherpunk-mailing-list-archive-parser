    Just got back a message from Julf's remailer that my Anonymous
    message failed (wrong password). Needless to say, I didn't try to
    send one through the remailer. The message it was refering to is
    the one I sent to the list earlier. Is this a repeat of the an/na
    problems we had in the past?

Yes.  The bounce message that I got back included this header line:

  X-Envelope-To: an157790

I sent a message to <na157790@anon.penet.fi> and got back a reply
stating that the person had unsubscribed hirself and may resubscribe
``in the clear''.
