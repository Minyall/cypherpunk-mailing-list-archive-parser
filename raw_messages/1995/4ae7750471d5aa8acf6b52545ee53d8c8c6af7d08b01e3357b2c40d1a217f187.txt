As a hardware type, I'd prefer a diode noise generator over a
radioactivity detector. I'd hate for the Fort to be tempted to fudge the
latter's output by flooding my house from a black helicopter...

But lacking same....

Can you take the time between two effectively async events, and use the
low order bits of same?

For example, time between a netverk pack arriving and the next tick of
the TOD clock? And/or the system's disk IO or such? 

Or: Choose a site at random. Ping it. Use low order bits of that time
with something above.

I'm sure most such schemes are not usable. But all it takes is one...
