It's great that it's on the upswing again, as it was dipping
pretty low a few weeks back. 

I don't think the "crisis" will be over until there are at least 50
remailers, spread over at least five countries. Each supporting the
usual features, and with some reasonable traffic.

With luck, and with "remailer accounts," this could happen by this
summer.

But it's a good sign.
