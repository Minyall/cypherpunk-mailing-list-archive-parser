   Internet Mess: Return to Sender [Editorial]

   The negotiations between House and Senate conferees on the
   restriction of pornography in cyberspace have gone from bad
   to worse. A tentative accommodation arrived at last night,
   which the conferees must still vote to accept or kill,
   combines some of the worst of a broad array of misguided
   restrictions on speech, none of them likely to protect
   children.
