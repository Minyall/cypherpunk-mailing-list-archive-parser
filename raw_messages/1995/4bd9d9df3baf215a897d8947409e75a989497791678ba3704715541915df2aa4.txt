	Sorry, but the RICO case had nothing to do with any of the
murders.  And if you're gonna go after OR&company for encouraging the
murder of doctors, I hope you're also going after certain rappers for
encouraging the murder of police.

	And the treatment you received then was wrong.  Does that make
admittedly less violent treatment of OR&company right?  At risk of your
calling it a 'nursery rhyme', or something similarly trivializing, two
wrongs don't make a right.
