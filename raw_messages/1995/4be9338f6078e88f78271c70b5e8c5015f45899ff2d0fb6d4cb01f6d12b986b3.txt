You would not be allowed to export a browser where the crypto library is
a dynamically-loaded library.

If you wrote a "browser toolkit", you would have to take special care to
hide even the names of the crypto functions in the library symbol table.

If you want to do offshore crypto development, your best bet is to document
the required interfaces and protocols in a publication which is available to
anyone, as this is supposedly protected by the First Amendment.

On the other hand, I encourage you to try to do otherwise.
