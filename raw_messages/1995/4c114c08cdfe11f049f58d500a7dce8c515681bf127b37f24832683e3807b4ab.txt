| Perry.  Normally I try my best to ignore you.

	When did PGP claim to be perfect?  Its not; and the point is
not to obtain 100% confidence in someone, but a useable level of
confidence.  If the remailer chains work, then it would be tough to
find out who you are.  If we do find out who you are, your integrity
shell will tell you that your PGP binary was tampered with.  If we
don't know who you are, then your machine is safe from just about
anything other than a thorough sweep of all the net connected users in
Canada.

	So, please explain the threat that causes you to think that
'pretty good' is worthless in this context.
