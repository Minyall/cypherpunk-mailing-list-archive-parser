I don't think that e.g., a stealth PGP would demand much of a fee, or 
that such a fee would make many of the people involved in the various\
 intellectual rights of the program happy.

I might add that I don't want the software for myself, I want it for the 
effect it will have on potential legislation/enforcement.

If some other 'punks want to get together and fund such projects, I will 
participate.  However, putting the burden of financing this venture 
(which will have no immediate economic return, as I will support no 
venture which does not result in fully public software) entirely on my 
shoulders just because I happen to believe it will soon be necessary to 
maintain any strong crypto ability, is unrealistic, and I believe you 
know it.

I'm working on 3, I don't believe it exists.

Cute, but that's about all.
