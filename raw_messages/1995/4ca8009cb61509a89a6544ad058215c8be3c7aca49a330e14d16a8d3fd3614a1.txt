	Buffer overflow seems like a much greater concern when dealing
with a server. Particularly one which is supposedly "secure", and
accessing "secured" documents. Even with the server running as
'nobody' if someone can implement buffer overflow to get access to
documents they shouldn't then that would count as a pretty significant
hack.

	I suspect that the server is where the majority of the bugs
lie. My Hack Netscape page emphasizes the server as a place to look
for holes.
