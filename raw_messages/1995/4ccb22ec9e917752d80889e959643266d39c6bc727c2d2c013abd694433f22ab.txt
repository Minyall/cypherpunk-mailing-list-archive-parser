Tattoo this on your arm: N.A.T.O.  If you work overseas, you deduct 70
kilobucks  from your gross income on your 1040.  And NATO civilian
employees pay NO INCOME TAX TO ANY OTHER NATO COUNTRY.
Good bennies package, too.

Downside? A Glacial Slug-like Beauracracy which doesn't seem to get alot done.
3-Year contracts only.  Major competition from Euro's who seem to know about the
perks.

Organization Motto:  "It's a cushy job, but somebody's got to do it."
