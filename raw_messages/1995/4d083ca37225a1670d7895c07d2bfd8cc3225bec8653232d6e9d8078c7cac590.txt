winpgp2.6 was the most succesfull pgp shell I could find but the interface was stale and non descript. 
including the fact that when it executed the commands it opened a window and I was interfacing with the 
dos pgp interface, I found that a little redundant for a shell program; but then again I'm not sure if an 
interface with pgp can be done any other way.
