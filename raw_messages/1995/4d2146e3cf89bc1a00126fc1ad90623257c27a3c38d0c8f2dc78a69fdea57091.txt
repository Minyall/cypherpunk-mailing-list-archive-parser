This also corresponds to IBM's development of its "IPC"
"network appliance" (also due out 1Q '96) to challenge
the desktop PC for Internet use.

It parallels as well IBM's reported work on a "Microkernal"
which may feature encryption, authentication and security
hooks.

IBM's IPC will probably use an Intel chip (WSJ today).

Which leads to speculation:

Would chip-fabbers covertly Fortezza chips to get export ok?

Motorola, HP, IBM, others long-linked to USG are ever ready 
to gobble international market share in the national
interest.

Intel, sure, world-class fab plants planting chip-secrets.

Wonder if that key escrow protest to Gore is a cover for
economic actions authorized by National Security D&D?
