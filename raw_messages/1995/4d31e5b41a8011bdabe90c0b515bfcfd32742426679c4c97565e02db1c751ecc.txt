I believe that the security related ones in those applications are
well within human ability to fix -- simply implementing some hygenic
coding practices stops them. I don't believe that is the case with
Java implementations. I don't know how I'd manage to produce a "safe"
Java. Its a neat programming language, by the way -- its only when you
rig yourself to automatically run code produce by hostile people that
the issue comes up.

Thats true, but again, there is the alternative of gaining the
functionality with truly safe languages.

Unfortunately, it will be very hard to stop people from doing just
that.
