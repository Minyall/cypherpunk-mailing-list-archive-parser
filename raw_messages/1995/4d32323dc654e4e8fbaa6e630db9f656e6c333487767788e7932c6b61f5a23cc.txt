This discussion puzzles me.  I thought we were bombarded with 
reputational goods all the time:  brand names, stocks (what is a purchase 
in the 2ndary market but a purchase of reputation most of the time?), 
degrees from famous universities.  Anonymity compliates matters only if 
no systems of unique ID is used.  Throw in digital signatures and we are 
back at brand names, aren't we?
