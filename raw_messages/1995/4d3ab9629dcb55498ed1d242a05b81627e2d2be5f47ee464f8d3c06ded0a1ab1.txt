I don't care. Anyone claiming to represent "cypherpunks" will be lying
-- at the very least, they will not be representing Tim May, and they
will not be representing me.

Given that there is no organization, you can't get the organization to
agree on anything anyway. If you claim to represent the group, you'll
just be lying.

No one is going to be representing "Perry Metzger", either. I don't
want anyone on earth pretending to represent me, as I'm the only
person who can state my views authoritatively.

Who gives a damn, anyway? Its not as though we have a "cypherpunks"
reputation to uphold.

If you want to get associated with something, go out and crack a
cryptosystem on your own. Quit thinking "group".
