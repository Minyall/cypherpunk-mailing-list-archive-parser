All this paranoid talk about the dangers of thumbprints on ID cards, about
driver's licenses, and about magstripes got me to thinking.

So, I accessed my NLETS (National Law Enforcement Telecommunications
System) and downloaded my own record:

Citizen-Unit ASCII Name: "Timothy Christopher May"
NLETS Actual Name: G0Yj34C1qm92H7u
Known Aliases: "Klaus! von Future Prime," "Lance," "Nick Szabo"

SSN: 227-80-5823

I don't see what the big deal is. The NLETS record implies I'm some kind of
security threat, but also correctly notes that I'm an Aryan, so I guess I'm
safe.
