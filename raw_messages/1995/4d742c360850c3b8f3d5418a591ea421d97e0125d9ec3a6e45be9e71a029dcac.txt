OK, so suppose I want to send my credit card number to Egghead Software.
I get one of these new-fangled certificates from somebody, in which
VeriSign has certified that key 0x12345678 has hash 0x54321.  I think we
can agree that by itself this is not useful.  So, it will also bind in
some attribute.  What will that attribute be?
