I didn't quite understand the "corporate speak" here.  It sounds like
something coming from Bosnia or something.  It's Greek to me.

What would make a University less secure than a corporation??

Universities (at least the ones, I've checked) have entire departments
and theoreticians devoted to Computers ... companies usually don't.  

I'd think that Universities are much, much more secure environments than
corporations are.  Doesn't Microsoft know this??  Or is this unique to
Seattle??
