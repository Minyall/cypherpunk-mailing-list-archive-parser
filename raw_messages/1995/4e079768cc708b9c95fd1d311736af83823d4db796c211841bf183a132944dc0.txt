No, they are trying to protect people. I'm about the biggest critic of
CERT out there, but I don't disagree with what they said -- although
its insufficient.

in the nearest internet drafts repository.

No they don't. I'm talking across one right now. I barely if ever
notice it.

Please confine the paranoia to places where it is justified. Firewalls
are a good and important thing.
