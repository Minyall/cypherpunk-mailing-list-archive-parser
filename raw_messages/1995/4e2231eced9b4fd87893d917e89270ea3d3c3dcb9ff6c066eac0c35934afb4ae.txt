I must disagre here and side with *gasp* FC.
If your so called *secure* server happens to get broken into by grace of 
god, you want to know at least where the attack came from. If Netscape
wants to hide internet hostnames they would to well setting up to DNS 
servers, one for internal resolutions where IPs resolve to their real 
hostname, and one in front of the firewall that resolves all IP's to 
unkown.netscape.com.
