If it's a cheap source of higher-than-background radiation, try a smoke
detector. They are getting darn cheap these days, and my First Alert Model
83R says it contains 1.0 Microcurie of Americium 241. This should raise the
count rate significantly over background. And if one isn't enough, you could
always get several, remove the module with the radioactive materials in it
(it's a sort of black cylinder in mine) from several, and put them all in a
box with the radiation detector. As I remember, I bought 2 or three of these
detectors in a single package for about $15 3 years ago. They should be
quite cheap by now.

Although, I don't think it has the same sort of humor value as the pillow.
(What's that hooked to your computer Mike? It's a pillow Bob. Don't ask.)
