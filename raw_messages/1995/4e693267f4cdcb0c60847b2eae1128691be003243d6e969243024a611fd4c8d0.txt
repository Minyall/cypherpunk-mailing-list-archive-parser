OK, OK, OK--

Robbie Westmorland has persuaded me that an action alert before
the bill has been "calendared" could be counterproductive. The reason
is that until the bill is scheduled to come before a committee, many
do not know it exists, and we do not want to tell them! There is a
possibility that the bill might be quietly forgotten about, up to the time
that it is "calendared".


Is there any reason we could not prepare an action alert in advance
to be released immediately when/if it is scheduled to come before
a subcommittee?
