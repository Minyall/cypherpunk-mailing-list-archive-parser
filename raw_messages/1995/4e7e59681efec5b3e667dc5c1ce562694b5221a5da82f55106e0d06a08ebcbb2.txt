Modern courts have replaced the rocks used in earlier days with law books,
of course. The need for heavy law books to press the accused is one of the
main reasons electronic versions are not being adopted.

This practice also gave us the term "the full weight of the law" as well as
the symbol of the law as being a blind woman carrying a scale filled with
rocks to place upon the guilty to convince them to confess. (This was
originally done in the court's torture chamber, from which we get the term
"judge's chamber.")

Sometimes the "scales of justice" can be "tipped," which derives from the
practice of tipping the judge to get favorable rulings.
