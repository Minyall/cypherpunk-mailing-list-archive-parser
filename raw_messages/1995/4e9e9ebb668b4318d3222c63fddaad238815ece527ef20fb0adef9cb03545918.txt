AAAAAAAAAAAKKKKKKKKK

My server has had problems with both incoming ftp and rz. Not only is it
very flakey, but they've mis-applied a timeout lately, meaning I have to
press a key every 10 minutes during ftp or the process gets killed. Oh,
and they did that just before becoming very busy.

I delayed announcing my keyring until I could physically transfer the
keyring by disk. After getting mail reporting it being corrupted, I had
to delete it. It's possible that when I mounted my disk, it could have
defaulted into an ascii conversion. I am currently trying to uuencode
the entire file and mail it to myself from my local machine. (Heh)

If that fails, the keyring will unfortunately not be available until
tomorrow, when I can physically transfer it.

Sorry for the delay.

Don
