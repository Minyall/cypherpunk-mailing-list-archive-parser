Although I hardly oppose the construction of "headerless"
cryptographic protocols, they make key management in any sort of a
reasonable system a living hell. If you work for an organization
maintaining a reasonable number of keys -- say a few hundred at some
institution -- you will have to linearly search them to find which one
is the right one. What a royal pain.

Rapid deployment in ordinary software is, of course, preferable.
