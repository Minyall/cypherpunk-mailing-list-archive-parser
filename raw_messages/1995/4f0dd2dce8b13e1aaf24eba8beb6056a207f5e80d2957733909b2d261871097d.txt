For personal reasons (my dislike for big mailboxes) I've set up 
hypermail to archive the Cypherpunks list at:

http://got.net/CypherpunksArchive/

If someone else has done this, I'll stop fiddling with the configs and 
come use yours.

I just set it up, so it's rather empty today... If someone has a 
non-html archive of the messages, I'm up to tossing some perl around and 
converting it for the archive.
