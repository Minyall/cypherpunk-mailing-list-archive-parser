Cypherpunk Type I?  Ok, what are the other types?  Should there be a
type specification like there is for RAID, or the Body Armor Threat
levels?

I would like to try my hand at writing a remailer, but I would like to
see standards, and level/type specifications.

E.g. The body armor threat levels are I - VI
VI is able to physically stop a 50 BMG round, i.e. prevent
penetration.  The wearer of the armor would likely die from the shock,
but would not be penetrated.  Level II includes all the abilites of
level I and then some, III = II + some more, etc until VI which is
all of the abilities in body armor.

I believe that RAID levels are 1-5, and I seem to remember that it is
graduated like the body armor threat levels, so that 2=1 + some stuff,
4=3 + some stuff, etc.

Should we come up with a similar type of graduated system, and specs
for each, with some kind of negotiation between remailers, so that they
can determine what levels to use to communicate with various
remailers?

Then we could talk in terms of type 6, for example, having all the
abilities of levels 1-5 and then some.
