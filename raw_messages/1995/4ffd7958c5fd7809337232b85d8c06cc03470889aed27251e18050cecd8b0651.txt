MC/Visa require the reversibility of transactions as a condition of their 
merchant agreements.  It's not something peculiar to FV.  In fact, under 
certain conditions it is mandated by federal law.  Escort services have a 
similar problem as far as non-returnability goes, but I don't know how they 
finesse their way around it.
