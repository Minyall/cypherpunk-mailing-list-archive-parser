The fundamental principle here is that an e-mail message is just so
many bits of 1's and 0's. It can never, in it's own capacity, steal,
molest or kill. It is therefore not unethical to run a no-log 'fortress
remailer' and auto-delete ALL complaints, without exception. It might
not be feasible to do so if one wants to stay out of jail, but hope-
fully this will change with the rapid increase in country domains
and the soon-to-come digicash market. Discussions of programming to
make fortress remailers work and to make them easily exportable to
African Linux-boxes are interesting. So are discussions of expected
repercussions on society. Ethical discussions of what is abuse or not
are better left to the clergy.
