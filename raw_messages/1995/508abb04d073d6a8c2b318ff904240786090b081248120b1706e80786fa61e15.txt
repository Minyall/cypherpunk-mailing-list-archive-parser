Yep, getting a decent 32 bit app for windows / DOS seems to be a
problem alright.  Pity as the 32 bit app runs appreciably faster.

I made a plea for a DJGCC (DOS port of GNU cc) compiled binary, that
would run under bog standard DOS, and with full 32 bit, if we can find
anyone with the software to do it.  Any takers?

Ready, steady, go!
