   Tell us about it in 6 months, Tim, when you've grown out of Netscape. You
   sound like someone who's totally enamored with their "-works" app. Most
   people end up using more specialized apps when they hit the wall with
   something which won't get all those "general purposes" taken care of...

While I understand what Tim's been saying about integrated apps, since
my Dad continues to use Microsoft Works instead of Wordperfect which is
much better, my Dad is limiting himself in ways that ultimately Tim isn't
going to accept.

Remember, he also raved about the Newton for the first couple of months.
I wonder if he's replaced the one he sold yet.

Phil
