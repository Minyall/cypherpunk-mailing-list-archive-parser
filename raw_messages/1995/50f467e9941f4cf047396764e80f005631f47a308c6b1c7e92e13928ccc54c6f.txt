Having received this message from majordomo@toad.com and seeing an 
apparent return of the mail-multiplication problem of recent days, I am 
beginning to suspect that some bozo has subscribed the c-punx list to the 
c-punx list.  A curse upon them and for good measure, a recurse upon them.

Finger for public key               \   )
Strong-arm for secret key             /    <--  minor groove
Thumb-screws for pass-phrase        /   )
