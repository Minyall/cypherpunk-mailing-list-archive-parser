So....once we get past what seems to be your utter refusal to consider 
the possibility that government could ever do anything right ....how do 
we ensure that those skyscrapers don't fall down on us?  That the surgeon 
who is going to open me up knows something about surgery?  That my money 
is at least somewhat safe in the bank?

If you are willing to trust your life to Adam Smith's 'invisible hand', 
then good luck to you.  I prefer to see the hand out on the table.
