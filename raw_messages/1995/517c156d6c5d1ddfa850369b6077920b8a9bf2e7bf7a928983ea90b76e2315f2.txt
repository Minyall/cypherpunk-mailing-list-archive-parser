This is an interesting notion, but one I don't think is quite right.
The anonymous remailer is not merely a courier.  It actively modifies
the message envelope by removing any indication of its origin.  The
main issue in Hal's quoted complaints are that the receiver isn't able
to contact the sender.  This fact is a direct result of the action of
the remailer.

Consider what would happen if a remailer were set up that *didn't*
remove the "From:" data.  Anonymizing remailer operators could attempt
to limit complaints by forwarding everything through the non-anonymizer
to make it the last link.  Who do you think would get the complaints?
The last anonymizer.

I had a similar idea that I mentioned to Hal in a private message.  How
about a POP server that authenticates with crypto, and accepts and
holds email addressed to the keyid of a PGP key?  You send email to
4466A801@keymail.com it holds them for 30 days (or whatever) and
discards them.  When I connect to the server to retrieve my mail, it
asks for my public key, encrypts a random challenge with it, and I tell
it the decrypted version.  Having proved that I can read messages
encrypted to the key, it delivers messages addressed to the hash of the
key.  It might also allow me to configure an address where
notifications of new messages should be sent.

It's an interesting twist on the anon.penet.fi system, since you
needn't bother tracking all the nym/email mappings, and *can't* give
CoS any incriminating information.
