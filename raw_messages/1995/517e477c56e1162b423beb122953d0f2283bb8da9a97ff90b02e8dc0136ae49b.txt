Sorry for the noise, but I just discovered that the librand.shar file
that I put in my ftp directory got garbled somewhere along the line.
I've repaired the damage and put a correct version of the file in:
    ftp://ftp.research.att.com/dist/mab/librand.shar
(Worst of all, the garbled version actually compiled, but you can
tell you have it by its failure to link properly).

Again sorry for the noise.
