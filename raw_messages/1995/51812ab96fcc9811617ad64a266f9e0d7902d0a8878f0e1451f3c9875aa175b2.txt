Well beta2 is heaps better than beta1, I can still crash beta2 with or
without java under win3, sgi, solaris and alpha but it has to be used
for a longer and few crashes are repeatable.  Plus lots of new gizmos,
the certificate authority interface (thanks Jeff).

I've got to note just one thing -- what about the Netscape LiveScript
language?  is it opening up the same security can of worms as java?  I
realise that it provides functionality specific to browsing only (no
network/files) but the potential for bugs when you add another
language must increase.
