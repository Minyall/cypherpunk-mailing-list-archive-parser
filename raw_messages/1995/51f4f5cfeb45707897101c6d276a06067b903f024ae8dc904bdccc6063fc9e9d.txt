Its kind of ugly, too. The new PEM-MIME stuff should do much better,
but its no longer really PEM per se. Look at the drafts if you are
interested.

Just so you know, Kipp, there is no real support for X.500 directories
over the internet, and there never will be. No one likes the things

going to be stored in the DNS.
