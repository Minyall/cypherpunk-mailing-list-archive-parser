Sounds like someone just threw down a gauntlet.

Is it even possible to do the precomputations in a distributed manner in
less than a year or two?  Or maybe starting a few years down the road?
It would be nice to give Photuris a chance to get established before the
least common denoninator shared modulus gets taken out, if we even can
take it out.
