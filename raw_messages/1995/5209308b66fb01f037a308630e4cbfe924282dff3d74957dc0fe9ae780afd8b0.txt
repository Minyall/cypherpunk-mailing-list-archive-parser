I got the following from mjos@math.jyu.fi a couple of months ago.
Unfortunately I was unable to attend or listen on mbone.  Does anyone
know more about this?

[Free translation: The GSM encryption algorithm is of exactly that
type.  Chambers tried to have this particular presentation over an
year ago, but at that time the official side interfered and the
presentation was cancelled.  He has found holes in the algorithm that
can be used to make decryption (without key) very quick.

PS.  Those of us who can get access to mbone, can follow it live.]
