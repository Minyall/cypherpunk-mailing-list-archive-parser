	Some time ago, I posted a reply to an allegation that the 
Spotlight was a Klan paper. 

	Of course, it is more Liberty Lobby/CIA, with Bo Gritz on the Board.

	The point of this post is that those who want to know 
what is up with the Spotlight need to subscribe to Searchnet, which 
covers all the information of like sort. There was also a wonderful post 
recently hailing hackers as the ones who are most likely to prevent 
government sponsored crypto-terror censorship.

	Those who would like the post, speak up.

	Those who want to subscribe to Searchnet, likewise.

	Hope this does not get in the way of PGP implementation.

	Onwards, Lee
