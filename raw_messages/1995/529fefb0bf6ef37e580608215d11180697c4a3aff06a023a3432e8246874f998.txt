I really tried to resist but....

1 request a minute!!!!  That's a whopping 1440 a day!  Try 20+ a second or
over a million a day which is the current rough load which most of our
servers on our site handle...(our peak day last week was 17 million hits).

I don't disagree that there is value in producing a trivial server which
can be guaranteed to have zero bugs (since it is so small).  It, however,
should be treated as an intellectual excercise.  Comparing it to a production-level
retail server is simply meaningless..they have different goals (as your last
post emphasized)...
