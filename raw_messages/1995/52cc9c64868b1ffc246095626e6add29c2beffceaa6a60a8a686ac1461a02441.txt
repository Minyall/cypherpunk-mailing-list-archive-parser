S. 982 is "the other bill" introduced recently in the Senate, the
National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1995 (introduced
by Sens. Kyl, Leahy and Grassley).  Since it has bipartisan support plus
the support of the Attorney General I thought it might be a good idea to
see what it really does.

I've made available via WWW the following documents:

	The text of S. 982: The National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1995; 
        The text of 18 USC 1030 as it is currently; 
        The text of 18 USC 1030 as modified by S. 982; 
        Sen. Kyl's statement introducing S. 982; 
        Sen. Leahy's statement introducing S. 982; 
        A section-by-section analysis of S. 982 provided by Sens. Kyl and Leahy; 
 
All are available from my "Legal Issues" page at:

	http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/~bal/legal/

The "text of 18 USC 1030 as modified by S. 982" is perhaps the most
interesting, since it shows both text removed by the bill (in italics)
and text added by the bill (in boldface).
