  I am not an official spokesperson of netscape.  What I post here
is either my opinion, my interpretation of netscape's public statements
(press releases), or my interpretation of the sentiments of my co-workers.
Obviously management know that I do spend some time reading and writing
messages on cypherpunks, but I've never been told to do it or to stop
doing it.

  I'm here to learn and to contribute, which I think is why most
people are here.

  Which problem are you talking about?

  I don't believe this statement to be true.  How about the following:

	If you download a program to your computer that is infected
	with a virus, the virus could send all of the files on your
	hard disk to anyone it wants to, or it could wipe your entire
	hard disk.

  Now, what does this have to do with running netscape?
