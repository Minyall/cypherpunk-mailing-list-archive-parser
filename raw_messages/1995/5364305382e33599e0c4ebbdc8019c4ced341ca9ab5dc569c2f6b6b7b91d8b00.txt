Perry,  I listed a huge number of the things that anonymous
is complaining about, under the thread heading "Even more 
holy war on unix"

I listed them precisely in response to flames like yours
challenging me to name such things.

If you ask "Such as" then someone is going to answer again.

The Holy Warriors of the Sacred Unix demand facts, then
scream like nasty children when someone answers this demand.

They say "Put up or shut up", and then send a torrent of 
savage hate mail when somebody puts up.
