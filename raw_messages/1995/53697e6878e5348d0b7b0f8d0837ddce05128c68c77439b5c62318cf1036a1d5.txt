  This is what our press release said:

	An updated version of Netscape Navigator 1.1 for Mac OS
	and Unix and Netscape Navigator 1.2 for Windows 3.1 and
	Windows 95 will be available for downloading by existing
	customers on the Internet next week.

There is still a link to it on our home page.
All press accounts I've seen (this is not exhaustive!!) have also
said early next week.

  I don't have an archive of every message I've sent to this list,
so I can't check myself, but if I somehow led you to believe that the
fix would be out friday, then I apologize.  You can look at this
url for the official company statement:
