Robin Hanson, who developed (so far as I know) the modern focus on idea
futures, was an active Bay Area person. His interests parallel ours, and I
think he was on the CP list for a while back in '92.

(Some of his game theory simulations--on betting markets and
preference-revealing--were a main inspiration for the "Crypto Anarchy Game"
I put on at the first Cypherpunks meeting in '92.)
