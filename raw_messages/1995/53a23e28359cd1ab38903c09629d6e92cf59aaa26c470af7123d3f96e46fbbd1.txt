FWIW, for the record, I'm uncomfortable with this. It sounds unethical, IMHO.

For me at least, targeting the key of some particular server that happens to
be out there is over the line.

If you said you would have someone volunteer a supposedly secure server for
the challenge, I'd have no qualms.

But hey, that's just one tentacle's opinion....
