IF it manages to get a word in edgeways, yes.

However, I fear some ACKS are being lost :-(

Indeed -- it's meant to run unattended.

HOWEVER, due to the problems with loosing ACKs, it would be useful to send
the output to a log file, and then check that all the scanned segments made it
to the server [[ NB: stats updates are currently manual !! ]]

> BTW how can I log brloop's output into a file and not to the screen?

sh:	brloop >> logfile 2>&1 &
csh	brloop >>& logfile &		(I think)

Aliter:	"nohup brloop &" might do it
