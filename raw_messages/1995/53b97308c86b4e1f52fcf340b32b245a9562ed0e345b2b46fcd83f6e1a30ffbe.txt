I get 11100 keys/sec with Linux/gcc 2.5.8 on a 486/66, optimized with
-O2 and -fomit-frame-pointer.

-fforce-mem and -funroll-loops made the program run more slowly.

I also tried -ffast-math -finline-functions -fforce-addr -fcaller-saves
which seemed to make no difference.


Now maybe when they get the server working again I can actually try
running this. :(
