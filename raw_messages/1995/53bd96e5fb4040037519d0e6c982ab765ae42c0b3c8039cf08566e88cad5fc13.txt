I think that this is a very large mistake. Allow me to explain why.

La Macchia (sp?) and Odlyzko (sp?) have a very nice result which shows
that once you've done enough precalculation on a particular modulus,
you can break any subsequent Diffie-Hellman operation performed on
that modulus with (for our purposes) no effort. 512 bits is, from what
I can tell, not far out of the realm of possibility for what someone
could try to crack with current machines given enough effort.

about likely misspelling your name.]
