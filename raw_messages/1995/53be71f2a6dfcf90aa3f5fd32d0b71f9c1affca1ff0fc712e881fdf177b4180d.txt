Actually, the file you got was pgp262s.tar.gz (or something equivalent.)
Inside this tarfile you found pgp262si.tar, which is the Source, Internal
tarfile.  It is not am international version; it is the US version.

Also, neither the US version nor any international versions have weak 
crypto.

Enjoy!
