Actually, I do say that, but in a slightly different way.  If I want to
estimate the cost to get home from the airport, I might say "I have two
friends with cars who might give me a ride, or I could rent a car from
Hertz."  Most of the time a free car will be available; once in the last
couple of years I rented a car at the airport to get home.  My average
cost hasn't been zero, but has certainly been a lot less than $40 ($29
from National, but that's not important now).

Finding a cheap or free ride from one place to another should not be a
problem if you live in a city of helpful people driving to and fro in
vehicles with no passengers.

There are lots of free seats on the CPU bus today!

Share and enjoy...
