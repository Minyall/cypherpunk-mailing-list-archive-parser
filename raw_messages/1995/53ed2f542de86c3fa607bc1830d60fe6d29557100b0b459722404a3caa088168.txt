Doug and/or Amanda Barnes posted some Java crypto stuff a while back,
I think using RSAREF; don't know the platform issues.

As far as timing goes, Bad Guys can always run accurate timing on

However, it may be worthwhile to allow the Java browser users
to set the resolution on the clocks available to Java scripts.
