Hmmm. Not as secure, but how about this... (a kind of script)

begin A
  if active(mailer@foo.com) mail(mailer@foo.com,B,C)
  elseif active(mailer@bar.com) mail(mailer@bar.com,B,C)
end

begin B
 { next block of scripts for chain... remailer would encrypt B and C
 blocks for appropriate mailer }
end

begin C
 { this block would be cargo... could even contain multiple messages? }
end

That's a pseudoscript, but you get the idea... (no pun intended ;)
