Same here -- I have an original Compaq "Sewing Machine" Portable with 
a 40MB hard card.  Of course the HD sticks and needs a good whacking
sometimes, and the last floppy came out of the drive smoking and
covered in grease.  (You DO have a 5 1/4" 360K floppy don't you?)

My service, however is $2.  That's because all keys are encrypted against
my key, which is unfortunately escrowed with the fellow listed above.

Sorry about having to pass along the extra costs. :-)
