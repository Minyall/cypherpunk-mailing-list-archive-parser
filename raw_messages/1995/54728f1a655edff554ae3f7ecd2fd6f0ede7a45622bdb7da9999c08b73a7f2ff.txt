        One question: Most of your remarks (and you're in no way alone in
this regard) seem to assume that uniformity is a sine qua non of law
enforcement (as opposed, say, to selective enforcement. Correct me if I'm
wrong.
        I wonder, though, whether this is so; isn't it true that the
impossibility of consistent enforcement may well encourage a systemically
selective enforcement (maybe shaped by this or that, one's politics, for
example)? Presumably, then, law enforcement would take on an increasingly
"terroristic" character--"random," as IRS audits and the like can be.
        Some recent high-profile cases (Packwood, and Kenneth Starr's
efforts to indict Gov. Tucker) might indicate the shape that enforcement
could take, especially in light of some recent congressional legislative
efforts: the gov't investigates you regarding X, in the process of the
investigation turns up Y and Z, and thus finds reason maybe to look into A,
B, and C as well--in effect, turning your life into a nightmare.
        But I digress: The main point, really, is that enforcement doesn't
need to be nonselective to be "effective." I think this holds whether I
understood your remarks correctly or not.
