I ran out of copies of my rump session paper handouts.  So, I put them on
my ftp server...

	ftp://ftp.clark.net/pub/cme/ps/

  cepp.ps ::	a couple of symmetric modes for block ciphers which
		I threw out for people to attack....

  k1.ps ::	Key exchange algorithm K-1 -- with some very suggestive
		properties.  Whit Diffie titled this one
		"If S-1 is Skipjack, then K-1 is KEA" in the rump session
		list.  I'm not about to make that claim -- but it *does*
		have some interesting characteristics.

Enjoy,

	Carl
