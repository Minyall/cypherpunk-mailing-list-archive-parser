you need to enter the proxy address in your preferences.  this is not a 
site to http to.

in your prefs there is a section on proxies.  put the address and port 
number in there.  this is already set for NSCA Mosaic, all you have to do 
is click on the button next to USE CERN PROXY SERVICE.  for netscape, 
just enter www.cern.ch in the http proxy section and 911 as the port number.
