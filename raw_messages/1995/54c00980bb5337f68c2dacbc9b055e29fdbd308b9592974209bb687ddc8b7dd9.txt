OTOH, they don't have any ITAR-like rules about not installing crypto hooks.

(It's pretty amusing that residents of Romania are eligible to enter, but
not residents of Vermont. At least to me, since I don't live in Vermont. ;)

I'm not convinced that such a contest is capable of that anyway. As in most
such contests, entries basically become the property of the sponsor. In this
case, "By participating in the Contest, Contestant waives all claim to 
intellectual property rights in the entry, including patent rights and 
copyright, and waives all moral rights, except where prohibited."  (Wow !
I didn't know I could waive my moral rights !)

I'm not inclined to hand the Java privacy software on which I'm working over
to Sun, even though I like Sun. If I were just working on a Tetris applet or
something, I wouldn't mind....
