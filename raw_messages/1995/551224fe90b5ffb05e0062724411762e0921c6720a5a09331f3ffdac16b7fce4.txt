Hardly. (*.gi0 and *.jp0 for a start?)
But what are data havens for, if not for controversial data?
One of the greatest needs, if not _the_ greatest, in our times
for a data haven is probably for storing porno. There is a
tremendous, world-wide demand for porno. Yet, there are numerous
countries where sex.gif's found on your disk (encrypted or not,
they can use thumb-screws to force the key out of your hands)
will put you in a very difficult situation (loss of social
status, jail, decapitation). It might be much more convenient
for, let's say, a Saudi teenager to store his encrypted private
gif's in a data haven in Sweden, download them when he feels
the urge and purge the copies after every use.
