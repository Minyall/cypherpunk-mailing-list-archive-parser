	I've started work on a formal remailer standards document that 
describes just how a Cypherpunk Type I remailer should process messages, 
with full header descriptions, etc. After I've checked it against the 
behaviors of all the various Cypherpunk remailer packages (Ghio vs Eric 
Hollander vs Sameer vs Mixmaster in compatibility mode vs whatever else), 
I'll post it here for comments.
