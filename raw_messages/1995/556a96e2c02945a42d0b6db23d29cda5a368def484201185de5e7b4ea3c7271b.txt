In Maryland you have the responsibility to retreat if possible when 
confronted by someone threatening your life or limb.  If you are unable 
to retreat or are in your domicile (or motel room, etc.) you have the 
right to use deadly force to stop an attack.

You certainly do not have the right to use deadly force against someone 
for any other reason than immediate threat of life or limb to you or 
someone else.
