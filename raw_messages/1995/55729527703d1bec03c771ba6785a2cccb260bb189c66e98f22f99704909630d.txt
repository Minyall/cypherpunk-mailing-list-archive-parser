The "Hello World" program I mentioned before is 325 bytes after
compilation. The 800K memory usage was a measurement of the
interpreter and language libraries being sucked into memory, assuming
no other activity on the machine.

I have a much larger program that does various kinds of reformatting
and munging of Java programs that take up a whopping 8K compiled, its
source file is 13K.

The bytecode compiled programs seem to be much more compact than their
source code versions.
