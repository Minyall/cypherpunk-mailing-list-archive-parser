The Cypherpunks RealAudio free account is now activated with password
"writecode" (case sensitive -- make them letters small).

The user name is still "cypherpu".  RealAudio.com does not truncate names
longer than 8 characters during login (meaning "cypherpunks" fails), but
their signup page won't allow entry of more than 8.  Silly.

Don't have too much fun listening to NPR, now...
