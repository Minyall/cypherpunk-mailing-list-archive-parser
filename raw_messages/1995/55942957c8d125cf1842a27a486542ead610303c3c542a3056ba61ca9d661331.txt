Do you have a copy of this?

Totaly agree, hell, I going to give the option for users and server to 
specify at run time which ciphers never to use :-).

The clear text I don't like, I agree.  But then when used for http, 
everything begins with a GET anyway.  The CRL verification is again to me 
a matter of implementation.  Currently my library does not support CRL 
(but I can load and manipulate them).  It is simply a function of the 
infrastructure to go with the library.  SSL v3 of the spec does alow for 
CRL to be passed along with the certificate heigherachy (a PKCS-7 object).

I'm mostly concered with any objections raised with the protocol, not the 
particular implementation around right now.  With my library I fully 
intend to make it possible to refuse to authenticate the server unless a 
current CRL is present.

Anyway, I'm intersted in hearing people complains so I can attempt to 
make sure none of the fixable problems are in my library :-)
