Tonight's local news included an interesting blurb about this case.
The judge refused to order Wollersheim to disclose his passphrase,
since the encrypted material comprised names of Co$ critics
who could then be targeted by the Church.  And the secret (and
copyright!) $criptures were read in court and excerpts broadcast
on the news, "close-captioned for the hearing-impaired."

All the entertaining stuff some of us have been reading on the
net was there:  aliens transported to earth, volcanoes h-bombed,
thetans...I laughed my ass off.  A bigtime win for PGP and encryption
generally, and a major PR debacle for the $cienos.

Kute Korrespondences Koda:

Tomorrow, Sept. 9, there will be protests worldwide at Co$ centers.
I was cleaning out some paperwork and disk file archives recently,
and noticed that the ViaCrypt and Austin Code Works subpoenas were
dated Sept. 9, 1993.  Grady Ward of ACW has, of course, been a
major Co$ antagonist, making good use of PGP and the Cypherpunks
remailers.  The old message I found detailing these subpoenas was
from this list's sometime visionary, L. Detweiler.
