Could this be it?  The test case for forced key disclosure?  The  
Scientologists seem very determined and already have a grudge against  
Wollersheim (according to a web page I saw Co$ owes him several million from  
a settlement).  Has Co$ filed against Wollersheim over this yet?

If this does go to court and forcing Wollersheim to reveal the key becomes a  
central issue, is this the test case "we" want?  Is this a "BIG WIN FOR PGP!"  
or not?

I can think of worse cases for this to come up in.  I.E. a four horseman  
case.  Here the party seeking forced disclosure of the key (Co$) is  
presumably already held in low esteem by much of the public (IMHO).  I  
suppose how this will play in the media, if at all, depends on what the  
"church" thinks Wollersheim has hidden in his encrypted data files.

It seems that the US media hasn't picked up much on the Scientology debacle  
yet... or am i wrong?
