If people care to look at my very old Shen work they will see a key
escrow facility. This was installed becase as a network administrator
at a sensitive site.

I'm a big fan of key escrow. I just don't think I should be forced to 
use it on a public network by a government. I need the ability to secure 
internal channels inside certain sites however. I don't think I want the 
Whitehouse running with each staffer providing their own personal encryption 
system.
