As a Canadian, I am often astounded by the attempts of the United States 
government to apply American law extraterritorially. A case in point is 
the trade embargo with Cuba. Canada does not recognize this embargo and 
trades freely with Cuba. Several American corporations faced legal 
sanction in the U.S. for the actions of their Canadian subsiduries. I 
don't remember the details but can get references if anyone requires it.
ITAR regulations may be enforced by the U.S. government on the parent 
corporations if history is any judge.
In any case, these regulations are impeding standards development and the 
use of secure cryptography for commerce on the internet. As for key 
escrow and and other schemes to dilute security, no foreign company is 
going to use such 'bastardized' products, knowing that the U.S. 
government may be listening in. Especially since your president is 
talking about commercial spying.
