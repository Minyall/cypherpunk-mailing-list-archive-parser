Ladies and Gentlemen;
	As I am sure that most of you have noticed, this is a high volume 
list. I have just spent the last 20 minutes deleting personal attacks and 
non-crypto related junk from my mail. Normally, this list is of fairly 
high quality and I enjoy reading the technical and political discussions 
that appear here. It must be something in the water but lately the 
nonsense has reached epic proportions. 
	Now I realize that trying to get an independent bunch of people 
(as the cypherpunks must be) to conform to a minimum standard of behaviour 
is like herding cats ( I like that image! <g>) but in the interests of 
your fellow list members, please take the attacks to private E-mail. This 
might make the volume of crypto-related material managable to the rest of us.
	Let the flames begin! ( In private E-mail please!)

	By the way, seasons greetings to everyone!

Tim Philp
Brantford, Ontario,
