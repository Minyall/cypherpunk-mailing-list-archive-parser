One more time for the security/cypher-impared (me at least).

I suspect there are a fair number of lurkers here who code for a living
and would be willing to contribute if someone/the_group can articulate
a requirements statement and then push it to the design stage.

I bring nothing cypher-wise. I would be willing to help walk the
s/w-engineering dog and to write Motif/X/socket if the chosen platform
is UN*X, however.

So, from an engineering standpoint, what should the "future" look
like?
