Though I have been vigorously using the various remailers for a long
time, I am stumped by my sudden inability to get a post to a newsgroup
by any remailed means.  Example:  For a long time I have used the
following boilerplate form with usura@replay.com with flawless results:

::
Encrypted: PGP

::
Anon-To: my.anon.address@somewhere.org
Cutmarks: *

| Message Successfully Remailed, # 999

*
::
Anon-To: mail2news@demon.co.uk

The current status of this is that I get the remailed receipt, but the
message never shows in the group.  Is mail2news@demon.co.uk down?

I tried using the Usura Anon-Post-To: feature, but it fails as well.

I've tried using _other_ remailers with the simple form...

        Anon-To: alt.some.group@comlab.ox.ac.uk
        Anon-To: alt.some.group.usenet@decwrl.dec.com
        Anon-To: alt.some.group@bull.com

I've also tried Request-Remailing-To: with the same address form.  Nada.

I have been unable to make any of the usual remailers get through to the
groups by any means for about three weeks, though evidence shows that
the remailers are certainly getting the messages, as I can send anon
netmail messages - - - the _posts_ just never show.

I periodically suspect that someone somewhere is running a program to
sweep all posts with "remail," "nobody" or "anon" anywhere in the
header. 

Any thoughts on this...assuming it shows here?
