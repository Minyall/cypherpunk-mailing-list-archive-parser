I registered as Richard E. Graves (changing middle initials and adding an
unnecessary suite number to your address are good ways to track who has
been selling whom your address). Richard E. Graves also received mail from
Pitney-Bowes.

Microsoft says they don't sell their mailing lists. Clearly, someone has
taken advantage of security holes in the NT servers that make up MSN and
*stole* the mailing lists. Maybe unauthorized external access accounts for
the abysmal performance of MSN, in part.
