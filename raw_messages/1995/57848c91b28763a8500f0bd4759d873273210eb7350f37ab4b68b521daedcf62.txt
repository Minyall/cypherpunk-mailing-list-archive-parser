I believe graphic encryption outputs a valid image file that is apparently  
white noise until you perform the decryption transformation on it.  An  
obvious way to do this with a non-lossy file format is to encrypt pixel vales  
with a stream cipher.  Another way to make the image unviewable would be to  
shuffle the pixels or rasters with a PRNG.
