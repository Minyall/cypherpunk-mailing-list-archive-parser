Even for a picture (as opposed to text fax) you have correlation.
If you do not, you cannot compress it (losslessly).

In general you would want to find the key which leads to least entropy
(ie most compressible file). In other words, find key with minimum
I(key) + I(ciphertext decrypted-by key).

That cannot be so: once it is compressed, you can't encrypt it as a
picture, you have to encrypt it as a bitstream.

Much easier than OCR.


Going back to compressing images now... HINT anyone?
