Smart card have one major advantage, though.  During these types of
operations, a smart card will be totally dedicated to the crypto.
Calculating the maximum possible delay for a given key size should be
relatively easy.

Most single-chip micros also have a timer that could be readily
dedicated to counting out this maximum possible delay, and the result
held only that long.  This could, on an 8051 (as a fairly typical
example) be easily controlled (with a 1-instruction loop) to within 2
instruction cycles.  Given another dozen or so instructions, it can be
controlled to a single fixed delay.

Where minimum and maximum delays only differ by 1% or so for a given
key size, no one will ever notice the extra time required to hold the
result for the maximum possible delay.
