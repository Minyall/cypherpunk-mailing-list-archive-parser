Let's not forget that Netscape is the biggest and best boon to the 
internet I've ever seen.  It is selling more bandwith, servers, and 
dial-up IP than anything that has come down the road.  It is enabling 
people to put even more info on the net, and I love it!

Of course, that is why it was targetted for the 40-bit RC4 crack, its 
immense popularity.  The total bogosity of 40-bit keys is now pretty 
apparent, and it is helping moves to 64-bit export, and perhaps beyond.
