Im interested too... if there is a 32 bit client for NT/Win95 (or a single
thredded one for Win32s) capable of reporting automatic to the
server/local server, I could probably throw in c.a. 40-50 pentiums and a
lot more 486 (and a few HP/Sun/Alpha) :-)  Anyone working on self-reporting
win32 client?

  Logi.
