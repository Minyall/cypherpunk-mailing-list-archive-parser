   12-15-95. NYPaper, crypto-bizarrely:

   "Extremist Army Group at War With U.S. Policy."

      It is not known how large the underground group is but
      the Special Forces acknowledge the group's existence and
      says that it was not in violation of any regulations.
      Its newsletter, The Resister, available on the Internet,
      said it favored "strict constitutionalism, isolationism,
      laissez-faire capitalism, individual rights, limited
      government and republicanism," and opposed "statism,
      liberalism, tribalism, socialism, collectivism,
      internationalism, democracy, altruism, pull politics and
      the New World Order."
