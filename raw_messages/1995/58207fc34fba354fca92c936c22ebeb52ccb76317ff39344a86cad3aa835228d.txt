There's this rad.web.intelligent person by the name of Sang.
Visit Sang at http://www.inlink.com/users/sangria/homepage.html

Sang has more information on Robots, Spiders, Ants, and Worms
than any other computer person I have yet to link up with.
Feel free to grab a copy of the Web Server Software while your there.

Love Always,

Carol Anne
