   I disagree - live connections  are great for fast-response systems,
   but we got along just fine in the uucp dialup world with occasional
   connections; 

And if get someone to do secondary MX for you that _is_ fulltime
connected, then the only latency for mail is the poll time.  If you're
on an ISDN line, for example, you can get online and poll every five
minutes for ten seconds at a time (ten seconds only when there's no
mail), cutting down line charges for fulltime _idle_ connectivity by a
factor of thirty.  Not all that expensive at all, really.
