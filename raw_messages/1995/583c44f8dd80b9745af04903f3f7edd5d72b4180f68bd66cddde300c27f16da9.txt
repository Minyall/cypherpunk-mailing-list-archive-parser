I can see a potential problem with Data Havens (as they've been discussed
here) that may very well inspire the wrath of the authorities more than
nuclear secrets or dirty pictures of J.Edgar Hoover...

How does one keep a site from becomming a remote pirated-software exchange
site? (Esp. since after that MIT case laws may be changed...) It seems that
such a service could become a magnet for the "elite warez" crowd... and even
if the operator isn't jailed it could lead to a shutdown of the service.
