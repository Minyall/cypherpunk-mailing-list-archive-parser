  Yeah, I guessed that. I'll work on it, I have a few doubts I have
to research first. For instance, how to embed code in the domain that
1) server/client processing won't "cook" and 2) contains no isolated
zero bytes which would null terminate the string.

  My current idea is to look in Netscape for an "exec" routine,
and call it passing a "/bin/csh" to it.

  Irregardless, it's a nasty bug given that you can crash anyone's
netscape. And on Mac/Win3.1, it may even require a reboot.
