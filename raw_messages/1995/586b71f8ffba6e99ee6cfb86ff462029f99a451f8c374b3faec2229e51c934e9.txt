Not relevant to cypherpunks-- just call me Carol Anne--

If I were the DOD, I would set the standard GPS default to selective
availability. After all, with SA on military receivers can still get
fine positioning data. If someone could come up with a good reason to
turn SA off, great, but I wouldn't leave it on otherwise.

The scenarios concerning GPS-piloted Cessnas full of nasty stuff come
to mind, especially vis-a-vis the North Koreans. They probably don't
have accurate IRBMs but they certainly could cobble together a
Learjet-based delivery system.
