I don't really follow the Co$ saga, but when I last looked it seemed
as though six lines (one of them the title) are sufficient for them
to be unhappy at you. If I remember correctly, those six lines said
to go to the zoo to practice telepathy with animals...

(No they didn't say *how*.)

So I don't know whether the "export-PGP-sig" system will be any use.

It always was, but do you have the money and the spirit to fight them?
