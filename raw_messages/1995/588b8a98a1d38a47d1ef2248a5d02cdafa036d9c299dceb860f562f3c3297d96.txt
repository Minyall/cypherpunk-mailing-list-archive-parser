	Its got a nasty learning curve; I held off for a long time
before making the leap.  What all mail filters need is better
integration with MUAs, so I can say "This message should have gone
into my cpunks-noise folder, fix the rules." Of course, doing that
really well is not trivial.

	Safe-tcl has a shorter learning curve, but I've spend enough
time that I don't want to switch without a payoff.
