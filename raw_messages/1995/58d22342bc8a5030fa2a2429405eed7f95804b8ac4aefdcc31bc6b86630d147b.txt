I'm thinking better safe than sorry. None of the studies on EM fields
and their effects on humans are causal, but a lot of studies and advice
have concluded that caution and minimization may be advisable.
 It's the un-noticable effects that I'm worried about. ;)

Just relating what I thought I'd heard. It may be wrong, or I may be
remembering it wrong. My EM theory is a bit rusty.
