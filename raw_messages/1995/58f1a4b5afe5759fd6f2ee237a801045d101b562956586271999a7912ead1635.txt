Try:
(quoting Wei Dai) 

ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/I_will_not_export/crypto_?????/libraries/crypto11.zip
 
where ????? is in ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/README
 
I encourage people to use this library in commercial as well as 
shareware/freeware products.  You don't have to pay me a cent, but 
don't forget about the patents.
