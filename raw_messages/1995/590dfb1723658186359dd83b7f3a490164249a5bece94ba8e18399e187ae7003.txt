Unix is perfectly easy to use. Its no worse than DOS.

I'm constantly amazed by people saying "why, Unix is so unfriendly!
What does "ls" mean to a naive user". Well, what does "dir" mean to a
naive user? Since when is "dir" the intuitive way to list the contents
of something?

Now, its true that Windows is friendlier than DOS, but there are good
windowing systems on Unix that provide equally easy to use front ends.

Anyone who claims that "Unix" is unfriendly hasn't looked at the
machine that they are using -- or they are bigots who think that the
strange commands that they know are natural whereas other people's are
magically unnnatural.

Teach her how to use FrameMaker, or IslandWrite, or something
similar. IslandWrite is no more unfriendly than MacWrite was. If you
want to teach her to use latex, thats actually quite feasable, but its
not needed.
