That's by Robin Winks. I have a copy, in hardback, that I found some
years back in a used book store. Lots of good stuff about the central
role Yale has played.

A friend of mine, Buddy Diamond, developer of the "NFL Challenge" PC
game of some years back, worked with James J. Angleton on a kind of
"CIA Challenge" training game. I met Buddy at the 1988 Crypto
conference, and he was the main reason I got invited to the Hackers
Conference that year (and thereafter, as is the norm). Oh, he went to
Yale, and this had a lot to do with the CIA getting in touch with him.
