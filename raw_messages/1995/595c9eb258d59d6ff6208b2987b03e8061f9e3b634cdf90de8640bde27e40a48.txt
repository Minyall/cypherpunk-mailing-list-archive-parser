Yes, it's true that this contributes to high interest rates (though
defaults cost more than fraud).

Doesn't matter, this is a disincentive to theft and you are never liable
unless you lost your physical card.

It would cost billions to get every single merchant that accepts credit
cards set up with PIN equipment.

You have to make sure the clerk that gets your order doesn't see the
PIN (so you need a secure path between you and your credit card co.
that avoids the merchant).  And what about the tellers?  Do you know
how badly they are treated?  They can get all those #'s.  Yes, it
can be done: ATMs are set up that way.  But as long as it's not done,
those who scream at the horrors of sending credit card #'s over the
net aren't thinking clearly.

Never forget that social engineering is the easiest hack.  Technical
solutions that ignore wide-open social engineering paths are worse
than useless (worse because they give an illusion of security).
