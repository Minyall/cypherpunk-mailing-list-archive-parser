   Information Week of August 28 has a cover story on
   "Internet Theft." It sees security threats in "freeware
   public-key encryption algorithms and anonymous remailer
   programs." BlackNet is red-flagged. Laggard law is cited.

   "This is where all the crime will be in the 21st century,"
   says Joseph Seanor, a federal government intelligence
   veteran. "Law enforcement officials are trying to get a
   handle on it, but they really can't stop it." Seanor adds,
   "When it comes to technology, criminals always seem to be
   one step ahead of law enforcement."
