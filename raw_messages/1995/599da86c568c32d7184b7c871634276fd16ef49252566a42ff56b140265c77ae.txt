Not all agents are agents provocateur.  Human Intelligence is often 
required to determine if the criteria you cite above are present.

The distinction is in the difference between private and government 
sponsored espionage and intelligence.

Most of the French activity is, for example, government sponsored.  As is 
most of the Japanese activity.  U.S. activity is mostly private, by 
corporations and such.

I believe the numbers above are quite helpful really, in identifying 
scope, and demonstrating a need for counterespionage.
