Couldn't one take advantage of the 50.000 mistake, by
setting up a second server for that space. I guess 
things will screw up when the first server reaches 
FFFF, as indicated earlier.

What would be nice is if one could divide up the key
between servers also.

Another thing that might decrease the load on the server
is if we start allocating more blocks at a time, lets
say 2-4 blocks each time. Wouldn't that help?
