I'm not sure that that's the case. Just because you move in dramatically
politically incorrect circles (no insult intended) you may tend to get
interviewed more than, say, I would.  The fact that I might be working on
more important or interesting things is completely irrelevent. 
Cypherpunks is 'hot', so the press goes to who are perceived to be the
'movers and shakers' and they are talked to. The people working behind the
scenes on stuff often are ignored in deference to those who are more
visible.  Again, no insult intended, but I think there's a large measure
of truth in it.  The same people keep getting the press while the larger
bulk of the population gets ignored.  It's also geographically-oriented, 
too - the folks on the West Coast tend to get the majority of the press, 
followed by the East Coast.  Anyone in between is basically ignored.  I 
guess the press thinks that no one outside of Silicon Valley or Boston is 
working on anything of any substance.  Hell, look at Linux - that was 
done by a guy in Finland, and a college student at that.  I'll bet that's 
rather embarassing to the "hot shots" in Cupertino :)
