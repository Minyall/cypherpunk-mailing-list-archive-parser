[I'm getting no Cypherpunks list traffic today, only mail sent to me
directly, so I apologize if this has come up already.]

The Jan 14-20 issue of "The Economist" has a good article on "Who
speaks for cyberspace?,"  which does a good job of summarizing the
civil libertarian arguments and why the EFF "imploded."

...

"Little wonder that many Internet pioneers thought they had stumbled
upon an electronic Utopia....If a single set of beliefs can be said to
dominate the politics of cyberspace, it is radical libertarianism..."

About the withdrawal of the EFF from the political fray:

"That leaves cyberspace's radical libertarians without a voice in
Washington. They're probably delighted."

I know I am.
