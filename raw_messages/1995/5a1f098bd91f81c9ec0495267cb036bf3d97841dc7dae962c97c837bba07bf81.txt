The licensed version of RC4, or the software that was posted anonymously?

Do you really feel comfortable basing an IETF standard on that?  When
you use the term RC4 do you mean the real version or the posted one,
what will you do if they ever conflict?  Can you even use the name RC4
for the posted version?  It seems to me that RC4 means the RSA licensed
code, which presumably you wanted to avoid when you wrote no mandatory PK.

Where would you swap RC4 for DES?

I assume your added stipulation is a "should" not a "must" item.

How are you going to handle key management and naming?
