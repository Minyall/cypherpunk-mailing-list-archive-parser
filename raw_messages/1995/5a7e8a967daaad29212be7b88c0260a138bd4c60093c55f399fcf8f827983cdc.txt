I don't think they have vested interests at all.  I think that they are 
able to see that the problem is not with the browser.  You know 
"/bin/login" is insecure because it allows hooks for unpasswded logins, I 
mean if the user wanted to they could leave root unpasswded and if they are 
using "/bin/login" someone could get into their system just like that.

That point is NOT valid IMO.

NO, postscript provides the method for executing shell commands if you 
accept postscript from anywhere.  Netscape can NEVER be "fool"proof 
against all hardware errors, particularly loose nuts on the keyboard.
