I read with interest about the (about time) reorganization of the EFF.  
While it is certainly a little early to make any kind of final decisions 
about the EFF, I do wonder a few things:

What will the EFF now be doing now that isn't already done by other
organizations? 

It sure seems to me that this CDT is awfully similiar to the CPSR, except
it's headed by former EFF people who have been puckering up to the
Washington politicos, the Telcos and other entities for the past few 
years.  Is there really a purpose?

Any thoughts on how the EFF will change it's approach?  I'm due for
renewal in March and I want to make sure I'm not flushing my money away.
