	Threat, please??  Do people often stand over your shoulder as
you type?  Enter your office, point guns at you, and take a backup of
your entire computer?  Have you considered putting the secret keyring
on a floppy and locking it in your desk/safe when you're not actually
in the office? (Or home..)

	I don't follow.  You're claiming that PGP is good enough to
transfer OTPads, but not good enough to sign pseudononymous messages?
