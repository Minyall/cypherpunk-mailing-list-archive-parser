Seals were duplicatable from the start. You just needed clay and a
seal made with the oritinal if you wanted to forge them -- fairly
common stuff. Signatures have been duplicatable from the start, too.

Signatures and seals are NOT truly authenticating technologies. They
are just a legal mechanism for an entity to demonstrate that it has
read and agreed to the terms on a document. It was always assumed that
someone might forge a signature, which is why if you had a document
where you cared that people might disclaim their signature, you got
people who could testify to the signature to witness the signing.

Digital "signatures" are the first real unforgeable authentication
technology mankind has developed.
