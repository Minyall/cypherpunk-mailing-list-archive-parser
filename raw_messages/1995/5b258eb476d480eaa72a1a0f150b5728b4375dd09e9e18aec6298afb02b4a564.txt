Well, yes, this is true.  My point was that reliable, fast, easy to use
bandwidth on the order of 128 Kbps is available now in some areas for
relatively cheap rates.  _With the condition_ that continuous access
is not necessary to run a remailer (as I had outlined), this could prove
to be a good jumping off ground for some remailer operators.  Sheesh, I 
could start my own on my home ethernet if I were so inclined.

The solution to the access fee problem is, of course, sharing that fee with
other payees.  Your example of putting boxes directly on TLG's network
is a good example of this.

We don't disagree here; we are solving two different problems it appears.
