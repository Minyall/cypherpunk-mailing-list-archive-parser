This should prove about as effective as the current French or Russian bans.
What are they going to do when they figure out that there need no longer be
such a thing as a telecoms operator.  We do most of the message packaging
ourselves.  It will be a bit difficult for any connectivity supplier to tell
what's going out via one of our encrypted IP sessions.

Question for Perry -- I'm assuming that it will soon be possible to
originate encrypted TCP/IP sessions with a distant "process" somewhere.  Do
you see technical problems with a TCP/IP laundry being established
"somewhere" that strips trace info from one of my processes and prevents
back tracing beyond the mouth of this encrypted pipe?

Also Perry, what did you think of the article "How Anarchy Works" in the
latest Wired on the IETF?
