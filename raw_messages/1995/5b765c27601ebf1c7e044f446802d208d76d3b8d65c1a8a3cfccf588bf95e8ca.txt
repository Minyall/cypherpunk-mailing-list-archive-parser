Very interesting.

Do you have information on the content of the various resource records
within a .PWL file? They should be the stored usernames and passwords for
every other authenticated service used by the "user profile."

I.e. the "default login," say, the local Windows password, encrypts the
.PWL file, and the contents are the passwords used for NetWare, NT,
Dial-Up Networking, the screen saver, .PWL-enabled "security" utilities,
etc.

If anyone wants a sample .PWL file including known values of all of the 
above, I can have it for you within a day. Of course I wouldn't want to 
give you any *real* passwords.

Of course I should just compile your code myself, but it's a busy day, 
and I'd hate to unnecessarily duplicate someone else's work...
