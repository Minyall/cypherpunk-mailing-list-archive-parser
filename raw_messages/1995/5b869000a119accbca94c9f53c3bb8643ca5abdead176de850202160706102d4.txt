SecureDrive works under Windows 95 if you disable all 32-bit disk drivers.

Disable all 32 bit protected mode disk drivers

You have to run SECTSR before starting Win95.  A pain but it does work.

I will be working on figuring out how to force Windows 95 to disable 32 bit
access for just my SecureDrive disk alone.  Should be possible.
