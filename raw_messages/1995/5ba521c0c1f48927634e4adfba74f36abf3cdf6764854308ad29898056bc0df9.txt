Standardization, is what.  It's not ready, so no names yet.

   If anyone wants a third-level domain name *.techwood.org for their
   linux box, send me mail *from root* on your box, telling me what
   third-level name you want.  

This is the right avenue right now for a non-.edu remailer address.
Immediate, cheap, etc.

And incidentally, it's a great idea to use a different domain name for
these services.
