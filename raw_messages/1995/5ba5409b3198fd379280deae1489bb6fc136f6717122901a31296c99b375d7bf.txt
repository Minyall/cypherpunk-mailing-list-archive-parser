Hi,

Please feel free to ad my key to your keychain and/or keyserver.

I am a cyberpunk in the most original sense.  From the early '80s the 
days of 8BBS & 414's, etc.   I am also in the book "CyberPunks" [now in 
your book store] see who signed my key, and you'll have a clue who I am.

Enjoy the key!
