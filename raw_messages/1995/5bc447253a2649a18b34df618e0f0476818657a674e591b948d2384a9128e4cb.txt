Hi,

One method to take the heat off of the last remailer
in a chain would be to call on our friend the "one
time pad".  A message is split into two equal parts
that only make sense when the two parts are 'xor'ed
together.  The seperate parts are then sent through
different paths to the final recepiant (or newsgroup).
The reader would have to 'xor' the parts together in
order to read the message.  The remailer could not be
blamed (as the message was unreadable to him).

The drawback is that the message would be unreadable
until both pieces showed up.

This method could also be expanded with two more equal
parts that transform the origional two parts into
two different messages unrelated to the origional
message.
