I have been having problems trying to set up an account at
alpha.c2.org. I have followed all the instructions but am still unable to
get a reply or anything that works right. What I am doing wrong? This is 
what I have done so far. I am about to pull my hair out. I have been 
working on this for 2 days now. Anyway, 

1. Created a Reply Block like this:  
Request-Remailing-To: hroller@metronet.com 

2. I then encrypted it with remailer@replay.com's Public Key. I prepended it
with the "Encrypted: PGP".  

3. I then created the following message: 

From: hroller@alpha.c2.org 
Password: MyPassword 
Reply-Block: 
::
Anon-To: remailer@replay.com 

::
Encrypted: PGP 
-------Begin PGP Message---------- 
"The Encrypted Reply Block Message"  
------End PGP Message------------- 

4. I then sent it to "alias@alpha.c2.org".  

Then I wait. But never get anything from alpha.c2.org.  I have gotten 
some anonymous messages from replay, but they are still encrypted so 
I don't know what it is sending me. Any help you can supply would be
greatly appreciated.
