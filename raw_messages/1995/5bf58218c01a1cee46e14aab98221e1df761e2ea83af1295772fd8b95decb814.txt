You presumably use the oddness of the count for your random bit in some
predetermined time interval. External radiation can change, but not bias
the parity. If the counter saturates, the counter may be biased towards one
parity but the software can easily detect saturation presuming it gets the
count.

You can use the source in a smoke detector.
