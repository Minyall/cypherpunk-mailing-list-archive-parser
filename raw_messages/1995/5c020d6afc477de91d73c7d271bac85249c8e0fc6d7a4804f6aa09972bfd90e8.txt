I took a quick look in my NT registry and you can get access to the Account
Manager section of the registry by manually changing the permissions and
giving yourself access.  I didn't have the time to look at all of the
entries in the registry, but there's a lot of stuff there and I wouldn't be
suprised if the encryted passwords were available.  Of course, you have to
be an administrator to change the permissions, but it is possible.
