	I was going to say some similar things about firewalls, but
then decided that Strick is doing the right thing.  If the firewall
wants to offer skronk'd services, it can respond to the UDP packet,
and offer up services, presumably through relays.

	The relay/proxy programs for these protocols already exist.
So you can reuse them to carry encrypted traffic through your
firewall.  Why build a new set of proxies that have to be checked for
correctness?

	Of course, letting encrypted traffic through your firewall
will upset those people who thought they can virus/porn scan at the
firewall.  Such scanners are almost always broken anyway.
