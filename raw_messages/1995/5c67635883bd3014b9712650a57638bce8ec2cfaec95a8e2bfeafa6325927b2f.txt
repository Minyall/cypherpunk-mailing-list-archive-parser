This has no real crypto relevence, but some anarchistic relevence.

Sometimes you find anti-government paranoia in the strangest of places...
In the Ziggy strip for 10/25/95, Ziggy is in a Psychiatrist's office.  The
shrink is stating "You're afraid of the government, are you?  I'm required
to report that sort of thing you know."

You can tell the state of distrust of the state when you see such things in
a generally bland and spineless strip like Ziggy.  What next? Little Billy
from Family Circus bringing home a copy of the Anarchists Cookbook?  Charlie
Brown getting his phone tapped by Louie Freeh?  Garfield joining the EFF?
The mind boggles...
