We all know that an alternative DNS structure would rapidly appear, and
perhaps even a second US (black) Internet - with links between the old
and new fully automatic and transparent.  However, perhaps a good
cypherpunks project would be to create and test a contingency plan and
start an alternative DNS system in parallel with the government run ones.
