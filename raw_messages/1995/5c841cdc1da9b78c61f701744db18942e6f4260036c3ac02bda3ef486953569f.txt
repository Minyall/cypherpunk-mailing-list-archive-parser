I would PREFER that I be able to legally obligate my service provider (and phone co) to provide only that level of cooperation which is actually, literally, legally required.  I would like to be able to know that if my service is tapped in some way, I receive a letter de-certifying the previous state of non-tapped-ness that it possessed.
