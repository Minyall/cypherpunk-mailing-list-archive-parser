Unless of course the case involves porn, drugs, etc, in which case the 
current practice in the American legal system places the onus on the 
accused, regardless of what the Constitution requires.  Civil forfeiture is 
a fine example of this, along with requiring porn producers to demonstrate 
the age of their models, etc ad nauseum.
