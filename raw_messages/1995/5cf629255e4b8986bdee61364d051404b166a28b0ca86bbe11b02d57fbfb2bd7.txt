You could only accept signed e-mail. From a suitably defined set of
signators, of course.

If you write a script to do that for you, it would be useful to
others as well: parents could set it up for their innocent children
to guard them against all them bad guys on the net of which there
are exactly 98.3527% (no, that's not from [Rimm 95], I made it up).

The other thing would be that you would thereby force all your
correspondents to use PGP, which can't be such a bad thing, can it.


Yes, no, maybe?
