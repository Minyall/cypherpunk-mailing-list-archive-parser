	My ex-gf just told me on the phone that her boss mentioned
that Netscape was giving away T-shirts to people who found holes.
Apparently her boss saw this on the news. Interesting. ;-)

	(For the over-stressed and/or humor-impaired: I'm not implying
that netscape is giving away t-shirts, just commenting on the accuracy
of the media.)
