   9-26-95. W$Japer:

   "On-Line Service to Assist Global Trade."

      A group of multinational companies is expected to unveil
      today an on-line service to businesses to engage in
      international trade. Dubbed IBEX, it is a joint effort
      of AT&T, Dun & Bradstreet, General Electric and the U.S.
      Chamber of Commerce to let businesses use on-line
      traffic to line up suppliers, negotiate contracts, make
      and receive bids, and arrange the delivery of goods and
      services around the world. IBEX expects the backing of
      Chase Manhattan, Microsoft, DEC and Simon & Schuster.

      The IBEX software allows companies to sign on and submit
      a request for goods or services, which is posted
      anonymously. The request could be styled using an array
      of categories offered by the service, including
      location, product category, payment and shipping terms.
      The customer would then receive bids from businesses
      hoping to land the contract. Once a bid is chosen, the
      identities of the businesses are disclosed and
      negotiations begin. IBEX allows them to attach documents
      such as confidentiality agreements, contracts and
      purchase orders.
