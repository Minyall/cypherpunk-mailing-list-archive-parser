Oh, hell, even I can do *that*.  Let's see ... motherboard, $100.  
Floppy drive and controller, $50.  14.4KB modem, $50.  Case and power 
supply, another $50 or so.  $250 profit.

	You appear to be forgetting the interface to the TV set; it will cost
more than for a monitor, unless I've missed something in my last few PC
purchases.
