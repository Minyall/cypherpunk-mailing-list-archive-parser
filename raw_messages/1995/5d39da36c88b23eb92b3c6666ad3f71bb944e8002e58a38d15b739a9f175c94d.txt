Is it my imagination, or is CERT just trying to firewall up the internet 
into uselessness?

What we need to concentrate on is secure systems that are not vulnerable 
to IP spoofing, as opposed to firewalls.

But of course, more firewalls makes more free transfer of information 
across the internet more difficult...perhaps this is what the government 
is interested in reducing.
