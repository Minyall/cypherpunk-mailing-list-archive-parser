DM|Depends on the counter people. The local RS here the clerks don't care
  |much about it and will enter a random number.

  |does the same thing, but they're pesky, so I make up silly names to test
  |the wits of impatient teenage mutant cashiers.  (They also used to have
  |a computer where you enter your telno. and place orders to pick up at
  |the desk... I don't think the system bills you automatically but the
  |employees probably won't like it when you have them get 10 wieght sets
  |out...)
