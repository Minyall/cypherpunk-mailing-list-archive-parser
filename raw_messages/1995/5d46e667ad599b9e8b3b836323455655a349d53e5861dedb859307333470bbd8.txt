According to the well researched list of various countries' crypto-laws
that Bert-Jaap Koops published on this list last July, the UK does not
have any laws against export of crypto. Here are some excerpts.

CRYPTO LAW SURVEY
Version July 1995

.................................<snip>   

----------------------------------------------------------------
SURVEY PER COUNTRY
1. Export/ import regulations
2. Other laws/regulations pertaining to encryption
3. Threats/ intentions to regulate encryption
4. Regulations stimulating encryption use

_COCOM_
1. COCOM (Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls)
is an international organization (Japan, Australia, and all NATO
members, Ireland excluded) for the mutual control (and restriction) of
strategic arms export. It maintains, among others, the International
Industrial List and the International Munitions List. In 1991, COCOM
has decided to allow export of mass-market cryptographic software
(including public domain software). Some member countries of COCOM
follow its regulations, but others, such as Germany and the
United States, maintain separate regulations.

_United Kingdom_
1. COCOM regulations.
2.  no
3.  In its policy on the information superhighway, Labour states it does
not approve of escrowed encryption, but it wishes authorities to have the
power to demand decryption under judicial warrant.  It seems, then, that
Labour intends to penalize a refusal to comply with a demand to decrypt
under judicial warrant.
