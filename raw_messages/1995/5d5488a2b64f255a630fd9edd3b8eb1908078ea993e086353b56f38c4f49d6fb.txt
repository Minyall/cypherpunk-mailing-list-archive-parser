Oh, hell, even I can do *that*.  Let's see ... motherboard, $100.  
Floppy drive and controller, $50.  14.4KB modem, $50.  Case and power 
supply, another $50 or so.  $250 profit.

What's so tough about that?  Not a bad deal for Acorn, if you ask me. 
 Hell, maybe I'll go into business making the damned things for that 
kind of profit margin...
