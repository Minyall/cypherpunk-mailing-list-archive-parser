I don't run the actual Cypherpunks Lite list, however I do run a free 
filtering service of the same sort... basically stick to news and 
technical stuff, as well as other miscalenous interesting stuff, but don't 
forward whole threads, or flames, etc...

If you want in, let me know in email and I'll add you to the list.
