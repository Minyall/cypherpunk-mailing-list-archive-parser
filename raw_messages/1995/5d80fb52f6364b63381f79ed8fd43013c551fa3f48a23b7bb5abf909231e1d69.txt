I could agree to a private filtering mechanism where each program
broadcasts an ID number.

A chip on the set reads this info from the dark band between frames or
someplace.

Private agencies rate the programs by whatever criteria sells ("Bikinis &
Beer", "Motherhood and Apple Pie", whatever), and people load those
rating/show lookups into their set off of the net or wherever...

Certainly the government shouldn't reqire anything. The government couldn't
find its ass with both hands. I bet this scheme could sell on an
information value-added basis alone.

Cheers,
