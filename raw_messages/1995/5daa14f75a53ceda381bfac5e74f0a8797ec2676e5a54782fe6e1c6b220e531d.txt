yes ! yes ! anyone with tcl-dp and tclX installed to run one ?
we need to have a 'network' of proxies !
[maybe I shall 'translate' the prototype in perl or C... but I'm much

http://hplyot.obspm.fr:8001/
shows what has been sent to it by the browser (between other www
goodies) [You can put the following 
---8<---
#! /bin/sh
echo "Content-type: text/plain"
echo ""
/bin/env
---8<---
as a minimal debugging cgi too, on any httpd, if you want]
