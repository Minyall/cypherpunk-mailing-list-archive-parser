Many postscript interpreters are a serious security threat. However, I
found it fairly easy to chop enough of the code out for the one I run
that I feel safe with it -- the exercise wasn't that hard.

Yes, but in practice, to support the given applets that Netscape will
be browsing you have to open the kimono a bit too much overall. With
sufficient emasculation, I believe Java could be made safe, but then
it wouldn't be the Java that Sun and Netscape are pushing any more.
