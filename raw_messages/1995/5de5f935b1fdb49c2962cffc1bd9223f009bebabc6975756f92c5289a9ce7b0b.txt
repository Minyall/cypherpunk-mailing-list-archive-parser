Also (and note that it's been a while since I've messed around with
PC's, but since the "architecture" remains chained to an early-80's
design I suspect they're still the same) the PC clock frequency is
generally pretty low.  PC UNIX implementations usually run it at about
100 Hz, I think.  There aren't a lot of available timers on the PC.
One of them used to be used as the DRAM refresh timer; I don't know
whether they still do that.

On the other hand, getting at a Windows PC over the network is a whole
'nuther enchilada, though if I want to keep my day job I need to get
that figured out real soon now.
