Agreed.  What's more, I'll make a similar claim about the legal 
system -- with the rise of alternate dispute resolution systems, it 
too appears to be moving toward a system where law issues less from 
state authorities and more from private ones.  Post's article brings 
out this point well.

As for terminology, I prefer "polycentric."  Originally coined (I 
believe) by Polyani with regard to non-hierarchical societies, it 
works quite well in economic and legal contexts.  A polycentric 
system harbors overlapping authorities in free and open competition.
