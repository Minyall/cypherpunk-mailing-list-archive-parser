I don't think binding hostnames to certificates helps much because 
both hostnames and IP addresses can be spoofed and DNS servers can be 
subverted.  The important thing is the binding to the "service" name or 
definition (e.g. InterState online banking service).

Well of course, if the secret key of the server (or worse yet, certificate 
authority) is compromised, all bets are off.  That's true of just about any 
protocol you can dream up.

Are you just referring to the problem of accurate and up to date certificate 
revocation lists (CRL) being available ?

If so, you're right, this is a very difficult problem to solve without 
having a truly reliable and pervasive key-distribution & CRL system 
deployed throughout the world.
