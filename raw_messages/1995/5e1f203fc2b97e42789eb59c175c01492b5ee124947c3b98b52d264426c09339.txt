Microsoft has lots to lose from making software available to systems
that "comptete" with MS-DOG and Windoze.  It's clearly in their best
interests to not make their software run under Unix and/or X11
(although WABI has some interesting implications in that regard).

On the other hand, that would seem to imply that it's in a lot of
other people's interest to port their software -- every little bit of
leverage against Microsoft helps.
