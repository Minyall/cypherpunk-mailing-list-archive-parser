I just HAD to forward this message I received.  About a 9 months ago I
joined Adam Curry's "CyberSleaze" mailing list.  About a month later I
unsubscribed.  The messages continued to come and I tried unsubscribing 
several more times.

Finally I set up a filter rule to flush the message and sent some grumpy 
email to the postmaster of the site telling them to fix their software 
(this was about mid-June of 1994).

This morning, I got the following message.  Note the dates on it.

Nothing like taking one's time.  You'd begin to think the government was 
somehow involved.
