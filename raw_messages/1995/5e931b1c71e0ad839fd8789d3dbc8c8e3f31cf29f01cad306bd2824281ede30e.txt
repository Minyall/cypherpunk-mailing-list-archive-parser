	If you believe this, there is a boy dying of cancer who wants
to be in the Guiness book of world records for getting the most dollar
bills in the mail.  Its cheaper than a get well card, and besides,
they abolished the get-well card category after Craig Shergold.

	So, mail your dollar to:

	Adam Shostack
	92 Howard St
	Cambridge Ma, 02139

	And help make someone very happy.  :)

	Also, save a copy of this message.  Any time you see something
about a modem tax, post this message in response.  Its a better use of
your stamps.  Really.
