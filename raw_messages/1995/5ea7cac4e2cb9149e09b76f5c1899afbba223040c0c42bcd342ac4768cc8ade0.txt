I wouldn't register my keys and I don't think ANY of us should either.
If they threatened me W/ RICO, I would probably register *A* key but 
certainly not one I EVER indended to actually use.
In a case like this I think massive civil disobediance would be a good 
response.
I would like to see a campaign of sending PGP to random Euros or whoever 
has a foriegn tag through anon. remailers.Like this UU encode it and daisy
chain it to whoever.
How's that sound?
