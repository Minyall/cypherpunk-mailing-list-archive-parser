	In my own experience, the Mac newsreaders that I have 
tried(mainly Nuntius and Newswatcher) have felt incredibly slow compared 
to tin. What, IMHO, would be a good step forward would be Mac versions of 
UNIX packages like pine and tin...preferably with AppleScripts that 
implement the same functionality as the PineSign and TinSign scripts 
recently distributed here. I don't know about the Netscape-addicted 
masses, but it would make my life a lot easier. :-)
