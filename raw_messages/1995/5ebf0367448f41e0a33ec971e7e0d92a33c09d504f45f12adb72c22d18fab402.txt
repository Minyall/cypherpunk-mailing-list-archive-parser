XFree86 was a snap to set up on my system, and I'm no guru.  In addition, 
Linux does not occupy the entirety of the UNIX spectrum - SGI systems, 
for example, give you graphics "out of the box", and so do many other 
workstation systems.  Granted, such machines are more expensive, but then 
we're talking about ease-of-use and power here, not cost.

I'm not a UNIX guru, as I said, although I do have some basic UNIX 
knowledge.  Slackware was, for me, one of the easiest installations I 
have ever done on any computer.  It was a breeze.

in fact, there are version of Wordperfect (and perhaps MS Word as well) 
for UNIX systems... they're just more expensive and less immediately 
available in the marketplace.
