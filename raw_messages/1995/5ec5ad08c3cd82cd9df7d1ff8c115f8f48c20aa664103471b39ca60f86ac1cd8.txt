I am extremely sympathetic to the anti-abortion cause but the kind of abuse
described in this item is unnerving.  Although illegal and reprehensible, it is
one thing for a government official, because of some strong conviction, to
violate the law.  It is completely another to violate it for money.  Men, if
they were men, who did this should have their privacies cut off.
