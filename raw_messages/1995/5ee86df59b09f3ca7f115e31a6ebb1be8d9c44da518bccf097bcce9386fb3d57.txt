| Oh please!  Some clerk browses the internet and you don't want to respect
| their privacy because of the IRS?  This makes sense how?  I suppose that
| you're going to dig up information about me and spread it around the 
| internet because you have issues about the company I work for?

	First off, I was being somewhat sarcastic, as you might have
noticed from several things, not the least of which was the phrase
'sarcasm aside.' 

	That said, why should I respect the privacy of government
employees?  There is a substantial difference between government and
private companies, in that I am not compelled in any way to do
business any private company.
