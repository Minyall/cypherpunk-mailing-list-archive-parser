RSA wants money (this comes from speaking with an RSA sales guy - Dave 
Garifolio, who incidentially sends out really neat RSA folders full of 
info you can take out of the folder and put elsewhere leaving you a cool 
folder) for the toolkit, thats all.  They send you to some sister corp of 
theirs and then charge you for the license.  Dave tells me there might be 
a chance you could buy one kit from RSA, design the server and anyone who 
wanted to use it could pay something like a $300.00 fee to lic. the thing.

However, in the aformentioned folder, Dave sent me all kinds of "we want 
big cash" paperwork, which I have yet to read (as anything you've gotta 
put in a really cool folder to get me to read can't be worth the time out 
from sleeping.)

Uh, yeah.
