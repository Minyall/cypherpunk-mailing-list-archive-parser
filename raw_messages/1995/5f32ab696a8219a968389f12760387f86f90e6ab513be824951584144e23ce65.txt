Well, assuming that US law follows british practice in this regard, it
would seem that those people would be wrong- to prove fraud, you would
need to show intent to commit fraud, and it's been obvious for a long long

rather than malice of any kind. Would you have a security expert write
your graphics engine? 

Microsoft is the Evil Empire; Netscape is  a Naughty Principality.
