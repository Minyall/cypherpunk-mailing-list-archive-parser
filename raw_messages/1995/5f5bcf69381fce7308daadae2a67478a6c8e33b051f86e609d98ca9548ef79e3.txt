	Speaking of ironic situations, my sister recently
mentioned that her fiancee is a good friend of Jim Bidzos and asked
me if I wanted a job with RSADSI. If I wasn't planning on leaving
the employed-by-others arena I would have seriously considered it. ;-)

	In terms of being a CA. I have considered making Community
COnneXion a CA for its customers, but I haven't done much research
into what is involved in doing that.
