   I am thinking of the 
   use of a trusted adjudicator who could receive information from both the 
   original participants and check to see if the two keys matched.

How do you authenticate the adjudicator?

You'll have to communicate with the adjudicator and verify one of
their signatures.  You can just as easily exchange signed DH
parameters directly with the other party and verify the signature of
your correspondent.

This is another one of those problems where potential solutions often
just lead to infinite regress.
