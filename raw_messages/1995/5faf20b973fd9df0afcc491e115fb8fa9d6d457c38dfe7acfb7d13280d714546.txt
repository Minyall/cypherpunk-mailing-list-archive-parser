I wouldn't think you would have to use OCR to detect a successful 
decryption. The graphic file is going to have a highly correlated 
structure, long runs of white space etc. The statistics for such a file 
would be different than the random distribution you'd get from using the 
wrong key. Even if the graphics format is compressed, leading to a more 
even distribution, there might be known plaintext at the beginning of the 
file, headers, size etc.
