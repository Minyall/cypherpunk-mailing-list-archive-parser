We recently lost (ok fired) our office manager, but not before she put 
nifty passwords on all the MS Money data we had and now she has, of 
course, gone on a three week vacation.  I have all the relevant WP 
password retrieving mechanisms but not one for MS Money.

Anyone with pointers or programs, your help would be greatly appreciated.
