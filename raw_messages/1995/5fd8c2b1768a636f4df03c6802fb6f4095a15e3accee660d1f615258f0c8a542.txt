Saw this on usenet. Figured someone might want to give it a spin...

We have now updated our servers to

a) Use 128 bit SSL if the client allows it.
b) Tell users which cipher is being used on a secure session.

To experiment point your secure client at one of the following:

https://193.118.187.101/
https://193.118.187.102/
https://193.118.187.105/
https://193.118.187.111/

(the main server does not run SSL to minimise PK calculations)

If you do not have a client that can use 128 bit RC4 then
ftp://193.119.26.70/mktnet/pub/horse.zip
does to the job, but is quite flaky otherwise.
