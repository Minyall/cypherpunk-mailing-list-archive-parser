I offer a similar service, with the following provisos:

 o There's no fee (unless you want to donate ecash)
 o No digest format available
 o Approximately the same statistics as Cpunks Lite (5-10% of
   all incoming messages, depending on content)
 o No archives of previous mailings available for public review
   to aid in consumer choice

I call it "Cpunks Frog Forwards". To be added or removed, send
a polite request to the human behind this address.
