Phill obviously presents one point of view, vigorously and well.  What do 
the rest of you think about a teen who, say, busts into a .edu site, 
plays with the files, and ultimately brings the system down entirely for 
36 hours?  Fun and games?  Send him to his room, sans modem? Prosecute 
him?  Have a TLA hire him???

Not an easy answer for me for "mere trespass," but as damage mounts, it 
becomes easier. 

I'll try to post later tonight on my prior key escrow question.
