cpunks,

yesterday i requested some help compiling cfs on my linux system.  well, 
after some serious help i got it to work.

the problem was that my copy of rpcgen was broken.  this was the copy 
installed with the slackware distribution.

damn, this is some sort of never ending contest between my sanity and the 
slackware distribution!
