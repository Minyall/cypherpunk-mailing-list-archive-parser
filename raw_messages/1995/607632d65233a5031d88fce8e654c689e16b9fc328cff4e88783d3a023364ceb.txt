Look, I aint no crypto expert or nuthin', but I have spent a lot of time
looking for the algorithm or key to figure this thing out and I can't
find it. I got whole ROOMS of cpu's crankin' on this one, I even called
uncle Al at Fort Meade and he called back and said, 
"....dunno...must be some newfangled stego or something, I'll call you back".

Was this really a newsletter post or do I need to go back to codebreaker 
school?????
