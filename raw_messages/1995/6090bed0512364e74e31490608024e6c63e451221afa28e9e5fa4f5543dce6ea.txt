I also tried the public affairs department of the National Security
Agency at (301) 688-6524, with no luck.  They gave me the number of
the technology transfer office.  From then on out it was nothing but
busy signals.  (I guess there are many c'punks hammering them with 
phone calls...)

I spoke with Mr. Cisco for several minutes, but he stated that the
NSA would not be at any trade shows in the Southern United States
any time soon.  He did state that they would be in Salt Lake, sometime
in the near future.

In a fit of dispair, I called the local branch office of the Central
Intelligence Agency only to get an answering machine, in an attempt to
get the number for public affairs office.  (Maybe they have a cool
flying disk...)  I called the direct number for the Central 
Intelligence Agency and was grudingly transferred to the public affairs 
office.  I was then given the number to the store that sells CIA stuff
at (703) 821-1414. 

[sigh] They don't have frisbies, but they do have the official CIA
shot glasses...
