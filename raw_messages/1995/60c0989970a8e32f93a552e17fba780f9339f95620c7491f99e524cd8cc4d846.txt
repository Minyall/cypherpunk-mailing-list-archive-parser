   "Infighting Unravels Alliance Seeking Standard to Protect
   Internet Purchases."

      The consortium brought together such top players as
      credit-card rivals Visa International and MasterCard
      International Inc., software titan Microsoft Corp. and
      Internet upstart Netscape Communications Corp. But this
      week, the alliance split because of tensions between
      Visa and MasterCard and their respective technology
      partners -- Microsoft and Netscape.

      Regarding Netscape, Mr. Dent of Microsoft said the
      firm's security deficiencies that have recently come to
      light have "tainted" electronic commerce on the
      Internet. Mr. Dent also noted that Microsoft yesterday
      introduced new security technology, including means to
      verify a user's identity, that is much stronger than
      Netscape's.
