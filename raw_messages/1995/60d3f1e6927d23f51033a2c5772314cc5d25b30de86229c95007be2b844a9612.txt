   "Clinton Assails Officers' Racist Event. Gathering Is
   Defended by the Organizer as Get-Acquainted Party."

      Mr. Rightmyer, organizer of the event, said he believed
      the criticism of the roundups was part of a politically
      motivated "setup" by the paramilitary group, the Gadsden
      Minutemen, who harbor intense hostility toward the ATF
      for its role in regulating the manufacture and sale of
      guns. Morris Dees, head of a prominent civil-rights
      organization, supported his view, and one Federal
      law-enforcement official said Mr. Rightmyer might be
      correct.                                       JIV_tun

      Local law-enforcement authorities, who had waited for
      more than three years to arrest a tax protester, Gordon
      Sellner, accused of trying to kill a lawman, shot and
      wounded him in a raid on his home.             JAK_but
