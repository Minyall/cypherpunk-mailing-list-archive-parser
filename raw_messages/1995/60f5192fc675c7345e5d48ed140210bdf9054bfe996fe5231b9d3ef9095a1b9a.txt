I have had a look at the exported version of Netscape's WWW browser
which has support for secure transfer of info, and it says it uses RSA
keys limited to 40 (not sure whether this is decimal digits or bits).
This is the broken version for export, I am not sure what the
non-crippled version uses.  I would like to have a go at factorising a
number of 40 digits to get a feel for how secure this system is.  I
suspect not very secure even 40 digits is pretty pitiful for an RSA
key size 40 bits would be a joke.  

I would like to get a feel for how long it takes to factorise a 40
digit number.  

Does anyone have source code for factorising large numbers.

I have code to generate the RSA key pairs and modulus, what I am
looking for is code to factorise a number using one of the better
algorithms (quadratic sieve, etc.).
