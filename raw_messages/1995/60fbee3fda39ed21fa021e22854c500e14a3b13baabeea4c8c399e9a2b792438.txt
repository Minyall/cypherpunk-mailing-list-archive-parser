I have been doing help desk related work for nearly 10 years and in my 
experience 'user friendly' is something you see on ads and never in the
software.

I have yet to see a piece of software that is useful and actually solves
a problem or does a job that doesn't also require an investment by the
help desk.

It simply ain't that easy.
