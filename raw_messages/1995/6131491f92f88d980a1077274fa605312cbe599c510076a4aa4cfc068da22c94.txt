THUS SPAKE jrochkin@cs.oberlin.edu (Jonathan Rochkind):
# 
# Maybe it's time for Eric to figure out what he's going to do 
# with remailer.net.

If anyone wants a third-level domain name *.techwood.org for their
linux box, send me mail *from root* on your box, telling me what
third-level name you want.  
(Techwood.org is the Techwood Broadcasting Foundation, incorporated
under orbital law.)

Put "techwood" in your Subject: line, and mail it to me at
<strick@techwood.org> from root at your site.  I will dig you and ping
you to get your dotted quad for an A record, and I'll make an MX record
that goes only to you.

			strick




p.s.  then in your /etc/sendmail.cf put a line like this

Cz mumble.techwood.org

(if you're running a recent UCB sendmail (like version 8.6 or later))
so that your site will accept mail destined to username@mumble.techwood.org.
(and kill -1 your sendmail daemon)
