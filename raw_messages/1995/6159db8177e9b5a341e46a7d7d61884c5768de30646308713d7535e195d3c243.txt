More accurately, you cannot prove a forall statement about an infinite
set by demonstrating examples - but you can disprove it with a single
refutation, however, your argument is incorrect in this context.

Since computers current digital computers (and programs) are (close to)
finite state machines, we can prove many forall statements.  But even
more to the point, it is the job of the person asking you to trust them
to justify that trust.  If you trust them with a less-than-adequate
basis, you have only yourself to blame when you get burned.

That's me - a tinker-toy logician.  But why do you believe that PGP can be
trusted?  Because someone told you so in email on an Internet forum?  I
would hate to bet billions of dollars a day and the lives of hundreds of
thousands of people on that judgement.

Ah!!! A threat.  You should be aware that threatening homocide is a form
of assault.  I will be certain to tell the FBI your exact words...  "the
kill-file, the bozo-filter, more rudely, a <plonk!ing>." sounds to me
(and may well sound to them) like a threat to commit murder.

I am being nice, but you are not.  Perhaps you should consider
addressing the issues.
