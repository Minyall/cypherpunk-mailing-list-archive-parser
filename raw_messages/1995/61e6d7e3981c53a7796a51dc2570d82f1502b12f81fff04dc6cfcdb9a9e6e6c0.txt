Hm. Time for agents. But here's a fairly simple test:
if there are no uppercase letters in the body of the message, and no
apostrophes either, it's likely from "anonymous", our favorite Thomas.

After all, the other reputable nyms at least *sign* their stuff, don't
they? [and PGP generally seems to use upper-case when it writes
signatures]
