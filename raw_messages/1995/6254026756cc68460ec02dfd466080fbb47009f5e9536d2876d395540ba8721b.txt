Just got back a message from Julf's remailer that my Anonymous message failed
(wrong password). Needless to say, I didn't try to send one through the
remailer. The message it was refering to is the one I sent to the list
earlier. Is this a repeat of the an/na problems we had in the past?

Confused,
