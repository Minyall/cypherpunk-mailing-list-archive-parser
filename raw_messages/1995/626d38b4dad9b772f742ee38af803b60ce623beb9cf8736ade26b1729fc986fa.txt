I worked on the Mac version of Nautilus for a very short while.
Nautilus was to provide a core of interoperable code for doing
voice-as-modem-stream on SunOS, DOS/Win, and Mac platforms. The
developer agreement that all developers had to execute specifically
said "I promise not to add any crypto."

That might sound odd-- but the crypto was to be added later, under the
direct or indirect supervision of PRZ. I ran out of time before the
code reached that point.

I don't know what percentage, if any, of the Nautilus code is
incorporated in PGPfone. Based on Will Price's CryptDisk work, I look
forward to learning from the PGPfone source code.
