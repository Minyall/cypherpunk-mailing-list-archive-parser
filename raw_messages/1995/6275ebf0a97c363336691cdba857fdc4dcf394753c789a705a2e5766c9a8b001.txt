Secret sharing can be done by Hamiltonian paths.  No public key code has been
found to take advantage of those, or any other NP complete problem, so far as
I know.  DNA computing really doesn't solve the Hamiltonian graph problem, it
just makes the biggest one that you can solve a little bit bigger.  500 point
graphs remain insoluble (pun unitended) for earth-sized vats of DNA. 

Really.
