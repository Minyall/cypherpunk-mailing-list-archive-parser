I heard a while back about being able to "split" up a PGP key.  What 
about
splitting up the key into many parts, and giving them out to multiple 
INDEPENDANT
agencies.  ie: One piece goes to the FBI, one to the NSA, one to some 
other committee, and
so on.  That way, no goverment body could just tap your conversations 
without getting
approval from others, and gaining the pieces of your key.

just a thought
