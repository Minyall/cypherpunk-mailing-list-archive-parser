Pardon me, but since this "key escrow" system was always claimed to be
"voluntary," then how can there be any kind of legal penalties associated
with "failure to release" those keys?


Which raises another question:  Let's suppose I owned a product based on
CKE, and I went to the escrow agent and said, "This escrow is voluntary,
right?  If so, erase my key in your possession."

Not that I'd trust them to do so, but how "voluntary" can a system be if
people can't volunteer out of it?
