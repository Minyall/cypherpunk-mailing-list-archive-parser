I suppose the word "receipt" might be handy to introduce into the entire
scheme. A dispute over who payed & who stole is solved with paperwork of some
sort. Although a digital signature is not necessarily valid (I don't even know
what the Utah Digital Signature Law does) but the bank, as rule-setter
is allowed to say that a digital receipt DOES bind the parties in some
way.
