    Announcing a new security mailing list - The Alert.

    The Alert will be covering the following topics:

    	- Security Product Announcements
    	- Updates to Security Products
    	- New Vulnerabilities found
    	- New Security Frequently Asked Question files.
            - New Intruder Techniques and Awareness

This sounds a lot like bugtraq.

A `hacker' is one who writes code.  Breaking into systems is `cracking'.
