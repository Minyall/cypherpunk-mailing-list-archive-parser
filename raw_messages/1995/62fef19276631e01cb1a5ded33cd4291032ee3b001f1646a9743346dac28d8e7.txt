As a libertarian nut, I bow to no one in my love of extreme statements.  
But I feel compelled to sqaush this particular notion whenever I see it.  
Randy Weaver really pissed off the Feds and did not go to jail (except 
during trial) and received a $3.1 million settlement.  (.1 to him, 3 to 
the kids but they are minors).
