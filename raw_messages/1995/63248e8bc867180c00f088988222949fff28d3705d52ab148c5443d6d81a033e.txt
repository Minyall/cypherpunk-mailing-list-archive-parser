There are some other problems too I believe.  I have worked for a decent 
sized network who did all user authentication at the terminal servers for 
dial-in accounts thru DNS.  This wasn't too bad for just passws and 
stuff, but wouldn't this cause some bloat in the nameservers database?  
As well as cause problems security wise when it comes to updates.  Would 
these automatically not be cached in any form by the site making the 
request?  This also causes a problem for smaller time people who perhaps 
have a PPP/SLIP connection 24/7 but have nameserve done by their prvider, 
and I for sure don't want my provider to be in control of those keys.
