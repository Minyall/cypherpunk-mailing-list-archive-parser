Damn fine idea, but how do a bunch of (p)anarchists choose a mouthpiece ?
Should we assign someone to be 'our' lawyer ?
 
I'd volunteer to be 'spokespunk', I've certainly been interviewed for TV and
print enough, and know how to handle and present myself to the press, but if
this is considered an 'honor' rather than a 'pain in the ass and potential
legal lightning rod' then I'd like to suggest someone with a longer pedigree
who has been writing more code lately take it on.  Tim ?
