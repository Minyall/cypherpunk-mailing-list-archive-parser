Ok.  If I want to get my email ad for the Ronco turnip-twaddler past a filter
like that, all I need to do is to create a PGP key with
a user name that's the same as one that the victim already
receives.

i.e. if I know that joe@blort.com exchanges email with phred@none.net, then
I just create a PGP key with the name "phred@none.net", and sign
the turnip-twaddler ad with that.  It'd have a valid signature, and
one coming from Joe's friend phred.   Mail accepted.

In addition to checking for a valid signature, the filtering software
would have to also check the PGP key id of the key used.  It would
also need to make sure that there is ONLY PGP-signed content in the
mail.  Otherwise Mallet could grab an innocuous mail message that
Phred signed and included it at the bottom of the turnip-twaddler ad.
It wouldn't make sense (although that might be usual with Phred), but it'd
contain a valid signature from Phred, and therefore get the ad
past the filter.

I'm sure there's other caveats, these are just the ones I can think of now.



I wish all Cypherpunks a Merry Christmas.  I hope Santa brought you
all something nice, like a fast new stream cipher, a new key exchange
protocol, or maybe a note from the Fedz saying that ITAR has been lifted.
