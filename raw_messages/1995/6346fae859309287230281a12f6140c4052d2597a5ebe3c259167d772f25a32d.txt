I guess he/it must be some existentially frustrated Java virus.
(apologies in advance, couldn't resist)

(my little contribution: People download binaries off the net all the time.
Code gets infected and infects PCs. Big deal. Infected PC's on networks can 
infect the rest of that network and call in even more infectious code from 
across the net. So what? I'm sorry, is this a new concept here?
It doesn't take netscape/java to do this. It's been possible to do this
in C for the longest time. Just takes a little more effort.)

These opinions are not even my own. Blame them on my non-algorithmic OTP and 
its good friend Mr. Line Noise.
