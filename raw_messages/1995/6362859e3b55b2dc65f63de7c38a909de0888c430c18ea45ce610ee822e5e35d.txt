I've only been skimming the NetScape-related posts lately, but I've yet
to see anyone mention using a keyboard-timing sampler as a source for
some random bits... I believe this is still a workable solution even in
Windows, though probably not as 'precise' as if it were run from DOS.

Any comments?
