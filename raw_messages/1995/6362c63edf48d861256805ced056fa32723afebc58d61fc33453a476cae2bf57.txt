You might want to check into STEL from CERT-IT; in their paper
describing it, they note that ports exist (as of June '95) on
HPUX, SunOS, IRIX, Solaris, and Linux. Since you mentioned an
interest in hacking some code yourself, you might want to see
if you could make a Windows port of their client.

STEL should be available via anonymous ftp at
	ftp://ftp.dsi.unimi.it/pub/security/cert-it/stel.tar.gz

CERT-IT can be found on the web at
	http://idea.sec.dsi.unimi.it/cert-it.html

...and the authors of the STEL paper, and their email addresses
are:

	David Vincenzetti	vince@dsi.unimi.it
	Stefano Taino		taino@dsi.unimi.it
	Fabio Bolognesi		bolo@dsi.unimi.it
