	Does anyone know if RSAREF works on 64 bit CPUs? It seems
that RSAREF's NN_Mod is getting stuck in digit.c at:

99         */
100       while ((t[1] > 0) || ((t[1] == 0) && t[0] >= c)) {
101         if ((t[0] -= c) > (MAX_NN_DIGIT - c))
102           t[1]--;
103         aLow++;
104       }


	on a dec alpha..
