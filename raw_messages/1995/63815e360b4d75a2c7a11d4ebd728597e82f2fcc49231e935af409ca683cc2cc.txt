Whoah, there!

I wasn't saying we were "quibbling" about definitions, I was saying that
different people have different names for things and different
interpretations, and that it behooves us to figure out what the real
definitions are, the standard names, and not invent new names when existing
names will do.

And that one benefit of class libraries for the "things" of commerce,
finance, crypto, etc., may be make it clearer what is being described.
