The Mondo article ("Total Surveillance" by Charles Ostman) was a joke.
Among other things, he claims the Teledesic project is a massive
satellite surveilance scheme.  Those birds are going to be in
geo-synchronous orbit!  What's more, even a LEO spy-sat weighs many
tons.  Nobody could launch 840 satellites of that weight without being
noticed.

From the innacuracies in what I do know about, I assume all of the
phone-paranoia is also unjustified.
