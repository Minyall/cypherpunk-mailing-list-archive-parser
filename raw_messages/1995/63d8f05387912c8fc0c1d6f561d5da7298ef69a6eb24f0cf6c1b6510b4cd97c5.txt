Saw Under Siege II last nite--fairly bad movie--wouldn't recommend it, 
but there was some cpunks/crypto relevance.

*	Mentioned the No Such Agency's SIGINT capabilities via COMMSAT

*	Mentioned encryption several times:
	+	WRT to cell phones
	+	WRT to Newton and encryping files
	+	WRT to codes--used a CD-ROM to store a keyspace and 
		encrypt and compare

Encryption is going mainstream folks.
