Why bother with the shared key?  You need a message from Helen describing
the powers with which you are invested, signed by her key.  The wonderful
thing about data is that copying it is virtually free.  When you issue an 
order on her behalf, include a copy of the signed PoA, and sign the whole
thing with your key.
