There was a posting allegedly from a Harvey S. Cohen at AT&T on 
soc.culture.jewish to the effect that the "Long March" email is, in 
fact, a fraud intended to get the National Alliance in trouble. (a noble 
cause if not necessarily appropriate means)

I don't know if this is connected but I notice that a "let's use these 
big lie tactics on Usenet" posting allegedly from the National 
Alliance's Compuserve address seems to have somehow gone through the 
University of Pennsylvania.
