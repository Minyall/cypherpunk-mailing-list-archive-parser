   It was released as a dynamically linked binary first, however
gazillions of Linux users who didn't purchase Motif (and hence could not
run Netscape 2.0 since it uses Motif), complained, and Netscape
put up a statically linked version immediately.

   No, the Java in Netscape 2.0 is Java BETA. The Java used in
earlier versions was Java Alpha, and Sun explicitly said that
the class hierarchy *would* change. The Java used in Netscape 2.0
is the same Java you get in SunSoft's Java development environment.
