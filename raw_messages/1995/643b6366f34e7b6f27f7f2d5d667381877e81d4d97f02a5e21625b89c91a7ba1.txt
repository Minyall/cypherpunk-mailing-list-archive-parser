It's important here to distinguish economic "espionage" and economic
"intelligence."

Espionage refers to the stealing of secrets with humint, and genrally the
term economic espionage refers to the actual thefts as with the French
government stealing bids, and bag jobbing American businessmen.

Economic Intelligence is much older, and is more about economic analysis
on a macro scale of the target country.

I mention these because the doublespeak can trip up people who aren't
used to what the intelligence types are saying.

John Deutsch is definately an economic intelligence man, but has in past
been quite opposed to economic espionage.
