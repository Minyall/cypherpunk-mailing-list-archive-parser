This is fascinating! Could you please explain (for the benefit of clueless
Ph.D.'s like myself) how putting your anon id in your signature enables folks
to send you anonymous e-mail, who couldn't do that before by e-mailing
anon@anon.penet.fi and adding:

X-Anon-To: erc@dal1820.computek.net

(E-mailing erc%dal1820.computek.net@anon.penet.fi might work too.)

I do see how it stops you from being anonymous when you post via that
particular anon.penet.fi address, but that's a different issue.
