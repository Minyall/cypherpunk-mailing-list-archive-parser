Hello all.

Someone mentioned this on IRC last night, and it sounded like a really
cool idea, so I thought I'd mention it.

The idea is to generate random numbers using a geiger counter tube and
a small portion of radioactive substance (like perhaps the stuff they
use in smoke detectors?) Would that be random enough?

I thought it was a neat idea anyway.
