: Subject: Internet Police

: According to an AP story, Wisconsin Attorney General James Doyle says that
: police must monitor the Internet to stop child porn, drug trafficking, and
: fraud.

: "We need to see that police are surfing the Internet just as other people
: are," Doyle said. "This is a good example of where the law is slower than
: technology."

"Stop Wisconsin Internet Police" "Your'e speeding"
