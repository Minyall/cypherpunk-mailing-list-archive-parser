I assume that C$ is only filtering the newsfeed as it hits German shores?
Please tell me
they aren't denying access to these "banned" newsgroups for all users

This is exactly what they are doing, Mr. Neely.  I am not familiar with
CompuServe, as I have never used it.  However, based on my understanding of
how Usenet operates, it would be possible to write software and incorporate
it into CompuServe software that would block German readers from the
"obscene" newsgroups.  CompuServe would rather score points with the mostly
ignorant general public by saying that they are becoming more
"family-oriented."

I get my access through America Online, and I am afraid that these monolith
online services (AOL, Delphi, Prodigy) will follow C$'s lead so they may also
say they are "family-oriented."

I will no longer send mail to addresses that end with "compuserve.com."  If
AOL decides to become family oriented, I will look for other ways to connect
to the net.
