I thought about this a bit, but I don't think that reading randseed.bin
counts as "mucking around with" the "PGP setup."

PGP launders randseed.bin before saving it for just this reason, so that
reading it won't reveal information on the user's session keys.

And the Netscape folks have published the source code which shows that
they only read the file and hash it with MD5.  That the contents of
randseed.bin have been mixed into an MD5 hash with a bunch of other
things can hardly be called a security hole, in my estimation.
