Friends - and Bernstein,
-	I am a writer on assignment from the Economist writing about a 
certain cryptographers' tussle with the State Department, a fellow who is 
known around the beltway crypto-anarchy, privacy, 
niceness-on-the-Internet advocacy crowds as Bernstein. I have the outline 
of the case from the attorney's handling it. But my editors would really 
like to be able to name the party and sketch his background. All I have 
now is a last name, that he is a professor/and/or graduate student at UC 
Berkeley and is being roughed up by the State Department. Can anyone here 
- or the hero of the hour himself - come forward and help me complete my 
assignment?
-					Regards,
-						Peter Cassidy

-	PS: By the way, thanks to the guys who helped me shore up some 
basic concepts for the pieces I've done for OMNI and the Covert Action 
Quarterly that have touched on cryptography. Weirdly, one editor actually 
knew the fellow from Texas that I'd interviewed on technical points. 
(They worked together on a newspaper. What a ruck!)
