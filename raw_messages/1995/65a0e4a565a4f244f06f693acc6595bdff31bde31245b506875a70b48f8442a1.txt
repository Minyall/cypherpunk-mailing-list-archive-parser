I don't think Tim threw in the towell on this bill, but has come to 
realize that the overall war on privacy cannot be won by concentrating on 
the individual battles.  We've ALL got to take a deep breath and come up 
with a different plan of attack; a plan that the TLAs and spooks will be 
unable to defend against.  Right now, as long as we're kept busy with 
individual bills and initiatives, they have us just where they want us.
