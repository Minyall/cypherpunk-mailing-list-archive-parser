If I am digging up old info please excuse me, I haven't been able
to read the majority of mail due to the volume of, fluff, shall
we say.

For U.S. cypherpunks this is it:
H.R. 4922 "Interception of Digital and Other Communications"
passed as of October. This is the first *I* heard about it.
In short the bill requires:
" ...telecommunications carrier shall insure that it's equipment,
facilities, or services are capable of (1) expeditiosly isolating and
enabling the government, persuant to a court order or other
authorization, to intercept, to the exclusion of all other communications,
all wire and electronic communications carried by the carrier....etc.

Time for me to generate more keys!
