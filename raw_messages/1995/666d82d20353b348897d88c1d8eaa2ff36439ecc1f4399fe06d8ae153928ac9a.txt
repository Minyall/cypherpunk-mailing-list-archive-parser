Bad idea, it would simply mean that every kook on USEnet would add 
alt.cypherpunks onto the crossposting line. We would have black helicopters, gun 
loons, Waco Wako's, Loonytarians and turkish government propaganda spamming 
forever.

I think we should wait a while. I see USEnet going through some very dramatic 
changes quite soon, the infrastructure of newsgroups is now insufficient to 
support the cognitive complexity of discorse amongst so many people. I expect 
more structures discorse models such as the lightweight link semantics of 
Openmeeting and Wit to percolate in, NCSA already have a version of hypernews 
with these features.

One thought to ponder on. There is no real difference in terms of resources 
required between a mailing list and an archive of a mailing list at a Web site. 
The latter does avoid a large number of unnecessary dispatches however.
