  In global.h, UINT4 is typedef'd to be unsigned long int, which is a 64 bit
value on the DEC alpha system.  The type UINT4 is supposed to be a 32-bit
value.  On the DEC system you need to make that be an unsigned int, which is
32-bits.  I've complained to RSA before about this problem, as it bit me
when I was porting SSLREF to the DEC machine.  They mumbled something about
people using the pre-compiled libraries, and ignored me.  It would be
so easy for them to just ifdef this one line...
