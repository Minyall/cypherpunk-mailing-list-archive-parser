  After talking with Jim over lunch, I believe that the second interpretation
is more accurate, and is certainly true of the companies position at this
point.  Also keep in mind that Jim's comments are his own opinion, and do
not necessarily represent the position of the company.  Barksdale's law is
that we provide value to our customers.  Our customers want long keys an
no GAK, both within and outside the country.  As long as we are legally
allowed to do that, I think we will.  The fact that customers know the
dangers of 40-bit keys, and that it is the government that is forcing
them to use weak keys, is in large part due to the brute force cracks
of the cypherpunks.
