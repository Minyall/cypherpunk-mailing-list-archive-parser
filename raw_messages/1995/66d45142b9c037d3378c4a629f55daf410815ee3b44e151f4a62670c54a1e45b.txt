a NSA lackey (yet), so I guess I have more time for pettiness ;)

In the context of RFC 1750, it appears to me that the phrase "truly random
hardware techniques" does not refer to the type of RNG method employed in
PGP. Section 5.3 discusses the use of built-in digitizers of analog natural
sources, and turbulence in disk drive chambers, as the "truly random" 
"existing hardware" techniques. Keystroke timing only seems to fall under
6.2, Non-Hardware Sources of Randomness.

5.3 Existing Hardware Can Be Used For Randomness

   As described below, many computers come with hardware that can, with
   care, be used to generate truly random quantities.

5.3.1 Using Existing Sound/Video Input
[...]
5.3.2 Using Existing Disk Drives
[...]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
6.2 Non-Hardware Sources of Randomness

   The best source of input for mixing would be a hardware randomness
   such as disk drive timing affected by air turbulence, audio input
   with thermal noise, or radioactive decay.  However, if that is not
   available there are other possibilities.  These include system
   clocks, system or input/output buffers, user/system/hardware/network
   serial numbers and/or addresses and timing, and user input.
