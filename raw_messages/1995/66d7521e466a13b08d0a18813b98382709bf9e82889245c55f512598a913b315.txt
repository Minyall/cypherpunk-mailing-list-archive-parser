Thanks.  I have added the [from Schneier] estimate

   e ** ((ln p)**1/2 * (ln (ln p))**1/2)

and number field sieve estimate

   e ** ((ln p)**1/3 * (ln (ln p))**2/3)

to the Photuris draft, with a small amount of explanation.

Hilarie Orman posted that 512-bits only gives an order of 56-bits
strength, 1024-bits yeilds 80-bits strength, and 2048 yields 112-bits
strength.  I do not have the facilities to verify her numbers.

As most of us agree that 56-bits is not enough (DES), the 512-bit prime
seems a waste of time and a tempting target.  I'd like to drop it, but
Phil is inclined to keep it with a disclaimer.
