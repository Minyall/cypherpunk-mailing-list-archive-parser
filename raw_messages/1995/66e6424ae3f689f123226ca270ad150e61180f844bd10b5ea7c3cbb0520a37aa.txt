I should add that later in the article it suggests the scenario of
select information from the database being used in an audit, and
you would be able to contest the specific information they use
against you, but you would not be able to view any of the raw data.
                     ^^^^^^^^^
It sounds like this amounts to "we don't have the info until we use
it against you".
