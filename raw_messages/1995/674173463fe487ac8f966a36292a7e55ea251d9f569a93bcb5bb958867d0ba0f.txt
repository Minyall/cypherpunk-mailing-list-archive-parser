    I just recieved an electronic junkmail!

    . . .

    Cypher punks to the rescue? my privacy has been violated anyone got any
    ideas besides just putting each individual into my kill file?

Well, it's not a perfect solution and it might not have done anything
in this particular case, however the amount of electronic junk mail
has dropped close to zero osince I added ``Please do not send
electronic junk mail!'' to my signature.
