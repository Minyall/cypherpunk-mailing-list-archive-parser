There seem to be a bunch of people interested in helping with a Linux
version of IPSEC. If you guys could spontaneously self-organize it
might help -- I unfortunately am not in a good position to do it for
you :-)

Having a Linux version would be extremely key -- I'm very glad to see
the enthusiasm for it.
