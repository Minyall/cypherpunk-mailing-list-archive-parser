So when the money Alice gave to Bob gets deposited by TCMay,
That it was Alice's is instantly known. This is not how physical cash works.

There is a chain from TCMay through some number of steps to Bob.
Even if you can't find it with this single case, you could use
a zero-knowledge type proof to slowly uncover Bob's identity.

I keep wanting to believe in ecash, but I'm not convinced
it can exist.
