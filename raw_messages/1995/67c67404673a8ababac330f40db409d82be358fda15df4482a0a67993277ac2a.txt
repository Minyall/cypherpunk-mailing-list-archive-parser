This assumes that every Usenet site uses RFC 822/1036 headers locally. This
is no real-world assumption. 

And the clearsign problem can be solved with MIME only, since currently, 
the MIME 8-bit character set conversion will kill the validity of 
signatures, regardless whether being forged or not.

Since I know this, I seldom use clearsigning. Quite simply, it does not 
work, and that's a more severe problem. If an error on signature validation
is the normality, not the exception, the whole stuff does not make any 
sense.
