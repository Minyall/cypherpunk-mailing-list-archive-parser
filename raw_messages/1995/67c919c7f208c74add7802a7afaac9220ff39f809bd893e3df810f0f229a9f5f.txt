   Beyond taking Lance on his PGP-signed-word, which I'm strongly inclined to do,
   I suspect he may not have much legal leeway in this regard.

There *will* always be a free version of the client with source code,
but the proprietary improvements will probably not be merged into the
free version.  Lance, and only Lance, as copyright holder, has the
publish the code under a different copyright.  It's the same thing
that Phil Z. did with ViacryptPGP.
