Oh, yes-- we do. The Army lost a small number (two or three) of of
UH-60 Black Hawks in crashes where the flight control system suddenly
commanded extreme pitch or attitude changes. Why? In all the crash
cases, EMI from nearby TV or FM transmitters was found to be the
proximate cause. The Army, and Sikorsky, immediately went to work to
better shield the FCS from EMI.

It's interesting to note that the Navy's SH-60, a UH-60 variant, was
designed from the start to be EMI-immune. Ships' radars operate in the
10-100kW range, and that's a lot of EMI when you're landing 15-20m
away from the radar mast.
