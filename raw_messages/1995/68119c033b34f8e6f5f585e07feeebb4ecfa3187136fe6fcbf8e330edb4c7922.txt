Best.com offers a dedicated 28.8kB line connection to the internet 
with $450 setup charge and $60 a month connect charge.  This
is a permanent connection, not a dial up connection.

This works out to $720 per year, plus setup charge.

This is as cheap as it gets for a box on the internet.

Now this is OK if one wishes to run linux, and have a
remailer as one hobby in addition to the main use of the
box, but it is still a bit much to pay for a dedicated 
remailer.

Now I just do not like linux.  Sure it is a great
operating system but it will not run codewright

(Vi causes mental degeneration.  Even though I detest,
loath, and hate vi, vi takes up so much brainspace that
I find myself issueing vi commands in editors that I 
use much more, and vastly prefer to vi.  Vi is evil.)

Therefore there is no way in the world I am going to
waste a full internet connection and a PC on linux.
