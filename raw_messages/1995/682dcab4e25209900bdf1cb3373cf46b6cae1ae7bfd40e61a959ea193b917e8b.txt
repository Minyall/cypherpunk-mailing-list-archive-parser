Yes, the speedups are patented.  Their system relied on very specific 
curves with very specific properties.  I purposly avoided coding up their 
method because of that.  Their method is described in patent #5,159,632 
dated Oct 27, 1992 and it uses a different equation (supersingular 
version) than what I implemented.  The price is slower speed, but with 
100 MHz processors you won't notice.
