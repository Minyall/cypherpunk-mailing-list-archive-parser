Last July *hobbit* (hobbit@avian.org) presented to this list a
description of "The FTP Bounce Attack" and stated that it's trivial to
hack past a defense like this (well, it didn't seem trivial to me, but
I'm not a unix wizard). Obviously, there is no real need for such attacks
with PGP and 'everything' else available at non-US sites, and I guess it
would leave traces? But it would be interesting to know if anybody have
successfully tried it at MIT or some other export-restricted FTP site.
