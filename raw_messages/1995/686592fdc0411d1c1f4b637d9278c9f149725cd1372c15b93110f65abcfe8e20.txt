   I offer to pay for and operate a remailer account on any system that will
   have me.

best.com, based in Mt. View, CA.  Mail to postmaster@best.com, or try
the other standard extensions.

I'm sure there are others.

   Do we have the software yet to run a remailer out of an account?

When I wrote the first cypherpunk remailer, this was a design
criterion.  In other words, yes.
