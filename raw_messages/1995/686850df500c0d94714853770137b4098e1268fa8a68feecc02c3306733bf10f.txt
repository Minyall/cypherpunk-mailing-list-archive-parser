I've found mkpgp to be a very useful tool, and an easy to use add on for 
'pine' and pgp. But for those that prefer a GUI E-Mail application,
I think it would be great if Netscape were to integrate some 
more security in that portion of their navigator. Or perhaps a third 
party could add this in by creating a PGP 'Plugin' for Netscape...
