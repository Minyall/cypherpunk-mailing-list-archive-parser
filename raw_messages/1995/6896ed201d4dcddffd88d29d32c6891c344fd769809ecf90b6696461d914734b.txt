I've finally gotten some time to incorporate a few new features/bug fixes
into Private Idaho (Windows remailer/PGP front-end).  The 2.5b4 release now
incorporates an easy interface to the alpha.c2.org nym server.  Also, simple
scripting is available for moving messages to e-mail apps that don't support
sequential header tabbing (Free Agent, Netscape, etc.).

The next available block of time will likely be devoted to incorporating
background POP3 scanning and downloading of PGP messages.

Thomas Jefferson used strong crypto, shouldn't you?
