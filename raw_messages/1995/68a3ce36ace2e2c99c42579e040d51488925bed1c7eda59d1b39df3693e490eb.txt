In that case, look at the last two pages in "Applied Crypto - 2nd ed", where
Wiley puts ads for related books.  You'll find:

- "E-Mail Security", also by Bruce Schneier
- "Protection and Security on the Information Superhighway", by Frederick B.
Cohen
- "Digital Money", by Daniel Lynch and Leslie Lundquist

I am neither attacking nor defending Fred Cohen; I don't know him from Adam,
and haven't read his messages or his book.  But since you asked for where
you can find Cohen's published work, there's one answer (assuming it's the
same Fred Cohen).
