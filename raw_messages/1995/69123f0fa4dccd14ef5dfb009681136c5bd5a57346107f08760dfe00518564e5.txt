	Just a minor nit regarding a well thought out post, public
keys are not 'global' ids, but 'system-wide' IDs.  For keys to be
really global, there needs to be a mechanism in place for insuring
that key ids are very probably unique.  One way to ensure that keys
are globally unique would be to integrate a KCA identifier with the
keyid, and KCAs base part of their reputation on not signing multiple
keys with the same id.
