I thought I'd ask here, since its related to a lot of the stuff people
have written for the PC platform in these parts. I need to securely
wipe a bunch of data from an MS-DOS hard drive, so that it can't be
recovered. Are there any readily available utilities for this? Will
any of them selectively erase only data that isn't allocated to
existing files?
