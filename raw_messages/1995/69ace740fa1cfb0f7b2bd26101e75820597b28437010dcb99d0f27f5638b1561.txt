So here's another attack on this scheme which I noticed today.
I'll assume you're using the Netscape/RSAREF PRNG:

	prng() {
		increment(my_seed);
		return(MD5(my_seed));
	}

Then an attacker can send you ``1'' as contribution.  This will
xor ``1 << contrib_area'' into your seed.  With probability 1/2,
this will be the same as subtracting ``1 << contrib_area'' from
your seed -- and in this case, your PRNG will repeat after
``1 << contrib_area'' more outputs.  This is much worse than the
expected 1 << 128 cycle length.


So this is an example of why it's dangerous to xor in values
*chosen by your adversary* to your seed.

I don't know about any work on related-key attacks on stream ciphers.
For block ciphers, related-key attacks are much stronger than other
attacks. (e.g. DES can be broken with ~ 2^28 related key queries and
about ~ 2^28 off-line computation steps)


Here's some references on related key attacks on block ciphers.  If
anyone can find any other work in this area, let me know!
