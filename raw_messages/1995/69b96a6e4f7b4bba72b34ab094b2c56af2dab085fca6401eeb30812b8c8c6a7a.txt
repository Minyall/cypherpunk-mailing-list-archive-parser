No, it doesn't belong, and deliberately being a jerk by posting the
whole thing with a "does this belong at the beginning" isn't a way to
win friends and influence people.

I'm beginning to wonder if the conspiracy idiots on this list are here
from the NSA to keep any real work getting done. Are there any
cypherpunks left here, or is it all just cryptogroupies?

Some of us want to see cryptography deployed, not conspiracy theories
about Waco, Vincent Foster, or your mother.
