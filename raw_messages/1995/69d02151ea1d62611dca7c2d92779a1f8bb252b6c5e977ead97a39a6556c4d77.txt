    The URL itself is:
    Turning Personal handwriting into TrueTypeFont
    (http://execpc.com/~adw/). 
    It includes an interesting .gif file of the producer's handiwork,
    but alas such a font costs $99.

    Uh, no one can't change pen pressure, but I think it can be
    mimicked.  If the effect one seeks of changing pen pressure is
    to vary the line width or ink deposited onto the paper then
    varying speed, and/or overwriting with or without offset can
    achieve interesting effects.  If I recall correctly, the HP
    pen position is addressable to 0.001" resolution, (though not
    accuracy.)  I recall creating some nice effects with multiple
    pen colors offset by a few mils in x and y.
