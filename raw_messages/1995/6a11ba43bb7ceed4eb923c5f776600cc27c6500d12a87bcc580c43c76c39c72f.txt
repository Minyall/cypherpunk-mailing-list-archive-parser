   I'll wager most of us could.  Question: whom would you redistribute it 
_TO_?  This seems to be the stumbling block - who is willing to store the 
data on their machine or net account?  Speaking as someone with about 
300k of quota left, it certainly couldn't be me, though I'd be willing to 
handle the frontend interfacing work.

   How would you handle retrieval of the data?

   Unfortunately I've found that the U.S. government especially can make 
your life a living hell if you don't go along with their desires, even if 
you're following all the laws.  Trumped-up charges.  Fake charges.  I 
wouldn't put much past our government.
