This sort of thing can become very dangerous very quickly. In the
UK there was a publicity seeking shyster who decided to make a
political career out of attacking a book he didn't like. The
authorities didn't want to risk getting involved so they let the
guy go round calling for the author to be murdered. He has been in
hiding since the Ayatoloah issued a death threat.

Sounds like they don't like the democracy so they are setting
up their own lynch law. It dosen't sound all that different from
fascism. First they start saying that a group of people are evil, 
once they have convinced each other that this is the case they take
the logical next step of murdering them.


Another reason why we need cryptography, to protect ourseles against 
such self appointed lynch mobs.
