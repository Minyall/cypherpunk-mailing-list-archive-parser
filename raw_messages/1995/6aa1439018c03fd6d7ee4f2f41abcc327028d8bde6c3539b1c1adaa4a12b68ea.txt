I am shocked at this proposed modem tax, along with the keyboard tax,
the printer tax, the mouse tax, and the cable tax.

FCC Commissioner Craig Shergold has asked that comment on this modem
tax be sent on post cards to him. He is hoping to receive more
postcards than any previous FCC Commissioner.

His address is:

FCC Commissioner Craig T. Shergold
Room 101
Ministry of Truth
42 Oceania Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 10666

In a related note, opponents of this modem tax are encouraged to flash
their headlights at oncoming traffic.
