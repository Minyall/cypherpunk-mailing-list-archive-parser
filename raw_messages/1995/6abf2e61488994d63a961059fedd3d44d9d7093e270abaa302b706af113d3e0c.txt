The Spotlight's official classification in the UC and Stanford library
databases is "Serials -- Anti-Semitic." I don't mean to offend anyone too
much, but the Spotlight is generally regarded to be rather lunatic-fringe.
Though the same is probably said of anyone on the cypherpunks list, hmm...

Spotlight tends to be rather vague in its sources for a reason. I found
the article to which this apparently refers at
http://gnn.com/gnn/wr/sept29/news/natl/index.html. It is rather less
lurid, but might still be of moderate concern. See the October 13
followup. 

I'm copying this to Steve Pizzo. I'm sure he'll get a real kick out of
being cited in The Spotlight, whose politics are a little different than 
his.

This is semantically and logically equivalent to:

Last May, amid growing public disbelief of Establishment media reports 
about the Oklahoma City bombing provocation [provocation?], Fred Rogers 
changed his shoes.

Obviously, Mr. Rogers is part of the conspiracy.

I know that at least part of this is true, at least in part.

SAIC also designed the hull of the Stars & Stripes yacht that won the 
America's Cup. Obviously Dennis Conner is part of a conspiracy that 
involves the Bavarian Illuminati, the Pope (who visited San Diego once), 
and New Zealand. Isn't it suspicious that the last America's Cup was 
contested and finally decided by the New York Supreme Court, the seat of 
the World Jewish Conspiracy?

Disclaimer: I was born in the San Diego area, and I know people who 
worked at SAIC, so I'm probably part of the conspiracy too.

I believe this is the first time I have seen the Post Office favorably

And now we have PROOF! For THIS VERY MESSAGE, sent to THIS VERY LIST only

I know that several people who have been spamming the net with Foster 
garbage have been UDP'd. Read back issues of news.admin.net-abuse.misc.

Hmm, few specifics here. I wonder if they would care to elaborate. Nah.

It is, of course, true that countries including Singapore, China, 
Vietnam, and Cuba control net access rather tightly, and there have been 
reprisals against online dissidents.

Only the Shadow knows.
