It's really about the threat model.

Sure, the authorities _could_ place microphones in offices and homes, but
this requires huge amounts of effort and is only justified when the target
is really, really important.

As Whit Diffie has said (and this makes about the fifth time I've credited
him on this, so I hope he's satisfied), widespread surveillance must attack
the communication channels, not just attack the origins and destinations.
That is, the _economics_ of mandating weak crypto are vastly more efficient
for the surveillance state.
