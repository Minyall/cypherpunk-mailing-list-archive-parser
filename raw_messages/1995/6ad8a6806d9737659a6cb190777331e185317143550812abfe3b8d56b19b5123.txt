    Can anybody briefly summarize for me some options for encrypting email 
    that are secure? I know about PGP but I need something for (my 
    environment) with an easy to use interface (PC-Windows) - for use by 
    people who really aren't very computer literate.
    
    Any ideas?
    
    Thanks!
    
    Connie
