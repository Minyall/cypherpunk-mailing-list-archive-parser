Why bother? Why not just say, if asked, that most reasonable technical
experts believe 40 bits are too small, or show them by a technical
demonstratino as we already have?

There is this widespread and wholely misplaced affection for
"cypherpunks". We aren't a company or an organization. This is a
mailing list, and occassionally a seminar series in places like
NoCal. It isn't a "group".
