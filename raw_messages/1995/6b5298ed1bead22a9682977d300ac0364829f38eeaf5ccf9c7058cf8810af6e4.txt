While it is true that on some versions of X you can watch mouse events on
other peoples computers, it is also true that on some versions you can
watch keyboard input.  At CMU Bennet Yee wrote a program to get peoples
passwords as they typed them in using X's poor/non-existent security back
then.  This was before xauth. 

I still think that the low bits of the mouses X and Y positions as the
user moves the mouse around the screen are a very good source of random
bits for Netscape.
