I hope I'm not alone in wondering why on earth this is the case.

Ok, exporting cryptography from the USA is restricted, and highly
controversial. I think there has been something on this one already.

But what is it, in the legal wibble, that make _hooks_ to
cryptography restricted. How have they worded things to make this the
case.

The hooks are of course completely useless in and of themselves. You
can only do anything useful with them if you have the matching crypto
package.

Yours a confused Brit ... who doesn't have this problem ... yet!!
