I've waited a bit, but as nobody seem to have pointed out, you can
definitly find a unique stream in a *single* pass (but maybe what you
really want is no pass at all ?)
{you add a new random byte each time you find your sequence in the
stream, and goes forward (as the previous separator was not in the
"past" of the stream, you don't need to go back)}

What am I missing ? (anyway, see below)
(I hope my answer is not as clueless as the "A-dice anonymous" one)

Isn't PGP encoded stream containing only base64 chars ? Why not use
"====PGP part #===="  (as you can't have more than 2 = in a base 64,
and only at the end anyway)
or "@PGP part #" or whatever starting with a non base64 char ?

so "@" = 8 bits is my anwser, do I win ;-) ?
