This doesn't necessarily eliminate certificates - while you have a signed
statement from Alice's key that she uses Bank Account X, and a signed statement
from Alice's key authorizing transfer of $D from Bank Account X to Bank
Account Y,
the Bank, or a customer, may refuse to accept the request unless there's 
a signed statement from the Bank's key that Alice's key uses Account X.
None of these need Alice's name, or for that matter the Bank's, as long as
there's
also a signed attribute statement from the Bank's key that it's a bank, etc. 
The meaning of the certificates changes a bit, but there's still a certificate
from the bank binding Alice's Key to Alice's Bank Account.
