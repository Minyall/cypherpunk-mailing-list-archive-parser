;).

Ten easy  steps to become a C.A.:

1. get a copy of SSLeay (try ftp://ftp.cert.dfn.de/pub/tools/net/ssleay)

2. install it

3. generate a key using 'genrsa -idea -rand
/dev/random:/var/adm/messages:/etc/utmp:/proc/net/dev -out
cypherpunks.key 1024'. Substitute a higher number than 1024 depending
on your paranoia. Choose an inconvenient pass phrase.

4. Use your favourite secret splitting method and send key and pass
phrase to respected members of the cypherpunks community.

5. Generate your X.509 certificate using makecert.

6. Sign other people's certificate using x509.

7.-10. Get yourself a decent beer and Applied Crytography 2nd Ed.

Sorry, I'd love to give you details for 5 and 6, but I'm out of
time. I'll deliver them tomorrow.

Andreas
