Because it isn't off topic. It was small and reasonably on-topic. So
are discussions of personal privacy, clipper, electronic cash, NSA
proceedure, and similar stuff. Its the long conspiracy theory rants
about Waco that are pure noise.

Furthermore, Tim, no one ever suggested that coding in C was the only
possible way people could contribute to the efforts we are
making. Popularization, lobbying, legal work, are all important.

It was the constant stream of posts about militias, Vincent Foster's
shoe size, and the like, which we were flaming.
