What this means is that 9^2 mod 35 = 11, and 8^2 mod 35 = 29.  See the list
right above the chart that is confusing you.

For example, it lists x^2 = 29 mod 35 has a solution: x = 8,13,22,27

So actually there are 3 other solutions... 13, 22, and 27 are also square
roots of 29 mod 35.

Yes.

Hm... I forgot.  I have one somewhere and will send it along if I find it.

Yes, you can use the Jacobi symbol to determine if a is a quadratic residue
mod n.  See page 207.

>5)From what does Feige-Fiat-Shamir derive its security?

Difficulty of factoring.
