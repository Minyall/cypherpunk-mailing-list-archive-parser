	But will the signature match that of phred@none.net's PGP
	key.  I doubt it.

	To check a signature, you need the public key the signature 
	was created with.  You allready have phred@none.net's public
	key on your keyring.  If that key does not demonstrate an
	authentic signature for the messge, then the message is 
	a fake.  

	Now, if you assume that your keyring has been compromised,
	then you can also check the signatures of who signed the
	keys.  At a minimu, your signature should be on the authentic
	key.  If it is missing, then you can place the message in
	a "suspected to be forged bin", or just send it to dev/null,
	unread.

	I hadn't thought of that, but here is one solution.

	Run a perl script that automatically deletes everything 
	that is not signed by pgp, with the exception of the date,
	the sender, and the subject line.

	Let's figure out some more threat models.  And how to counter
	them.  

	Man in the middle --- he has your public key, joe@none.net's
	public key, and access to both your pbulic ring, and 
	joe@none.net public ring.   I don't know know how to counter
	this one using filters with perl --- yet.
