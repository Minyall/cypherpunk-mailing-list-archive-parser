Yeah, buy an account on a local ISP, or on C2, got.net, or some other
cypherpunk run/supporting business.

|      For those of us sitting behind a firewall that blocks out all of the 
|      alt, rec, etc.. newsgroups...is there another way to access these 
|      groups?  For example, redirecting the contents of alt.2600 to, say, 
|      comp.2600 (because this firewall allows the comp.xxx groups through).  
|      Or any other hacks around this inconvenience?
