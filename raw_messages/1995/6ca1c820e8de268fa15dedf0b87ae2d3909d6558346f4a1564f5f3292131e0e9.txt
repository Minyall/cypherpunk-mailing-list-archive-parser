No, but treaties permitting citizens of Canada to work in the U.S. are
enforceable in U.S. courts, and other similar treaties that have
personal impact are enforceable in court, such as tax treaties.

In the case of a treaty saying "you aren't breaking a third country's
laws if you transmit something that wouldn't be legal to say in that
country over its telecom lines", its a personal rather than a national
impact and it could be enforced in a U.S. court.

To whom was I being offensive, Mr. Hallam, given that I was refering
to a theoretical non-extant personage? Or are you a charter member of
"lobotomized mongoloids for equal justice" or some such.

Yes, but my reputation is irrelevant to whether or not you can be
prosecuted as a foreigner for the act of handing another foreigner
cryptographic software outside the U.S.
