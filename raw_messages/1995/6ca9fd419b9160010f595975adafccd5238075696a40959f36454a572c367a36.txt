I am looking for an encrypted telnet (or rlogin/etc) package
that supports a Windoze client.  

It looks like all the normal ones that I can find 
(SSH, SRA telnet, SSLtelnet, etc) are just under Unixoids.  
Don't get me wrong - I would prefer to use Unix, but I am
headed off to locations, where I know all I'll have access to 
is Windows, with a PPP stack to some ISP.

I'ld write it myself, - pasteing different packages together,
but I need it working in a day or two.  Can anyone help me here?  


Thanks,
Dan
