MTV has a pretty funny parody of the V-chip concept that they have run on
occasion.  They are advertising that kids should get the MTV-chip which
prevents parents from watching MTV while the kids are at school.  Their
slogan is "keep mind control at home where it belongs".

(I find it interesting that they have an anti-censorship stance, yet censor
many of their videos.  Kind of hypocritical...)
