He didn't say it was illegal to print private banknotes, just taxable.
Anybody can issue paper or metal tokens or whatever - the difference
with goverment-issue currency is that they can pass laws saying you
must accept it as payment for debts, even though your contract
specified repayment in real money instead of private bogons
like green paper IOUs or lightweight impure-metal coins with
politician's pictures on them.

As far as I know, the legal definition of a "dollar" in the US is still a
certain weight of silver, and payment in silver legally satisfies debts;
under current silver prices, that probably costs more than a 
$1 US Federal Reserve Note, so nobody bothers.
