Hi. 

please excuse if this is an inappropriate place to ask this, but what the 
hell...

If I create a set of patches to a PD or GNU software package (i.e. telnetd, 
httpd) to support encryption (in particular SSL), can i put the patches up 
on an ftp site, Or would i be in violation of itar, and therefore risk 
getting hauled off by the feds?  (i'm a us citizen living/working in the 
states).

Thanks.
-TA
