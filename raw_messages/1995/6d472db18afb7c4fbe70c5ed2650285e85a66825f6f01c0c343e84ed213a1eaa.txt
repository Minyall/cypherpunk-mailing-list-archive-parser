	Which makes an exploit all the more useful. If an exploit was
published well before a patch would be available, people would make
accusations that the exploit publisher was aiding
vandalism. (Warranted or not, 8lgm gets these accusations, etc.)
Publishing the exploit after the patch is available means more of an
incentive to go get the patched version. I for one, haven't picked up
the patched netscape yet.
