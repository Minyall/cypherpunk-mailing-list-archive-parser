Yeah. Thats the way it works sometimes. I remember back when that
housewife from minnasota launched her media campaign to have "Married
With Children" taken off the air. All it did was make the show a
hundred times more popular and extend its life for years after it
probably would have been canceled on its own.

And the sad part is that now that they have announced that they are
dropping their unofficial Linux support, I really want to hurt
Netscape badly.

Sigh.
