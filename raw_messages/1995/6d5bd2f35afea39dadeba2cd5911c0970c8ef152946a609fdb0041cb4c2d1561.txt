That's where somebody, e.g. Microsoft or the Church of Scientology, gets
US Federal Marshals to seize your computer.

Article <46j4t6$6od@newsbf02.news.aol.com> in alt.religion.scientology is   

a good article by Adam S. Bauman of the Los Angeles Times. You might find   

it interesting, but not quite relevant enough to post the whole thing
here.
