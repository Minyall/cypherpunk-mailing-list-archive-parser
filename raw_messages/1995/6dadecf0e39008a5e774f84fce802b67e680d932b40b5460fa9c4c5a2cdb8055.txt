About two weeks ago, there was some talk in here with regards to holding 
DC lawmakers crominally liable for passign bad laws.  This was followed 
up with postins pointing out that you can't do that.

However, this morning I remembered something.

Whent he republicans took over the congress, they instidtued that 
Contract on America.   One of the first laws that was passed (by both 
parties, I might add) was a law that made lawmakers abide by the same 
laws that "normal" people abide by.

Does this change, in any fashion, the original idea?
