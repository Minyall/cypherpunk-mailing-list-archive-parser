  It turns out that Taher Elgamal and I started working here within
a week of each other, about 6 months ago.  Neither of us thought to
take a serious look at the RNG seed code.  I don't think that anyone
would accuse Taher of being an amateur in this area.

  I for one just didn't think about it enough to realize that while
we got the RNG code from RSA, they did not provide seed code.

  As for my background, I am not a trained cryptographer, but I do
understand protocols, did some internet security work as a sysadmin
while in school, and have had a casual interest in crypto stuff
for several years.  If you want the gory details see my web page...
