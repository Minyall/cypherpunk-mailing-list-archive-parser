Well, security bugs aside (and I've got the sun4.1.3_u1 and Win32 ns2b
distributions :) has anyone given any thought to using Java to do some
sort of Chinese Lottery attack.  I was re-reading App. Crypto. last
night and it could be feasable.  If you could get your key cruncher
thread loaded into a good many browsers to run when idle . . . .  How
many estimated copies of NS are there?  Anyone want to do the math? :)
