If Mr. & Mrs J. Sixpack seem to know zilch at present about strong or any 
other other kind of crypto, would it maybe, possibly have to do with a lack
of exposure to it on the soap operas of their favorite media, ie TV? Hmmm.

The general level of paranoia on X-Files (100 milion viewers all over the 
world, rabid internet following) is even higher than on this list, and 
the usual discussions on this list would read like a free vacation to their
scriptwriters and researchers. Anyone have any scriptwriting skills?
100 million potential subscribers to toad are stake... (Yes I guess then
we'd have to move to usenet distribution. But think how entertaining our
flames wars would become. Yes I'm definitely calling for it, and the big 
house with the hot tub would be nice too. Only half joking. Honestly though, 
anyone want to find out their email addreses and send out a gratis 
subscription to toad? A script would be nice too. It's better exposure 
than five seconds of Tim with Connie Chung.)
