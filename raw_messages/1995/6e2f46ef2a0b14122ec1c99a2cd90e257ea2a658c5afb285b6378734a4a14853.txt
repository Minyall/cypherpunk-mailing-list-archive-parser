If you look at ftp://toxicwaste.mit.edu/pub/rsa129 you will find a lot
of documentation on the RSA-129 project, including the call-to-arms,
program distributions, papers, etc.

I wouldn't call this the canonical site, but I tried to make available
most everything that I could find on the project while it was running
and afterwards.

Enjoy!
