Pardon me. The amount of vitriol I am going to spew is probably
difficult for people to understand because most folks around here
weren't following the keyed MD5 discussions during the IPSEC work and
have no idea of the sort of crap the professional cryptographic
community put us through.

We spent months, and months, and months, and months, getting advice
from every cryptographer on the planet. Every conceivable combination
of pads, multiple keys, keys before the text, after, before and after,
etc., was discussed over and over and over again.

Finally, the folks at RSA and IBM both agreed that Hugo's scheme, the
one we were putting in to place, was the best possible one. (Thats the
one with the padded key.)

What the flying hell are you doing telling us now, and indeed not even
telling the IPSEC community but instead mumbling on cypherpunks, that
you guys were in possession of information BEFORE the entire
discussion in midsummer that indicated that your own advice was wrong?
