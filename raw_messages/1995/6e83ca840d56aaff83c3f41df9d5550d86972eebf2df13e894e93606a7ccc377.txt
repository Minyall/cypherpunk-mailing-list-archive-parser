Huh?  So you run on 120 workstations worth how much?  to steal a credit
card number worth how much?  Get real - there are hundreds of ways
to get credit card numbers that cost less.  The idea is to make
breaking SSL less attractive than dumpster diving not to make it
impossible.   I'll lay odds that I could get the credit card number
of *any* individual in the US in less elapsed time and with nothing
more than a $1000 windoze machinei, a telephone and a modem.
