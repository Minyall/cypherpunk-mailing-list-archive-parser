No question.  Many high profile public corruption, Mafia, and high-level 
narcotics trafficking cases are made with wiretaps.  In our district, we 
managed to convict almost 20 people in an investigation of the state 
legislature, including the now-former Speaker of the House and > 6 other 
legislators.  Bribing lobbyists took hits, etc.

Particularly effective were the court-approved video and audio tapes of 
the Speaker taking a bribe in exchange for certain action on legislation 
and responding to the bribing party:   "Well bless your heart."
That has become the office's mantra.

I understand the same was true of the South Carolina state legislature 
investigation (wiretaps). 

A number of previous investigations of our legislature failed over the 
past 15 years as the stonewall held.  Wiretaps, hidden microphones, and 
hidden cameras put corrupt politicians (I know - redundant) out of business.

I don't doubt that wiretaps may sometimes be abused despite the 
incredibly onerous review process, but they have positive aspects, too.

Not a lawyer on the Net, although I play one in real life.
