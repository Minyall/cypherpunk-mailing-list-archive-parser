As I understand it, the government owns a portion of the internet. What 
they want to regulate about that is their business. What I want to know 
is how can they regulate what private business and citizen's do with 
there Fiber Optic's, ISDN lines, telephone lines, and computers. If the 
government was to ban anything on the net, it would shurly seem to me to 
be in violation of the first ammenment. Things like pirated software, 
being illegal already, is one thing, but our mail, conversations, ect. is 
diffrent. 

	Does anyone have any information on what grouds Seigel and Lewis 
plan to use for legislation? If they do pass laws regulating the 'net I 
hope someone comes up with a no-spamming law, then I am getting a ticket 
on Jon Coopers plane out of the country.
