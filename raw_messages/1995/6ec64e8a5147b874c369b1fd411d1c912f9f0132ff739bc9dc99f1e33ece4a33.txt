Sallie Mae's commercial paper is NOT backed by the full 
faith and credit of the US government.  They carry a specific disclaimer 
to that effect.  It is true that many personal student loans (GSLs) from 
banks are guaranteed by the government.  The system was recently reformed 
to remove the riskless subsidy to Sallie Mae, which is 100% privately 
owned, and very profitable.

Similarly Fannie Mae and all other priavetly held GSE's are only backed 
by an "implicit" federal guarantee.  Although the only time one of these 
got into trouble the feds did bail it out.

See my forthcoming article "Reinventing Government Corporations" in the 
Illinois Law Review.  Due out in about three months.

OBCrypto: How big a risk premium would YOU want to lend to an anonymous
borrower?  In practice, for the forseeable future any such lending will
almost certainly be intermediated through a very small number (near zero)
of specialists ready, willing and able to measure and minimize the risks. 
Or there will be ferocious requirements for collateral.
