How could it be worse than with the U.S. of A.?? ;-)

Seriously: you may bank in US Dollars (or other major currencies) in many
countries, including all the offshore banking centres. Limited amounts of
cash may be withdrawn using ATM dispensers, against a fee of two or three
USD per operation; for larger amounts, you may ask them to wire money by
SWIFT, Telex or bank drafts to other banks or genric payees. For such
operations, most large banks accept instructions by snail mail, and
sometimes by fax (if the customer signs a letter of indemnity exempting
the bank from liabilities in case of forgeries). Sadly, AFAIK no bank is
accepting digitally encrypted and signed e-mail instructions, and issuing 
digitally encrypted and signed receipts.
