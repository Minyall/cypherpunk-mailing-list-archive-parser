If all Alice's prospective customers are also resellers on the side, then I
agree that she has a problem. But how realistic is a market scenario in which
a new supplier cannot positively identify some legitimate end consumers of a
product or service ?  (I'm ignoring cases in which the market for the
product or service is only just being forged.)  This strikes me as rather
implausible, although I don't claim to have devoted a great deal of thought
to it.
