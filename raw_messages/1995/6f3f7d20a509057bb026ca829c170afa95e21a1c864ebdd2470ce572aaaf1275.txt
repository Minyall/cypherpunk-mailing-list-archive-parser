  I scanned through the ITAR, and I agree that there doesn't seem to be 
anything about hooks that are illegal, but the NSA does have the 
authority to protect whatever threatens national security.  If they are 
over-stepping their bounds who is going to push it to court to find out, 
as that is where the decision would have to be made (very expensive).
  Take care and have fun.
