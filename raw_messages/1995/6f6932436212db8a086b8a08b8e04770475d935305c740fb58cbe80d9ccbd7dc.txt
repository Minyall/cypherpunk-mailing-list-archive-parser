Oops, I actually meant to direct it to the list myself, but forgot
to edit my headers.  Sure.

Assume root.

I know that you can set the 'masquerade as' thing in sendmail, but
of course any other SMTP agents you deal with are going to
correctly identify you when you 'HELO' and you're going to wind
up in the header, somewhere... (well, except smail 3.1, and probably
others.)  -- I'm assuming here the best one will be able to do will
be equivalent to a forgery via port 25.
