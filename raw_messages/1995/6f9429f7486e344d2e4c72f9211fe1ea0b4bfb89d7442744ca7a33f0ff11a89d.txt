Failed transactions are more likely to affect consumer confidence than
trader confidence.  I have yet to find a site on the net where goods are
shipped before receiving payment, therefore the 'at risk' party is the
buyer. Cybertraders will need to establish a level of credibility and
reliability on a par with their terrestrial cousins.  Cyberbuyers will need
to be confident in their ability to call upon yet unwritten international
laws to gain a refund or replacement when goods and services don't arrive as
advertised.

BTW do you want to buy a really big rock way out in the middle of nowhere?  [:>)
