Maybe.

In passing, the whole field of cryptography is filled with interesting
papers with titles like "How to toss a fair coin over the telephone" and
"Avoiding double spenders in digital money systems."

Meaning, how robust cryptographic protocols can be used to avoid scams
familiar to the most junior grifter.

The theme of "proving anonymous betting schemes are not fixed" is in the
same vein, and could establish the reputation of any budding Amos Fiats or
David Chaums out there.
