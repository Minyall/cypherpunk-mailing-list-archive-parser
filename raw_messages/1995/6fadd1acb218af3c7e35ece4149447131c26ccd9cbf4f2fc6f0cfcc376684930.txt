A somewhat useful utility would be one that would compress C code into as 
small space as possible, stripping out all spaces and making variable 
names one character a piece when possible. And of course one to expand it 
back into 'formatted' text, style could even be incorporated.

I'm sure a Perl fanatic knows a quick solution... I'm always amazed at 
how short Perl code is.. :)   Anyone care to take care of this utility?
