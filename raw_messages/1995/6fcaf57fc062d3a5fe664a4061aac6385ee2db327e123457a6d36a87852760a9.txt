AT&T ACCUSED OF DEFRAUDING !!!

     New York - AT&T Corp. is accused in a lawsuit of cheating millions of
residential long-distance customers out of billions of dollars by rounding
off calls to the next full minute.

     The Lawsuit, filed Thursday in state Supreme Court, claims AT&T
residential calls are billed in full minutes, meaning a call lasting one
minute and one second would be billed as a two-minute call.

     Business customers, on the other hand, are billed in six-second
intervals, meaning a one-minute, one-second call would be billed as
one minute, six seconds, the lawsuit claims.
