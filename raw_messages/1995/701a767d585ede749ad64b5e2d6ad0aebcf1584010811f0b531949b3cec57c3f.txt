I gotta read more of this drivil!   ROTFL!   ROTFL!!!


No wonder they dont want it out!  They look like tey belong in the 
funny-farm....Have you ever seen those cute uniforms they wear?  
[really!  Hollywood california, I have *been* to their "church"]   
especially the girls, reminds me of school-uniforms, but they are all so 
grown up [yum!] but with the minds of a moron....[see above drivil they read]

I know this is somewhat off-topic, but I just *had* to say it!
