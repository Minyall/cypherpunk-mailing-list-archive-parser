Cracking VoicePGP is easy, since it's still a bones version without
the encryption installed yet - anybody who can figure out where
to get the software should be able to do it.  Might take more than
10 minutes to do that :-)

However, the rumor mostly sounded like a pro-active version of the
"NSA cracked PGP" version of the FBI Modem Tax on Religious Broadcasting
put out by Madeline Murray O'Shergold.
