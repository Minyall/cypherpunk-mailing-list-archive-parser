I just posted the following from stanford.edu; it probably won't be
approved and propagated in time, though. 

By the way, alt.internet.media-coverage, to which someone pointed me, is 
explicitly *not* for press releases. 

I do not plan to utter the string "cypherpunks@toad.com" because I think 
there's enough noise here already (some from me). 

Apologies to sameer for being presumptuous, but I did say "hope," and I 
also think tomorrow would be a really good time to document the .PWL file 
bugs...

Subject: Info on Microsoft Internet Announcements Thursday, December 7, 1995

Please reply, if necessary, to the address in the current FAQ, because I 
very seldom actually log on to America "On Line." Before forwarding this 
along, please check whether this has already been done; and let me know 
after the fact.

As has already been announced in the print press, Bill Gates, who works 
at a large software company, will hold a press conference tomorrow, 
December 7th (a date with some historical significance), to announce 
Microsoft's Internet strategy.

For information on Microsoft-sponsored marketing events in your area, 
please see http://www.microsoft.com/events/

Approximately fifteen minutes after Mr. Gates begins speaking (anyone 
have the exact schedule? please phone me), we hope to release very 
significant updates to the following Internet sites:

http://www.c2.org/hackmsoft/
  [information on a few security problems with Microsoft products]

http://www-leland.stanford.edu/~llurch/win95netbugs/faq.html
  [canon URL; multiple DNS-load-balancing SPARCServers]

http://www-dccs.stanford.edu/NetConsult/Win95Net/faq.html
  [use this mirror of the above if you have an old DNS server that
   barfs on the www-leland lbnamed tricks]

news.answers, comp.answers, comp.protocols.tcp-ip.ibmpc, and several
higher-traffic groups will receive a text rendering of the above. This 
will be the first approved and rtfm-archived posting; the news-answers 
folks got back to me last week.

gopher://quixote.stanford.edu/1m/win95netbugs will get a text rendering 
of the above, and contains relevant messages from an email discussion 
list.

An email autoresponder to be named later (finger 
llurch@elaine.stanford.edu in the morning).

The various archives on http://www.hks.net/ have additional information 
for the technically minded.

A PGP-signed copy of this announcement is available on request, but I 
don't want to confuse the unwashed masses unnecessarily.
