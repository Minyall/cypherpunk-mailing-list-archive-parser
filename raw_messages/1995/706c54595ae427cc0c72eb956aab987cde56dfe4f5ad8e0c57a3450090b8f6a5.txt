A acquaintance of mine at a now-defunct company compared the reverse
engineered RC4 work-alike that was released on the net with the source they
had licensed from RSADSI.  She noted that the implementations were quite
different (structure and variable names were both very different), so the
work-alike released on the net was indeed most likely reverse engineered.
Someone else queried two or three other BSAFE source licensees, and found
all agreed that the code was not cribbed from BSAFE sources.  Sadly, I no
longer have copies of the (anonymous) post.

Still, I'm not rich enough to punch through RSADSI's smoke screen...
