I don't really understand the use for "can't be opened until
Christmas" tricks.  If you don't want anyone to see your info until
Christmas then just don't give them a copy until then!  If you want
to prove that you have it but not let them see it until later then
do timestamping of hashes, zero-knowledge proofs and so forth.


Can anyone explain what use this theoretical "time-sensitive" crypto
box would be good for?


Regards,

Bryce
