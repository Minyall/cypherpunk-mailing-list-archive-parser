No, but they're doing something that makes me very uncomfortable:  As
I read this, they're hashing the password and some other user
information using MD4 then doing some proprietary permutations on
that.  Given their record with security, I'd rather they used straight
MD4, rather than throwing in something that we can't analyze.

Storage of the Passwords in the SAM Database
--------------------------------------------
 
User records are stored in the security accounts manager (SAM)
database. Each user has two passwords with which it is associated: the
LAN Manager compatible password and the Windows NT password. Each
password is stored doubly encrypted in the SAM database. The first
encryption is a one-way function (OWF) version of the clear text
generally considered to be non-decryptable. The second encryption is
an encryption of the user's relative ID (RID). The second encryption
is decryptable by anyone who has access to the double-encrypted
password, the user's RID, and the algorithm. The second encryption is
used for obfuscation purposes.
[snip]
The Windows NT password is based on the Unicode character set, is case
sensitive, and can be up to 128 characters long. The OWF version
(called the Windows NT OWF password) is computed using the RSA MD-4
encryption algorithm, which computes a 16-byte "digest" of a variable
length string of clear text password bytes.
