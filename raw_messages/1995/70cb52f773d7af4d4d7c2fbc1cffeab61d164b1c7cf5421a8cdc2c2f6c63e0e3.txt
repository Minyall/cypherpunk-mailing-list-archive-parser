Who _is_ legally prohibited from using it?  I think there are some countries
where the very use of crypto is illegal (could someone please list them?),
but who else?

There are some people that may be legally prohibited from _obtaining_ it
from a US site (ITAR yadda), but even so, if JRFurriner downloads
crypto from company C's site in the US, who's guilty of ITAR-violation?
Company C for making it available, or JRF for initiating the action
that caused the bits to be send out of the country?
