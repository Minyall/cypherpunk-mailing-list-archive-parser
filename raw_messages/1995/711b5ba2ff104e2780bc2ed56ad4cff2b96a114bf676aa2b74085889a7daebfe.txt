   This point may have been raised before, but anyway, unless you're using a 
   swiss-bank issued credit card [etc. ...], why would anybody want to use 
   something as completely traceable as a credit card to pay for a remailer 
   or a data haven?

Because not everyone needs paranoid levels of security.

Just because the truly paranoid won't use a service doesn't make it
useless.  Vebum sapienti...
