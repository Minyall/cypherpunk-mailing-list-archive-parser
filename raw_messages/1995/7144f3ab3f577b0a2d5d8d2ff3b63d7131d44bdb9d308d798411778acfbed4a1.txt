   Safe deposit boxes, by virtue of their accessibility to law enforcement,
   are subject to search and seizure under court order and are sealed
   in certain cases (probate). This makes them likely to be the first place
   to look when the Feds decide that we can't have keys anymore. 

I am not designing systems for the paranoid fantasy of an inspection
of all safety deposit boxes by government agents in search of
contraband.

I am interested in designing systems which will fit into business as
usual, that are inconspicuous by their prevalance, and which will be a
part of ordinary and usual protection of data by cryptographic means.

Our goals appear to differ enough to preclude my continuing
involvement on this topic.

Eric
