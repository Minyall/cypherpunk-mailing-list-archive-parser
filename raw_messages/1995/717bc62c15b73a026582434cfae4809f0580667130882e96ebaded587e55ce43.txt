i just want to mention that i obtained the newest code from the web site, 
compiled and everything is working fine.  i started brloop as a 
background process, hope that's ok...

anyway, seems to be doing ok.  i guess i'll know tomorrow when the 
cracking starts.

i think i'll try to get things working on an SGI i have access to as well.
