I answer questions about my megabyte-long "Cyphernomicon" FAQ every few
months, so I guess it's that time again.

My "Cyphernomicon" FAQ, and various shorter and compressed versions, are
available, actually, in several places.

The site I tell people about most often is Jonathan Rochkind's excellent
HTML version at the URL: http://www.oberlin.edu/~brchkind/cyphernomicon/

I recommend that people use their browsers to read it at this URL. To those
who want to download the whole thing and print it out, I have one question:
"Are you on drugs?" (I have gotten complaints from people who tried to
print it out and gave up after 200 pages, somehow blaming me for it being
too long. Use computerized search tools!)

Searching for "Cyphernomicon" with InfoSeek, Excite, Lycos, or other search
tools will show numerous places it may be found.
