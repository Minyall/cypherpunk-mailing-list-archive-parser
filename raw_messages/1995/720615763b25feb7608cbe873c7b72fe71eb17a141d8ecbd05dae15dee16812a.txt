It's obvious that this bill has very little to do with large-scale
money laundering, narcotrafficking nor terrorism.  All those folks 
will simply use "domestic use currency" inside or outside of the 
United States.  At worst, it will cause them a one-time problem.

Then at whom is the bill really aimed?  Average, middle-class
Americans, is my guess.  Fortunately, it doesn't look too tough
to get around.  If you have a matress full of C-notes, I suggest
you start using them to buy travelers checks--including a few
denominated in strong foreign currencies.
