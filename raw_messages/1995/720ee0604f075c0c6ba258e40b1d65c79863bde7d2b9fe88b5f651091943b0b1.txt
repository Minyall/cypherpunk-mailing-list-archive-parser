Poor you, the only major political party to come out with a pro crypto statement 
is a socialist party.

The problem is currently with the right wing, right wing democrats such as 
Clinton and practically all the Republicans. 

Crypto is outsi]de the left right debate which centers on ecconomic goals, 
whether to help the poor or the rich. The crypto debate is on the 
authoritarian/libertarian axis which is orthogonal. Geroge Orwell was a 
socialist, John Stuart Mill a Liberal, both had very anti-authoritarian views 
which used to be known as libertarian. 

If you want a debate on how to convince the authoritarians then perhaps you will 
get some interest. Trying to make crypto control out to be a left/right or 
pro/anti gun control issue is no more relevant than the pro/anti abortion 
debate.
