   How could it be worse than with the U.S. of A.?? ;-)

OK... think about Venezuela. It has bad inflation. It has laws against
converting local currency to US dollars on the black market, which is
basically defined as any agency/person/corporate entity exchanging at
a worse rate than the government rate (at least in Venezuela itself;
you can pay your foreign creditors in Bolivars and exchange them on
the open market for twice the official exchange rate); all
government-rate currency transactions must go through a special
currency review board that checks to see if you _really_ need to
exchange currency. It is illegal to bribe this board and impossible to
get a request acknowledged inside a year without bribery (if it isn't
denied because you didn't bribe the members of the board).

Of course, one day the U.S. may be this bad.
