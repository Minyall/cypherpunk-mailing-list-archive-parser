I don't understand why Kocher's point is correct. For example, why do the
times diverge with the following modification of the modexp algorithm on
pg.2 of the abstract ?

	Algorithm to compute R = y^x mod n:
		Let R_0 = 1.
		Let y_0 = y.
		For i = 0 upto (bits_in_x - 1):
			Let M = (R_i * y_i) mod n.
			Let R_(i+1) = (bit i of x) * M  +
					(1 - (bit i of x)) * R_i.
			Let y_(i+1) = (y_i)^2 mod n.
		End.

(I suppose I should wait for the full paper....)
