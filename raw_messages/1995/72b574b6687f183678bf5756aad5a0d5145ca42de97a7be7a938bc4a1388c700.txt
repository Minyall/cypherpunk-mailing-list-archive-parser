The Religious Alliance Against Pornography has been holding a biggish 
conference in Manila; the focus is on child pornography, and a major topic
of discussion is the evil of electronic networks. The Interpol is among those
participating; the head of their kiddie-porn division claims Britain is the
source of most European stuff, and bemoans the fact that too little is spent
on monitoring traffic, as the war against drugs is considered more important.
