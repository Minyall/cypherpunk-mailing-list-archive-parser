	I'd just like to add one bit to what Jonathan said here.  That
is the AT&T Clipper phones don't come with 'Big Brother Inside'
stickers on them.  The phrase 'key escrow' is not used in the manual
(near as I remember.)  The disclaimer is in very small print.

	Its not a reasonable expectation that a product being touted
as 'secure' is known to its makers to be insecure.  Expecting John Q.
Public to know that without warning labels seems like a strech.
