 No problem.  ;-) I congratulate you guys (Netscape) for reacting 
so quickly. ;-)

  BTW, I checked lynx for the big domain bug and it also crashes. It could
be a unix bug, but my own test program fails to crash looking up a
1000 character domain. Even so, Netscape should be enforcing a
sanity check on the domain.
