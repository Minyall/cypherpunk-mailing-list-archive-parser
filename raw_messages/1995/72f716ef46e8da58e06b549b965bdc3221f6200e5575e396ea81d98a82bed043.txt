Its interesting to note that all the people that were raving mad about Java
seem to be quiet now that MS is proposing to use VB. At least Java was 
designed from the ground up with security in mind. But VB? Actual binary
DDL running around. Just as an explame look at Oracles new PowerBrowers.
They have what they call CSP (or client side processing) which are just that
VB DDL's that you keep in your machine and if you dont have one d/l.
Now their docs say that once you download all it does is warn you
so you can authenticate it and scan it for viruses. This is not good.
Wanna bet who many people dont? And this is not like Netscape plug ins.
Where Netscapes plug ins are ment to handle major content types (like 
streaming video) and you would get them from a company that then you can sue,
CPS are ment to be used anywhere fron plugins type apps down to Java type 
applets like a ticker tape (their exmaple).

Also not that Oracle included BASIC as their client side scripting language.
By readin gthe web pages I saw that the scripts seem to have access
to the clients history, profile, et la. Anyone for a "Hack Oracle Content"?
I will d/l today an play with it, if I mind by guess true who will give
me a t-shirt?
