It is my suspicion that seeds which depend on machine 
states(ie state of your computer at a specific instance of 
time) would always be subject to scrutiny and de-cryption.
As long as the software used to encrypt is not self-modifying, 
the machine state can (through careful manipulation involving 
temperature, clocks, processes etc)always be replicated and 
fixed to an acceptable degree.
This allows you to look into the heart of the encryption 
method and then create a plan to decode based on a brute-force 
attack.  Time is the only friend then of the encryptor and 
unfortunately in the case of credit cards this typically is 
measured in years. Plenty of time for brute force attacks to 
yield fruit.  I'll be gone for two days. will respond to any 
comments Saturday.
