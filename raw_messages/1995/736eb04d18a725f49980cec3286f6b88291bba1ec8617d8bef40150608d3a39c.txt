point well taken, but I thought the original poster stated that one
had to reveal the blinding factors to the bank, which I interpreted
as "sacrificing" anonymity.

frankly, I didn't understand that whole procedure and that's why I
asked someone to go into detail about this very important aspect
of the cash beyond the 3 liners or so I have seen.
