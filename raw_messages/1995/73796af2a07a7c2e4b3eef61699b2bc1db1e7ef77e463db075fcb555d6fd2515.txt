If the next challenge is advertised with time enough, I have a spare
MasPar I could use.

I've been considering porting brutessl to it for a while, but never 
actually tried. Maybe I could have time to do it... That would be real
fun!

OTOH I'm about to leave my current job. Maybe I won't have the time...
But I could try. <:-)
