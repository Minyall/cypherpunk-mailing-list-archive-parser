I generally try to avoid buying anything with the word "Infobahn" on it,
but in the premiere issue of this new magazine there's a 5-page article
about Phil Zimmerman written by Jeff Elliot (of the National Review...but
it's a good article anyway ;).  It's pretty good--if anyone is new to the
ongoing Zimmerman drama it's a good sum-up.
