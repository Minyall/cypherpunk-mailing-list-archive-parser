Hey folks,
	Remember the AOL Good Times virus?  Well, we just got some mail here 
at SPRY warning us about it.  I laughed rather hard.  Anyway, I told the guy 
who sent the mail that I would send him a number of pieces of documentation 
about the fact its a hoax.  There was a NASA newsletter a few months back 
about it.  I deleted it, because I thought I'd never need it again.  
	Does anyone know where I might get a copy of that or another press 
release about the Goot Times hoax?
	I'd appreciate any help.  Thnax,

Brad
