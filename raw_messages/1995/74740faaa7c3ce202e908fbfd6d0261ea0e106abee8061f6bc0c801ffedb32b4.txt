I'm not surprised someone sees a market for this.  I've worked at
a number of customer sites that block access to 900 numbers and
local pay-per-call numbers, which also blocks access to Time-of-day
and some vendors' customer-support numbers.

I assume for that price that it's a gateway product, rather than a site
license for a censored client (which would require sysadmins to go hunt
down everybody's copy of netscape...)  If so, I hope the system at least offers
caching (to save on outside bandwidth requirements and download time),
and has a fair amount of security so it doesn't become a hole in the firewall.

Wow!  Folks have finally found a way to get paid for looking for porn on the
net! :-)
Surfwatch doesn't make it's censored list easily available (otherwise it'd
probably get pirated, or used as an "interesting sites" index...), but
apparently
it blocks access to things other than just pornography - does Webster
indicate what categories of stuff they're blocking?
