We've not "bowed out" on this bill, it's just not significant enough a 
threat (yet) to warrant stirring up a lot of activism about it - which 
would detract from the focus on the CDA and it's clones.

We'll be tracking this bill and will certain help form a campaign against 
it if it looks to be going anywhere. In the mean time, we're issuing an 
analysis of it, and will keep the net informed.
