   [Denise Caruso's column] "New Microsoft network will offer
   a wealth of privacy."

      It seems unthinkable that anything has been left unsaid
      about the Microsoft Network. And even less has been said
      about MSN's design, which Microsoft has said complies
      with the new data-privacy rules that the European Union
      is expected to adopt in September. The new European
      policy would set out clear guidelines about the way in
      which companies -- in this case, Microsoft and its
      independent content providers -- can collect and use the
      personal data about their European customers that the
      companies gather electronically. Microsoft has said it
      plans to extend the same privacy provisions to its
      American customers. The European provisions are a
      striking departure from current practices in the United
      States, where few restrictions protect consumers from
      marketeers, who collect and sell consumers' personal
      information.                                   PEK_boo
