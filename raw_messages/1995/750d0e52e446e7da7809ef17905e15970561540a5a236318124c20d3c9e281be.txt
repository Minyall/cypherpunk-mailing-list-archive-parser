Well, for all those that are looking for something a little lighter after 
todays activity, the new version of the Geek Code (version 3.0) was 
released this morning.

You can find it via your favorite web browser at:
	http://krypton.mankato.msus.edu/~hayden/geek.html

Or finger me for info on how to get it in ASCII version.

Comments appreciated.  I know the revamped political sections aren't 
perfect, but they are a little better.
