As an alternative, there was the Cypherwonks list, which worked just that
way, and such conversations did rapidly go away :-)
What's evolved here instead are a couple of filtered lists,
such as cp-lite, where you can get the conversations that
one or another monitor considers relevant instead of the whole firehose.
It seems to work reasonably well for a lot of people.
