Thanks to all who helped me get my hands on Cyphernomicon.

I now can breeze through the html site at www.oberlin.edu.  I guess at 2am
it didn't work because either I or oberlin were too sleepy.  I still cannot
open an FTP port at netcom.

I got a copy on my Mac by giving a lot of memory to Netscape and getting it
from www.swiss.ai.mit.edu.  I also got a copy from Jeff's zipped copy at
ftp.goblin.punk.net, but my unzipping utility hacked out a few lines.

Here is a summary of what I learned:

  Cyphernomicon
  File Size:  1,287,731 (single character newlines)

  FTP sites:

     ftp.netcom.com/pub/tc/tcmay/CP-FAQ
     The original.  "crowded"  (I couldn't open an FTP port.)

     ftp.goblin.punk.net/pub/docs/cypherpunk.faq.gz
     ftp.goblin.punk.net/pub/docs/cypherfq.zip
     28.8 bps modem, newline=CR, but .zip will change to newline=CRLF
     About 432Kbytes.
     (On PPP@14.4 it took me 6+ minutes to get it.)
     "until someone posts it on a site with higher bandwidth"

     [the upcoming new/changed/mirrored Cypherpunk site]

  HTML site:

     http://www.oberlin.edu/~brchkind/cyphernomicon/
     nice.

  Other http: sites:

     http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/6095/articles/cyphernomicon/CP-FAQ
     text.  very responsive and fast (6 minutes for my 14.4 connection).

     http:/www.isse.gmu.edu/~pfarrell/crypto/CP-FAQ
     text

     http://www.msen.com/~lwp/Cyphernomicon.gz
     About 432Kbytes.  Need g[un]zip utility.

Clearly missing are credits and contact info.

I probably won't get to the FAQ much this weekend (wife & kids expect me to
do my share and bring home the bacon), but maybe in a week or two.  Do I
have to read the sci.crypt FAQ, too, to earn my FAQ badge?
