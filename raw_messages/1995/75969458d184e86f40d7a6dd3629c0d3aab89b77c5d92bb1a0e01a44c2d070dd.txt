The following URL was posted by Ross Anderson (the author of the
article quoted in RISKS):

http://commerce.anu.edu.au/comm/staff/RogerC/Info_Infrastructure/Orlowski.html

This is a pointer for the full text of the Orlowski paper (the cause
of much discussion on the future of crypto in Australia).

Also Roger Clark's home page contains lots of interesting references
for crypto policy, privacy, some info on CFP, etc, very interesting
reading I found:
