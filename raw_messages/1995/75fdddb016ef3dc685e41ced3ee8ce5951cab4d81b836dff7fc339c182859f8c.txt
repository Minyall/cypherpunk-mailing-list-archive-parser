Some others of us, however, are very happy to see that there are 
people still subscribed to this list who don't buy into the tripe that
the "majority" of the people here try to pass off as a political philosophy.

This list _ought_ to be the wrong place for politics, but it is
disingenuous to imply that politics, and pretty nutty politics at that,
doesn't consume a hefty fraction of what this list spews out. The fact
that someone expressing a moderate viewpoint is in danger of being 
flambeed is the list's problem, not Mr. Moore's.
