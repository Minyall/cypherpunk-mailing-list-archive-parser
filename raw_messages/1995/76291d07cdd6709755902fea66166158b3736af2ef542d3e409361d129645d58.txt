	More specifically, few items sensitive electronic items are
hardened against electromagnetic pulses.  Ever see a speaker interfere
with your TV set?  Build a big enough speaker, and you can screw with
your computers memory.  (Of course, if you just use an electromagnet,
and not bother to build a speaker around it, you'll be much more
energy efficient. :) A big enough pulse can confuse just about any
hardware; bigger pulses still can destroy it.  Directed (or
undirected) pulses are easy to produce with the right amps.

	Again, check out Schwartau; your local library probably has
him.
