I think i was misunderstood.  I was not referring to the actual use of light 
in the communications process.  I was talking about the key generation method 
suggested in that article.  Of course the use of light is impractical for most 
- the need for direct fiberoptics aside, you have to be able to test a photon 
for its polarized orientation.  In any case, i dig on.
