Yeah, I played with this idea a while ago and eventually gave up on it, 
exactly because of those long runs of 0x80's and 0x7f's. I'm not sure
how you estimate 0.65 bits of entropy per byte sampled when you have long
strings of repeating bytes like that. 

The thing is that event timings (the Time Manager allows you microsecond
resolution) and mouse position measurements give you so much more entropy
than the sound port that it's hardly worth it, IMO.
