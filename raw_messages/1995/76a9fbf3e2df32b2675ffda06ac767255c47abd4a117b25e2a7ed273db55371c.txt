128 bits of true entropy, in your RNG seed, and never leaked 
is good enough.  (You one way hash the RNG numbers generated, 
to avoid leaking any information about your internal RNG state.)

Your RNG number must of course be based on the full seed, not on
some 16 bit subset of the seed.

To be on the safe side, you might use 128 bytes of seed, or 4K 
bytes of seed, just because gross overkill is cheap, and it is kind 
of nice to have a seed larger than any random numbers you might 
really need.
