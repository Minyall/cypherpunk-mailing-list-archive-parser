If one wonders what sort of physical threat an operator of a datahaven 
could potentially face, then today's (01/10/95) Wall Street Journal 
editorial is must reading.  It's on the Op-Ed page (page A20) and is 
titled: "No Accountability at the FBI".  It discusses the Randy Weaver 
siege in 1992 and the subsequent investigation and whitewash that 
followed.  It's scary stuff!
