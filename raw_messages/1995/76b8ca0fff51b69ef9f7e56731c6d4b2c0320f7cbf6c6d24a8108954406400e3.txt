	Yes. You don't have to work at Netscape to make money doing
crypto. Witness the various crypto-related startups who do not support
key escrow. Comsec partners, electric communities, community
connexion, etc.
	(Not that you can't be a supporter of strong crypto and work
for netscape at the same time. The jury [in my mind] is still out on
that one)
