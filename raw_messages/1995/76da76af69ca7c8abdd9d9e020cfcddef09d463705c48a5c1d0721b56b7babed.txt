    Ding...Ding...Ding... We have another winner. Goodbye remailers. Probably 
    90% of remailer traffic violates this one. Well boys and girls we'd 
    better get lots more offshore...soon.

Actually, unless the quote dropped important context, this part
doesn't seem to outlaw remailers, but rather certain classes of
remailer use (``makes a call'', ``utilizes...'').  It is the user, not
the provider that this seems to address.
