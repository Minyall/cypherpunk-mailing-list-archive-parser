As usual, I agree with all Jim has to say, but there's another problem
with Netscape's response: they UNDERestimate the cost of breaking
RC4-128 (by brute force) by a factor of about 300 trillion.

If someone know of an URL for Netscape's response, I'll be glad to
include a pointer in my virtual press conference.  I would have to ask
for permission before I put a copy on my disks.  Copyrights, you
know...
