The articles I've read on this new system ("Compliance 2000") make it
clear that the IRS will be buying data from non-governmental entities,
e.g., the direct marketing databases and the commercial credit
reporting agencies. This neatly skirts the FOIA, as the FOIA cannot be
used to force a private entity or corporation to reveal its own data
(which, as a libertarian, I am glad of....I wouldn't want folks
demanding to sift through my records, files, and dossiers).

This just extends the type of "subcontracting" to nominally private
entities that the intelligence community began many years ago. The
corporation, "Dossiers R Us," will be the "Air America" for our age.
