One potential "clean room" solution would be to publish precise interface 
specifications for the product. Overseas vendors and users could produce 
their own patches that match the interface. This is of course a kind of 
"hook", and the gov may sabre-rattle about it but I doubt it will stand 
up in court. Certainly publishing specs is no different than publishing 
"Applied Cryptography".
