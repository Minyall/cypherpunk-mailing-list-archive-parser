We already have a centralized, for profit, key distribution system.

http://ww.four11.com/InfoServices.html


If they make money off it, there will be more of them, they
will provide better service, and it will in due course
become a distributed key distribution system.

Digression:

I notice that it is possible to have thread titled 
"Why PGP sucks" without Holy Warriors leaping into 
the fray.

This is a marked contrast with certain other topics. 

Possibly the level of heat is inversely proportional
to the level of knowledge.  (I.e. it is safe to have
such a thread title because in this list we have
many people with considerable knowledge of several
different crypto systems, and who have spent 
considerable thought on the various possibilities.)
