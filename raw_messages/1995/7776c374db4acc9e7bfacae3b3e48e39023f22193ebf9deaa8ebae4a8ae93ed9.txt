A more cypherpunky type of application would be to enable anonymous
httpd's so that your clients could advertise their nice/naughty products
and be safe from location identification. If they had to pack up then
they could move to another ISP and reconnect to the anon.net as normal.
(Didnt I just read this in a spam HOWTO?)

The problem I see is when a LEA gets involved and snoops your wires and
traces you back to your starting point and then traces the client that is
supplying nasty httpd services. You wouldnt necessarily be aware of this
occuring either.
