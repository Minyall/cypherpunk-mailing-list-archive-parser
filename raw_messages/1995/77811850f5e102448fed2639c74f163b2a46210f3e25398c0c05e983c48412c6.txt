Btw i typoed, I use "Content-Checksum: md5=<hexa/ascii-output>"
like in "Content-Checksum: md5=0246be185424cc79b61f4a55b73362c1"
like does the "md5" and md5sum (pgp's contrib dir) programs

Thanks very much for pointing out,

I don't like the fact they somehow hard wired the checksum/digest
algorithm in the keyword name, it is imo a bad idea, when you will want to
use another algorithm, also the rfc state that the checksum applies to
"canonical" form, the one I want applies to the "Content-Length" bytes
you read, whatever they are (no interpretation), and I don't like the
use of base64 which is not nice if you want to check with existing
md5,md5sum programs what you get.

I stepped meanwhile on a draft on authorization scheme using digest, 
which might be interesting... when implemented client side... more on
this later (ref:
http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/draft-ietf-http-digest-aa-01.txt
see also
http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/draft-ietf-http-mda-00.txt
for a "mediated digest" authentification/security scheme)
