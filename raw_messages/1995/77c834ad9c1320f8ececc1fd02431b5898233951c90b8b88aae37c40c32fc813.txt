Hello, everyone.. <warning: semi off-topic post> I am posting
this to let everyone know that I am starting a semitechnical
magazine titled _The_Carrier_Wave_.  It will be published every
two months to begin with, and hopefully monthly if I receive
enough material.  I am requesting articles, columns, news, 
bits, etc..  Whenever anything -interesting- happens, I'd
appreciate it if someone could write a long or short blurb
about it and forward it to me.  Events, meetings, tradeshows,
milestones, new algorithms...  Stories about PGP, Clipper,
etc... Use this to get the word out.  If someone could
run a "Cryptography Column" or "CryptoNews" or a Cypherpunks
column, that would be great... If you are interested, please
send me mail at dr261@cleveland.freenet.edu..  Also note, I
have unsubscribed to Cypherpunks because I will be very
busy lately and an overflowing mailbox is undesirable.
Thanks!
!!!
