Its pretty good on security and structure of protocols. Makes a good companion to 
the Schneier book. I use it frequently.

It does have some very irritating assertions concerning ASN.1 however, 
specifically concerning its use in Kerberos. I consider Kerberos's use of ASN.1 
to be far superior than the alternative suggested which is pure lossage. 
Lambasting the use of ASN.1 is fair game but arguments over wasted bytes miss the 
point of ASN.1 and the BER encoding entirely.

It would make a usefull course book.
