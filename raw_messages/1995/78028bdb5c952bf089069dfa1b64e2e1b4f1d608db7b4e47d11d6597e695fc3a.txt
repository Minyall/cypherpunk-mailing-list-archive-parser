I thought people would love to see this.

Note especially "Dr." Fred's threat to have toad.com confiscated as
part of a conspiracy against his reputation.

To the contrary, I have a very good global reputation, and you are
knowingly and maliciously attempting to slander me by claiming that
I use a false identity to support my positions.

Let's see.  I guess I would start by having the police confiscate the
toad.com computers becfause thay are part of a criminal conspiracy to
daamage my reputation.  Criminal because of the recent changes in the
law that prohibit you from sending me information I don't want to get.

The dollar value would be $1 plus a public apology plus all costs of the
suit plus my time to right the wrong (at my usual fee of course).  Of
course the fact that you have decided to make this posting in public
justifies my extensive efforts to clear my reputation which, unless you
apologize immediately will be surprisingly enjoyable for me.
