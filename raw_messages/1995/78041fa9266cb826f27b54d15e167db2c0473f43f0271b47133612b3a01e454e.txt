Um, if you mean "freely distributable, in source form" by "Gnu-style",
I don't think there's much of a shortage of Gnu-style WWW browsers and servers. 
Lynx and Chimera are my two favorite WWW browsers, and both come in source form.
Then there's w3.el, the WWW browser for Emacs.   As for Web servers, you can
get the source code for Plexus or CERN httpd off the net.  Plus, doesn't
Eric Young have someone's httpd already hacked to include SSL-compliant
encryption?

The question becomes why don't the free WWW software people out there now
support crypto?  Maybe they're simply not expert in or interested in crypto,
or maybe they don't want to mess with the ITAR hassles.
