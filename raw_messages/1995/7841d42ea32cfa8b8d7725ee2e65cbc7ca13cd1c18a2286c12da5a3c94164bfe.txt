What possible value could the LEAs get by having your thumbprint digitally
encoded on your driver's license?  It's not like the average cop-on-the-beat
is qualified to lift a fingerprint and compare it.  Even if he was, how
does it benefit that the fingerprint is on the license?

This seems silly.
