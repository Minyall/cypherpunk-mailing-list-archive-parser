I use mkpgp.  It is a script that requres a lot of setting up, but once 
you learn what you are doing it makes sense.  Depending on how you want 
it, it can be totally transparent.  Personally, I took it off of total 
transparency, and now use it by invoking it with Atl-&

I lost the site where I got it from, but I have it on disk if anybody 
wants it sent.  It includes instructions, and once it is going is totally 
slick.
