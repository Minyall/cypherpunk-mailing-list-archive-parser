	Sure.  I'll respect their privacy as much as they, and the
organizations they oversee, respect mine.  I'll use as the
respresentative organizations the IRS and the Social Security
Administration, which respects my pricvacy so much that they use
prison inmates to process paperwork.

	If I was in a nasty mood, I'd add the USPS.

	Sarcasm aside, they show no interest in other people's
privacy.  Why should we go out of our way to do anything but show them
how bad the situation is?
