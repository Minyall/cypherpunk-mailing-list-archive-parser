" With this knowledge, an experienced computer programmer could
decrypt messages sent by Netscape Navigator to other computers in a
few hours of computation time."

	Excuse me? A few hours? Try 25 seconds??

"Netscape has also begun to engage an external group of world-class
security experts who will review our solution to this problem before
it is sent to customers."

	A group which offered to review the first version, but
Netscape refused.

	From their release it looks like they aren't finding a better
source of entropy, but just using *more* sources of entropy. Doesn't
mean that the entropy is good.
	A T-shirt to the first person to decompile the new Seed code
and post the sources of "entropy" used.

in stone] guidelines regarding t-shirt awards)
