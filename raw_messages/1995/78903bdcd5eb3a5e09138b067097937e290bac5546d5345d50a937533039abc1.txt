  As a student I am concerned with the false security, and that was 
mentioned while we were talking (today).  As to liability, it is 
important that no one can come back and hold the school liable.  Once the 
messages can be encrypted then it is harder to read the messages, but not 
impossible, unless the students keep the key on a disk, and just ftp it 
into the account everytime.  The fact is that that won't be the rule, so 
the admin can still read messages, but there will need to be clear-cut 
reasons for them to do that (IMOHO).  I am curious what requirements must 
be met.  I guess there are more schools that allow this than I expected 
<g>.  Well thanx for replying.  Take care and have fun.
