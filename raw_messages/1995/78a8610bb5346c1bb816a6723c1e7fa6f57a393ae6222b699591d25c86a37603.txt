My understanding is that Win '95 installs its winsock.dll in
/windows/system, which is where a number of other Internet packages also
install their winsock.dll. As their .dll is replaced by MS's, they cease to
function (either correctly or at all). The problem is resolved by
re-installing the original winsock.dll or configuring the Internet software
to look elsewhere for it.
