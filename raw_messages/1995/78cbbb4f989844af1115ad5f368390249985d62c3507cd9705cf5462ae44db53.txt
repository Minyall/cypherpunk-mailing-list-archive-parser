SSL can of course be used to protect information other than credit card #s.
It is supposed to be strong enough to resist the attempts of amateurs, yet
it was broken not by a government, not by a three letter agency, not by a
major corporation, but by a grad student with a lot of spare cycles.

In other words, it was broken by an amateur.  The real issue is not cc#s,
the real issue is: does it do what it was designed to do (foil amateur
attempts), and the answer is: no, not so long as it is export-restricted
to only 40 secret bits of key.
