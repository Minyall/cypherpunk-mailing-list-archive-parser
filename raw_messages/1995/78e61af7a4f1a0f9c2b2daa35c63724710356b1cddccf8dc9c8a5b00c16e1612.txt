I'd like to know if anyone have first hand experience with brain wave
and other (hyped) input devices like IBVA or others and/or pointers to
informations ?

sorry for the little relevance to crypto, but I expect the share
of geeks and nerds on the list to increase my chance to get an answer :-)
{
 the military folks are welcome to answer too... i will receive
 anonymously posted classified documents on the subject with pleasure :-)
 and reference to published work too [plane's brain interfaces,...]
