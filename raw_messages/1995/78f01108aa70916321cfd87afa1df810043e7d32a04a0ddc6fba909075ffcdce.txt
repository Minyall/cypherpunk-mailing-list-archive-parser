Is it Netscape's position that when people call them on their statements
they make irrelevant comments and inflamatory remarks toward legitimate
researchers who are freely helping them understand the security issues
they apparently don't understand?

You claim that you provide secure net access for the purposes of
transactions - which you don't - and you have gotten an enormous amount
of money from people who don't understand these issues based, at least
in part, on your false claims.  Some people might interpret that as fraud.

Now instead of trying to insult and put down people who have legitimate
security concerns, you personally attack individuals, try to redirect the
discussion away from the security flaws in Netscape, and try to hush the
discussion with:

>   Dont you think we've wasted enough bandwidth on this?  I'm sure
> most readers of this list are sick of it by now.

I think that you should give a copy of this and the other messages on
this topic to someone at Netscape who is responsible for protection and
ask them to speak for the company and address these issues head on. 
Regardless of your disclaimer, when you speak on the net, we hear
Netscape, and the sounds are starting to sound more and more like
Microsoft to me.
