Pardon me for being behind; I'm catching up with 1500 cypherpunks
articles...  I was skimming and came upon the following:

I'm not sure how Mondex works, but if currency conversion is made easy
doesn't this have an interesting effect on the currency markets?  If I can
have my machine follow micro changes in the markets and convert my money
around instantaneously without going through a middle-man then things could
get interesting.  Then again, I'm really nieve when it comes to currency
exchange.

Please show me the flaw here.
