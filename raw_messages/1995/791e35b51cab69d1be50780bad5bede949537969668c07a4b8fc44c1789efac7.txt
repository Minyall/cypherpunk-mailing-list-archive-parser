But you're back to trusting an agent or device not to reveal a secret.
What have you gained?

The point about moving the elements of the message physically apart has
merit, though.  So the one-time pad of timerel, the ideally secure but
unworkable model, is to encrypt your message with an OTP, then securely
transport the pad and location to points that are $ct$ metres apart,
where $t$ is the length of time you want to keep your message secret.
You could do this with a reflector $ct/2$ metres away, assuming your
opponent and you are in the same location.

I suppose this could be useful for very short-term applications (for
reference, the diameter of the solar system is about 5.4 light-hours),
but like the OTP, its application is limited.
