Suppose you get "silenced", or carted off by big brother for thought
crime.  A defense: if you try to silence me, this info gets plastered
all over the net.

Suppose you discovered a polynomial time factoring algorithm (dream
on:-), and wanted to sell it to the highest bidder - what odds that
the NSA would try to obtain it and silence you?  Time-release would be
useful for such things.
