It already happens with other media. The Christian Coalition have an army of 
letter writters at their call. They simply write a very large number of letters 
and post them. It is not difficult if you can afford it.

Political staffers know all about this type of thing and can recognise spam. 

It would be usefull to have some mechanism for producing a one time use ID on 
the Web however. This would be configured such that each party can vote once but 
once only. There is stuff in the open meeting system that does this using an 
email callback loop (later used by First Virtual).
