If I saw a weakness in Intel's machine I would happily inform the company
in the safest way possible: posting it to Cypherpunks,
alt.destroy.microsoft, comp.sys.intel and any other appropriate newsgroup,
via anonymous server. I'm sure the information would wind up in the correct
hands _eventually_.

Not that I'm suggesting anything, of course.
