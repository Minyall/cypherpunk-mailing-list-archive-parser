Another data point:

This week I flew TWA from Boston to St. Louis, then TW Express from
St. Louis to Champaign, Ill, and back.

I was asked for picture ID when boarding at Boston, but at no other time.
I protested, and was told that my alternative was not to fly. Since I was
travelling on business and my employer's dime, I did not want to risk
missing the flight, so I complied.
