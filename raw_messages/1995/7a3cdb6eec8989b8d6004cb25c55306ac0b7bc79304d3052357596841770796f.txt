excite Netsearch (http://www.excite.com/) indexes all or part of alt, soc,
and talk groups. (I say "all or part" because I obviously cannot verify
that it indexes all posts to these groups just by verifying that it indexes
at least _some_ posts in these groups.)

It even indexes the *.binaries.* groups, as I just learned.
