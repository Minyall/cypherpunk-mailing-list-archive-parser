Isn't this just the "subliminal channels" scenario? Originally phrased in
terms of prisoners under the watchful eyes of their jailers nevertheless
establishing a private communication channel?

Schneier describes this beginning on page 66 (of his 1st edition).

Your scenario looks identical to this. So you should check out the papers
