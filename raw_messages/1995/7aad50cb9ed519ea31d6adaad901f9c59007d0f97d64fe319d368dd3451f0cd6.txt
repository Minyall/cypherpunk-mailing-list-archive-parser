I'd love to see something in there about most commercial sites being behind
firewalls without nfs access across the firewall.  This greatly reduces the
risk from the nfs problems.  If you get your binary via nfs from a trusted
host inaccessible from the internet, then if you have this problem management
can handle it as an employee problem;)  There are ways to make secure
firewalls, it's fairly well understood.  Sometimes people point to things
like the hack Mitnick did last Christmas, but his attack took advantage of
a couple of things a security expert shouldn't have allowed, first and
foremost two machines were accesible from the internet, and one of them
trusted root logins from the other without a password:(

I could write something up about it if you'd like.
