That wonderful state of bliss seems rather limited in certain parts of 
the world. 

Not that I want to get into a big political discussion, but David Friedman
has a nice, calm and rational book called The Machinery of Freedom, 2nd ed,
which argues anarchism/libertarianism from an economist'spoint of view. 
The argument is not cased in terms of ethics and morals but rather 
economic efficiency and utility. Slim, easy to read and cheap. He also 
has a good sense of humor. Unfortunately the book is currently on back order.
I'm holding on to my library copy until they ship one to me.

You can butt heads with him and Tim on the cyberia list (I don't remember 
the address but they have it at news://nntp.hks.net )

I gather from the cyphernomicon that someone recently converted him to 
cryptoanarchy.
