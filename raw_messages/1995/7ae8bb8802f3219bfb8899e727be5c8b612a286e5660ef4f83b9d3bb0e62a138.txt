The Pacific Research Forum, a local libertarian economics group, is

Reserve Bank of Cleveland and Dr. Donald T. Brash, governor of the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand, with moderator Dr. William S. Haraf,
director of public policy for BofA.

The forum is 3:30-5PM at the Banker's Club, 555 California St, 51st
floor, SF.  The reception is 5PM-6PM.  It costs $25; RSVP to Cindy
Sparks at +1 415 989 0833.

"Central banks were originally intended to bring price stability to a
paper-based bank payments system.  But what will be the proper role of
a central bank in the rapidly approaching era of digital money?  What
happens to monetary policy, supervision and regulation, as well as
financial services such as clearning checks, when electronically-
initiated debits and credits become the transaction of choice?"

..."Dr. Jordan predicts that ... the proliferation of digital money will
provide new challenges for central banks laboring to provide stable money."

I'll probably see you there...
