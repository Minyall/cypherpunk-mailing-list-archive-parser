	Its nice of you to say that.  Its nice of Perry to disagree.
Lets start using some concrete examples, so the source of
disagreements become obvious?

	I suspect Ray is working in an environment less security
concious than Perry's.  Perry works on a lot of security-critical
applications where a lot of money is at stake.  If I were going to go
after financial institutions, I'd definetly look at which ones were
using Java, and see what I could upload into their systems.  Getting
copies of the recent files might be *very* informative.  I'd be
worried if I were at Solomon brothers.

	If I were running Java at home, I'd be a lot less worried,
especially as all the interesting data on my hard drive sits on an
encrypted partition.
