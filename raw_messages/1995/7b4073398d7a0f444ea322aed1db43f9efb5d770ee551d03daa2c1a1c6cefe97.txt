The virus is starting to get large and noticeable.  First, I alternate 
between a.out and ELF (and DOS .EXE). It doesn't have to patch pgp, just 
look for it to be loaded and teh secring file accessed.  Then record 
keystrokes.  This would also work with a hardware implementation if the 
secring passphrase is external (as opposed to an external keypad).

This is what can be done when PGP is used for communication.  For other 
info, I can isolate a computer (no modem, unroutable IP addresses, etc).

Of course our firewall is a socks server and doesn't forward UDP.  Maybe 
a socksified, SSL virus?  My computer is attatched that way far more than 
via modem.  And maybe I should just nuke (or modularize) UDP?  You can do 
interesting things with kernel source.

That woudl be interesting - even with the speaker "off" the power surge 
causes clicking and other signs.  Not to mention that the interrupt count 
would start moving (of course the virus could replace the entire OS and 
would only have to find 300K chunks to hide in).

Were they that interested, they could place a surveillence device over my 
desk (I don't know if they can pick up the scan on LCDs like they can on 
monitors - I am suprised they didn't put the kybosh to the FCC emission 
rules).  Maybe I can move my desk, or my pgp station inside our EMI 
testing faraday cage :).
