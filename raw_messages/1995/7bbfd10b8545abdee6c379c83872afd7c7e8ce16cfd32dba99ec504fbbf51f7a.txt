Hi all,

The recent discussion on the <$1000 computer/appliance/digital-widget got me
to thinking and I had a spasm...

The new Sony Play Station is operating under a stripped down Unix.
Considering the speed that these boxes are designed to run at it seems a
natural for somebody to come up with a crypto workbench on ROM to install in
one of these babies. Could program one of the game controller ports as a
serial port and hook it to a Linux box (for example).

Ta ta
