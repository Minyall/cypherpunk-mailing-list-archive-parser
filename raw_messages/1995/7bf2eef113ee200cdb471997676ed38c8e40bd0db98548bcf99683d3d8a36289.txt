this is so much shit.  targetting anything is very difficult.  just ask 
all those people about the wonders of gene therapy.  hell, even the 
economist had an article about it's failures recently (Dec 16-22 1995, 
p77).

in any event the so-called 'differences' you are imagining are
phenotypes.  these are a long cry from DNA.  i'm not aware of any
genetic markers available to distinguish a black man from a white
man. and, even if there were, recombination requires long
stretches of homology between DNAs, not small differences.  i'd bet
it's nearly impossible to target black vs white vs yellow vs a
gorilla.
