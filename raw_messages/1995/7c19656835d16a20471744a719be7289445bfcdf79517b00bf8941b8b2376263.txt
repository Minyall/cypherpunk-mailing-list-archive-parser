Ah, err, the infamious problem of Netscape Navigator refusing to talk to 
SSL httpd's because they don't have a certificate issued by Verisign is 
caused by the client authentication the Server certificate.
To get a Verisign signed x509 certificate requires quite a bit of proof 
that your company is who they claim they are.  So server authentication 
is used.
