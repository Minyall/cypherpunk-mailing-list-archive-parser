Not quite squashed, Duncan.  Bullet placement (poor by some standards)
is all that prevented Mr. Weaver from croaking like his unfortunate wife.
She is said to have "pissed off" the feds but was not charged with a

Unless I have missed somthing somewhere, no TLA is concerned in the slightest
with individual liberty.  That notion should keep a rational person awake
nights.
