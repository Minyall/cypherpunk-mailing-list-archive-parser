There are also some links on 

  http://iaks-www.ira.uka.de/subjects/crypto.html

to ftp-servers with cryptographic stuff outside USA/Canada.


The page contains several crypto-related links and is
written in german language, but the ftp links at the end
of the page are language-independent.
