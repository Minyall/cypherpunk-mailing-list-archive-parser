Go tell that to General Noriega.  I don't know what definition you are
talking about, but it is not one recognized by the American Courts.

The American courts will apply American laws to non-US-citizens who
violate American laws outside the United States, if they can catch
them.  The fact that they may be in the United States because they
were kidnapped or because they were captured outside the United States
in an agressive war that quite clearly violated international law
won't stop them for a moment.  And lord help the foreigner who has 
violated US law outside the US and then tries to immigrate to the
United States.

And the United States is not alone in this.  Look what Israel did to
Eichman.

And didn't Denmark just allow Germany to extradite an American citizen
for nasty things that he wrote and said in the United States?
