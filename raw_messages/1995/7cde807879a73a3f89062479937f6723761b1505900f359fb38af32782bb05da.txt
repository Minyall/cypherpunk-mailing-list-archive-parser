	Since now Netscape allows for user defined certification authorities
I would like to hear some ideas for a Cybpherpunk CA. Probably run by one 
of the respected member in the group such as Sammer, Perry or Tim. I would
like to hear some discussion about creating the certificates based on
the web of trust of your PGP key, etc. Any takers?
