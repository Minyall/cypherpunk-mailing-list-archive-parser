Exactly. It's already happening. I've noticed on local BBS's they are afraid
of conversation about controversial subjects or files having to do with
things like do-it-yourself-birth control methods, drug legalization, or
crypto... some of the networks like RIME are also jittery about certain
topics like crypto or how telephones work.

Yes, I was discussing broadcasting. Scary thought is that because networks
are different they will try to outright ban everything.

What boggles my mind is how that hypothetical ratings system(s) the WSJ
article mentioned would operate... let alone who would rate content (very
controversial in movie ratings here in the US).
