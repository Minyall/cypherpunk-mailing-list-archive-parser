But fractal compression schemes are usually _lossy_, that is, some of the
original bits are irretrievably lost. (This should be clear also from the
amount of compression achieved....multiple files/images compress to the
"same" smaller file--by the "pigeonhold principle.")

Lossy compression is often OK for visual images and audible files, a la
music, but would be pretty bad for any scheme dependent on encryption.

(Not totally out of the question, as error correction could be used to
maybe  construct the critical bits, but then there's a messy battle going
on between lossy compresssion to get more bit density and adding bits for
error correction...)
