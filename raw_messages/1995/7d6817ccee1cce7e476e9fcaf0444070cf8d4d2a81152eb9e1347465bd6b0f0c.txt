Why does an account provider need a snail-address and phone-number?  Usually  
for billing purposes.  However, this isn't necessary for accounts paid with  
ECash.  I believe C2.org already offers non-dialup access accounts, paid for  
with ECash, that do not require a valid snail-address or phone-number.  I am  
sure that there will be many more to come.
