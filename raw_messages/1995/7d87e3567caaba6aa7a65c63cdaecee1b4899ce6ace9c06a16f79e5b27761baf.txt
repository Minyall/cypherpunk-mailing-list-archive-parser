As it seems everyone is broadcasting URL about electronic payment
systems, let me propose
        http://globeid.gctech.fr/cgi-gid/welcome?Language=English
which does no lead to a specification but the Globe Online, Globe ID pilot
setup By GC Tech.

Sorry only a few pages are available in english by now.
  English and some other languages wil be available within a few weeks

Sorry again, but because real content is and will be available
we commited to deliver only a few hundreds Web Wallets for this
pilot. You can still use the web form to apply for one...
