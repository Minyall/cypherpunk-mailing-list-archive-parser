Please keep me informed of your progress.  Does anyone out there have a 
somewhat comprehensive listing of these or other implementations 
already ported to Linux?  I am intending on setting up an alternative 
site for folks with nosey or suppressive employer accounts or private 
university accounts who desire an anonymous account somewhere else.

While they are getting better and better, I am not certain that anything 
is ready to be deemed as secure as it can be.

In that same spirit, does anyone have pointers to Linux specific security 
implementations.  I would also be interested in ported implementations of 
remailers, or other annonymity protecting services.
