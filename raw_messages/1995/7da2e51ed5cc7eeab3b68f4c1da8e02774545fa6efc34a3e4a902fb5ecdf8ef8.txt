Right, this is the main quantum crypto idea of Brassard et al. (See for
example _Applied Crypto_ v.1 pp.408-410)

No, the integrity of the system really depends upon the quantum properties
of light. Among other things, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle makes it
impossible for Eve to "eavesdrop" on the photons without affecting them
measurably.

In this situation Eve can read the email traffic without modifying it, so the
game is up.
