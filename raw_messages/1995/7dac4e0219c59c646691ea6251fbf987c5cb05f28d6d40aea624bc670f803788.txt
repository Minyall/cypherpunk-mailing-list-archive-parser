Thanks for the deeper insight. Sure it was probably a mistake. But someone
made the decision to write code that didn't conform to that design document.
That person was probably saying, "Random number generator. Cool. I can use
the standard C library." or whatever. But that person could have been saying,
"Hey, if I slip this in then I'll be able to snag the session
keys with impunity."
We'll never know for sure.
