A small point of information.  I work for Architext, the company that provides
the excite service.  We only keep the last two weeks of USENET news around,
and don't keep any archives going further back than that.  USENET is just too
damn huge for us to go to the trouble of keeping comprehensive archives around
without good evidence of demand for it among our target audience.
