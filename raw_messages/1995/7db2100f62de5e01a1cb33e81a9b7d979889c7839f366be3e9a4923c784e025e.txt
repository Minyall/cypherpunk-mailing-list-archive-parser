   Because I wanted to share the RSA Criptography FAQ on WWW with our local 

users, I have converted your document, verbatum, to HTML Hypertext. 

                                                                              

The entire Table of Contents is clickable so that you can zoom to the 
particular
area of interest. 

                                                                              

I can FTP somewhere public  you would like (I don't know where to stash this 

kind of thing.
                                                                              

It could probably use some more links in it where the document suggest that 
the
reader go to another section for more information but... I will leave that 
up
to someone else.
