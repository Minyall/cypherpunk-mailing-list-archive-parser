I apologize if this is a dead horse, but...

Is granting use of crypto software running in the US to a remote user
outside the US considered exportation?  For example, if allow my friend in
Paris to use a PGP binary residing and running on my PC in Washington, is
either of us violating any ITAR or similar restrictions?
