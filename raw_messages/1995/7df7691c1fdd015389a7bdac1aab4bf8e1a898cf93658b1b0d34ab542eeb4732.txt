[I'm hoping that we can get some papers on freely redistributable
*crypto* and *security* software -- like PGP or PEM or SSL_eay or
Kerberos or brute-force tools or SATAN or Java tools or whatever!  I'm
on the program committee and am trying to make the conference as broad
as possible, not just focusing on "traditional" free software.  Help!
