Jeez. I really don't know why the heck this always happens to me, my
digsigs not validating.

You can finger me at tjbryce@amherst.edu to retrieve a message with a valid
signature.

I always write the message in eudora, copy it, sign it in MacPGP as TEXT
with attached signature, then go back and paste it over the old message.
Then I go back to MacPGP and check the signature on the clipboard to be
sure - no problems. But after getting mailed, it doesn't work.

Damn.
