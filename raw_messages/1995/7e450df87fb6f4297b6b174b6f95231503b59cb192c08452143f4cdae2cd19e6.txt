   What is wrong with this person?

   ban her if you can, that's my opnion.

Gee, I don't know what everyone is complaining about, because I have:

	if (from = "carolann@mm.com") then delete

in my ~/.elm/filter-rules file.  I highly encourage everyone to have
their own mail filters, because then you don't have to convince anyone
to ban anyone, you just do your own banning.
