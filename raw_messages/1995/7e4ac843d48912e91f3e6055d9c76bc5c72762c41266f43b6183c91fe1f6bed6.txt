Does anyone remember the problem IBM had back ~10 years on X'mas, when
someone sent an embeded 'script' greeting card to multiple 'profs'
addresses?  When the mail was opened the 'script' procedure was
executed, resulting in the card being forwarded to everyone in the
recipient's address book.  It didn't take too many interations of this
to drag IBM's net to it's knees.

Given JAVA's i/o capabilities, I'm a little concerned about mating it
with my mail reader.
