I can only assume one of two things - either this is a joke, as the
decrypted contents are nothing special as far as I can see (though
'interesting' in a sense), or that someone is very, very clever and
managed to hide two different messages in there with different
passphrases.

If this is the file the Co$ want to crack, they're a) clearly 
cryptographically inept, and b) the joke's clearly on them 8-).. Any 
hacker worthy of the name ought to get the passphrase within three 
attempts (I got it first time).

Note for paranoids: Of course, this message may just be a ruse to put 
the Co$ off the scent ;-)..
