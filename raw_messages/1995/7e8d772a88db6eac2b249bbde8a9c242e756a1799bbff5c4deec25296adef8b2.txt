OK, let's ponder the minimum hardware necessary,
possible minimal configuration (Intel/clone based):

(1) Case.
(2) Power supply.
(3) Motherboard/CPU and 4mb RAM.
(4) Hard drive w/ controller.
(5) modem card.

(5) No monitor, keyboard, floppy, or video card.
   (a) would require some "umbilical cord" connection to initially
       set up from another PC.
   (b) need to operate on "umbilical", direct and uucp modes.

I am just thinking out loud here, but the hardware could be damn
cheap (sub $500). You can find old 386 boards with 4mb right on
the board (no SIMMs) for next to nothing (the decreasing popularity
of 30-pin SIMMs makes this a surplus store reality, as nobody
wants to bother to strip out the RAM chips anymore).

I have also seen an ad by the KILA company in Boulder, CO who
advertise some sort of compact pc-on-a-card deal, that might
be applicable.

Comments?
