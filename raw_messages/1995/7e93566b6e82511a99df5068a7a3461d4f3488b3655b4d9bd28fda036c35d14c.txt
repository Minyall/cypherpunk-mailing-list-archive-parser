Terrorists, Drug Dealers, Pornography and Piracy (copyright, patent & trademarks)
					  ^^^^^^
That's been left out... and likely it's the one some of the authorities
fear most. Money can be made off of terrorists, drug dealers and pornograpy
by allowing them to exist as a "threat" rather than actually stopping them.

Piracy is a whole different matter (though some would argue that it applies
to allow it as well...)

Off the subject of crypto, though....
