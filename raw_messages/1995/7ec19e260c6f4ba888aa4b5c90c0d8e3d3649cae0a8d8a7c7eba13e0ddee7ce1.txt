We've seen the word "hacker" kicked around rather arbitrarily in the press.
Are we to conclude that the cypherpunks are a bunch of hackers? I think its
time for some cypherpunks spin. How about a logo *and* a press release? The
press release would give contacts (email, phone, etc.) so that someone on
this list would be contacted by journalists when a crypto story breaks.

If we get enough volunteers, we can fax blanket every newspaper, station,
and network in the world.
