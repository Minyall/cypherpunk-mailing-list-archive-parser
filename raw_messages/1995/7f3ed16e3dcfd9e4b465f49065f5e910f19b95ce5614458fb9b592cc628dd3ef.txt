Just an idle thought: it might be possible to do a probabalistic
verification of a RNG by sampling it over some number of samples, and
statistically analyzing the sample space. This would be analysis under the
model of "RNG as black box" as opposed to (or rather, if you're smart, in
addition to) code inspection & review. Any statisticians among us?
