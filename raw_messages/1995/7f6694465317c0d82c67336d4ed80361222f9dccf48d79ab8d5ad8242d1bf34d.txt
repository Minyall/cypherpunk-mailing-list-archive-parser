Majordomo always includes a Sender: owner-cypherpunks@toad.com header. 
You'd know this if you used, say, Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft Mail, or
some other broken mail gateway. Procmail or whatever should be able to 
filter mail based on this.

You can also read cypherpunks courtesy of http://www.hks.net/ (no,
Cyberia-L isn't there), or nntp.hks.net. Lots of people do this. I prefer
to deal with receiving the list in my personal mailbox because I don't
like waiting for downloads in real time.

I asked a related question of one of the networking program managers 
today; I think the answer is yes. I'll forward this to see if he'd like 
to make a public comment.
