Sour grapes, and from an anonymous poster too.  Oooo - I'm insulted.

I have been thinking about the issues of anonymity for some time, and I
have been convinced for some time that you can't have both integrity and
anonymity.  I thought there might be ways to accomplish this, but the
cypherpunks have convinced me it isn't true.  Show some integrity and
tell us who you are.
