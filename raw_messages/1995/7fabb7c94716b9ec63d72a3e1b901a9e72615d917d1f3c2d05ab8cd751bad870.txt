I'm incensed.

I casually mentioned somewhere else that I saw something on this list about
floating-point math being used in crypto, contrary to popular belief, and
somebody had the *timerity* to call me on it. ;-).

I think it had to do with factoring, but maybe even in key-generation,
though that doesn't sound right at all...

So, are there c-punk archives I could look in? I remember hearing something
about that, too.

However, if someone remembers off the top of their head, or if they have an
actual copy of the posting, that would be great, too.

Please send me whatever it is by e-mail. No point cluttering the list more
than I already have...

Of all the nerve....

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
