Nonsense.  The code is pretty solid, the interfaces aren't very 
difficult.  What is needed is better human management of keys.  Why 
brute-force, why look for weak keys, why bother calculating how much 
safer 2047-bit keys are rather than 1024-bit keys when someone can 
look on your HD and find your secret key, when they can open your 
desk drawer and find your pass phrase or password, when they can 
guess that you used your wife's maiden name as your password?

Adam, I don't understand why you wrote nonsense in the first 
paragraph, then followed it up with textbook attacks such as:

Moving the systems which automatically issue key revocation 
certificates, and coupling that with a wide distribution system would 
be the perfect match to such a scheme.  Of course, that means that 
PGP et. al. needs to be more tightly integrated into existing mail 
software.
