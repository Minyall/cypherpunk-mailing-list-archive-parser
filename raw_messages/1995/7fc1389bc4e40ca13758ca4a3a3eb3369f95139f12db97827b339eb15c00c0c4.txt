Actually, a slight correction.  PGP does have an algorithm byte
for the encryption algorithm; this byte is inside the RSA block.
(It doesn't have to be RSA, either, but thats a different story).

So long as you use a public key to encrypt, you get this byte.  If
you just use PGP -c, using the current implementation, you do not
get a type byte.  Oops.

My point is that although the current implementation doesn't have
multiple encryption schemes, that doesn't mean that it can't have
them...
