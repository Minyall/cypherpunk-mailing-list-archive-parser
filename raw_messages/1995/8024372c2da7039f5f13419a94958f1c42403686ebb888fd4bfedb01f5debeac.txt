Yes, why not... (it's been suggested before)

Careful... the buttons one tends to click on are in the same regions,
and the entropy would not be as great as say, with keyboard timings.
I think fast timings between clicks (maybe added or xor'd with low bits
from mouse positions?) is a better solution.

Though the best way is to experiment... I wrote a DOS ISR to capture
timings between clicks ('keyrand?.zip' on some ftp-sites) and experimented
with speeding up the system clock (which is normally 18.2 times/sec), but
the entropy appeared lower (superficially less random).
