Well, in addition, universal deployment of Photuris and IPSP would
probably prevent the sort of active attack being discussed because you
could no longer replace the packets.

It was suprisingly weak for a John Markoff story (he usually gets the
details exactly right) but it is an issue that had to be brought up
