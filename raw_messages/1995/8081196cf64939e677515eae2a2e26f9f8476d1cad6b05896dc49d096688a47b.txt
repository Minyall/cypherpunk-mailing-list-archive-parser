hate to start another endless thread on speeding limits, but
this is an interesting privacy anecdote... hope this hasn't
been posted here.

Vernon Hills, IL.

Vernon Hills, Illinois, a Chicago suburb, has passed legislation allowing 
citizens to check out radar guns from the local police department to 
catch speeders in their community. The radar guns are combined with 
cameras in order to instantaneously capture the car, license number, and the 
rate of speed. The citizens can check out the units for a week at a time. The 
police have stated that they, at this time, will use the data to issue 
warning letters to the violaters.
