Setting up and doing work on a new operating system is *WORK*. It
takes time. It takes space in your lab or office. Maybe he just
doesn't feel like spending that time, effort, and lab budget. Why
should he? CFS is a GIFT. It isn't a product. Maybe if you paid
someone to maintain a Linux version you would have one, but you aren't
paying a penny. Quit looking a gift horse in the mouth.
