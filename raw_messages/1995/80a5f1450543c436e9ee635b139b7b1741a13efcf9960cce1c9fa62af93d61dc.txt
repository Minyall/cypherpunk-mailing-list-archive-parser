The points Tim makes here are quite good.  However, I'm more concerned 
with a slightly longer time scale, when people focus less on FILES, 
but more on CONVERSATIONS and INTERACTIONS.  It is then that latency 
becomes more problematic.

Can anyone give me an estimate of when truly anonymous video conferencing 
will become possible?  This is not just to help me make the point, but 
I'm really wondering.
