No it isn't. Its just an operating system microkernel. These typically
just provide very low level process abstractions to allow device
drivers and operating system interfaces to be built as processes. It
has nothing WHATSOEVER to do with cryptography.

I realize that the word "code" appeared in the article, but just
because the word "code" gets used doesn't mean we are talking about
cryptography.

By the way, learn how to spell "kernel".
