Strange.

First, they were never a common carrier:  they went to some legal pains
to get registered as an enhanced service provider.  I don't know what
the differences are, but when the first "Internet Porn" article by Joe
Abernathy appeared years ago, Rick wasn't worried.  He told me ESP was
better then CC, but I don't remember why (perhaps it was no FCC regulation?)

It's unclear how this new policy affects their ESP status.
