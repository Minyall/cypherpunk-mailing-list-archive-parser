Yes, many of the EFH founders have participated in EFF-Austin events.
Steve Ryan, one of the EFH founders, spoke last week at HoHoCon (as 
did myself, Jim McCoy and Jeremy Porter.)

I think the program is an excellent idea, and will be getting feedback
from attendees with an eye to doing something similar here at some
point.
