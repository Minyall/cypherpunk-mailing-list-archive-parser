  Um, in an earlier post she mentioned the venerable Mr. Kahn and
  someone else whose name I forget.

I noted at the time that I didn't know any of the
names, except Kahn, and only later realised that
this is the Kahn who wrote the book, not the Karn
who is a cryptographer. I don't know whether David
Kahn actually has any credentials at all as a
cryptographer. Does anyone else?

Note I'm not trying to discredit Elementrix POTP,
and especially not David Kahn who wrote a very
important book.
