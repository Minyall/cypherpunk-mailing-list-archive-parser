    This thread illustrates (at least if setup's like this are
    worthy of a place in Raph's list) that penet.fi is the safest
    way to go for the moment.

That depends on your threat model.  For most, chaining is safer than
penet.

    I would just hate it to have my head on the plate of a remailer
    operator who takes an interest in subtile ethical discussion of
    whether to sell me out or not.

Your characterization of what Homer has said strikes me as extremely
inaccurate.
