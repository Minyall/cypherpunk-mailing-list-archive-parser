This is not entirely true. If I log in as 'guest' I cannot modify just 
any key in the registry. I can only modify the ones that I have 
permissions to change.  Also if you know what you are doing you can set 
permissions on any key in the registry so that it can't be modified by 
just anyone.  I can also modify the account permissions so that if a 
logon attempt fails, after a specified number of retries the account is 
locked and will not accept logons until the administrator unlocks the 
account. I'd recommend that you get a copy of Windows NT and the 
Windows NT Resource Kit, install it and play around with the security 
system before you make generalized statements about it.
