This can be done with hacked telephones probably.  A switch in the 
telphones that then takes the line over turning it into a data connection 
and negotiating keys etc.. with the remote side which would have a 
similiarly equipped telephone.  It may already be done, but rather 
prohibitevly expensive for common use.

not true really, most providers shut off accounts that run SLIRP if they 
also offer SLip/PPP service to customers. I know MCSnet did.  but 
SLIP/PPP was only five dollars more a month and offered much better 
performance.
