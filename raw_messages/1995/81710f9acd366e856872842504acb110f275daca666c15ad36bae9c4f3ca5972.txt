David Fox has me on a panel discussion he's leading tomorrow (November 1)
at Internet World in Boston in the Harborview Ballroom from 10:15 to 12:30.

Also on the panel will be someone each from First Virtual, Open Market, and
CheckFree, all of whom will be demo-ing their latest stuff. This promises
to be interesting, and it would also be a great opportunity for me to
actually meet some people I only read in e-mail.

If you're around, I hope to see you there!

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
