You are correct in saying that onerous provisions of adhesion contracts 
are sometimes not enforced against the party who did not draft the 
contract (the one who had it "forced" upon them).  Again, very fact 
specific.  And that has been my point all along.

As an aside, understand that my comments on this thread relate to my 
semi-educated prediction of how the law will be applied in this context.  
It does not reflect what the law would be if I were King of the forest.
