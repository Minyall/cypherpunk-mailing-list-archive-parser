Dear Bruce,

When you see the actual postings on the last 24 hours,
they are all running to the newsgroup to use killfiles.

Isn't it ostriches that do that kinda thing?

They've been caught napping.

The Webbittown Post Office could use all the remail people.
Every last one of them

And meanwhile, still stuck in the pine composer, lies the original response.

Good copy, definitely good copy.

Love Always,

Carol Anne
