you have surpassed yourself in assumption here A,

your hope that e-cash will some how reduce bank fees is a long stretch.
banks like their fees and the massive profits they pull too much to cut 
this part out.  they will likely charge more for the great gift of e-cash 
as if it were some special feature.

how will small shops hope to run with consumer titians like citibank and 
such?  all they need to is announce something nifty like the "electric 
purse" and call it e-cash and the market is closed.
