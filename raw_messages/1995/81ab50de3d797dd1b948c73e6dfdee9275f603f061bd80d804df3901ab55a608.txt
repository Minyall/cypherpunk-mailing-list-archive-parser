Good point.  However, since it's been around for years and is (in some
people's eyes, at least) cutting-edge secure replication technology, it made
me begin to wonder about the product's actual security.  All I know is that
they use one of RSADSI's libraries, since RSADSI mentions them in their
"here are our current users" advertising.

From the deafening silence, though, it seems like there's not a whole lot of
information or opinion either way on Notes' security...?
