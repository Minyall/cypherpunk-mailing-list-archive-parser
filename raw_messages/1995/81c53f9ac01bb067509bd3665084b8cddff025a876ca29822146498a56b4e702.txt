Ah, I was hoping that my statement would stir some controversy. I've 
learned that well thought out, carefully reasoned posts never get any 
response.

I agree with you that the X.509 stuff is extra baggage in MOSS. 
Fortunately, the use of X.509 is optional.

MOSS has two very large advantages over PGP:

1. It can operate without temp files.

2. It has no non-MIME variant.

It will take forever for PGP/MIME to catch on. Thus, PGP will never 
really be a suitable candidate for my generic interface. Ah well.

This is true. I hope it happens.
