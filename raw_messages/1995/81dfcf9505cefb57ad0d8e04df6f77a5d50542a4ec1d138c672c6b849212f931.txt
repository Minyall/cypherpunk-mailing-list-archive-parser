I've got a dilema.
        2 laptops that I just purchased at a police auction have passwords,
from what I can tell they are passworded at the cmos level. I would normaly
just pull out the battery and clear the cmos but these are laptops and I'm
not to comfortable about doing that.  Any ideas?

laptop1 -  Toshiba Satelite Pro T2400CT
laptop2 -  Epson Action Note 500 c
