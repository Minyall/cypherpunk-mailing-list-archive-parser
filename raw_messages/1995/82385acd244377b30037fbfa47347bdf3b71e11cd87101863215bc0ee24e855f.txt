The latter, assuming the gloves were ever on.  In the previous day's
presentations at the ICI conference, FBI Dir. Freeh spoke about the need
for the FBI to get not only decryptable wiretaps but also decryptable
files, and pointed out that some of the proposals about limited-duration
keys would not let them decrypt files they seized with a legal warrant if
those files had been encrypted earlier than the warrant date.  He took Q&A
for a while, and I got to ask the first Q:

Q: Does the Bureau favor making escrowed keys mandatory for domestic
   encryption?
A: Not at this time.  We hope that voluntary compliance and cooperation
   from industry will result in companies developing a single system for
   export and for domestic use.  If this does not happen, then we will
   need to take further action.
