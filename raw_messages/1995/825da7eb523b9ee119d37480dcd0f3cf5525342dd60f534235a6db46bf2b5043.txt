The design of the prtotocol assumes a hierarchy -- maybe in the next attempt.

Static partitioning would be possible (e.g. 0000-7ffff and 8000-ffff)
but there are problems with acking to the right server, deciding which to
contact, etc.

Yup.

Hierarchy or static ?

I think most of the load is "HELO COMM QUIT" clients.
Yes -- we had thought of upping the allocation ....
