 Devices of this type are known generically as "infinity
transmitters." They will not function anywhere the phone network is
run by a digital (4ESS or better) switch.

 In a modern switch, the ringing you hear is being generated by the
switch, the switch is simultaneously ringing the number you dialed,
however the two are not physically connected. The actual connection
is not made untill the far end answers, this was implemented to
stop various types of fraud, and unauthorized eavesdropping.
