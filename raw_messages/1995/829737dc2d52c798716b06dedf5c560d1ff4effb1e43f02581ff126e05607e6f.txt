Whatever you use, check its claims with a disk editor. None of the various
wipe utilities for the Mac that I am aware of (Norton, Burn) work as
advertized. They all invariably fail to wipe the slackspace at the end of
allocated, but not fully used blocks. Consequently, several kB of data
left behind in said slackspace by previously deleted files will be missed
on your average drive.
