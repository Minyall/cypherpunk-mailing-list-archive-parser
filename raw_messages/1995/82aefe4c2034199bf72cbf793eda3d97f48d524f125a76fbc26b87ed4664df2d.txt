	When I get the bugs out of the procmail script I'm
	writing, to accomplish this, I'll send it to you.

	Strip out everything that is not header information, and is
	not signed with pgp. You could even strip out all header
	information, except for who sent the message.  That you need,
	so you know who to respond to.

	This is a good point.  

	However, won['t most messages have the name of the intended
	recipient inside the PGP signature lines?

	Regardless, you've stated a weakness that I hadn't realized
	existed.

	I'll have to give this some thought.  Have the script
	match the from id, with the message id.  << Not sure 
	how I can do this one, yet.  >>

	The Header won't be signed by PGP.  That part I will concede.
	The signature might be signed by PGP, depending on what one is
	using to read & respond to email with.  With SLMR can sign 
	signatures. << Granted, it is for DOS, and is geared towards 
	FidoNet conferences.  And I had to right a batch file to call 
	the editor, then the program to attach the signature, then 
	sign the thing.  But the signature was included in the signed 
	part of the pgp message.  >>
