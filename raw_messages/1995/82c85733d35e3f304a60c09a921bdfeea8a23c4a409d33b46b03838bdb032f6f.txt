	This is a common misconception. Cancelmoose[tm] doesn't use 
anon.penet.fi for cancelling spams -- she telnets directly into the NNTP 
server of a university in Norway. Strangely enough, this is the same 
university where Arnt Gulbrantsen works. Arnt, if you don't already know, 
is the Norwegian hacker who wrote the cancelbots that are being used 
against spams (Canter & Siegel's included). Cancelmoose[tm] is reachable 
through anon.penet.fi for comments, and she always lists the <naXXXXXX> 
form of the address (non-double-blinded)

	Dick Depew and AARM (Auto-Active Retro Moderation). He wanted to 
cancelbot any posting from anon.penet.fi in the Big Seven Usenet hierarchies.
He was promptly beaten down by the net. Feh.

ObCrypto: I've been working on a draft paper that puts forward a proposal 
to make Usenet articles uncancellable except by [1] the original author 
of the article or [2] the system admin who runs the NNTP server the 
article issued from. The problem with this is that it eliminates 
Cancelmoose[tm] and the other spam cancellers, who, IMHO, are Good Things.
