Theis will not work, Hal, because it would mean that administrative
control over keys would have to be held by people far removed
organizationally and spacially from those who own them. Things work
much better when the administrators and users are close
together. Futhermore, the DNS style solution scales -- it
automatically aquires servers to meet demand as the space expands,
unlike a pseudo-distributed system such as the one you
propose. Furthermore, DNS is one of the few really large scale
distributed databases that has been well proven, and piggybacking off
the technology has real advantages.
