Properly formatted, a dispersed multijurisdictional data haven can 
effectively say "Who cares" to the entirety of your point.

A data haven that mandates encryption for all incoming data will be 
essentially immune from this sort of problem.  The real measure of 
shutdown will be (on non-privately owned sites) the level of traffic that 
begins to interefere with other functions of the site.

Data havens that can split data to two or more locations in seperate 
jurisdictions can effectively ignore attention from authorities not 
related to the site management or site preformance.  Encryption mandated 
sites can also take this stance, while encryption is legal in any event.
