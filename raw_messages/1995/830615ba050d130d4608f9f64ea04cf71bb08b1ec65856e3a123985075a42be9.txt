     SafeTcl or Java? I wish SafeTcl was isolated into a separate library
   with compiled-in safety so I could embed it into my applications. As it is
   now, I have to just use normal Tcl and hack in the MakeInterpreterSafe()
   function which removes dangerous commands.

You mean the "dangerous" commands can't just be left out of the proper
place in the makefile or something?
