I was unaware, Mr. Froomkin, that the legal system of our country had
the right to arbitrarily ignore its own rules and refuse to answer a
question. The munitions T-Shirt was not, in my opinion, substantially
more frivolous than Phil Karn's floppy, which was rejected. I do not
believe that the state department has the right to reject such things
by refusing to accept their mail, and I do not believe that they have
the right to violate their own proceedures. If someone asks "is this
captain midnight decoder ring exportable" they are legally obligated
to answer, one way or the other, unless we live under a government of
men, and not laws.
