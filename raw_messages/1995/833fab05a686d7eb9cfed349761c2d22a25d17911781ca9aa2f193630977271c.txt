Well, sort of. A key management system that operates sort of like
Kerberos' is necessary. However, thats really far from
sufficient. Most Kerberized protocols authenticate only at the
beginning of the session -- very very hijackable.

Oh, hardly the case -- in fact in the architecture of the system I'm
developing things are actually slightly easier than in the kerberos
situation. Invasive I'll agree with -- encrypted/authenticated IP
requires kernel mods. However, they can be made fairly painless.

I'll point out, by the way, that one of the major problems with
kerberos is just bad documentation and difficult build tools.
