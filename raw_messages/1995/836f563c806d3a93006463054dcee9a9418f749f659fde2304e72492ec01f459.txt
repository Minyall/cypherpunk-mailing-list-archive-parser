I found Alan's comment about the comics interesting, as even Alan's critic
apparently did, and hardly harmful to the overall noise level. It gave in a
short snapshot a vignette of "pop culture" views of surveillance.

At less than 1% of the size of the latest EPIC crosspost to our list (or
was it EFF, or VTW?) it hardly will affect the list in any significant way.

Many of us have posted movie reviews, book reviews, even mentions of Alison
Armitage sightings. The list is more than just about Java and Netscape,
though newcomers may not know this.
