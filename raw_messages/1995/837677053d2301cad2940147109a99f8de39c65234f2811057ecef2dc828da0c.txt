Ideally, yes. However most processes won't swamp (and deplete) /dev/random
like this will. Most (well-behaved) processes will (should) just take what
they need. The above loop tries quite hard to take all that is there,
so any process asking for randomness will be sharing with the above loop
on an almost byte-by-byte basis, like you suggest.

The above won't leave a "pool of randomness" to act as a buffer for user
requests, so will cause a nasty slowdown.
