None of these organisations have mentioned GSSAPI to me.

Do you have a source?

Rubish, disclosure is required for a grant of a patent. Unless someone 
skilled in the art can duplicate the invention from the patent claim
you don't get a patent issued.

Trade secret protection is very tricky in any case. Its practically
useless if you want to protect a product rather than a procedure.
