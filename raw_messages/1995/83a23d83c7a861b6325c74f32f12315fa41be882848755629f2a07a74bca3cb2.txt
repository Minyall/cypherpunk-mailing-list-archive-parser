Unfortunately, however, there are a lot of things that a lot of people can't
do in a unix system.  Unix is probably the most widely used unfriendly
cryptic, and complicated operating system today.  With the upcoming of
Linux, this will probably change somewhat in the future, but until I can
teach my secretary how she can use latex to type and print her letters, we
are going to be stuck with getting us whatever the bastards at MicroSoft
think we want.
