Hmmm... then why use a data haven at all?  Split the file into small
pieces, encrypt each and post each piece in a newsgroups (the pieces may
even be posted as small garbles of data in sigs?).  When you need to 
recover the file checksites which archive those newsgroups.

Just a thought. It's probably quite doable for small files.

Another idea: use encryption/secret sharing combined with steganography
and upload copies of the said files to various ftp-sties or BBS's. (It
may be that this is more secure than data havens, since few SysAdmins
would bother checking for steganographically hidden files...)
