  The execution of shell commands by sendmail was not approved
by the user.  The execution of a shell or postscript interpreter, or
whatever, by netscape must be configured by the user.  These are
not the same situation at all.

  I posted a list of MD5 checksums as a personal favor to various cypherpunks
who asked for them, since I have access to the original bits.  The official
Netscape solution for checking your downloaded distribution will be
announced later in the year.  In the mean time anyone who is uncomfortable
with downloading the bits from the net can always buy a copy.  We will
ship them the distribution on floppy.

 Do you have something better than MD5 to suggest?  If so, on what do you base this
opinion?
