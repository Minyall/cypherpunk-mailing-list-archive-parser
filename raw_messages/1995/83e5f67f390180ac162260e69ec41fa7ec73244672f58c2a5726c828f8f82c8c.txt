   The problem with a _free_ remailer is obvious -- like many
   other Internet resources, it can suffer from the tragedy of
   the commons. 

   Even a negligible fee would do much to prevent gross remailer
   abuse. It may not be feasible to make remailers in to an
   industry, but this isn't the point -- it will keep the utterly
   lame from using it for pranks and their ilk.

Use First Virtual.  The "information" that you sell is a one-time
email alias that points to your remailer.  After an hour, that email
alias gets disabled.  This dynamic setup is easy to do with smail,
just a matter of dropping a file into a directory.

And who cares if they pay you or not, because if they don't pay
(choose to purchase the information), eventually FV will cancel their
account.

Send mail to info@fv.com.  This gets you an automated response.

Their contract says that they won't enforce payment on services, so if
you offer a service, you're completely at risk, but again, there's not
much real risk here...
