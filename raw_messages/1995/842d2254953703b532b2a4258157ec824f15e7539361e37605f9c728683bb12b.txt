Well, let's do the math. Since the remailer has to be connected at all
times, of course, this implies $162 a month in connect charges, over
and above the other charges. Or $187 a month including the line
charge. Or $2244 a year. 

This makes a "cheap Linux box" almost a moot point. This is a lot more
than I'm willing to pay to run a remailer.

(I can imagine workarounds that involve connecting at regular
intervals to pick up mail....assuming it "accumulates" somewhere (?),
but the goal of a remailer "on the Net" is what I'm after.)

I agree that it's something to look at.
