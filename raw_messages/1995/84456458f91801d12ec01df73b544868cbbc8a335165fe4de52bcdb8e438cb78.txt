You certainly need some kind of encrypted secure checksum (MAC) to ensure 
message integrity.  I don't think you have to go through the 
entire authentication of the principal.  (Though as V. Gligor keeps 
showing, even if you have a MAC at the end of your data, there are still 
some kinds of integrity attacks which are possible if you are not careful 
about how MACs and encryption is used).

Now if you are talking about simple denial-of-service (detected tampering
or traffic flooding), that is another more difficult story.
