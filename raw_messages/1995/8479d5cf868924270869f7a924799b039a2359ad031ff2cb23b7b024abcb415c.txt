An extract from the Australian Constitution:

116. The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any
religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the
free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as
a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth. 

Do please explain.
