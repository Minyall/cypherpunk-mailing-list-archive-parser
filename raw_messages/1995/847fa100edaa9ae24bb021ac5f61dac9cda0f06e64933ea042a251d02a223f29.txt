I wrote a post to comp.org.eff.talk in which I asked if "S.314" isn't
just the "Pi Bill," in which pi = 3.14 is mandated to be pi = 3.00.

S.314 I initially, for a minute or so, thought to be a put-on, a
spoof. But the text lacked other signs of humor and had the trappings
of a real bill. And then versions from reputable groups began to
appear, so I was of course convinced it was real.

If it's a spoof, it's too cute by half.
