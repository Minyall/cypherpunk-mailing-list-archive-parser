Yuck!

Opening the file for read/write should be ok on all filesystems
where walking the inodes is doable and ok, and will be more portable.

Walking the inodes has the advantage that it won't run out of disk space,
but I suspect confidential files with holes will be rare.

There's no automatic rm that will also delete all backups of the file.
(You are keeping backups, aren't you?)


Hope I'm making sense...
