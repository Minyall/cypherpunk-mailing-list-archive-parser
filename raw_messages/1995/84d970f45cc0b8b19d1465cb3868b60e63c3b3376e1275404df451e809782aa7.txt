I don't have the citation handy, but I recall reading that Cable &
Wireless has plans to link much of the region via undersea fiber over
the next few years.  I think it will be a simple North-South line --
Virgin Islands to Trinidad and Tobago or something like that, bypassing
the Caymans, etc.  The cost of the project is outweighed by the gains
of eliminating these recurring weather-related outages.

In fact, someone (Duncan?) may have posted the press release here over
a year ago.
