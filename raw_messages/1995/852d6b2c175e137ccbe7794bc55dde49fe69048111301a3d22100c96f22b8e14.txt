I havn't seen any scanners that block the 900 MHz range.  Didn't think they
were blocking that.  There isn't any reason to. After all they don't block
the 49 MHz.

Most cellular phone like the Motorola and the NEC can scan cellular
channels.  Whats neat is that they require little or no modification.
They can scan through all cellular channels including control, pause on a
channel that has audio, and should signal level.  

I've use the Novatel and Motorola phones to even force the transmit on my
phone on a channel that was already in conversation and create a three way
call.  Since the cellular system already proccessed the original MIN and ESN
of the calling party my ESN is never checked.  All of this without modifying
my phone internaly or adding a computer.  

This type of stuff makes encryption needed.  More and more people are using
PCMCIA cellular modems for all kinds of transaction not realizing that
anyone can pretty much intercept and use that information.  Digital will
help in some ways but harm on others.

$49 bucks will buy you an upconverter that will enable any scanner that can
pick up the 400 MHz range to pickup cellular.
