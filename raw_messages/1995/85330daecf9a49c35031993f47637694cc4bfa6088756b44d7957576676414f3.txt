   So Fred, I gather that you believe that there is an absolute metric of
insultingness, of untruthfulness, of crudeness.

  Possibly you think that you, Fred Cohen, are a good judge of these
things, or that you know who to trust, to delegate these measurements to? 

  Yes, Fred, please do act now to ensure that other Netters are held to 
the standards you propose. Perhaps you can propose a law that will 
enforce your will?
