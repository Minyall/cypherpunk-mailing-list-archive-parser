In this particular case, hostnames do help, because they are information 
imbedded in the url used to access the server. By verifying the hostname 
in the certificate with the hostname in the url, you can state with a 
high degree of confidence that the object retrieved is precisely the 
desired object covered by this url.

I'm not referring to the secret key of _the_ server; I'm referring to the 
secret key of _ANY_ server. In the limiting case, such a key can be 
obtained by buying one from the CA.
