This is the second person who has expressed this sentiment. I don't
understand it. If you believe that the possibility of randseed.bin
getting out is dangerous, then why do you leave it online? Do you
really trust every piece of software you run, every piece of software
that can possibly access your machine over the net, to not look at
that file?
