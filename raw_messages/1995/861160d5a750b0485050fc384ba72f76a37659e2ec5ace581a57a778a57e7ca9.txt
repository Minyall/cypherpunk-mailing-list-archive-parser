* Secure Local Proxy - provides secure DCE-Web access
  using standard off-the-shelf browsers. It is possible
  to access DCE-Web using any browser without any
  modification. The Secure Local Proxy functions as
  protocol switch, forwarding proxy requests either as
  standard http or using the secure DCE-Web protocol.

* Secure Gateway - integrates the DCE-Web with other
  secure Web protocols. The Gateway provides secure
  access to the Multi-protocol Server, providing DCE
  authentication based on public key identities. The
  gateway is designed to allow plug-in access for
  multiple public key Web protocols.
