Excellent assessment - I wholely agree with it.

A reasonable response.  My question is: Why do you think that the key
generation algorithm used by PGP is secure? Specifically, how do we know
there is no subtle back door that reduces the problem of testing the
typical key space to a solvable problem in today's technology?

I don't believe I made ANY "vague, wild, unsupported claims" however,
that is certainly a matter of opinion.

Excellent - have you looked at the white paper describing the secure
"get-only" W3 server available under What's New at http://all.net? I
think that this is a step in the right direction toward demonstrating
more about a program than that it runs most of the time and seems to
give reasonable answers.  Perhaps someone would like to make similar
demonstrations for PGP.

Under what analysis do you construe "It cannot be safely assumed" as
"near-defamatory"?

I don't know you any more than you know me.  We are both just mail
sources on the Internet.  Why do you consider it reasonable to assume
that we should all trust statements made by people we do not know and
have not met based on their assertion that they think a cryptosystem is
safe and free of back doors?  If I add a PGP signature, does it make
me any more trustworthy?

And I should trust you to tell me that PGP is safe for me to use?
