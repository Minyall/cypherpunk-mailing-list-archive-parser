Most LEC's charge per-minute for ISDN.  Pac Bell and SWBT are some of the 
few exceptions.  What's even worse is in some states there isn't even a 
residential ISDN tariff, hence all ISDN lines are "business" lines and 
billed accordingly.  The only real solution is to demand dial the 
connection from both ends.  This is fairly straightforward assuming your 
provider is set up for it, since there is a lot of ISDN equipment that 
will brfing the connection up only when there are packets to send then 
idle it out.

An economical alternative in some areas is frame-relay.  In Washington 
state USwest wants ~$70/month for a 56k FR link to anywhere in your 
LATA.  The providers around here charge $100-$150 to link a single 
machine to the net via FR, and $150-$350 if you are routing a whole 
subnet.
