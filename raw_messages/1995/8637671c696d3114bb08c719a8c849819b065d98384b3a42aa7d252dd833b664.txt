The ACK process and the allocation process are separate, and should 
remain so.  They run on different servers, and they run as separate 
processes in the unix version of brloop.  A little tweaking of brloop 
could allow pre-fetching of the next segment to search, without any 
effect on the ACK process.  I dislike the idea of a client sending an ACK 
before it has searched the entire segment.
