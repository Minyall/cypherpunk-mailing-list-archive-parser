I very much agree with the direction you appear to be headed in.  It seems
to me that Netscape should have no problem devising some sort of scenario in
which such a program eventually gets onto the nets, but in a way that is
squeaky clean, at least for THEM.  


In addition, why should they even need to write the encrytion part of their
software IN the US?  It occurs to me that one way to do this might be to
send one of their programmers to a conveniently-located place, such as
Vancouver BC , Montreal Canada, or a few other nearby places, with a great
deal of fanfare, and tell him to "write some crypto."  He does, and brings
it back into the US with him, leaving a copy of it "outside" the country for
international distribution.
