Fine -- then packet filter on your firewall. Of course, you can't
really trust the IP addresses anyway -- you need something IPSP-like
if you actually want to trust outside hosts (swIPe does nicely as a
stopgap). And even if one wanted to move packets through a firewall
over TCP, why use SLIP encapsulation? It was designed for unreliable
links -- on a reliable link, you can save lots of grief by just
sending the packet -- total length of an IP datagram is included
inside the datagram, thus rendering further encapsulation unnecessary.
