I think that two Amnesty policies are being confused. Amnesty does protest on 
behalf of prisoners of concience in all countries. It also has a rule which means 
that a group making a protest should come from outside the country concerned, 
this is a sensible means of preventing Amnesty becomming a vehicle for partisan 
protests. They have similar rules for when they send observers etc.

I don't think that Phil necessarily has to be arrested though. Amnesty might well 
wish to send someone to the trial to act as an observer.
