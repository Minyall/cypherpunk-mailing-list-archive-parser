Sorry.  That's the minor point I was talking about.

For example, one might make an exportable system by doing something really
nice for the gov't and giving NSA a back door master key for it to use.
That doesn't give it to the DoJ -- and I'm not so sure NSA would admit to
the existence of a back door much less release the master key.
