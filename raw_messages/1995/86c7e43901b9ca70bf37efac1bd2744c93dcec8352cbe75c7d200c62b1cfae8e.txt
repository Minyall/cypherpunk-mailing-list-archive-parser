Well, its already been modified to do it. Read the drafts by Eastlake
and Kaufman on DNS security, which basically means keys in the DNS and
signed DNS records.

So you use TCP -- DNS already supports that. In any case, however, the
reassembly size and lowest common denominator MTUs are being jacked
way up for IPv6.

I very strongly disagree. Even today, we find more and more bugs in
DNS. If we had to start from scratch, we'd have to build an
infrastructure like DNS all over again, only to find that we suffer
from all the same old bugs and end up with a parallel implementation
that looks almost exactly like DNS only less reliable.
