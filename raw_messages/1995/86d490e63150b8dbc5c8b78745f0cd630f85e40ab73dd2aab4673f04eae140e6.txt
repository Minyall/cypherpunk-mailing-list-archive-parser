A couple of questions regarding Thomas Jefferson's Wheel Ciphyer:

1) How would you classify this cipher?  It looks to me like a polyalphabetic
   with the plaintext also being the key, kind of like an autokey.  Am 
   I correct, or is this cipher a different animal entirely?

2) Can anyone point me to references on the cryptanalysis of this cipher?
   
Many thanks in advance,

Ken
