Neither am I, but may I suggest the following:

S. Prata, C++ Primer Plus: Teach Yourself Object-Oriented Programming,
2d ed., Waite Group Press, ISBN 1-878739-74-3 (1995).  Nuts & bolts.

S. Lippman, C++ Primer, 2d ed., Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-54848-8
(1993).  Not quite so nuts and bolts, but good to read after covering
the treatment of the same material in Prata.

I've just starting working through these and find them effective.
