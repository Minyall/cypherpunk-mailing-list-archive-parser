Of course I told you so. I knew what I was saying when I mentioned
buffer overflows being a big problem in code written by the NCSA team,
most of whom went over to Netscape When at NCSA, they showed very
little capacity to learn this lesson no matter how many cracks
occured. They always just tried to kludge around the thing instead of
fixing it. When I write security oriented code, I outright ban the use
of certain C library calls.

The problem is that if you don't produce a (benign) exploit people
aren't going to take it seriously enough.
