I stand corrected.  I've not read the original paper.

Granted.  A brute force attack on MD4 takes 2^64 times more operations
to invert it than it does to find matching pairs if I remember correctly.
However a clever algorithm would reduce that.

Of course with MD5 as a plug-in replacement that's only 30% slower
this isn't a big problem.  Looks like the safety belts are worth while
after all.
