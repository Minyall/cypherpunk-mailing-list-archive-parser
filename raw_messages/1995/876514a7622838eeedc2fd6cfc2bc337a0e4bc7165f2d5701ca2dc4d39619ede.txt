These programs are pretty much textbook examples of socket usage, so
it's not too surprising, but that is kindof funny.  I doubt they were
actually copied out of a textbook; as they both had bugs in them, but I
think I have most of the bugs fixed now.  One that I didn't see earlier
when I posted that is that the select loop is missing an
if(FD_ISSET(fd,&readfds)....  It works without it, but not smoothly.  I
found these posted to alt.2600 last summer and they've been sitting on
my hard disk until this weekend when I pulled them out and started
playing with them.

Did any of your students try for the extra credit and add encryption?
