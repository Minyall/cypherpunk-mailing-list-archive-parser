  or, a less expensive solution if you use BSDI or Linux, set up an alias 
or a dummy interface (virtual interface). (under linux you also have to 
add a route from your real interface to it.) it's what i do.
   this also requires another IP address and hence cooperation of whoever 
is giving you IP numbers, but it works like a charm.
