Any time you're using non-encrypted remailers, you've got no protection
against people doing that; even with encrypted messages they can still
tell who's sending mail to anon.penet.fi, but can't tell who the messages
are forwarded to.

There may be ECPA issues involved, especially if CalPolySLO is a government-
run university; the sysadmins certainly need to learn some ethics...
If your ombudsperson can be reached by email, a note through anon.penet.fi
explaining the usefulness of anonymous remailers for sensitive communications
might be educational.  After all, it's a technique they might want to use
for handling sexual harassment cases or other problems requiring two-way
communications.
