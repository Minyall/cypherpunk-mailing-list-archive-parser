Is this the poem, Lucky?

     They [Nazis] came first for the Communists,
and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Communist.
     Then they came for the Jews, 
and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Jew.
     Then they came for the Catholics, 
and I didn't speak up because I was a Protestant.
     Then they came for me,
and by that time there was no one left to speak up.
                         - Martin Niemller

Seems appropriate lately, doesn't it?
