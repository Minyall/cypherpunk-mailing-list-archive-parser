Yes, I've seen that too. They insisted it will always be secure, especially
if one keeps changing the ink...

...probably will be until DNA cloning becomes cheap and accessible...

BTW, I think that company also had other ideas to use cheap cloning technology
such as distributing icons of famous people (Jerry Garcia was an example) that
had bits of their DNA in them...
