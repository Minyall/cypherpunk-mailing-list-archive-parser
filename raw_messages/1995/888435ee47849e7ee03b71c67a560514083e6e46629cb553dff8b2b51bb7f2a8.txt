Subject: MixMaster remailer source

    A little while back when the "remailer crisis" discussion was in
full swing, L. McCarthy recommended the Mixmaster remailer as being the
most modern. After several days of hunting, I have utterly failed to
turn up the source to this remailer. Can anyone provide me a pointer?

    On a slightly related note, is there a validation suite for PGP? The
MIT distribution does not include OS/2 binaries, unfortunately, but I
have managed to get a clean build. It seems to work, but I simply don't
know enough about PGP to be sure that it really is a fully working
verson.
