I'm not about to split hairs based on one's particular implementation of labels;
rather, I would say that the labels one gives to government don't really
matter.  The purpose of government is to maximize personal freedom while at
the same time minimizing the curtailment of the personal freedoms of others.
I don't think that you can have a meaningful yardstick other than this - it
covers economic as well as social issues.

Agreed, but I don't see that that was the point Rishab was making.  Oh, well..
