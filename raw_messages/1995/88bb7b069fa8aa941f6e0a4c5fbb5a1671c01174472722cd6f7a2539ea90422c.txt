There was a program that forged CRC checksums that came out a couple years back,
letting you create a Trojan Horse and modify it to match Unix "sum" checksums
by adding junk to the end.  I'd be extremely surprised if anyone did this
with MD5;
CRCs are invertable, and generally short enough to brute-force as well.
