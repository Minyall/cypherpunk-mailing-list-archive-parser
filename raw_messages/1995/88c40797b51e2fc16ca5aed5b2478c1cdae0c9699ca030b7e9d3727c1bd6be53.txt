I don't have the text of Lance's response available at the moment, but
I believe he clearly stated that he would not block remailings to the
mail-to-news gateways.  I.e., while he's complying with the letter of the
Co$ request, his remailers can still be used effectively for anonymous
posting.  Other than a slight delay in posting, I can't think of any
inconvenience this imposes on those wishing to post anonymously.

I thought it was an excellent response.  /* nudge, wink, etc. :-) */
