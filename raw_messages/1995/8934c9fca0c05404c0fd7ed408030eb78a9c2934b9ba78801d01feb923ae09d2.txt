Er, heh?

1) 95% of the people on this list write no code and participate in no
   design activities, so they have no efforts to dissipate.
2) If there was a lobbying effort, the most participation anyone in
   the "we" above would end up doing is throwing cash at some
   Washington firm. I doubt that anyone would be involved directly, so
   how does this "disspiapate our efforts"?
3) What you mean "we", kimosabe?
