Just a straight Chaumian style blinding won't work, as there are too many 
covert channels available via both timing and amounts; For example, Joe 
Random Capitalist-Oppressor could arrange to pay a series of relatively 
small amounts wth different values in the cents field which could be used 
to confirm their payment (e.g. they could be composed to form a digitally 
signed value of some kind ("pollution rools" or "lung cancer is kool") :)

Sen. Dianne Running-Dog could then look for a matching set of donations 
and confirm that the bribe had in fact been paid. 

There are much better ways of reforming the political system -the 
formation of proper political parties with real programmes (the one good 
thing about the newtoid surge); changing the rules for TV advertising, 
etc. Blinding just makes things worse.
