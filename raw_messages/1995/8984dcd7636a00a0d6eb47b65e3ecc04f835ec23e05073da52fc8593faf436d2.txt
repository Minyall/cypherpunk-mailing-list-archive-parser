	how to use a timing attack?  across a network?  on the same host 
(therefore multiuser)?   or on a dedicated host, with a know algorithm 
and known ciphertext running DOS (no kernel or anything to preempt the 
process)?   using the famous appendix H registers of a 586 allows you to 
time the processing of instructions very well.

	dont have to know how long it takes to encrypt ahead of time.  
walk the key bit by bit (ouch bad pun) guessing 1 or 0 each time and 
looking to see if the correlations continue to appear or not.  horrendous 
problem, but a lot better than brute force.

	i really need to read the final paper when it is issued.
