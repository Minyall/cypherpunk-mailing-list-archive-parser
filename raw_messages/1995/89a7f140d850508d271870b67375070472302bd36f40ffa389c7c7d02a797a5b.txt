     OTOH, maybe we _should_ try for constant computation time and then try 
     for *random* delay time.  Remember that _we_ will spend a lot of real 
     time arguing whether the *random* delay is really _random_

     Hey, don't go for constant time, that's too hard to get perfect.  Add 
     a *random* delay.  This particular crypto-flaw is pretty easy to fix. 
     (See, I'm not *always* arguing the downside of cryptography!)
     
     It is worth noting, however, the extent to which "secure" 
     cryptographic protocols keep needing to get fixed one last time....
