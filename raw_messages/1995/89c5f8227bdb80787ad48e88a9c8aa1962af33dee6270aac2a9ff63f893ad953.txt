A much simpler solution might be to just force all politicians to give up 
their campaign funds when they retire, or even better, immediately 
following the elections. Today, whatever is left in their campaign funds 
are given over to them when they retire or are forced out of office, on top 
of their lucrative pensions.

Cheers,
