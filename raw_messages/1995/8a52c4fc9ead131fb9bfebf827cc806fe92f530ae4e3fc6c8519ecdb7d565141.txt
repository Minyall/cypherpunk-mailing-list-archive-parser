The economics of the situation seem to dictate that whether you have
one key or N keys, it's going to be cheaper to subvert the escrow agent
(you guys or whoever) than it is to brute-force even one key. Therefore
I'm not clear on how using multiple keys buys you much against the most
probable threat -- opponents getting physical access to keys or the
subversion of personnel who have legitimate access.

Of course, it's still a good policy, reducing the payoff to those too
timid to try the direct approach. But I think this threat is significantly
less likely than a disgruntled employee selling the DRC private
keys on a real instantiation of the Blacknet model, without even being
solicited.

You may feel very comfortable with the personnel and procedures you
have in place now, but auditing and vetting systems are notorious
for scaling very, very poorly. You may feel you can vouch for the
trustworthiness of everyone at TIS now, but this sort of familiarity
also scales very poorly. And clearly, were this to become commercially
significant, it would need to scale quite a bit.
