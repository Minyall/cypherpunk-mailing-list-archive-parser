Are the SSL patches for Apache available somewhere else than in USA or UK?

You know I am a big security risk for those countries as I live in 
Estonia, so it is not allowed for me to get apache-ssl legally. Good old 
COCOM restrictions, the poor guys in Great Britain have not heard the 
world has changed.

So can anyone suggest how to get the software? Ftp, fsp, http, e-mail, 
anything will do.
