There is an easy way to develop a secret key in front any number of eves, be 
they experts or not, without the eves knowing what the key is.  Even if they 
tap your phone/comm line, ect.  There was an article in Discovery Magazine a 
couple of years ago, talking about how to use photons and their randomness as 
the perfect, uncrackable code.  Use of the photons aside, there was a key 
generation method discussed, simple, yet secure enough to work out on a tapped 
phone.  Let me root around.
