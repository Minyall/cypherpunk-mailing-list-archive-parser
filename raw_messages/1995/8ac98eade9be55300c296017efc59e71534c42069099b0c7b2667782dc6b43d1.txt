	Aren't court orders part of the public record? I don't quite
know how this would work. I don't think they can keep me from telling
people that I've started comprehensive logging, or at least keep it
from being founnd out. (Legally, that is. I'm sure they could always
use an approach like threatening to audit me every year, threatening
my family, etc.)
