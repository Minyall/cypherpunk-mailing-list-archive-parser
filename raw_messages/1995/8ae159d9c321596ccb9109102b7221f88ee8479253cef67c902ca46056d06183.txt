Mmmh,

correctness does not mean "it's a nice thing". It just
means that something fulfills the specs.

Do you know which specs were fed into the prover?

The specs could be as weak as

  -  RSA must terminate if fed with the number 42

  -  x ^ (e * d) = x  mod n   for all x from 0..(n-1)
