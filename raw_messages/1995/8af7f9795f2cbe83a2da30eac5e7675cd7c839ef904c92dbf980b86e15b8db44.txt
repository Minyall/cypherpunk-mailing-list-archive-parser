That just refers to the fact that it is no longer legal to sell
scanners that can listen in to that range.  The same is true
of the 800 MHz band (used for a lot of cellular phone traffic).
Ah, I love my really old scanner that isn't bound by such
limitations...  (BTW, a couple of years ago Nuts & Volts ran
an article with information on a program and some toys that let
a laptop computer, properly wired into a cell phone, act as a
cell scanner.  Never did wire it up, but it looked like fun ;)

ObCrypto: um, if you can find it, let me know :)
