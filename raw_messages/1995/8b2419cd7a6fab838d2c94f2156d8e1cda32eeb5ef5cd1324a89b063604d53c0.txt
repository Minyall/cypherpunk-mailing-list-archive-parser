Friends,
-	My editor from the Covert Action Quarterly called with a question 
on a piece I've authored on the NSA's involvement in the development of 
the digital telephony bill. I animated the characters and campaign 
strategies in this narrative common to the clipper and DT initiatives. In 
that, taking about Clipper I mentioned its rise as a FIPS, etc. 
-	QUESTION: Just what is the power of the FIPS outside of the 
interop issues in sending stuff back and forth from federal agencies?
