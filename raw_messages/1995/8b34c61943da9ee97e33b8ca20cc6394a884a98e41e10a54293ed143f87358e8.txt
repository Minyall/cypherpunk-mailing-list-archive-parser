   IEEE Spectrum, September, 1995:


   Excerpt on Net security from "Upgrading the Internet," a
   roundtable discussion of the Internet Society on the next
   generation of Internet protocols, IP Version 6.

   Discussants: Vinton Cerf, Stephen Deering, Christian
   Huitema, Haruhisa Ishida, Larry Landweber, Eric Schmidt,
   Lixia Zhang.

      A most important aspect of the IPv6 is the somewhat
      controversial decision to require that all v6
      implementations support strong privacy and strong
      authentication. At this level, all of the security
      problems won't be solved, but we can authenticate and
      maintain privacy of packets that flow from one machine
      to another. This will eliminate many security threats in
      the current Internet, such as source-address-spoofing,
      source-related routing attacks, password sniffing,
      connection hijacking, and so on.


   New Scientist, Sept 9, 1995: "Watching you, watching us."

      Companies that sell electronic surveillance equipment to
      repressive regimes face the prospect of being "outed" on
      the Internet this autumn. Two electronic watchdogs, the
      British group Privacy International (PI) and its
      American sister organisation the Electronic Privacy
      Information Centre (EPIC), are setting up an offshore
      Internet site that will name companies that sell
      electronic instruments of repression to governments with
      poor records on human rights.
