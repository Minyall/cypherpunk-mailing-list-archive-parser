( im gonna work this back onto topic.. just watch. :)  ) 

There is a rather lengthy FAQ that explains about a zillion different 
ways to get your paws on whichever newsgroups you desire. Its called
"How to Receive Banned News Groups FAQ" and you can find it at:

http://www.cen.uiuc.edu/~jg11772/banned-groups-faq.html

(here it comes..)

In addition to covering topics relating to finding what you want in the 
way of usenet news, it also has a pretty well thought out anti-censorship 
rant towards the end, and gives pointers to some open NNTP servers, 
and freenets where you can obtain free access to usenet news. There is 
also a short list of mail to news gateways, which is useful if you would 
like to post to usenet via a remailer (or if your sysadmin censors which 
groups you have access to).

(Ok.. maybe not totally on topic.. i tried.. blegh)

have a day.
