You want to take a look at the ECPA (stands for Electronic
Communications Privacy Act--I think).  I don't have URLs handy, but it
should be easy enough to find via Alta Vista or Yahoo.

The way I understand it, though there are fairly strict limits on the
snooping your employer can do, you waive more or less all your privacy
rights if you sign a form saying you "consent" to the snooping.  Your
encryption question falls in kind of a grey area (most of the ECPA
deals with reading people's email, etc.), but it's probably covered in
there somewhere.

I have very strong feelings about this subject, but I'll keep them to
myself for now since I'm posting from work.  We were all informed a
week or two ago that Bear Stearns is now archiving every piece of
email coming into or leaving the company.

All I'll say here is that I disagree strongly with the views Tim May
posted about employees' property rights, etc. (though we agree on most
other things).
