Hard to tell from this bill what the deal is on this. Common carriers 
aren;t completely immune from prosecution or lawsuit or whatnot to begin 
with. But in addition, S.314 introduces "transmit or otherwise make 
available" into the language of the law. Which makes the -carrier- of the 
"offending" information responsible.
