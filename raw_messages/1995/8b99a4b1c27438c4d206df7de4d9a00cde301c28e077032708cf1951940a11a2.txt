Another thought:  why couldn't you sell a book of "stamps" -- Magic Money 
tokens -- and get paid for them using First Virtual?  This would get 
around two problems:  the lack of anonymity using First Virtual, and the 
fairly high 29-cent-per-transaction fee.  You could sell a book of twenty 
remailer stamps for a dollar, or something.  I'd buy.

And it wouldn't make it too easy for people to use remailers without 
paying.  FV will still take an account away from someone who denies 
legitimate charges too many times.

I guess there is the problem of Chaum's patents (and RSA's).  Is there 
anyplace where neither set of patents is valid, or where they'd be 
practically unenforceable?
