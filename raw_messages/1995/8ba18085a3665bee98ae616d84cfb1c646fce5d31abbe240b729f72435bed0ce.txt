Hmmm, a few words about credit card liabilty.

The situation now is that in a "card not present" transaction the merchant is
liable for the fraud.  This means that *a lot* of internet based stores are 
getting eaten alive by fraud.  The big issue right now is not cards being
stolen from the telco switch (yes it's a risk but can anybody cite it
happening?).
The issue is authentication of the card user.  We have a significant
investment in 
AI / credit scoring code to defeat the wannabe crackers.  This goes way beyond
mod 10 checks and address verification.

[ as an aside I've put two people in jail this year for card fraud ]
