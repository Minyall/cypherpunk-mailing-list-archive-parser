The Microsoft Internet Explorer sends the user-agent "Mozilla 1.22 (compatible"
to hte server, which triggers an incorrect response from, e.g., www.c2.org.
This little fraud has the potential to make you look silly if left unexplained.

If you get the string "compatible;" (or Compatible;?), you should instead pop
up Netscapisms that show that Microsoft is lying. Or maybe Billisms.
<font face="Symbol">, which affects only MSIE, might be appropriate.
