There have been many examples of this - several cases of hams having 
their pacemakers go nuts when they keyed their transmitters, etc.  But 
that doesn't mean that aviation avionics are sensitive - in fact, devices 
that are specifically designed to receive RF of a specific frequency are 
usually designed to reject RF of a different frequency, especially type 
accepted radios (the avionics package is required to be type accepted for 
that particular class of service, which includes spurious rejection, 
intermod products down XX dB, etc.)

A transistor radio puts out such a minute amount of RF (at 455 KHz and/or
10.7 MHz, the IF freqs of the radio) that most insturments designed to
pick up RF can't detect this stuff from more than a few feet away.  FCC
regulations say that if your avionics is being interfered with, it's YOUR
problem, not the guy that just turned on his radio.  If someone's avionics
is being interfered when I turn on an AM/FM transistor radio, then I'd say
that he either needs to get his avionics fixed, or he's using illegal
consumer-grade radios (which are usually junk anyway - even much ham radio
gear is garbage, unfortunately), instead of the type-accepted stuff he's
supposed to be using.  I'd be interested in finding out more about this
guy and his "VLS-jumped-when-someone-turned-on-their-radio" story.

The early laptop computers would put out an amazing amount of crap.  I 
used to have a Zenith laptop, and when I'd turn the thing on, it'd throw 
out junk that I could hear on every radio in the house, including the 2m 
FM stuff, the HF rig, and I could even hear it out in my car on the 2m 
mobile!  I can believe it, but that's no excuse for just saying, "well, 
let's just ban all of it..."

My point is, it's not your, nor my responsibility to refrain from using 
our radios - it's the responsibility of the avionics people to make sure 
that their radios are within spec and are kept that way.  If they don't 
bother, that's not my fault.

Again, my contention is that they don't.

The ng rec.radio.amateur.misc might have some additional stuff in the FAQ,
and the ARRL certainly has a mountain of information on this - I'll poke
around.  'echo help|Mail info@arrl.org' might yield some interesting
things...
