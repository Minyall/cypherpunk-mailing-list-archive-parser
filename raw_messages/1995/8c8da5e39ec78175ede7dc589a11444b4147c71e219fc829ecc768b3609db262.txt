What I meant is, are there any proto-coins that will show through
a blinding? (Mathematically special values like fixed points.)

So it is.

What you'd really want is for Alice to pay for the new coins in ecash.


I'm wondering whether a "coin-changer" would be easier or harder to
set up than a "bank" (from regulatory point of view).

After all, for e-cash you don't really need accounts; you just need:
  - verify coins (coin-changer) ie ecash->ecash
  - buy coins (join the system) ie  cash->ecash
  - sell coins (redeem)         ie ecash->cash

Any cyberspace banks can be completely separate from the ecash issuer.
