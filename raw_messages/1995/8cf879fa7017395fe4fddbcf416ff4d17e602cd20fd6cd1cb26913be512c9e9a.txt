   "One Source, Many Ideas In Foster Case: Publisher Bankrolls
   Cover Up Theories."

      The theory of a Vincent Foster murder and a cover-up has
      been promoted by a handful of foundations and
      publications united by a common denominator: the money
      of Richard Mellon Scaife.

      "The death of Vincent Foster: I think that's the Rosetta
      Stone to the whole Clinton Administration," said Mr.
      Scaife, a newspaper publisher with half a billion
      dollars in the bank, during a two-hour interview.
