You might want to prepare your memorial service, then, as I recall reading
editorials along these lines back around 1990, when "should the NSA be used
for economic espionage?" was in the news.

Not the exact title of their editorial, but the gist was that turning the
NSA into a spy agency at the beck and call of Ford and Motorola is a bad
idea.

But if you die, Vlad, "the vznuri," at least you have seven other
functioning tentacles.
