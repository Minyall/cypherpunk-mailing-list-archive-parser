well, since it is "official" policy and the basics concern rejecting all 
foreign addresses and making the proposed recipient agree to a file

Canadian citizen, it might be nice if someone who has the `sed ....`
and/or `awk...` scripts would post them for all to use (with whatever 
disclaimers, etc.)
