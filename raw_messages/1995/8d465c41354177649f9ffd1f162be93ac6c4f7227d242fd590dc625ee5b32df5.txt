Well, PGP does have keys. You have your private key and your public key, and
they have to be managed somehow (stored on disk) even if it's not centrally.
Other algorithms like kerberos have more complex key management issues. 
This has no key, and hence no management.

This is the most confusing part of the whole thing.. How does it get started.
unfortunately, as this is embroiled in non-disclosure and patent-pending,
we're not going to know, but are forced to take the word of experts such
as David Kahn that it works as advertised.

Yes, I and a friend of mine were the only two people in the audience
that were not Journalists.  It does look rather intruguing, but so much
negativism is flying about, that most people have dismissed it out of hand.

Yeah, this is a bit of a marketing issue. It doesn't use a cryptographically
strong random number generation scheme. Instead, some kind of state about
the two machines and the message stream is used to perform synchronization.
Then, the message itself is supposed to impart the non-repetitive nature
for the non-repeating "One time pad".
 So, in the sense that it never repeats, it could be called a one time pad,
and that's how they are using it. However, according to the traditional
definitions of a one time pad with a strong random number and no correlation,
it may not pass.

I believe they also use a random number stream somehow.. e.g. both parties
observe some random number stream, as well as the randomness in the message
itself to construct the pad. It would seem that if you wanted to decode
message N of an M message sequence, you would need all of the messages 1
through N to do it. If any one of them was missing, you couldn't decode
N itself.
