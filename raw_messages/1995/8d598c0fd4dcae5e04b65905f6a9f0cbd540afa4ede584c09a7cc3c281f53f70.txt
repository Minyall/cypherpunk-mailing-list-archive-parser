The only way this can work is if the server is told it is a 50%/75%/etc
size ACK, and then latter the server is ACKed for the full 100%. 

Why?  Because what happens if the client dies immediately after doing 
the ACK - maybe only 51% of that space has been searched, yet 
the server has already seen an ACK for it.


IMO - a % ACK is to much complexity and extra work on the server,
which is already having trouble keeping up.
