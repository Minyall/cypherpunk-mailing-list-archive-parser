	I keep hearing this thought.  Isn't Win95 with its
'executables in email' much more dangerous than Java, which at least
tries to address security?

	There is the argument that the claims will inspire false
confidence in Java's security mechanisms, and thus people will be
bitten, but I don't buy it.  People don't look to security as a chack
item when buying software.  And when they do, they're usually not
capable of distinguishing between the pap that passes for security
through marketing from security by design.
