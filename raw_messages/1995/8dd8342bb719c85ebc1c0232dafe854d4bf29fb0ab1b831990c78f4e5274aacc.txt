RSA WANTS LICENSE FOR DIGITAL SIGNATURE TECHNOLOGY

RSA Data Security claims it owns the dominant patent covering
digital signature technology, and wants other companies and
government agencies to pay them license fees for using it.

The U.S. government is fighting RSA's claim, saying the digital
signature algorithm it uses in its digital signature standard
is covered by a different patent.  If RSA can make its claim
stick, the government will owe the encryption company royalties
for use of its digital signature standard.
