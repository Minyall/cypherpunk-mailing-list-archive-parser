That's one way to look at it.  Of course since the "license 
requirements" had to do with some obscure administrivia that nobody
thought would apply to ISP's, none of the 6 or so ISP's in Hong Kong
had thought to apply for it.  One has to wonder why the gov't pulled
the plug on 5 of them without so much as a warning, much less a
chance to comply.


Did I say 5?  Oh yes.  The largest HK ISP-- and the one with closest
ties to the government-- had gone ahead and applied for the license
just a couple of weeks before the blackout.  Corruption is the modus
operandi in HK, so I wouldn't be at all surprised if that one ISP
got a special favor by being warned of the impending black-out, or
even if it had a hand in instigating it.


I'm sure you'll correct me if I've got any of my facts wrong.


(c'punks relevance:  (parts of) the Net is still vulnerable to
governmental blackout.  Is this relevant?  Well, hardly, but perhaps
interesting.  And at least I flagged it.)
