Hi all,

Just a reminder that the next general meeting will be held on January 7,
1996 from 6-8pm at the Central Market HEB on N. Lamar at 42nd.

We will be discussing further issues related to the video and setting a
schedule of meetings and deadlines for various production points.

Hope to see you folks there!
