A colleague drew my attention to this, and I was so pleased with it that
I ported it to FreeBSD.

I kept the interface as close to the original as I could, but made some
changes for efficiency and ease:

1) I turned the huge comment at the top explaining the theory of operation
into a man page (random(4)).

2) We felt that hooking all interrupts might be dangerous. IDE drives can
interrupt at a heck of a rate, and so can some serial ports, and we felt
that in these cases _not_ using the interrupt was a good idea. So I
added an ioctl to allow the superuser to select his own set, appropriate
to the hardware in use. It is nearly impossible to do this automatically.

Gimme a yell if you want copies :-)
