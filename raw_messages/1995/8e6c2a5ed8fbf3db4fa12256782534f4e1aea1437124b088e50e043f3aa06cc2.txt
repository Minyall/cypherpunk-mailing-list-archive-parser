 "Dr" Cohen. If you want to criticize Java, why not read the technical
papers rather than spewing questions and assertions based from ignorance.
When you want to criticize a piece of engineering, you don't look
at the feature list or white paper. As is made clear in your post,
you don't know the meanings of phrases used in the Java paper, nor do
you understand how the machinery works. (e.g. byte code verifier)
