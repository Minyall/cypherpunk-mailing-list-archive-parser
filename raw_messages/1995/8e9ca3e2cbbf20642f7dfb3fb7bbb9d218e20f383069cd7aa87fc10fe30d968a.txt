True, in that sense it's useless.  But if it's PGP'd with a sufficient 
key, nobody can read it.  If it's from a well-overused guest account, 
nobody can find who sent it.  If the picture's not preceded with an 
identification of the intended recipient, and is posted in a public 
forum, then nobody knows who it's for.  Especially if everyone has to 
read it in order to find out if it's for them.

If PGP 3.0 has some sort of option to decrypt messages without PGP 
headers or footers, then the issue ceases to be relevant. Because you've 
stego'd already random-seeming material.  If the stego program is 
integrated with PGP properly, you have public key stegonography.

It's possible; just that somebody's gotta write the damned software.  And 
I'm certainly not capable to do that.  Yet.
