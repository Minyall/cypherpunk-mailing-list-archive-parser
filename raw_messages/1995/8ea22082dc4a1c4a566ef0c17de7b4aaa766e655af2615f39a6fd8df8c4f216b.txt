	Procmail will run on the UNIX system that you connect to via
pop.  It processes mail, it doesn't transport it.  (It can, of course,
hand mail off to an MTA.)

	Procmail is a very versatile, relatively easy to use way of
processing mail.  Its most obvious function is to put mailing lists
into one or several folders, but it also can be made into a file
server*, automatically retrieve PGP keys, act as a basic remailer,
etc, etc.
