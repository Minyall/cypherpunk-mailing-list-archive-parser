Yuk yuk. :>

A minor adjustment to your comment: I haven't read the work yet, but
if it's based on Shor and Simon, it only "proves" the existence of
state superpositions (and perhaps some other mathematical things
relating to the construction of unitary transforms) - a fact equally
congenial to Many Worlds, Copenhagen, von Neumann, and most other
interpretations of quantum mechanics.  The only people who would
likely be upset by this are the neo-materialists and other
hidden-variable fetishists.

I'm six hundred messages behind and not likely to catch up soon, so
apologies if this has already been covered.
