Well, given that I haven't seen any Bell employees rushing to tear out
payphones, I suspect that if it ever went to court, they'd have to show
intent to commit or assist fraud.  Since anonymous remailers (and
payphones, prepaid calling cards, etc) have legitimate uses, they can't
prove you were intending to assist crime by providing those services.
There's also the ECPA protections...
