Hi Team,

Received this little blurb in my e-mail.  

>Free Directory Pinpoints E-Mail Addresses
>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
>  Palo Alto, Calif. -- ....  Well, SLED Corp. has stepped up to answer the
call of all the Internet
>users who have ever screamed  "How can I find someone's e-mail address?"
>.....
>  The Palo Alto-based company recently released its Four11 Online User
>Directory as a free service for Internet users. The directory is easily
>searched by e-mail, through the use of e-mail forms, or the Web, by using
>browsers such as Mosaic or Lynx. Search parameters include name, location,
>old e-mail address, Group Connection and wildcards.
>...Membership also includes PGP encryption certification and storage
>services. Members who provide proper identification can have their PGP
>public key signed with the SLED Silver Signature. Signed keys are added
>to the key owner's directory listing and can be quickly retrieved by other
>Internet users through either e-mail or the Web. These keys, actually
>small data files, are used to send private messages and verify digital
>signatures. The combination of an Internet wide directory with a PGP key
>server makes it possible to quickly find someone, obtain their key, and
>send them a secure message.

Things that make you go hmmmm....
