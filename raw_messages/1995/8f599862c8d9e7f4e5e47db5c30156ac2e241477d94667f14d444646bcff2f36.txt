Agreed, but that doesn't make it appropriate here.

Why?  Is there some REAL requirement that HTTP-NG be implementable
using only RSAREF for crypto?

No argument -- but it's still too short for most hash applications.
I'd much rather see hashes that everyone agrees are more than long
enough for the forseeable future  -- and I don't think you'll find
that consensus for MD5.

Of course, whether a particular hash is as secure as it can be for a
given length is a separate question.
