	I have literally hundreds of messages archived from the CP list of
several months back where Eric Hughes repeatedly states that reordering,
not latency, is the key. Reordering of a sufficient magnitude will
introduce latency inherently. Otherwise you are still vulnerable to 
traffic analysis (which is an art, not a science, remember).
