I have no current plans to alter our treatment of Linux.  It is not now,
nor has it ever been, a supported platform.  We do build for it,
and some people are happy about that.

I have not constructed a business case which would cause Netscape
to begin support for Linux versions of the Navigator.  Right now, I'm 
not sure that making a point of this would do what you want.

Either of the two above paragraphs could be changed with time.
