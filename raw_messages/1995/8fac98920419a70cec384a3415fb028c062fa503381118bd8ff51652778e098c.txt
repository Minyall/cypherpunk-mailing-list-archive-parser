I've had a look at the web site and it looks really interesting.  It would
make a great project if a bunch of cypherpunks installed NoCeM and then piped
the list to a newsgroup.  We could then develop reputation servers to help us
use NoCeM, start charging cyberbucks for our recommendations, and, in short,
make cpunks into a slightly larger outpost in Cyberlibertaria.  (a.k.a. The
Free Net)
