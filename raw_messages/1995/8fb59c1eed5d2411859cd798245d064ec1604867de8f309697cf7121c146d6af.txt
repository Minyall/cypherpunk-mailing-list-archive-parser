Sounds like _Sega v. Accolade_, 977 F.2d 1510 (9th Cir., 1993). 
I don't have it in front of me, but Terry Carroll's Copyright FAQ
(ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/law/copyright/faq/part2)
cites it for the proposition that dissasembly of a copyrighted work
can be fair use if there is no other way to reach noncopyrightable
(functional, not expressive) elements of an existing work.
