'small' questions about inet gambling

+ How do you complain that you didn't got your win without revealing
your ID ?
+ Alternatively, How do you prevent false complains or nasty
concurrent trying to trash gambling co reputation ?

regards
ps: it would be easier that the game is legal so ppl can play without
being hidden... In my current casino, most people do complain when
there is a problem, and I think that those who don't aren't because
its monopoly money or just they aren't paying much attention...
