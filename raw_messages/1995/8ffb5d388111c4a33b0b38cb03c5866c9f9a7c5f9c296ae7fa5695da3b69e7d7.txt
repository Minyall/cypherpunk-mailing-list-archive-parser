I believe that was Woodward & Bernstein. They were referring to some
right-wing wackos who had flagrantly broken the law investigating their
political opposition, then very sloppily tried to cover it up. Woodward &
Bernstein brought down a President. I think they're cool (though they seem
to have rested on their laurels, and their subsequent work is less
impressive). 

Anyway, Russell, did you ever get a followup to this? I don't see a
response on CDT's Web page, so I assume the funding issue never hit the 
"mainstream." I haven't been following the relevant lists and newsgroups.

While Leahy, the medical privacy bill's chief sponsor, is generally regarded 
as a White Hat (he led the opposition to Exon), I do have serious 
concerns about the issues that have been raised. I'm aware of the CDT's 
break with the EFF and have questioned their "maturity" before. It's 
possible they were "co-opted" or naive.

But at least the CDT cites its sources (like the full text of the bill and
testimony), and allows financial disclosure. This is not true of some less
reputable fringe organizations and publications. 

As for Clark's implied threats (I'm not entirely sure how much to read
into them, probably not much), I am of course aware of the vulnerability
of my personal records, and live my life accordingly. This includes
monitoring fraudulent requests for credit and medical records and being
completely honest with friends and employers. This is the "other" reason
I'm on cypherpunks. Would that we would all do the same. 

As for Clark knowing that I'm an274074@anon.penet.fi, well DUH. I've
posted that several times. It's advertised as a means for people
uninformed about remailers and such to send me anonymous tips. 

As Woody Allen once said, be fruitful and multiply.
