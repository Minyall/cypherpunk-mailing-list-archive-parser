According to AFP(London), The Independent reported on January 3, 1995
that a sixteen years old boy was arrested for breaking into the 
computer network of US Defense Department.

The report also tells that the hacker posted documents about last
year's nuclear crisis between North Korea and USA.

Does anyone know where can I get a copy of that documents ?
