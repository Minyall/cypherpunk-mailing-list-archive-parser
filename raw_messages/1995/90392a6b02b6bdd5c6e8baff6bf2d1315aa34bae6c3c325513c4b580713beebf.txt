Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3) has an optional command called 
APOP which sends a string of the form "<process-ID.clock@hostname>".
The POP3 client calculates the MD5 digest of 
 
  <process-ID.clock@hostname>password

and sends it to the server as "APOP username 58349485whatever89583449".

I like it.
