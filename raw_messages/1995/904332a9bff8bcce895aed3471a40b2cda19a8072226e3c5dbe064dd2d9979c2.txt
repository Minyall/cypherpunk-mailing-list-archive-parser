I suggest Forced Key Deposit (FKD) (when some non-governmental entity e.g.
an employer forces you to send copies of your keys to some depository), and
Voluntary Key Deposit (VKD), when you chose to deposit a copy of your key
with some third party.  I love the way GAK sounds, so I support it even the
whole concept is really FUCKED.  Whenever I hear, "Government Key
Certification", I think of digital signatures, not communication privacy.
