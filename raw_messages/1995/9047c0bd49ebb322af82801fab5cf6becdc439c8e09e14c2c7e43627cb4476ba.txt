Does anyone know of software available outside the US for generating 
large (1024-bit or more) Diffie-Hellman keys ? The default key for CTCP 
is only 512 bits, and I'd like to be able to give out some larger keys 
(e.g. 1024 and 2048 bits) so that people have a choice of the level of 
security that they want to use.

Alternatively, does anyone have any pre-generated large keys that I can 
put in there ?

Finally, I'm basing this on comments in 'Applied Cryptography' that D-H
keys should be at least 512 bits and preferably 1024. How does the
difficulty of breaking a D-H exchange with a 512 bit key compare to
breaking a 512 bit RSA key ?
