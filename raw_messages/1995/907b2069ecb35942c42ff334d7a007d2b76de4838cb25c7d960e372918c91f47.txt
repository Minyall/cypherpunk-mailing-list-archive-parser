I was rather amused at the forum given by the New York City Bar
Association on Clipper. The FBI representative not only trotted out
the four horsemen of the infocalypse -- in order, in a single
sentence! -- but also at one point spoke of snuff films.

He said, in what I found to be the greatest denial of logical thinking
I've seen in years, that he's not ready to give up and say that the
genii is out of the bottle -- as though he could put it back by force
of will.

I spoke with Stuart Baker for a while, during which time he informed
me that he didn't think the internet could possibly last.

Dorothy Denning is running another such conference soon.
