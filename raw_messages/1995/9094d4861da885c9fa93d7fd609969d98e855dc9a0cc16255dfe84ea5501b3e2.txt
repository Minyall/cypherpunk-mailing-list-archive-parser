  I believe that the identies of free certificates that verisign plans
to offer to netscape customers will not be checked in any way other than
to ensure that the name is unique for that CA.  You will have to ask
someone from Verisign to get a certain answer.

  I have stated here, and in other public forums, several times in the
past few months, that Netscape Navigator 2.0 will support user configurable
certificate authorities.  You will be able to specify that you do or
do not trust specific server certificates and certificate authorities.
The user will be able to incorporate new CA certificates into their
certificate database, and mark them as trusted for signing certs for
SSL, email, etc.
