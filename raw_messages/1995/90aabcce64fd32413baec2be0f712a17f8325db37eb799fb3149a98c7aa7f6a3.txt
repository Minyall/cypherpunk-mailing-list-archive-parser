WRONG!!! Netscape claims to be "secure" - hence it is Netscape's job to
be secure - regardless of the user's use of their product.  Otherwise,
the ads should read:

	"Netscape can be used securely by sufficiently knowledgeable
	users who have emasculated their postscript interpreters before
	using them to view files of unknown origin, and who have removed
	all other known, unknown, and/or undisclosed security holes from
	their systems.  Otherwise, Netscape is insecure and should not be
	trusted."
