Uni, if you're so overwhelmingly and absolutely incensed with Netscape, why 
don't you write to Jim Clark yourself and tell him about his spinelessness and 
all your other opinions of him, his unaccceptable attitude, and his worthless 
company, instead of getting granular with Jim and Dan here on the list?

After all, Jim Clark is the one who made the unpleasant statements.
