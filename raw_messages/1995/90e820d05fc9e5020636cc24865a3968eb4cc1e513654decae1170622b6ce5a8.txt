This assumes the find command actually works ;) Find doesn't follow
symbolic links, which renders it mostly useless.  It doesn't follow
symbolic links to avoid falling in a infinite cycle.

Of course, any second year computer science student can devise an
algorithm that follows symbolic links and detects when it is in a
cycle, to escape.

The unix philosophy "small is beautiful" <--> "when faced with a choice,
cop out and take the easy route"

This is all well documented in "The Unix Hater's Guide."

How would I go around undeleting a file under Unix?  It's easy on the
Mac.  Doing it under DOS is ugly, but it works.  But with unix, there
is no way.  More productivity has been lost because of accidental
erasure under unix than was lost dealing with the internet worm, than
all security breaches combined.
