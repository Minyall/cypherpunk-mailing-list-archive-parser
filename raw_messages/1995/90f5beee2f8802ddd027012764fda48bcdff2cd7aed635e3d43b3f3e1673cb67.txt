By "disregarding the quantum properties", I assume you are asking about
deterministic cryptosystems. Eve does not have sufficient information if 
Alice and Bob use, say, Diffie-Hellman key exchange (DH). As I said, that's
why DH is so clever. :)  (cf. any good crypto text)  But that's patented
(for now), and we were asked about a patent-free solution.
