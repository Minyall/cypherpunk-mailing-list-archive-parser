Tim May says that having govt == root is a step down the slippery slope.
If we say that others can set themselves up as root too, and that
web-of-trust is not prohibited, but that CAs which take part in the
govt-as-root hierarchy get some advantages (liability caps, primarily),
what are the dangers? 

National ID cards is one possibility (key becomes a functional ID).
Others?
