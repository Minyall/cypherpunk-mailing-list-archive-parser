This is something I got off the Idea Futures computers list.
(The Fact claim is that a 512 bit number will be factored by '97)
I don't know if the following address has been posted here before.

A team at Bellcore seems to be planning to try and make the claim Fact true.
See this web page, and the forward in particular:

   http://kayak.npac.syr.edu:2008/ 

They plan to use the web to allow lots of machines to easily participate.
They will start with a 130-digit number and work their way up to the
155-digit number required to satisfy the claim.

Will they succeed by the end of '97?  A crypto expert friend of mine
claims their chances are 90%.  I have bet accordingly.
