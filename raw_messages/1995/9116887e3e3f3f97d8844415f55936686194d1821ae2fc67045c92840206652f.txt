No, this is too small a community for such tools to exist
off-the-shelf. Start with the standard mix papers, mentioned here
often. Also, Hal Finney made a first stab at a more careful
calculation of just how well remailer's do their job...this was about
half a year ago, as I recall.

The goal for whom? I find IRC a waste of time, so "anonymous
audivisual" is not even on my radar screen of things of interest. I
think it's >10 years off.

Think market. I don't see anyone paying for this until costs drop
dramatically.
