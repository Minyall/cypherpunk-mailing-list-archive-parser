I'm a bit uncomfortable about the hardwiring of a particular remailer into
the chain, according to the Web page:

	"Select your remailers [...] Your mail will be automatically sent
	 to the remailer hfinney@shell.portal.com and at least one other
	 remailer that you choose."

(Nothing personal, Hal :)

Why was this done ?
