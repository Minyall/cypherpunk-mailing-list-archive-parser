No, basically the idea is that each stamp covers an average number of 
remailer hops.  The remailer ops get together, with counts of their ins and 
outs to each other, and split some fraction of the stamp prices accordingly. 
 They can even determine the average number of hops given the in/out counts. 
 Fairly simple, actually.
