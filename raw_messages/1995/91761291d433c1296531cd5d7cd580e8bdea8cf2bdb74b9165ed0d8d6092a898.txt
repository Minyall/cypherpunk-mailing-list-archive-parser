Thats one of a number of reasons why the DNS dynamic update facility
has been created.

What makes you assume we are using hosts as the keyed endpoints in the

difficult until humans all come equipped with implanted radio
transmitters. See "The Presidents Analyst" for a possible solution to
that problem, but I prefer DNS :-)
