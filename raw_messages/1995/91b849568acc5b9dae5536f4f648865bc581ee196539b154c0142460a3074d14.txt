Central point software faced this problem.

So they made the encryption features of their product a free
add on, and posted it on bulleting boards with instructions
not to download unless you were an American citizen.

Needless to say these instructions were ignored, surprise 
surprise.

Of course this strategy only works if your product is
useful without encryption, and the add on is of limited
use without your product.

I believe that Kevin Welch decided on this strategy.
