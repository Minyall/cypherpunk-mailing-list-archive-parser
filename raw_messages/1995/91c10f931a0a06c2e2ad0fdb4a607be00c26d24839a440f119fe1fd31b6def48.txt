I took it to mean that they were saying that an approved program on one end
of a communication exchange could not exchange encrypted messages or
established an encrypted session of some kind with an un approved program on
the other end.  Not trying to outlaw superencryption (PGP on both ends using
a GAKed channel) but GAK on one end working with an unapproved system on the
other end.  A ringer GAK-work-alike that would defeat the intent of GAK.

I don't know if the government can prevent that with a software-only system
or indeed if half a secure system can be made completely secure.
