Doh, the wordwrap on that message was ugly. Sorry. Gotta spend some more
time making friends with Private Idaho. 

Short version: remailer@ideath.goldenbear.com is gone forever, sorry. All
mail to anything @goldenbear.com is bouncing. Mail for me should be sent to
"gbroiles@netbox.com", effective immediately. I have distributed a new PGP
key to the keyservers and marked my old key obsolete. I will be signing list
messages again once I get that wordwrap thing fixed.
