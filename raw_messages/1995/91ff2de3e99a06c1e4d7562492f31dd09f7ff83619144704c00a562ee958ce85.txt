The real concern is this:

Bob gives his key to alice.

The cops walk into alice's place and 'convince' alice to turn the key 
over whithout a warant.  Perhaps alice is more susceptible to 
persuasion because of some external reasons.  Alice does, Bob has no privacy
interest in the key, Bob can no longer argue that it is protected under 
the 4th amendment.

Now let's get more sinister.

The cops mysteriously 'find' the key somewhere without a warrant.
Bob cannot argue that the key should be surpressed on the basis of the 
4th amendment because he gave it to Alice, and thus clearly it's not 
information he was interested in protecting.  (This is assuming the cops 
didn't violate other areas, or break into a house or something, or that 
if they did, that the court will find out about it).

That's the rationale.

Indeed.
