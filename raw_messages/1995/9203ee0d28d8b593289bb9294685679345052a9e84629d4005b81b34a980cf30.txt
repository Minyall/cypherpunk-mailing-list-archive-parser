It is true, I swear <g>

I am a Mac person. UNIX is pretty far from the Mac OS. Nonetheless, I am
about to buy a cheap 486 (any recomendations?) on which I will install
FreeBSD to run an Internet server. Once Apple will officially relase their
dirt cheap multi-processor servers that run A/UX only, I'll probably buy
one of those. Why am I getting a UNIX machine? Because there is nothing out
there in world of operating systems that does the job as well as UNIX when
it comes to networking.
