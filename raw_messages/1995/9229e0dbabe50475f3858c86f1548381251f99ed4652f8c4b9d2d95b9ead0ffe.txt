When Netcom slows down, this is not because the asshole in charge
is being an asshole.

He may well be an asshole, but the size of netcom protects
me from having to discover this.

This is good for my mental health.

You are totally full of shit.

Mike Horwath was arrogant and unprofessional.  

The problems you describe with Netcoms service are entirely
accurate.  I am looking for better solution. Submitting to 
the authority of an arrogant and incompetent fool does not
seem like a good solution.

He is plainly a fool, because if I had acted as he has acted,
I would certainly not post this all over the place.

Until he posted, I had assumed that Carol was having a hissy fit,
that she was premenstrual or something.

Now I see why she is upset.
