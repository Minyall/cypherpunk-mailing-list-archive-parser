You are right...  Given talks Ive had with Brian LaMacchia, who broke
a version of "Secure SunRPC" (a 192-bit prime), he claims that the
difficulty is reducing a D-L problem is about the same amount of
computation to factorize an RSA modulus of approximately the same
size..

So, within napkin-computation, you are correct.
