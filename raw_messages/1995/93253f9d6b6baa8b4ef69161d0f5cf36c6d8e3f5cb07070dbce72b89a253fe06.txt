I'm looking for add-in cards that implement DES and/or RSA
for either a PC (ISA/EISA/whatever) or a Sun (S-Bus),
preferably a Sun. Also, the RSA card would need to implement
a 1024 bit modulus.

Any tips or pointers? I've got the list of chip makers in
_Applied Cryptography_, but the ones I've contacted so far
don't seem to know anything about cards, even if they admit
that they have the chips.

Thanks,

Doug
