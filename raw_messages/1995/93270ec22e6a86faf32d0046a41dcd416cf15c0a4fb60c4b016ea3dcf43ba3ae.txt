Would PGP on CD-ROM truely gaurantee a corrupt/virus free executable? A 
virus already running in memory could tamper with what it's doing, 
perhaps extracting the necessary keys and dumping them to a log file.
This would be especially dangerous on a UNIX system where many people 
might be using PGP, thinking it is secure.

I think the only way to be safe is to actually boot up off of the CD-ROM, 
and hope that the hardware in your computer physically hasn't been 
tampered with :)
