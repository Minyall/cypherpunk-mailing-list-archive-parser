This list might usefully be supplemented by an electronic censorship 
law review as the two issues are inextricably intertwined.  There is a news 
piece in the 20th July issue of NATURE saying that in the UK, the Lord 
Chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern will be floating draft legislation 
to protect ISP's from defamation actions brought about by posts from 
their users.  Mackay's Defamation Bill does not address USENET and 
moderated discussion groups apparently.  Do our UK-centric readers have 
any more details on the proposals?
