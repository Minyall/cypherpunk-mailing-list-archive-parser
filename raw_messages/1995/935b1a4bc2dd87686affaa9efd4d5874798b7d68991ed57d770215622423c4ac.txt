I have a small linux box doing 1000 keys per second.  I had to 
re-download the brloop and brclient, cuse when I viewed them on the WWW 
page and attempted ot save them I forgo that Lynx will truncate soem 
lines, leaving me with some errors.  I got complete correct versions an 
the box is chugging away.
