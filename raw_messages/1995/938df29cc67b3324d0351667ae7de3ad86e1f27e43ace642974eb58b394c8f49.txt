I disagree, one can use e-mail to steal.  E-mail consumes resources,
resources for which the sender may have no right to use.  If the sender
is sending messages which the recipient does not wish to receive then
his resources are being taken.  If the recipient has now way of stopping
the messages then the recipients resources are being taken against the
recipient's will and the recipient should be able to have the messages
stopped before they consume the recipients resources.
