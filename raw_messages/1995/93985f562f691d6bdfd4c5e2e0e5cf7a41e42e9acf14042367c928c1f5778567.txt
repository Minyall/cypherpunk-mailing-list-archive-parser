Does any facility current exist to allow people to create anonymous
web pages? After anonymous email and anonymous news postings, this is
an obvious next step.

It seems that it would be a fairly simple matter to write a program
that would accept email containing a web page and the destination URL,
do some checking, and then create (or update) the requested page.
Require signatures and allow receiving mail via a remailer chain, and
you've got secure anonymous web pages.

The hard part would be finding a site that would be willing to serve
anonymous pages. I don't understand the politics at various sites that
allow anonymous remailers: maybe this isn't much harder?
