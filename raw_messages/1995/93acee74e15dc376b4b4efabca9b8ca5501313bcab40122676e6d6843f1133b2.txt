I just had a view into the alt.religion.scientology and
alt.clearing.technology newsgroups. There are some messages
about a Scientology decision to shut down every internet traffic
about Scientology. If the messages are true, Scientology sent 
rmgroup Control messages to remove the groups. 

The request to stop the remailers seems to come from the
same people...
