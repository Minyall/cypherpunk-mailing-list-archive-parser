   Perhaps it's my libertarian outlook, perhaps not, but I tend to abhor 
using the US government's ``legal'' system for almost any reason.  

   The worst thing about doing this (suing them), IMHO, is that if you 
lost you would create a precedent for all the people who aren't doing it 
because they might consider it illegal or immoral -- far too many people 
consider things that the court okays to be morally okay.  

   Instead, I think it's a great stimulus for better software - there's 
no reason to sue them when it'd be a better thing for the community if 
newsreaders and mailreaders were enhanced to deal with spams.
