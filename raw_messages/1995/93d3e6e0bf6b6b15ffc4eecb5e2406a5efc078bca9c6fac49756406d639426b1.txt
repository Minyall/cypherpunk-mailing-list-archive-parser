Basically they are going to set up a web site to act as a clearing
house for security related breaches.

On particular thing they will do is:

1) Hosting a web site where a user with any broswer can find out if
   their browser is secure. List security problems associated with
   that browser. "basically a self diagnostic center"

That will be done by tues.
