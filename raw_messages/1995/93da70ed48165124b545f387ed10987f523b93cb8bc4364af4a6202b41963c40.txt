Peter Gutmann has an interesting article in sci.crypt, demonstrating how
weak Microsoft's encryption is with basic access control in Windows for
Workgroups (I'm assuming Win95 uses the same algorithm).  Essentially, he
shows how a 32-bit key is created to be passed to RC4 for encrypting .PWL
files.  I think a t-shirt is definitely in order for this.

Anyone up for writing some bruting code?
