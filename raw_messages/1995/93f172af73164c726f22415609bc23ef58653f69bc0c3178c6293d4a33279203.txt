	No.  Banning strong crypto will not help; those darn furriners
are using it anyway.  What it will mean is that the Information
Infrastructure of the future will bypass the United States, as without
strong cryptography, it is impossible to build a secure architechture.

	Should the United States wish to relagate itself to the status
of a third world nation becuase of terrorists, druge dealers, child
pornorgaphers and money launderers, that is indeed unfortunate.
