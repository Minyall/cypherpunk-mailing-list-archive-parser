I was impressed with the slant of this essay.  I remember another article
on different forms of digital cash in Popular Science where the author mentions
ecash and the only thing said about it was that it could aid drug-traffickers.
I was glad to see the article in Scientific American that gives the positive
side of ecash.  It did seem from some of the responces to the Popular Science
article that most people disagreed with the author's point of view on 
anonymous digital cash.
