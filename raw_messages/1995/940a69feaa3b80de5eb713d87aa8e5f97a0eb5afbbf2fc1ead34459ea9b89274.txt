Without belaboring the point too much, I think there are a few
conclusions that really ought to be drawn:

-- The world has never seen unbreakable encryption software, and almost
certainly never will.  Nothing that human beings ever build is perfect.

-- Any encryption-based scheme is only as strong as its weakest link.
Generally, you don't know what the weakest link will turn out to be.

-- Basing a global financial infrastructure on the unbreakability of a
certain algorithm or program is at best imprudent.  Bear in mind that
people as well respected as Dr. Adelman -- the "A" in RSA -- are hard at
work trying to figure out how, for example, to use massive parallelism
to break the basic algorithms of public key cryptography.

-- Keeping sensitive financial information completely off the net is
always best, whether or not you are using encryption.

fully operational for nearly a year, with over 30,000 paying customers,
