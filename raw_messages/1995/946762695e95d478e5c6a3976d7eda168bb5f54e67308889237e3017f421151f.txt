OK, I'll try again. First, as I recall, SECRET clearance 
is actually not very high: when I got it, I had to answer 
a bunch of questions (do you abuse illegal drugs? are 
you now or have you ever been a member of any 
organizations? have you ever been _arrested_ for anything?) 
----------------------
	I suspect I know what organizations they're interested in (CPUSA et
al), but did they ask about any specific organizations?
