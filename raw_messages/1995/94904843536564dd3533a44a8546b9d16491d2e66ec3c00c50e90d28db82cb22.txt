Wanted to save my 'me too' until a time I could piggy-back it onto something a
little more pithy (and I DO mean 'little'). Robert, thanks for taking the time
and energy for filtering cpx and forwarding the best. David, thanks for
providing the forum. Now that  _that's_  out of the way ...

I've just been handed a registration booklet for The Bank Administration
Institute's Retail Delivery '95 conference December 2-6 in Atlanta. Notable
speakers include The Bill, MasterCard CEO Eugene Lockhart, Visa International
CEO Edmund Jensen, Intuit CEO Scott Cook and Checkfree CEO Pete Kight (among
others).

Featured on page 6 is a "Fireside Chat: The Financial Marketplace of the
Future" moderated by Lou Dobbs... How warm and fuzzy. What really caught my eye
was a panel discussion on Internet Security scheduled for that Wednesday. The
panelists are David Chaum, Cybercash CEO William Melton, and FV CEO Lee Stein.

If anyone goes, tell us all how it went!

Kicker -  the postal frank is of the "non-profit organization" variety.
