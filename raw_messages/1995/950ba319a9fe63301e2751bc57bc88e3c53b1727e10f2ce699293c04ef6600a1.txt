Here it is possible to walk into a suitably equipped police station, put your
fingertips on a sensor pad and a few seconds, if records exist, have the appear
on the computer screen. Extrapolating this it isnt a big step for a patrol
car, already equipped with a packet radio link to HQ and a data terminal,
scan in your fingerprint and check it. If the system was offline they could
easily take your rpint and compare it to that on your license. It's just a
little more proof that the license is linked to you.
