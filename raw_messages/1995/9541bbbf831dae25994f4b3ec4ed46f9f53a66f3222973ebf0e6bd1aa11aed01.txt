>If speed is really a concern, you could do a 640 or 768 bit modulus

Hilarie suggested exactly this in private mail, and I've agreed. I'm
going to generate a 768-bit optional modulus.

Bill has also suggested a killer 4096-bit modulus for the truly
paranoid. Not sure my poor 32MB P90 can handle that without thrashing
its guts out, but I'll give it a try.
