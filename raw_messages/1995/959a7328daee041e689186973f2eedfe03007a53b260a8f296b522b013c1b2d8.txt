I don't think this will work. When you

> if ( (Pfp = fopen(Pfilename, "wb") ) == NULL)

the file will be truncated. Subsequent writes could be anywhere on the
platter; you're building a new file.

I think you can work this way if you open the file for read/write
access, although I'd be more inclined to take the file name into the
directory and then walk the inodes.
