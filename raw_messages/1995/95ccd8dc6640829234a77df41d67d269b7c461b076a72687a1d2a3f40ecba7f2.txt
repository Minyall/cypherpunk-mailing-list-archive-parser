Mark,
	I saw your message on Cypherpunks List and noticed that you were 
using WinEudora. My question is do you know of a program that will do 
encryption with PGP on the fly within Windows. 
	I know how to encrypt a file and attach it to a message. And I 
have both WinPGP 2.6 and WinPGP 1.0. Both only encrypt files. Any help 
would greatly be appreciated. Thanks in Advance....
