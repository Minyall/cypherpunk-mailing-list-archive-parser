Jon Bentley's column in this month's Unix Review talks about protecting
data.  As with all this columns, it's short but manages to touch on a
large number of issues; in this case, using page faults to guess passwords,
threat models, and so on.

Upside, "The Business Magazine for the Technology Elite" (http://www.upside.com)
has an interview with Jim Clark that took place two weeks before the IPO.
He discusses in a couple of places how using crypto over the Internet is
critical for businesses that can't afford private nets, and how this is
an important part of their business plan.

(Prof Froomkin:  Upside also has an article on "ITEF infighting" you might
want to read.)
