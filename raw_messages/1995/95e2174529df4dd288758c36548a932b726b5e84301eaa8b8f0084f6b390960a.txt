Right, but it's a kind of vicious circle. What I meant about cryptanalysis
not really be "academic" is that not much status attaches to having broken
a specific message.

I guess this is my bias, as I think of the "differential cryptanalysis" as
not really being cryptanalysis :-}. In the sense that it's basic research
unto itself, not the grungy cracking of an actual cipher.

But you're right that the stuff on Wiener's estimates for a DES-cracking
machine, on the differential cryptanalysis work, etc., _does_ make it into
Crypto. Ditto for breaking ciphers (showing them to be flawed). I just
never see papers describing actual attacks on specific systems...maybe
those who do such things are talking?

I guess the bottom line of what I'm saying is that if some person or group
wants to be a "tiger team" to try to find flaws in PGP, to try to break it,
this would be a nifty thing. I doubt anyone on this list disagrees.
