	I never disputed that subverting the DNS system would affect the
ability to use numeric IP addresses, just IP names.  But knowing that
there are multiple 'root' DNS servers makes me a bit more comfortable.
But only a little bit - despite my being one of what is generally
referred to as the 'religious right', the pro-censorship tendencies of
the political 'leaders' pandering to it makes me very uncomfortable (the
"and when they came to censor me, no one was left to protest" concept
[with apologies to the writer of the original version referring to the
Holocaust]).
