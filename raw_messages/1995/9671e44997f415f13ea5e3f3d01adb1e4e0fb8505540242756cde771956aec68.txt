I'm glad you brought that up.  Having contributed some questions myself, I
was hoping to get some kind of feedback.  I didn't expect transcripts of any
top-secret meetings or anything, but the whole subject seems to have fallen
into a black hole; we don't even know whether the meetings ever took place.

If possible, it would be great to hear at least general reactions to at
least some of the questions and issues we raised.

John, did anything ever come of this?  Do you have any info at all?
