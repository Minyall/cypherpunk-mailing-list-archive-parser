A real good book with a fair amount of details is Peter Wright's great
book "Spycatcher". The clueless media concentrated on Wright's allegation
that Sir Roger Hollis, head of MI5 was a Soviet mole or the "5th Man"
of the Philby, Burgess, Maclean & Blunt spyring. Now Wright may have been
in Jesus Angleton's psychotic "wilderness of mirrors" too long, but he
did a lot of bugging & stuff w/ GCHQ & he spends a great deal of his book
talking about precisely the Venona decrypts. Briefly there was some reuse
of "one time pads". He gives a fair amount of detail, & I suspect this is
why HRM Govt. was so displeased, the supposed "embarrassment" of the
allegations against long dead Sir Roger being just a cover story & much
easier for the tabloids & general public to understand.
