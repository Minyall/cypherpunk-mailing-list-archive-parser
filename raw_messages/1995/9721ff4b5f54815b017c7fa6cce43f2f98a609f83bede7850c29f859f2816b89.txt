Luckily, a lot of cryptographic materials are available outside the
United States (see e.g. http://www.cs.hut.fi/crypto for pointers).

If the United States chooses to restrict export of IP security
products, it simply helps create a flourishing network security
and other communications industry in other countries.  There are
already several implementations of the IP security stuff abroad -
including at least one in the former Soviet Union.
