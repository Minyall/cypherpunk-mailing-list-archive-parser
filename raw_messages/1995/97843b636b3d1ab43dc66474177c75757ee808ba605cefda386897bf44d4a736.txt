   NZ Telecom are conducting an experiment with using phonecards in
   softdrink vending machines.  There was an article in The Dominion
   newspaper's _InfoTech_ magazine crying out for the Government to stop
   it, claiming Telecom's creating an independant (from the Reserve Bank)
   currency, will destroy the New Zealand economy, etc., etc.

Sounds like your basic central banking ignorance.

Look folks, just so y'all don't look like idiots, remember this: A
means of payment is not the same thing as a currency.
