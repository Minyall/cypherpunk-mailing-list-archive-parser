I am entirely sympathetic to the judges, but obviously we need
to keep an eye on them.

Their attempt to restrict circulation of their FAQ fails to
inspire confidence.  It is supiciously reminiscent of 
what the Church of Scientology is up to.

But I repeat, I think that the judges list is necessary
and desirable, so long as they remember they are self
appointed and do not start to imagine that they are
the "official" judges.
