Greetings,
 

The only way for E-Mail Privacy on the internet is - 
ENCRYPTION.  You don"t have to be an Internet Expert to 
understand that data which is not encrypted is open for every 
one.
 

On Oct. 20 1995 Andy Jonson-Laird <andy@jli.com> sent a most 
interesting data to the list concerning that the user has 
absulutly no control ever how the data is routed. A Mail that 
he sent to an address which is at the distance of 11 miles 
actualy did 1200 miles.
 

It may be  " The end of days vision" that privacy will be 
maintained without encryption. With the ongoing danger from the 
Cypherpunks, we must use very strong Algorithms. A French 
"algorithms cracker" recommended not long ago that the 
commercial sector have to use not less than 128 bytes based 
algorithms.
 

I will appreciate to receive list members opinion.
