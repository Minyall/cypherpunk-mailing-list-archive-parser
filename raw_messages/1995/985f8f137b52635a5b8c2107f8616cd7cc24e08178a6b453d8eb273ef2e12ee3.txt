This thread illustrates (at least if setup's like this are
worthy of a place in Raph's list) that penet.fi is the safest
way to go for the moment. I would just hate it to have my
head on the plate of a remailer operator who takes an interest
in subtile ethical discussion of whether to sell me out or not.
