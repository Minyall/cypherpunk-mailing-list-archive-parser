Not my mistake - iw@all.net's mistake - only my correction.  And it
wasn't a correction to an error in this forum - the error appeared in
the Risks forum - the Cypherpunks posting (which I posted) was the
corrected one.  Am I supposed to correct mistakes in other forums made
by other people when I post to Cypherpunks?  (let me see... in 1928, a
mistake was made on page 73 of the New York Times related to cryptography, ...)

Even with only 4 years of service (after graduating from College), 25-27
years old is no longer whizzkid age in my book.  But even more
importantly, the readers who commented on this one error ignored the
main body of facts in the posting in favor of creating a conspiracy
theory.  Next we find out from yet another story that at least part of
the original story posted to Risks was in error.  According to the
second independent source, the Captain was working with the Navy's
support and knowledge.  How much do you want to bet that the story
changes again by Tuesday?
