Dear Alex, 

We have all the web pages. They should be moving to spring.com shortly.

It's kinda sad that they bootleg off my net.web.goodwill, as My pages are
are at the 200+ access count and rising level per day. The Webbittown pages
will remedy this in the not too distant future. (PGP encoded HTML)

They should be down by the end of the day.

Love Always,

Carol Anne
