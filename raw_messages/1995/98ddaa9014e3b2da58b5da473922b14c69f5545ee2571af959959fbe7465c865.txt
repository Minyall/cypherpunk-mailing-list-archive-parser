SA is effectively cancelled out by using differential GPS
(Using a correction transmitter to send out differences
between GPS as-reported position and actual position).

However, any 'home made cruise missile' would need to
be fairly slow moving and manoevring. One of the features
of p-Code is support for 'high-dynamic' vehicles.

I've been away from the navigation field for some years,
so others may know more. Does the Russian Glonass system
have SA?
