They always did that, without even giving away T-shirt since they
released the first beta version to world. As long as people enjoy
playing for free with a product and give feed back and see the program
improved... why would it stop ? 
Personally, though I prefer free products (but ppl have to get some
money for a living....), I think it is not that bad an idea, and
I trust lot of people will continue to do it for the fun of it {As
long as the company is *really* listening to reports....}
