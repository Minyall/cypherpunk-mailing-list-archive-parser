One reason why Alice might not want to use PGP would be that posession
of the secret key would be ipso facto evidence that he is Alice.

Who to believe: at that stage, Alice will simply cease to exist.
The key will be revoked and Alice will be no more. A new Alice may
or may not arise, but no-one will know if it's the same one.

If Alice is afraid of loss of identity (as if he had one now),
he could have a permanent key at home (where he does his OTP work),
and on his e-mail machine have only a temporary key. When the key
on the public machine is compromised, it is revoked and a new one
is issued.

(The same can be done with real-name keys, BTW; viz my own key.)

In this case I think we are all stuffed.
