There is absolutely no difficulty obtaining cryptographic aparatus outside the 
US. I had an entire distribution of PEM and X500 that was entirely written 
outside the US.

DES is avaliable from many sources, there are many tripple DES products 
avaliable.

It is not impossible to get export licenses, there have been several issued for 
DES for financial applications.

If the US wants to be cut out of the market for financial services software 
thats up to them. Non US citizens can write crypto code as well, the British 
crypto tradition is far longer than the US one for example.
