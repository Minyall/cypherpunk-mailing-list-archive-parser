I've heard that Digital, HP, and IBM have all mandated that all security
code (except keymgmt and other things that are out of scope) must go
through the GSSAPI:  no writing your own stuff.  I heard, less
authoritatively, that Microsoft has the same rules, except they use a
FunnyLookingVariant(far) of an earlier GSSAPI draft.
