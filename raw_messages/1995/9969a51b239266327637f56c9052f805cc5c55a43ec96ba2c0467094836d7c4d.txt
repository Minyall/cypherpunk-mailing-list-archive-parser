Safe-TCL comes from a different starting place.  For example, the original
intent was to actually remove all the dangerous operations such as
file manipulation.  As Perry's explained, this is different, and better,
then just having the run-time "guarantee" that all file I/O is in a
"Safe" place.

Claimer:  I invented safe-tcl, started by creating a mailing list with
Ousterhout and Borenstein.  Disclaimer:  I walked away in disgust with
the announcement of "enabled mail" so they may have broken things.
