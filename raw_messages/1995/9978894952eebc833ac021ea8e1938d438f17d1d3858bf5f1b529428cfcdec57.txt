	ecash provides full payor anonymity. Payee anonymity is
currently not possible, but that is being worked on. 
----------------
	That's what I said; "non-privacy to the sender" is lack of payee
anonymnity. This lack is problematic for me personally in two respects:
	First, there is that, as I have stated, I would like to be a payee at
some point. My likelihood of doing so is decreased if I do not have an
anonymnity option.
	Second, services that I might like to utilize are less likely to be
available if the anonymnity of the provider is not guaranteed.
