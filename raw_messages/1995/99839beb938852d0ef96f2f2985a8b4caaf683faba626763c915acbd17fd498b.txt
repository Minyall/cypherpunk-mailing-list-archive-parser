DOES YOUR BOSS KNOW WHERE YOU'RE SURFING?

The SIMBA Media daily reported recently that a Maryland-based software
publisher called Charles River Media has introrduced a $30 electronic fink
program called "Internet Watchdog" that keeps an eye on where you've been
hanging out on the Net.  the program doesn't block or censor sites, but it
does maintain a handy record of cyber-footprints that the parent, teacher
or employer who controls your Net access can peruse.

Anyone know more about this program?
