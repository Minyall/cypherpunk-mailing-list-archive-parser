Geoff Duncan has written an article about the Netscape security
breach in TidBITS, an e-zine for Mac owners. Copies are available
at: 

ftp://ftp.tidbits.com/pub/tidbits/issues/1995/TidBITS#297_02-Oct-95.etx

The above version is formatted using Setext. HTML and text/plain
versions are also available. Mr. Young? Perhaps this could go into
the library?

Seems fair, if critical, and c2.org gets a mention.
