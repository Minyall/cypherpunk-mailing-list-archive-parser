    What is it precisely that you might want to encapsulate that MIME
    can't encapsulate?

And in what way does MIME encapsulation aid in the privacy goals of
remailing?

It seems far more likely to require that you expose information which
you might prefer not to expose, much as the Privacy Enhanced Mail
standard does.
