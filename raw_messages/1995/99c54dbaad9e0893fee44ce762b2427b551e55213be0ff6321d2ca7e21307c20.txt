You're forgetting our good friends the libel laws. Another reason to go anon.
You have the right to say whatever you please, but you'll have to be able 
to defend it in court if it damages someone's reputation. It can also get 
you fired. (or shot if you're MLK) 

This is why It'd be so nice to see more idiot-friendly remailer clients
on windoze, or even better Java (does Private Idaho support Mixmaster yet?).
The average person can really benefit from easy anonymity, otherwise they 
won't bother and get in hot water.

Slander is in the eye of the beholder.
