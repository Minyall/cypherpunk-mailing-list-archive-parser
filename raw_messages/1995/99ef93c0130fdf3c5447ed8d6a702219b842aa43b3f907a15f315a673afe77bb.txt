     For those of us sitting behind a firewall that blocks out all of the 
     alt, rec, etc.. newsgroups...is there another way to access these 
     groups?  For example, redirecting the contents of alt.2600 to, say, 
     comp.2600 (because this firewall allows the comp.xxx groups through).  
     Or any other hacks around this inconvenience?
