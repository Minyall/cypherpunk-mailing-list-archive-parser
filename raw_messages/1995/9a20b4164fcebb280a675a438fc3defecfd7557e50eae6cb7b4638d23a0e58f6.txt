Internet-Drafts are available by anonymous FTP to ds.internic.net in the
directory internet-drafts.  Other places, too -- don't ask me, tho; for
questions, please mail to Internet-Drafts@cnri.reston.va.us.

The first two seem interesting even if SKIP has no future in IPng.
The last is useful because I keep pushing GSSAPI as a standard crypto
API. :)
       Title     : Encoding of an Unsigned Diffie-Hellman Public Value     
       Author(s) : A. Aziz, T. Markson, H. Prafullchandra

It is useful to be able to communicate public keys in the absence of a 
certificate hierarchy and a signature infrastructure.  This document 
describes a method by which certificates which communicate Diffie-Hellman 
public values and parameters may be encoded and securely named.            

							
       Title     : Certificate Discovery Protocol                          
       Author(s) : A. Aziz, T. Markson, H. Prafullchandra
       Filename  : draft-ietf-ipsec-cdp-00.txt
       Pages     : 13
       Date      : 12/22/1995
Use of Public key cryptography is becoming widespread on the Internet in 
such applications as electronic mail and IP Security (IPSEC).  Currently, 
however, a common public key certificate infrastructure does not exist 
which is interoperable with other systems and ubiquitous.  In light of 
this, we describe a protocol which may be used to exchange or retrieve 
certificates (essentially signed public keys) with or from another entity. 
The protocol may be used to request certificates from a directory/name 
server or from the entity who owns the certificate.                        

       Title     : The Simple Public-Key GSS-API Mechanism (SPKM)          
       Author(s) : C. Adams
       Filename  : draft-ietf-cat-spkmgss-05.txt
       Pages     : 42
       Date      : 12/22/1995
This specification defines protocols, procedures, and conventions to be 
employed by peers implementing the Generic Security Service Application 
Program Interface (as specified in RFCs 1508 and 1509) when using the 
Simple Public-Key Mechanism.
