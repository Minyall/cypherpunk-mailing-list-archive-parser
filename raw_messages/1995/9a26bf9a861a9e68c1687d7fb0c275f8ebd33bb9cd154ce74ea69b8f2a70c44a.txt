My reward would be the satisfaction of showing M$ code to be the substandard,
elitist, money grubbing and dictatorial junk it is. The size of their payroll
should not be the reason they want to be able to dictate what programs Joe
Deskset runs on the internet.

I can see the progression where their CC transportation software is coupled
with a Registration Wizard to automatically purchase any software on your HD
that they have no record of you purchasing... "just in case and as a service
on your behalf".
