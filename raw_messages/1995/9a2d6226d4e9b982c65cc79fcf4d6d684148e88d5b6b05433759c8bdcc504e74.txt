Wow! I think Ted just hit on something that could be used to quickly derail
the "V-chip":

I agree, of course, about it not being the role of government/FCC/etc. to
mandate such ratings, such chips, etc.

However, to help derail this V-chip being mandated, what if we (I mean
activists, writers of columns, etc.) "insisted" that _commercials_ be
similarly labelled?

"Yes, if violence and sex is to be "voluntarily rated," we think that
commercial advertising ought to be similarly rated."

It might be hard for the legislators to avoid the logic of this.
Advertisers, fearing people would of course mute the commercials, would
then quietly urge them to drop the whole idea.
