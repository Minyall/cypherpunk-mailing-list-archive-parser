What's wrong with young, curious eLiTiStS running storing sites for
mutual benefits ('warez')? Some say copyright is dead. Others have
taken this to their hearts, especially for private use, and I don't
blame them. Copyrighted data on a server in a jurisdiction that
doesn't acknowledege the copyrights - a prime use for Data Havens
when they come of age.
