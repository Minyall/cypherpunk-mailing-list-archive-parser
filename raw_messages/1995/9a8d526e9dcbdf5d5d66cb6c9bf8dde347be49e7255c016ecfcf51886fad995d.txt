Exactly! We need to point out that crypto is essential to protect us from 
criminals. Some criminials may use crypto technology, just as they use faxes and 
portable phones. But just because a portable phone could be used by a drug 
dealer does not mean they should be illegal.

Jim Bizdos just pinned a rather cool poster to the wall of the 3rd florr coffee 
lounge here at MIT today. It has a woman on a phone labeled "escrow enabled" and 
then the spooks listening in from a post marked "escrow integrity center". The 
motto is "A good Marketing Agency Listens to its Customers - We Hear You!"
