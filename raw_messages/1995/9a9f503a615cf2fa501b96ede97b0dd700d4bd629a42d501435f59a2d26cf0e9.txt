My rule is no binaries, none of the time. Grepping for whitwater and foster
and routing it to /dev/null seems like a good idea too.. And a great big 
*plonk* to our alt.conspiracy friends... Need to learn what a pointer is...

Anyway, my tri-county crime spree for the next weeks will put me in San
Francisco, Alameda, and Orange counties. If anyone wants to mutually sign
keys, email me and I'll try to arrange something.

Unfortunately my cryptoshirt won't arrive in time. I'd be able to wear it
in front of LOTS of illegal aliens. So, to make up for it, I'm going to
export part of the cryptosig: #

Have a nice day.
