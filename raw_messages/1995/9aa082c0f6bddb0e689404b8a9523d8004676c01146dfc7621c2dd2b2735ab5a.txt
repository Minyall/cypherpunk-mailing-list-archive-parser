You know, these fees everybody keeps quoting sound remarkably like the cost
of a modem, the installation of a new phone line, plus a reasonable amount
of profit. So why don't a bunch of you, say in the Bay Area, get together
to get a small subnet, each buy your own pair of modems, pay for the added
phone line, and install the whole shootin' match in Tim's house?
