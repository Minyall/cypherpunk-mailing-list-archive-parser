In response to Chuck and Lucky, I can only say that the Weavers suffered 57%
casualties (4/7) and 28% KIA (2/7).  The Feds suffered .25% KIA (1/400).  I
don't think any Feds were merely wounded.

They brought murder charges against two members of the group and lost.  They
settled wrongful death suits for $3.1 million.  They also lost the publicity
war.  They had to change their procedures because of Ruby Ridge and Waco.
They energized the opposition.

The casualties were unfortunate but when facing force ratios of 57/1 or
better, the outcome has to be considered a major victory for Randy Weaver.
The case is a demonstration of modern conflicts in which litigation and
publicity count as much as guns.  On that field, the Feds don't hold all the
cards.
