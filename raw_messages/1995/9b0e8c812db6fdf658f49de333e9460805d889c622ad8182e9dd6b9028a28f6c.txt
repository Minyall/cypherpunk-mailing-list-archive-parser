It's been noted on this list before that some programs give uid information
out...sendmail comes to mind...this GREATLY narrows the search for a pid.

It requires knowledge of how the stack is set up and of assembler for the
target.  Most people in computer science know at least one assembler and
could easily add enough of another to launch an attack like this.  I did
one once to attack one of my programs as an example for a class.  Please
don't overestimate the difficulty of this attack or underestimate the 
number of folks out there that are qualified to launch it.  It's just that
most of us would rather be writing constructive code:)
