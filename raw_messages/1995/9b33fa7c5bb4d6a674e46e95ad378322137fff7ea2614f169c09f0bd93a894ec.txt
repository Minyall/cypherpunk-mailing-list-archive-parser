If Clipper were mandated you might be able to resist a prosecution for
"failure to file" keys or for double encrypting your transmissions if you
could prove that you were transmitting illegal messages or evidence of a
crime.  Just as those who possess illegal weapons are not required to
register them (self incrimination).  You have to be sure your traffic is
illegal though otherwise no protection.
