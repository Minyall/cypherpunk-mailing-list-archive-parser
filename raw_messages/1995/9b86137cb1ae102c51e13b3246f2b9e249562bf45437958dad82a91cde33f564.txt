This may be old news, but I don't recall seeing it on the list...

In version

		netscape -version

		Netscape 1.1N/export, 20-Apr-95; (c) 1995 Netscape Communications Corp.

I ran 'strings' on the binary, and only got one "about.*security" reference.

entering it as an URL
		
		about:security

yields the ironically humorous (when you consider all of the security bugs):

		Whatchew talkin' 'bout, Willis?
