You are talking about trading mortgage-backed (and other debt-backed)
securities, and what you say can be generalized to bonds and certain
FX contracts as well.  Certainly derivatives often use debt instruments
in their formulation.

This could work, but you are talking about securities markets, which
do this already.  Selling securities over remailers would be sure to
bring down the wrath of moneyed establishment types... :-)

This is the problem.  Government always ends up playing this role,
and so it reserves the right to decide what it is willing to enforce...
classifying the rest as 'gambling' or some other unenforceable debt...
