Actually, it could communicate with a differently-privileged process.
The security gain probably isn't worth the performance hit, though.

(A possible secure channel: Give the password manager a uid of its own.
Have it listen on a unix-domain socket.  The server process opens the
socket, then fstat()s it to make sure it's really owned by the password
manager.)
