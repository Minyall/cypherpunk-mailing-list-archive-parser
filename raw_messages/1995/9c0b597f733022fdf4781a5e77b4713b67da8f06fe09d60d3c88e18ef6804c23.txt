That was me.  And thank you.

For those not tuned in, the subject was obscenity/indecency
on the internet, and the government's attempts to
control it.  I asked if we as list members discussing
the works of a man who gets obscene and indecent on
occassion might be subjected to criminal prosecution
by citing the works to make a point here on the net.

The man arguing for restrictions suggested that
we better make sure this is an adults only board.
The man arguing against the Exon amendment
pointed out that we may not be able to discuss
Pynchon on the net because children might read it,
but anyone can buy it at the bookstore.
He ended up going back to the Pynchon example
to make his point after that.

BTW - I am writing an article on the recent censorship
movements on the e-zine enterzone.  I'll send the
URL and publication dates when I have them.
