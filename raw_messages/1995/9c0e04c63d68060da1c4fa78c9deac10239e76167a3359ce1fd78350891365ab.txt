   It's a nice idea, really.  The problem is - how do you verify the
absolute time?  For instance, by resetting a PC's internal clock
you can instantly circumvent that measure.  Possibly by forcing
the application to consult a "reliable" clock like one of the
cesium clocks, but that could be hacked.
   Unless you can absolutely, reliably, and without fear/danger of
being hacked around, verify the correct time, self-destruct crypto
probably won't happen.
