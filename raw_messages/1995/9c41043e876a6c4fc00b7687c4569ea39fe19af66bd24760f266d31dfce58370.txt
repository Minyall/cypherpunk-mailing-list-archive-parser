I think this is an important and somewhat subtle political move on
the part of the administration.  If they can get at least a few
large businesses (the ones who buy into the key-escrow scheme) on
their side, by making it in their economic interests for everyone
to use escrowed crypto, they will have manufactured some
potentially powerful allies in the computer industry.  Certainly,
once any major company has spent a lot of money to set up a key
escrow facility, they will help lobby *against* any easing of the
requirement to use escrowed crypto, based simply on self-interest.
