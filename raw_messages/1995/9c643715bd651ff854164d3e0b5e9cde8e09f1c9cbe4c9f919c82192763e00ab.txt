	Strange, the military processed a SECRET clearance on me even
before I signed on the dotted line.  Now a TS, that's expensive, but
they didn't have much on me other than my SSAN and, I think, my prints
to process the SECRET, so they couldn't have done much more than run be
through the FBI criminal database.
