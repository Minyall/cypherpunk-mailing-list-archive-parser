In my case, I just opted to moving my crypto business outside the US. 
This is the real result of the crypto policy.  The US is falling behind
the rest of thew world in crypto R+D.  For example, two good crypto
packages for the Internet have been released in the last few months.  I
was engaged in a similar project in the late 80s but abandoned it
because I couldn't export, so the market would not justify the work. 
Now it is owned by people in EC and Australia who are generous enough to
allow those of us in the US to use them.

Of course, I can't post them in info-sec heaven because even imported
crypto software may not be exported, and I cannot adequately detect the
difference between a foreign person using a US site to get the
information and a legitimate US site getting the information for itself. 
In other words, the policy prevents US firms from having better Internet
resources in the info-sec arena.

Right - in other words, nothing can be exported if it produces output
and takes input.  The point is, they want a way to arrest people who are
doing something they don't like.  Philo Zimmerman would almost certainly
win if they ever took him to court, but by harassing him in this more
subtle way, they destroy the impact of PGP in the marketplace, get MIT
to support an official (and perhaps customized for the NSA to have weak
keys) version, and prevent others from following in Phil's footsteps. 
So the strategy works until some brave person risks enough top get past
it.

All true, but as the saying goes:

Representative democracy is a terrible form of government,
but every other form of government we know of is even worse.
