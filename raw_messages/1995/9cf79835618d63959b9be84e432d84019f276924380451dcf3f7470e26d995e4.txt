It does RSA encrypt/decrypt, works with keys up to 1024 bits (and
larger).

You need two utils installed on your machine: perl and dc.  Not having
dc would cause an error on line 3.  Try getting gnu dc (bc-1.03.tar.gz
from gnu sites, see:

	http://www.dcs.ex.ac.uk/~aba/rsa/dc.html
)

To encrypt:

	rsa -k=11 -n=ca1 < plaintext > ciphertext
	
to decrypt:

	rsa -d -k=ac1 -n=ca1 < ciphertext > out

you can extract pgp keys to use with it, that was a 32 bit key for
demonstrational purposes and offers no security.  See:

	http://www.dcs.ex.ac.uk/~aba/rsa/pgpacket.html

for extracting pgp keys in hex format.
