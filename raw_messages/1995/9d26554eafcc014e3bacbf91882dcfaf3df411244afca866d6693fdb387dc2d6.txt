   Yesterday I heard in the radio that someone in America has developed
   some device which darkens the TV screen if there is sex or crime on TV. 

   Does anyone know whether this is true and how it works?

Actually it's licensed from a British manufacturer of sunglasses called
the Peril-Sensitive Sense-O-Matics, which darken rapidly to keep you
from seeing things that might distress you.
