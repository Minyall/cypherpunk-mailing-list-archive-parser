Hi all,

This is of real interest to Austin subscribers only...

It has been over a year since the last real meeting of the Austin
Cypherpunks. I am interested in getting the group back on a regular schedule
and writing code and building hardware. If you share this interest then
please drop me a note at ravage@einstein.ssz.com

I have created a mailing list for the local members and if interested then
send a subscribe austin-cpunks to list@einstein.ssz.com

That is all.
