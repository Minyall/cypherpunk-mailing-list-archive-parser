But statistical tests of randomness alone do not make a good RNG.
At least, not for cryptographic use. A cryptographically secure
RNG is also unpredictable, i.e., computationally unfeasible to
predict the next random bit will be given the algorithm, and not
reliably reproduced, i.e., multiple runs with the exact same input
do not generate the same sequence.
