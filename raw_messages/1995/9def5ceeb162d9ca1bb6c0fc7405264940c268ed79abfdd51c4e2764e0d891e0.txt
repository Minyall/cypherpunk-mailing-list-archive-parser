Tim mentioned that we're planning on spiffing up the cypherpunks web
site (including using a real web server) and the cyphernomicon is an
obvious candidate for inclusion - depending on how many people help out,
the new site (a quasi-mirror at first, till we get sameer/et al's
go-ahead) should be live within a couple weeks.

If you're interested in gathering documents, hacking HTML, or anything
else involved in creating/maintaining a web hierarchy, drop me a line.
The space/delivery of the documents we're providing for free, but I
don't have a budget to hire a staff to do things the "right way" (my way :)
for this project.
