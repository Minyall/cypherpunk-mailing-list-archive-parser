All out espionage should, idealy at least, only take place if there is
evidence that a nations indipendance is directly involved. By this I mean

actively insert agents provocateur.

What are its estimates on what US business gains with its present industrial
espionage infrastructure? Without these numbers the quoted above are
useless.
