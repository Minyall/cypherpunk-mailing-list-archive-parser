How would you want to examine a pentium processor?

Just an idea:

Take the block move instructions and attach a little state machine.
If a certain sequence of bytes is detected, a fuse somewhere on the chip
is burned and the processor could switch irreversible into a mode where
it does partial incorrect calculations. Send someone an email, an IP packet
or an ethernet packet and you can expect the packet to be moved by a
block move command.
