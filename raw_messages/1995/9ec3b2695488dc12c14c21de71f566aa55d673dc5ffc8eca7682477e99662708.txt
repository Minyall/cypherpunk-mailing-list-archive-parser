I specifically mentioned that I had but intermittant access to the list, but I
believe I got the answer netmail.  Unfortunately, it is already outdated, which
is why I am asking again.

Coolio.  Just the thing!

I hope he does it fairly frequently, as these gates seem to have a half-life of

seemed to be stable, but it appears to have locked us all out now.

Thanks for the address!
