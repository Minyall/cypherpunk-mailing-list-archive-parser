I was talking with someone at NSA's NISSC today and he was
talking about Hamilton's support of the gov't in the Whiskey Rebellion.
To voice his support (an unpopular position at the time) he wrote
an article under a pseudonym, had it published in a French paper and
then re-published over here, citing the French paper.

This is the earliest example of an anonymous remailer I've found yet. :-)
