Where the spam was coming from ?

Btw, the web,... application is *great* it is always nice to (appear)
to interact with the real world ! ('cept that when I tried, the only
thing the camera showed was indeed "Strong Crypto" or "Now", it
would'nt let pass one of my messages)
It is a very easy target for abuses though...
Very nice job, keep up !
