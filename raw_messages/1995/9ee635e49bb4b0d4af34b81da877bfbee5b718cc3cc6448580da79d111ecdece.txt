This has nothing to do with crypto, and is only remotely related to 
remailers. However, I thought I'd send it along to demonstrate to our 
conspiracypunks friends how to shorten the length of an off-topic post.

There is a document on alt.security which describes exploitable sendmail
bugs. The reference is <809544856snz@hacknet.demon.co.uk>
I saved a copy in case anyone would like one.

SEE! Now wasn't that easy!
