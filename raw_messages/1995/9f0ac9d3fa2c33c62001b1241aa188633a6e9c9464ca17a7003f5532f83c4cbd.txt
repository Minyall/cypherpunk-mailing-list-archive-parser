In correspondence with someone outside the US regarding ITAR regulations, the remark was made that Jim Bizdos was Greek and not a U.S. citizen.  Is this statement in the same class as an Elvis sighting?  Or if it is true, what impact would ITAR have on foreign nationals working for a US company involved with export restricted crypto?

Please don't get carried away and turn this into a Net rumor.  I'm just curious if anyone on the list can confirm or deny the citizenship comment.

Thomas Jefferson used strong crypto, shouldn't you?
