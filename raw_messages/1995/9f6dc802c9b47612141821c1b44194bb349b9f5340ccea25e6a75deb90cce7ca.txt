I may not have been clear: the certificate I was referring to was the one
from Egghead, the one which I will use to make sure that I have a valid
key for Egghead.  Such a certificate would of course not have my credit
card number; it would probably have some information related to Egghead.
My rhetorical point was that information would most plausibly be a NAME
by which I would refer to Egghead.  I am still trying to understand how
these proposals to take names out of the picture will apply to a
commonplace situation like this one.
