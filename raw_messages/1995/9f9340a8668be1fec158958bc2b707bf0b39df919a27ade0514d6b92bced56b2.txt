For non Dr. Jobbs subscribers:

Dr. Jobbs Journal has several articles on encryption,
including an article by Ian and Dave on the Netscape crack, multiple 
encryption, and using MD5 for passwords.

Also, there is a very interesting article by the author of Applied
Cryptography (the Big Mac himself), looking at differential and linear
cryptoanalysis of the DES algorithm.

There are also some compression articles as well.
