I am one as well.. being pro-2nd amendment, and pro-1st.. and learning 
lots about the fight to protect them. Unlike some of the non-US readers 
in this list, I can see the clear connection between the 1st and 2nd 
amendment attacks.. if one falls, the other does as well. Both are slowly 
being whittled away to nothing (i.e. you can have only certain 
'assault-style' guns, and you can only be guaranteed certain types of 
free speech)
