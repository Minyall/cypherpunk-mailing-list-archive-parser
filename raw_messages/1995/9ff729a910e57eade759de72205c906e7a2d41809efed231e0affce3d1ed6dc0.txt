Don't just look at this bug, though... check ALL your static buffers and
include code to check for overflow writes.  For example, if Netscape is
written in C or C++ and the above code uses strcpy(), you could change
strcpy() to strncpy() everywhere (and then set the last char to null in case
strncpy() didn't).  Your programmers will know what I mean.
