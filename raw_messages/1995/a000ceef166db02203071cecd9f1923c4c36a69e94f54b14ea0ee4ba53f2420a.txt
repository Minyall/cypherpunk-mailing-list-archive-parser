MIT PGP distribution site accessible from Canada

July 29, 1995

MIT is pleased to announce that, after consulting with the US State
Office of Defense Trade Controls, we have clarified procedures that
permit us to make our PGP distribution site accessible from Canada.
We would like to thank ODTC for helping us to make this possible.

People in Canada attempting to download PGP from MIT will be required
to assert that they are Canadian citizens and that they are obtaining
the software for end-use in Canada by Canadian citizens, or for return
to the United States.

You can obtain PGP via the World Wide Web at

        http://web.mit.edu/network/pgp.html

You can also obtain PGP via anonymous FTP to net-dist.mit.edu.
Connect to the directory pub/PGP and get and read the README
file.
