  Given the second possibility, I see no reason to hardwire a
remailer.  It really will make people suspicious!  I can easily
imagine someone deciding not to use that remailer again, just
on general principles.

  And anyway, chaining is not always necessary, especially if
the sender is at a public Web terminal or using an anonymous Web
proxy.  The remailers don't enforce chaining, why should you?
