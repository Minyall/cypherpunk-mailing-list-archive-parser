Norton Utilities has been able to do this for a long time.  I think
the program is called <wipedisk> (wipe "unused" area of a disk), and I
believe there's also a <wipefile> that will obliterate a file.  These
things are supposed to conform to some unspecified "government
guidelines," so you decide how good they are.  My guess is that
they're plenty good enough.
