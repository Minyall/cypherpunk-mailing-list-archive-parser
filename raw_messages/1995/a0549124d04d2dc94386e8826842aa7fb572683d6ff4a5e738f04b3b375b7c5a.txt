Just heard on the 11:30pm NPR news update.  The Clinton Administration
has changed the crypto export policy.  You will now be allowed to
export strong crypto, provided it is a key escrow system.  The
reporter (Dan Charles?) said something like anyone can hold the keys,
as long as they will be made avail when presented with a court order.
He also said, US citizens will still be able to use strong crypto
without key escrow internally.  Terrorists and drug pushers were given
as "reasons."
