Ouch.....!

On Linux:
rsh [huge host name] crashes bad... (file system now corrupted)

The above claims for ping, ftp and finger may be dependent on how
huge is huge.  rsh took a very large number (I'm guessing 10 lines,
800 characters) before crashing.  Huge was not this huge for the
previous tests.

rsh is usually suid root.

I must quit experimenting now.... and repair my system.

Crypto relevance:  little....  some hack relevance, lots of general
                   system/network security relevance
