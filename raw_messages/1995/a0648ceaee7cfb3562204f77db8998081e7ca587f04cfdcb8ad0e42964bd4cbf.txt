       For information on Enigma try "APPLIED CRYPTOGRAPHY"
by Bruce Schneier page 11 and 364.  Page 11 gives a brief
summary of it and provides some info and other material
covering it.  Page 364 does the same.  In case you do not
have access to the book ( which of course is a sin ) here are
some of the references.

       "THE CODEBREAKERS" by D. Kahn    1983
       "CRYPTANALYSIS of the HAGLEN CRYPTOGRAPH" by W.G. Barker  1977
       "THE BLACK CHAMBER: A COLUMN; HOW THE BRITISH BROKE ENIGMA" by
    C.A. Deavours    Crptologia, v.4,n.3,Jul 1980,pp 129-132
