Very true.  Authentication, whether strong or weak, merely says that you are who you say you are -
totally different from this "web of trust" I keep hearing about - and that is *it*.  Do you trust me
any more now than before I started signing my postings?

It's well-known that most revelations of encrypted information come from "humint", not from 
mathematical finesse with the encryption scheme.  I especially love Oracle's idea of security - when 
submitting SQL to the Oracle back-end, to automate the process, you feed it your user ID and 
password IN THE CLEAR, ON THE COMMAND LINE.  Any weenie can run "ps -ef/ps -ax" and pipe it to 
grep.  The fact that Larry Ellison wont do anything about it seems to me to be idiocy of the first 
order, and that Oracle doesn't know what it's doing.  It's not even a good database product.  Deity 
only knows why people keep buying it, although that's rather off-topic ;)
