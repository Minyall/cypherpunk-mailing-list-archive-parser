I think that that kind of quantum computer is much less likely to be built
to impact RSA style crypto, than some revolutionary sort of factoring
algorithm. It is not clear whether the tolerances required for the quantum
computer can ever be met and it is not entirely clear if the quantum
principles are correct. I don't entirely rule it out however.
