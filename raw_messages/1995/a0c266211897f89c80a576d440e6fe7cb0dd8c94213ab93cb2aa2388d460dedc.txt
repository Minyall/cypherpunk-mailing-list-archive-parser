"Freedom shall stops where starts the one of the others"
That's what I learned, and what I think it is a "good thing",
Thus, your freedom of speach shall stops where it starts hurting
people

[not that I support at all the childish way l^Hamericans sue everybody
for anything, but I am happy that racists saying are not allowed and
can be condamned in France.]
