Hi all,

The Austin Cypherpunks will be meeting this Saturday from 6-8pm at Ted's
Greek Restaurant on Congress between 4th and 5th. We will be taking the
tables in the rear.

The main topic of discussion will be the proposed 1 hour public access video
on cryptography. Also we will be discussing making some form of monthly
key-signing.

Hope to see you there!
