It can be done (in some sense its just an extension of the Socks
protocol), but I'm not sure how easy it will be to prevent all traffic
analysis on the thing. Also, if this gets done frequently, it sort of
screws up our attempts to keep up the efficiency of traffic in the network.

I haven't read it, although the IETF is certainly (whether it knows it
or not) an organization run on anarchist lines.
