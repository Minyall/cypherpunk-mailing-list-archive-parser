You have several alternative means of verifying the key:

1) You can meet Bob at a local Pizza Hut and verify the key in person.

2) You can go through a variety of channels to a variety of other
trusted entities and verify with them that they're using the same key
for Bob.

3) You can set up some sorts of communications tests to "probe" for a
MITM situation, perhaps by passing through "seeded" information (data
taggants?).

I don't think it is irrelevant, I just think it's orthogonal to the
issue of whether a certificate for a key<-->entity relationship is
considered to be the key or an adjunct to the key.  I could be wrong,
of course.
