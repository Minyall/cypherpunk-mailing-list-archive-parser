	Why, other data haven operators, of course.

	Details, details. Just off the top of my head: an encrypted 
database that logs where the pieces were split and sent to. When the 
original data haven recieves a request for the file, it sends out 
requests to the other data havens, and reassembles the file, and shoots 
it out again to the original owner.
