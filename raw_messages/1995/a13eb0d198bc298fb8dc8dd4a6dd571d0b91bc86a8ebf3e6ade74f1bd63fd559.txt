This is part of the danger. It to omse degree doesn't matter how 
restictive or "enforceable" the law might be, or even whether or not 
prosecutins will stick. Arrests and prosecutions will take a financial 
toll on those targetted, and will create a chillinf effect in the online 
community, meaning sysops and BBS operators will start policing 
themselves too severely in an effort to avoid politcial or legal scrutiny.

Unfortunately, this only works for media which operate within the old 
broadcast paradigm, while the online world operates within the network 
paradigm. There are no hours in which it is safe to broadcast because 
there is no "broadcast" in the tradition sense.

And is also, as stated above, often motivated out of a desire to force 
the public to overly-police themselves to avoid prosecution.
