Do I get you wrong, or are you proposing the mailing of one time pads

The NSA is willing to monitor virtually all international
telecommunications traffic and try to figure out whats interesting. I

that it probably wouldn't pose much of a challenge to *me* given a set
of wiretaps and I have virtually no resources...
