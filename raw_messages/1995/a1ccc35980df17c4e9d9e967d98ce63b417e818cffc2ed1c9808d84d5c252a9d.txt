Ok, I updated my tclbin thing to include the unbuffered IO change,
And I've added everything you need to build the shell, as well as the
proxy source itself, in the latest tclbin release :

I wonder if anyone is interested ?

ps: I received today the rsa/amno shirts I've ordered from Adam, they
*rocks*, well designed, very good quality,... a must ! see
