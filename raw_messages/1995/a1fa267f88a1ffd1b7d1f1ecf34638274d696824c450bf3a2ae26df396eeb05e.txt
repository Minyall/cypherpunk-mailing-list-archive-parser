Actually it allows you to imbed data and commands to run. What the latest
MSWord virus did is imbed a virus dropper encoded in the word document
and then run it trough the dos debug command to make it a binary file
(if you ever read the 40HEX virus magazine you should know how this works).
From there it just run the dropper.
