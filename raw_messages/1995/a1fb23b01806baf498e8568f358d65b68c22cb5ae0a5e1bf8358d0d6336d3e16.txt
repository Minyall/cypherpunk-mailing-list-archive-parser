Due to some acct. problems I lost most of the mail snet to me betw. May
and September.  I saw a post in a newsgroup about VoicePGP betas being 
available, though only for Mac and WIn'95... is this true? And if so,
will there be a Win 3.11 or OS/2 or DOS version out eventually? I don't
intend to get Win '95 for as long as I can avoid it (and this is NOT the
start of an OS flame war...)

Also, what's the status of PGP 3.0?

Thanks,

Rob
