Since each hardware scanning device, and each image source, has 
idiosyncratic forms of noise, it is much harder to detect 
unusual forms of noise, than it is to emulate a usual form
of noise.

The attacker will get a huge number of false positives.  He
will not know if there is a whole lot of stego going on, or
he needs to adjust his noise models for a whole lot of
cranky and/or funky scanners.
