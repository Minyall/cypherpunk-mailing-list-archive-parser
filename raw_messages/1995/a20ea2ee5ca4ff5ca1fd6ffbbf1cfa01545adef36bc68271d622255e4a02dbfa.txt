	Here's the section from the Cyberangel FAQ which should explain why
I put the addresses on the list. Given that their main tactic so far is telling
ISPs, I would guess that any unauthorized remailers may be in trouble... once
they get a clue enough to spot them. Yes, the shouting is theirs.

  _9) WHAT KINDS OF CHANGES WOULD THE GUARDIAN ANGELS / CYBERANGELS LIKE TO
  SEE?_
  
  
  A) WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN IMPROVEMENT IN USER IDENTIFICATION. USER ID IS
  IMPOSSIBLE TO VERIFY OR TRACE BACK. THE VERY ANONYMITY OF USERS IS ITSELF
  CAUSING AN INCREASE IN RUDENESS, SEXUAL ABUSE, FLAMING, AND CRIMES LIKE
  PEDOPHILE ACTIVITY. WE THE NET USERS MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PROBLEM
  OURSELVES. ONE OF OUR DEMANDS IS FOR MORE ACCOUNTABLE USER IDS ON THE NET.
  WHEN PEOPLE ARE ANONYMOUS THEY ARE ALSO FREE TO BE CRIMINALS. IN A RIOT YOU
  SEE RIOTERS WEARING MASKS TO DISGUISE THEIR TRUE IDENTITY. THE SAME THING IS
  HAPPENING ONLINE. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE USER ID MUCH MORE THOROUGHLY CHECKED
  BY INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS.
