You tell'em Christopher! 

I have turned on quite a few of my friends to Linux. 
Some are Engineers and Programmers in businesses that would love to add
Netscape navigator and server. Hell, I would too.

Screw 'em. If they want to be the defacto standard for *some* OS's but
not all, someone else will come along and fill in the gap.
Besides, they already made the point that they don't want to make money
so why change the status quo. All the more reason to show the weaknesses
of the product before others get sucked in.
I'll stick to TkWWW and Lynx thank you.
