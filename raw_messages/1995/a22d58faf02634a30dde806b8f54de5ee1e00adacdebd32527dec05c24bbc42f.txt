This probably dates back to the time when a palestinian group tried to 
blow up an El Al flight from London by persauding the pregnant Irish 
girlfriend of one to carry a package for a friend. Flights from London 
have had the spiel ever since. El Al still does the best pre-flight 
screening (much more detailed questioning, and the security staff 
actually listen to the answers.
