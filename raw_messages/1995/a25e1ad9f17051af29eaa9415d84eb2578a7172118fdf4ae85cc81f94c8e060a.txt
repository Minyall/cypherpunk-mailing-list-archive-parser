They don't want to encourage encryption if they can avoid it.  It
impairs their ability to gather intelligence.

Legal? What makes you think so? It hasn't made it to the courts yet
because people in the US aren't willing to risk jail for over their
right to do it.  The only court case I am aware of was the RSA case and
in that one, the courts ruled against the NSA - but in today's political
and economic environment, people who do cryptography don't want to risk
it.

Not really right.  It's very easy to change a compression hook into an
encryption hook using standard off-the-shelf shareware, public domain
software, or commercial products.

Don't bet on it.  If you really try to export top-flight encryption
technology in a big way, you may find that your government can be
just as opressive as mine.
