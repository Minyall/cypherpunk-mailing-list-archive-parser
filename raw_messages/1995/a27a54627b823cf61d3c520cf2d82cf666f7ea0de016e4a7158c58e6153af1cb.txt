Possibly because a) it is allready being faught, and b) court battles cost 
money which most folks dont have.  If people are unfamilliar with 
encryptation, they should do a web search and find out what they can, then use 
it.  What you are saying (as far as encryptation not being an answer because 
so few know how to use it) feels like "lets not use a gun to defend our home 
from intrusion because so few know how to handle them.  You dont just assume 
that bewcause you dont know how that you give up.  You learn how.  That is how 
i found this list - because i did a little running around.
