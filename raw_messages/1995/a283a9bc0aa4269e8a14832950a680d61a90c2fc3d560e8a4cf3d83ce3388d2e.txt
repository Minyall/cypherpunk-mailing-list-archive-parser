I got the distinct impression that he didn't know that the internet
was in real use by big companies to conduct their daily affairs. When
I asked him if he'd ever heard of Cisco, he said he hadn't; he seemed
slightly suprised when I explained that it was a Fortune 500 company
that basically did nothing but sell internet routing equipment.

I don't know if the bastards are posing or are legitimately ignorant
but either way they are dangerous.
