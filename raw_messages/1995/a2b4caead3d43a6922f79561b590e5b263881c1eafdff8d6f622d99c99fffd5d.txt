Anonymous writes, concerning the "you want a remailer, you run one" idea:

   User X on Machine A sends a form via HTTP (or a variant- SHTTP, HTTPS, etc.)
   to Machine B.  User Y on Machine C receives an anonymous mail from Machine
   B.  Suspecting User X, User Y sends a mail to be anonymized and sent back to
   himself to User X.  User X's temporary remailer does as it's told.  User Y
   now has a strong reason to suspect User X has sent the said mail.

   Cpunks write code and all, but I don't think this one's going to work. :-(

I was thinking in terms of User X running one node in a mixmaster
network. AFAIK, mixmaster doesn't work in one-bounce mode; otherwise,
why would it go through all the trouble of breaking up the messages,
etc.?
