Uni is right. Notes used RSA, which starts out fine. but it has
nothing  like PGP's passphrase to protect the private key. You can
simply copy the "username.ID" file, and you can sign and encrypt
messages with "username"'s nym.

Of course, Corporate america loves Notes, which is why IBM bought it.

Weak encryption for weak minds.
