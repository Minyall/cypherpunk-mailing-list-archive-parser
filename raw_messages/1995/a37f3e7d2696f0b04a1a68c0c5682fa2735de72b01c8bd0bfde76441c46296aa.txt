   9-3-95. NYPaper:


   "It's a Hacker Meeting, So Hide Your Phones."

      Razor and Curious George showed up. Angstrom and
      Tigerboy and Cameo came, Rebel and Master Chemist, and
      the revered Emmanuel Goldstein. And there were dozens
      more, the illicit apparatus for filching pay-phone calls
      secreted deep in the pockets of shredded jeans, the
      hand-held Newton minicomputers at the ready. It was a
      time for all prudent people to hide their cellular
      phones and guard their calling cards, and for those who
      despise Nynex, Bell Atlantic and AT&T to rejoice.
      Because the electronic virtuosos in the public lobby of
      the Citicorp building at 53d Street and Lexington Avenue
      were networking to share clever and highly illegal ways
      of fooling the phone system and the corporate computer
      guard dogs meant to keep them out.
