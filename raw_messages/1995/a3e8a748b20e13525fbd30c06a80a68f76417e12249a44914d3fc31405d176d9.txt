Hi,

I've been trying to get back on the Cypherpunks list now for over 3 weeks.
IS anyone out there on the list that has the power to get me added.   I
tried
the usual request to cypherpunks-request@toad.com,   but haven't been
sucessful.

Who is maintaining the list these days?   Does it still exist?  And
why haven't any of my requests been hohored?
thats honored...

Thanx
John D.
