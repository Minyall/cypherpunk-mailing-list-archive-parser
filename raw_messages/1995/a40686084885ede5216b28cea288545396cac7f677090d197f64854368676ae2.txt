   I hate jumping in when I may be completely off base but...

   NT and (possibly Winodws97) may solve some of this, mainly through better
controll over devices and protected memory. I recently installed some NT
services, HTTP server, and Time Service (to get time off a trusted host).
The HTTP server was installed and working in 5 minutes.  I'm a little more
advanced than the typical "Solitare junky", but I was amazed at the ease of
install and controll that some of this stuff gives you.  I would probably
spend atleast 30+ minutes trying to get them properly installed on my UNIX host.
