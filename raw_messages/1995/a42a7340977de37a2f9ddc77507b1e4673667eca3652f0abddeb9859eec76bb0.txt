Well, the server appears to be unable to serve cgi scripts - I get 
'500 - server error' whenever I try. I cannot report the ~500 segments
I swept overnight, nor get new keyspace.

I thing it's gotten to the point where the server is the bottleneck on 
this operation - we seem to have plenty of cpu for sweeps. This will
damage our primary goal - to demonstrate how fast 40 bits can be
swept.

Piete, Adam, could you put a note on the /bute/ root page describing the
server status?

Thanks
