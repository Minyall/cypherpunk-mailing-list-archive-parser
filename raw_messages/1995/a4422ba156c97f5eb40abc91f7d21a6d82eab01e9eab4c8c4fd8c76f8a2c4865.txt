I've posted a message about this to a local demon newsgroup.   I
haven't seen any announcement about withdrawing mail2news access from
non-Demon subscribers.  

The mail2news gateway has been abused with spam  from some large ISPs
(guess which one? ), but Demon's policy seems to be that they deal with
such problems on an individual or site basis.

It is possible there was a configuration error at demon which may have
been fixed by now.
