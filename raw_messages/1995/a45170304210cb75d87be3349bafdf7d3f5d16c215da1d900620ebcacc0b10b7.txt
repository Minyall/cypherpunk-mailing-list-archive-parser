Yes, and even in the here and now, we suspect the existence of Powers with 
computational resources far in excess of our own.  But do we know for 
sure that PKE *must* rely on computational obfuscation?  Is it 
demonstrable that access to a public key always yields the secret key, 
given sufficient computational power?  Or is this only a result of the 
clumsy way we construct our keypairs here in the slow zone?
