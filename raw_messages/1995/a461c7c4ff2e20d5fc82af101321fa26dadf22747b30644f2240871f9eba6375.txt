You appear to be correct.  I came in from a .net address, which MIT apparently 
feels is non-US, and they would be correct about some .net's, but that's true 
of .com and .edu as well.

I came in from a Multinational corporation in .com, and it let me in. :-)

But if people get it from MIT directly, then MIT is violating ITAR/DTR, and 
its lawyers would be justified in shutting things down.  If it's pulled down 
by a US citizen, and then sent out, I don't see how MIT could be held 
responsible for it.
