   "Use of Computer Network For Child Sex Sets Off Raids."

      The Justice Department today announced a dozen arrests
      in a two year investigation into the use of America
      Online, the country's largest computer network, to
      distribute child pornography and to lure minors into
      sex. The culmination of the inquiry by the Federal
      Bureau of Investigation comes at a time when the agency
      has needed some favorable attention to offset a string
      of incidents that have cast it in a negative light.


   "Scientologists Lose a Battle on the Internet."

      Upholding free speech on the Internet, a Federal judge
      has ordered the Church of Scientology to return
      computers and files seized here last month from two men
      who used a computer bulletin board to disseminate
      information critical of the church. The equipment
      belongs to Factnet, an anti-Scientology bulletin board
      run by two Boulder men, Lawrence Wollersheim and Robert
      Penny.
