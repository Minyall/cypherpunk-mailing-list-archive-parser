Why is a true name necessary for sex? It should be feasible to arrange
a romantic rendezvous without True Names, no?
How often have you checked IDs before going on a date?

(I think most normal people would notice a MITM during, er, never mind.)

You simply arrange time, place, sign/counter-sign.

Anything I've missed?

For thing number five from your next post: I find it amusing that
octets seven and eight of my fingerprint resemble the name of
a certain Swedish group of singers. Mama mia!


Here I go again, my my, how can I resist... stop humming to yourself!
