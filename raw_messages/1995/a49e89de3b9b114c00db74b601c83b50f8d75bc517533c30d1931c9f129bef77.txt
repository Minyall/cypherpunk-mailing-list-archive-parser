Bob,

So can I... :-(

Too bad Damien didn't wait until after the date one could legally
short the stock.  That would have been the perfect time for a media
frenzy on the issue.  The announcement of SSL having been broken is
occuring too soon to be at all useful in the financial sense.  The
media frenzy, if it happens, will now occur well before the 30-day
lock-out on shorting a new issue.  What a shame. <arg>!
