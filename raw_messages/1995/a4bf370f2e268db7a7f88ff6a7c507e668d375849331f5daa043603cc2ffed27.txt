Something I've been is: Why can't one of your enemies just get a piece of
your hair or fingernails or something, and make their own DNA ink our of
your DNA?  They could probably even send it to this DNA ink company, and
they'd make your enemy ink out of your own DNA without even noticing.
Doesn't seem very secure to me.

[Yeah, it's not crypto related, but I've been wondering about this since
the topic was first brought up, and am somewhat surprised that of the few
messages there were making fun of the DNA ink,  none mentioned this fact.
Is that because it's too obvious to mention, or is there something I'm not
thinking about which makes DNA ink useful after all?]
