Just make all the URLs on the server point to a CGI script.  The script
would check the requesting browser's id and return the real data or the
"sorry" message.  This would allow the process to be done with *no*
server changes.

Since "Cypherpunks write code", one can easily imagine a hack to the
Apache or NCSD or CERN servers that did the same thing without having
the overhead of a CGI script for each access.
