People who steal credit cards prefer to order goods to be delivered somewhere
they can grab them. (Often this is just the front of the rightful owner's
home, while Holly the Homeowner is off at work.) But that's just another
reason to cut down unauthorized credit card charges, not a reason to restrict
what a rightful cardholder can do with the card. I _want_ to be able to have
stuff delivered to arbitrary locations, and I _don't_ want to give that up
just to make it tough on thieves.

Ordering hardcore porno videos to be sent to, say, somewhere in Tennessee
might work pretty well in our sadly repressed society.
