Please help.  Somehow, someone signed up the "cypherpunks" mailing
list to your "ZD Net Update" electronic newsletter.  Our mailing list,
with over a thousand members, is for the discussion of cryptography
and technical means of achieving privacy and anonymity in the
emergent digital world.

There is some overlap between your publication and our mailing list,
which is why some well-meaning individual "signed us up."  It's pretty
slight, however, and interested parties can sign up individually.

So, please remove cypherpunks@toad.com from your mailing list.  As
always, if you ahve questions about the propriety of this, you can
follow the internet conventions of writing to postmaster@toad.com
to double-check.

Thanks.
