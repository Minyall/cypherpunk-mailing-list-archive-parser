To Whom It May Concern:

I was curious as to where I might find some electronic freedom legal 
precedents.  If, for example, an employer was planning to probe file systems on 
PCs in the off-hours and employees began encrypting their hard drives, what 
legal precedents would support the employees or would support the employer in 
blocking the encryption?

Thanks for any info you can give me!!
