Good question.

Here's one answer, obtained using a minor variation on Ray's URL:

----------------------------------------------
Congratulations, you have found a bug in
NCSA Mosaic 2.4 on Sun.

If a core file was generated in your directory,
please run 'dbx Mosaic' (or 'dbx /path/Mosaic' if the
Mosaic executable is not in your current directory)
and then type:
  dbx> where
and mail the results, and a description of what you were doing at the time,
to mosaic-x@ncsa.uiuc.edu.  We thank you for your support.

...exiting NCSA Mosaic now.
----------------------------------------------------

Now, the question is, does Netscape use _the same code_ that was used in
Mosaic for this purpose ?
