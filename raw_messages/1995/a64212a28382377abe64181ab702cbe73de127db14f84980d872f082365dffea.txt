How do I know that they (this means YOU! :> ) don't work for the company?
(which is a contracter for, blackmail-victim of, tentacle of NSA, CSE, 
TCMAY, Purplenet, your fairy-stepmother ...)

Of course there's always the mail-drop & forward-net... (anyone one know
maildrop company addresses, the possible (il)legality of these things or 
any reported monitoring cases? A physical remailernet might come to matter in an
economy where the "split" between an untaxable info economy and a 
taxable physical economy become pronounced. Though it's kinda hard to encrypt
and reorder packages.)
