This is the official announcement for the Ecafe Mixmaster Remailer that
has been running on ecafe.org for testing purposes for the last few weeks.
The address to send to is mixmaster@remail.ecafe.org, message reordering
is enabled with a poolsize currently set to two (which may be increased
when we get more traffic), and the key is attached. The remailer is
physically located in the UK.
