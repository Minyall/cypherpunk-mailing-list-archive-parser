I agree, this is an important issue.  But I think it's a separate one
from the question of how users pay for the service.  In other words,
once there's a consensus to have a Guild of for-pay remailers, all the
users should have to do is pay the Guild once.  The Guild can then
haggle over how to divvy up the money.  Hard jobs, such as posting anon
news, should command more money.

On the issue of the medium of exchange, I favor blinded digital cash
with its absolute anonymity.  The "remailer in a box" that we spoke of
earlier would do well to include this capability.
