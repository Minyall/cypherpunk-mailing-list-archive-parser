  Wow -- hooks to encryption are unexportable -- now THAT's bullshit.  Sheesh.

A few yuears ago I asked Matt Blaze if he would
publish CFS with the sryptography removed, and he
told me that AT&T's lawyers also believed this to
be true. (So, of course, his answer was "No".)
The hooks are as important as the crypto code.
