Yes, I believe that they have only ever given verbal agreement to this
sort of thing, which is worth the air it is written on.

You are assuming that because the government has chosen not to
prosecute MIT that they will not prosecute anyone else.  This is a
faulty assumption, laws are not invalidated if they are not enforced,

any such discussion can take place we need a determination from the
government as to what sort of verification is adiquite.
