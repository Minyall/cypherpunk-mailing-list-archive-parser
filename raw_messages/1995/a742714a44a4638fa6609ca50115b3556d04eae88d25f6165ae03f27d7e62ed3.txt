     Actually, there was a story in the San Jose Mercury News a couple
of weeks ago regarding a product that does just that.  VCRs from at
least two manufacturers will contain a chip and/or firmware that
detects commercials and does not record them.

     My dim memories from a project I did for Sony a couple of years
ago are that commercials are separated by a fixed number of black
frames and some, at least, have tracking information encoded so that
advertisers can monitor how often they are played.  I'll try to dig up
more info.
