You are quite right here; some kind of account is needed on the
forwarder machine.  (It can, though, be an account without password
and a login shell that just sleeps.)  But anyway, TCP port forwarding
is not its main function.  (I don't think the packetizing is such a
major overhead though - it currently transfers around 400kbytes/sec
over ethernet encrypted with RC4 between P90 machines.)

The reasons for this key exchange are mostly historical.  If I was
starting the implementation now, I would use DH + signatures.  The
performance difference is not very big, but DH + signature would be simpler.
