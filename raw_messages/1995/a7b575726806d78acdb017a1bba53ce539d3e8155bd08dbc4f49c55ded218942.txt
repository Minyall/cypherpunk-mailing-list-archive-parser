Oh jesus, I need to get myself a certificate for the netscape servers
at work.

All I need are three forms of identification, two written letters, an
authorized signature, $300, mailed and faxed, along with an e-mail
or two.

I think this is an amazing pain in the ass. Any way I could sign a
certificate by myself for myself and have it work with the netscape
products? 

Just curious,
Christopher
