I would like to be involved with any final stages of the Linux port.  I 
run a now, fairly defunct business off of my Linux Box and can afford 
some troubles in alpha testing.  Let me know when things are near a 
testing stage guys.

Oh, and by the way, thanks for doing this everyone.  It is VERY important!
