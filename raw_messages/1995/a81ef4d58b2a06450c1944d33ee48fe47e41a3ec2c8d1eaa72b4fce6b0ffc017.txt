The article, by T. Matsumoto and H. Imai, was in Eurocrypt '91, which
is published as vol. 547 of "Lecture notes in computer science".

The only followup article I could find was:
C.-H. Wang, T. Hwang, and J.-J. Tsai, "On the Matsumoto and Imai's
[sic] human identification scheme." (LNCS 921, 1995)

It may be that the approach is off anyway. Credit cards have only
signature verification -- if the salesperson bothers -- because stolen
cards are reported. You don't need a strong authentication technique
if a stolen card is easy to cancel.

Of course, perhaps this encourages someone to steal your card and
incapacitate you before you can report it. That's why we have
PINs... so that someone can steal your card, threaten you until you
reveal your PIN, and then incapacitate you... Hmm...

Even with a weak PIN system for authentication, you can always provide
a "duress" PIN, right?
