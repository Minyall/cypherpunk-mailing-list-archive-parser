I'm certainly no expert on viruses, but doesn't that have to be
transitive flow of executable information?  If I'm just shipping data
around, there's no way you can infect me.  Does Java allow the client to
upload an applet to the server?  Can applets persist between netscape
sessions?  If the answer to both of these questions is no, then the
viability of viruses should be substantially degraded.
