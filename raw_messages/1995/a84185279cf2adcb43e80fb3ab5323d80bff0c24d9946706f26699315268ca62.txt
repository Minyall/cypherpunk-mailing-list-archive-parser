	While this might been read as a sarcastic comment, I'll
suggest that it really is excellent advice from Perry.  Like
cryptosystem design, secure software is best written by those with
experience breaking other people's system.

	Encouraging Netscape programmers to hack at SST will result in
embarassing disclosures for Microsoft, and better code for Netscape.
