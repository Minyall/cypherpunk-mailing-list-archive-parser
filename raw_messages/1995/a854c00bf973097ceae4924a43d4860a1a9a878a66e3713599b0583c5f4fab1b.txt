Laissez Faire Books has a stockpile and they're giving them away!
LF sends you _True_Names_ free when you buy _Solomon's Knife_ by Victor
Korman (a pen-name). Order FN5136, $9.95 for both + $3.25 shipping:
Laissez Faire, 938 Howard Street #202, San Francisco, CA 94103, tel
800-326-0996, fax 415-541-0597. They have their own Laissez Faire Book
News list, too, with previews and samples. Ask Chris Whitten for more
info at <whitten@panix.com>.
