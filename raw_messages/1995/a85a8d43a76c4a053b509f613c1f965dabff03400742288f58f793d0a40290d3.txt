   PC Mag of Oct 24 odes Damien's mode, yodels out-of-tunely
   Netscape's sec, cites the sites of the SSL hacking axes,
   and declares that, whew, nervous darlings, all is lovely
   waltzing at crypto-crystal ball.

   Also casts doe eyes at STT and pre-lubed sheaths. It says
   the "National Security Administration" Rx's 40-56 itty-bit
   fits for muleing precious US fairy dust.

   Oilpalming the jittery globalists of squat fearing 
cleartext.
