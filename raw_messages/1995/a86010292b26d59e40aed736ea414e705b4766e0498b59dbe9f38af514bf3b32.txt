I don't believe that that would be a consideration.  Wasn't there a 
court case a few years ago, in which a convicted criminal sued the 
government, charging that filling out one of those forms that you 
have to fill out when you buy a gun was a violation of his 5th 
amendment rights?  What ever happened to that case?

I also think that, besides the obvious 5th amendment problems, there 
would be a 1st amendment problem - if you "*had* to use GAK to 
communicate, that would be an impermissible restriction on your 1st 
amendment rights.
