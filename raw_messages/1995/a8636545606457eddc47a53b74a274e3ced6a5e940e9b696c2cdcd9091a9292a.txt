I'll back up the disassembly theory.  I've done it myself once when I 
lost some of my own source code from years previous and had to get out 
the dissassembler.  Very painful work which resulted in a first set of 
source much like the "S1" sample posted here.  Only difference was that I 
went back over the "first draft" after verifying it and cleaned it up 
somewhat.

The poster either does not know 'C' or thinks that a cleanup will reveal 
his/her style.
