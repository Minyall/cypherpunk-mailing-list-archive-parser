I'm going to need some clarification of this; what is meant by
"successful"?  If you mean "a communication without a MITM
participating", and presuming also that that communication would
involve a key validation, then I suppose it's true.  However, I don't
see how this success can be evaluated if the parties do not have
nearly complete control over the communications substrate.
