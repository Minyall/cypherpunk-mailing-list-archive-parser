I should have mentioned that I have no problem with people trying to
make money.  However, it turns out that ViaCrypt is not selling
site-licenses, or even floating licenses, so they actually want to sell
a separate copy for every user that will use it.

As it happens, the aforementioned sys admin had purchased 5 licenses, to
take care of the 2 users he already knew about, and figuring that there
would probably be a couple more wanting to jump on the bandwagon.  He
offered to let me use one of the licenses, but there's no way I can go
and tell my users "we have PGP", if I can't tell everyone that they can
do it.

And, there's no way I can see convincing my boss that we need that many
copies of ViaCrypt, just so everyone in my department can encrypt their
email traffic.

Of course, I realize that none of the above changes the legality.


thanks,
