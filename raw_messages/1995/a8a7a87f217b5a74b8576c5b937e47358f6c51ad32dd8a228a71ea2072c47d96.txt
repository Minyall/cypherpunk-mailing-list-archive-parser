This is not the case for digital imagery. For any given band, if you
sample a significant portion of the image it would not be surprising to
see a more or less random distribution over the range.

If you decrypt with the wrong key, do you get a random distribution?
Would this be the case for all wrong keys? Would the statistics change
in any discernible pattern as the keys got "closer"?

This may give a better result. Most compressions involve a shift to the
frequency domain with a quantization of the samples. You might be able
to write a detector based on this discontinuity.

You could also try throwing an edge detector or some other morphological
recognizer at the output. It would still be cheaper than having to a man
in the loop, but you're going to spend a lot of cpu time.
