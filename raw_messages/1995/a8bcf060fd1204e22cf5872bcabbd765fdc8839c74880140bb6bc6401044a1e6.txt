The worst part of the book was the cover.  I didn't think I was a 
cyberpunk until I could check off 8 out of 10 items (I don't have a pager 
or fake security ID, but I do have a carbide scribe and library with 
similar books in similar stacks:).  To say nothing about fashion.  I am 
no longer in denial ;).
