good points, Christian!

more and more, networks are becoming flooded with X traffic.  although X
has always been known to be a potential security hole, i think X-attacks
are going to increase dramatically in the coming months.

i commonly hear of sights with Xauthority enabled, only to have the user
community type "xhost +" at the prompt.  bad karma.  the days of pumping
rude & crass noises to someone else's workstation will soon graduate to
more nefarious and insidious attacks.

is anyone looking into a means of securing X (above and beyond the current
weak solutions)?

regards,
