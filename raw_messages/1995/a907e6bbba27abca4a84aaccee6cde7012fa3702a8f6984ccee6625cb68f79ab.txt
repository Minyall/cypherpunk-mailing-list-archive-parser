No -- it means that you were taking too long to respond, so it timed you out.

brclient -k failed to get any keys, so brutessl didn't generate any output,
so brclient -A didn't get any input :-(

Latest brloop should avoid this by not calling brutessl if brclient -k failed
and also not calling brclient -A if brutessl didn't run / failed.

Well, the problem with brclient 0.16 was that a "go faster" stripe made it
go *too* fast if local, perl losses data, so it times out :-((

Kind of -- slow clients hogging the single threaded (idle) server :-((
