Hmm -- I clearly haven't been reading this thread close enough!  How
is PGP deficient?  What do you need PGP to do in order to get it to
work right with remailers?  I've never seen a bug-report/ feature
request of this sort sent to pgp-bugs@mit.edu, so clearly no one
considered this for the MIT PGP release.

So, what does PGP need to be able to do?
