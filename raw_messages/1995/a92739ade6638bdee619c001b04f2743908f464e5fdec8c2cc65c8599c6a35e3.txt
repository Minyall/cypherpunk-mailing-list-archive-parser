	Once netscape is patched with a stronger PRNG if someone can
crack -that- one too, then they will get a T-shirt as well. Perhaps I
should offer the t-shirt for just revealing the algorithim used w/o
actually cracking it, just to deal with that statement from "Netscape
officials".
	I emphasized in my conversation with the SFChronicle today
that 'security by obscurity' doesn't work. Hopefully that will be
reflected in the article.
