   having spent 30+ years in and around the spook show, the first rule of 
thumb is: "...dont summarily dismiss an obvious falsehood which is 
persistent from non-related sources,"  and "...expert more

   patents were intended to be granted for unique developments 
--generally without prior art (other than relational).

popular discussion.  --but, consider the components and think plasma....
