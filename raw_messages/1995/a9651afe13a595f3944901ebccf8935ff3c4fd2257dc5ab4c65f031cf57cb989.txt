Associated Press reported on 1/20/95:

Since wiretapping on court order from their no-questions-asked secret 
court is already allowed, can they mean anything other than wiretapping 
without court order?

Can somebody explain to me why the Clinton administration is
considered "liberal"?  Why the Republicans are considered
"conservative"?
