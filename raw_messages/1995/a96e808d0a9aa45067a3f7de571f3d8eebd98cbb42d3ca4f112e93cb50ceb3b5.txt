I wasn't saying I wouldn't let new technology provide this service for me.

I was just saying that lack of it has not been a problem, so far. In very
few of my dealings, even in the economic world, have I needed to have any
kind of certification.

(Buying a new house recently is where I needed certification of inspectors,
escrow agents, title companies, etc.)
