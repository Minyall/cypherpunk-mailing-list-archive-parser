It would be interesting to create a hardware device which is 
interoperable with PGPFone but uses a DSP chip and a slower control 
processor.  I can easilly imagine $100-$150 as a reasonable range.

I will be really curious to see what kind of voice coder they are using 
in PGPFone...I assume it is some flavor of CELP.
