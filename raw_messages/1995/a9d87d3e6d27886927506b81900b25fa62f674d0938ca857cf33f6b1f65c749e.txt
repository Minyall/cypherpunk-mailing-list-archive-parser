If you are willing to accept that in all likelihood, one year from
now, some group will announce that can "crack" all key exchanges that
using the published modulus, then sure, call it sufficient.  There is
certainly precedent; it was my understanding that Sun did not change
their SecureRPC modulus when informed of LaMacchia and Odlyzko's work.
