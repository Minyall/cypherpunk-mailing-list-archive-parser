I have to disagree here.. There is such a thing as overstating the obvious.
And a statement such as the one you propose is definately in that range. If
the user is 
knowledgable about system ops that come from external apps, such as the PS
interpreters, Java or whatever, then they should take appropriate security
measures themselves. If they are not skilled or versed in such subjects, you
can bet they will be after the first incident of 'cyber-vandalism'.
Ignorance is not bliss, and you, and only you, are responsible for
protecting yourself in 'cyberspace'.

Heck, I can see it now:
       "Sex can be used by sufficiently knowledgeable
	users who have educated their partners before
	using them to attempt comply to acts of contortion,
        sustained physical activity, voluntary dehydration,
        and who have removed all other known, unknown, and/or 
        undisclosed partners from their systems.  Otherwise, 
        sex unsafe and should not be attempted."

Again, overstating the obvious...
