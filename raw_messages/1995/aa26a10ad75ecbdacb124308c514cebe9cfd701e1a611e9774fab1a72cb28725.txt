A much more interesting spin on this would be a variety of ways to encode
throughout a substance in an inert but permanent way a public key.

Whether it's an easily identifiable molecule or some type of deep etching,
you could do things like mark all the parts of a car or all the paint,
fabric, plastic, etc. of a work of art.

DNA isn't very good really since it's mostly the same and based a lot
on probabilities.
