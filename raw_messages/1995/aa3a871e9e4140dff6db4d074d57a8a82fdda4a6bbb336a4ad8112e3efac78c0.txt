Agreed; but it's present, not just in Word (every version since 2.0, as 
far as I can tell, in fact, since they all let you make system calls...), 
but in Microsoft Network, Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel... I believe 
PowerPoint and Publisher are exempt from this bug, if only because the 
current versions have no macro languages...

One of the penalties that modern software (at least for Windows) imposes 
is the ability to create massive viri, simply by allowing system calls to 
be executed from macros (if this was not the case, OLE technology 
wouldn't work, and interoperation between Windows programs can't occur, 
thereby crippling the system through bad design regardless of which 
alternative was chosen)
