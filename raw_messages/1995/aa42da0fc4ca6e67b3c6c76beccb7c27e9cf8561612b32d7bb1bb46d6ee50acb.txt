I also suggest taking a look at Stefan Brands' solution, which, while
requiring hardware, has some favorable properties.  Among these are:

   - prior restraint of double spending through hardware-based
   "secret-key certificates"

   - in the case of hardware tampering, double spenders are traceable
   as in Chaum's system; however, the protocol used to achieve this is
   much more efficient than Chaum's "cut-and-choose"

   - no possibility of a subliminal channel between the
   tamper-resistant device and the payee or bank
