	Hell, *I'd* prefer to see the whole thing given away. Ain't
gonna happen though. It's called US patent law. (I would have put
*much* less work into it, if it was going to be given away, though, so
the fact that people have to pay for it actually results in a better
non-commercial version as well. [the only thing you don't get with the
non-commercial version is commercial use licensing for the patent
stuff and support..])
	Maybe though, if the various lawsuits disputing the patents go
through and the patents are found invalid or something, commercial use
will be possible for free.
