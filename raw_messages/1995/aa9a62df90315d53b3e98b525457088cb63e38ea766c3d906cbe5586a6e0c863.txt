  Poor choice of words on my part.  My understanding is that we can not
export our US-only product, except to canada - for the use of canadian
citizens.  I also believe that it is illegal for anyone except US citizens,
permanent residents of the US (green card holders) and Canadian citizens
to use it, even within the US.  I'm not a lawyer, and I've not read
all of ITAR myself, so I could be totally wrong...
