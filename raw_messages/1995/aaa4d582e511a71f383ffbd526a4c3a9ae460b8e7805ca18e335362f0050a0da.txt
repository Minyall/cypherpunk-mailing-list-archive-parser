At the meeting, the NIST/NSA folks presented their criteria for
being an acceptable escrow agent criteria. They had hardcopy, and
Geoff had slides. The slides didn't exactly match the hardcopy.

I have typed in the text from my hardcopy. It is on my clipper2
page (which is under construction at
<a href="http:/www.isse.gmu.edu/~pfarrell/nist/clipper2.html">)
url for the criteria for escrow agent entities is
<a href="http:/www.isse.gmu.edu/~pfarrell/nist/escagent.html">

I will _not_ post it (about 4 pages) to the list.
If you can't use the web, email me and I'll forward a copy.

I've got some notes on Geoff's presentation that I'll post later on.
