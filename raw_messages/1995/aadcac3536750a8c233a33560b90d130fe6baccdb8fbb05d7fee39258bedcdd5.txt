I remember when RSA129 was being done, the program you have you manually 
get a start location, and then email transparent any results that it 
got.  The program that doled out areas to search would base those on what 
had already been mailed in.  I don't know the details of how exactly that 
worked, however.

But, if the program could be written in such a way that it was all 
automatic, mailing in results and automatically (maybe via a telnet 
port?) getting the information about what to search, that would be most 
nice. 

I'd basicly like to be able to start the program, nice it, slam it in the 
background, and forget about it.
