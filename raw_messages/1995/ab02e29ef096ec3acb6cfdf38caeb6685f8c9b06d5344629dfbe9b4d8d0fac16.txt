From whose point of view? Remember the thread about Getting things right
v. Getting the software out?

The above way is easier for most people with little computer techie
knowledge. Requiring a whole complex set of commands would mean less
PGP users.

As people get used to it and learn about the issues, key management,
etc. they'll be more willing to use a more advanced version of PGP...
at the very least, they'll eventually RTFM and realize that you actally
have more control of what it can do...

Have your program check what's in the mail before doing anything with it...?
