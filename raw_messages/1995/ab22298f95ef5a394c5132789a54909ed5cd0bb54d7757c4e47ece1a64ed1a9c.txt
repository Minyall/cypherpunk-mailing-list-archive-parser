Patented does not equal secret.  The argument against Clipper (at least one 
of them ;-), is that it has not been subjected to review outside of the NSA.

I believe the code for RC4 and RC2 is accessible and has been subjected to
review by many in the crypto field - you just can't use it legally without 
a license.
