would some kind soul make available MIXMASTER client thru telnet????

of course less security but Some of us dont have Unix Access So it would Help!!


as long as Reasonable Care is Taken it should be Safe Enuff?for Most uses?

Making Client default shell For a Guest User would be Easy and Safe!and
Client stay on That Host so No Exporting Done!so Someone Please!!

10x all!!
