Steven knows titles can't be copyrighted.  He was just expressing the wish
that they had come up with their own title.  I'm pissed because the sequel
to Jurassic Park is stealing the title of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's dinosaur
novel "Lost World."  Unfortunately, title-space is more limited than book-space.
