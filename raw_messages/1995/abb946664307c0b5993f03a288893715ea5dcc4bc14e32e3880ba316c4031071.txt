Sigh...

>> Hmm. Anyone here ever heard of the Walkers, or the Rosenbergs? 

Different cases - the Walkers gave away information on how the Yankees were
stealing Russian secrets, which the Russians patched up by encrypting.
The most current information on the Rosenbergs, gotten from decrypted Soviet
communications and declassified US and ex-Soviet files, indicates that Ethel
Rosenberg
was probably innocent of spying, and Julius was spying but didn't give away
any useful atomic secrets, and that the FBI probably knew at the time they
had Ethel killed that she was innocent.  Sometimes even having your secrets
cracked isn't enough to protect you....
