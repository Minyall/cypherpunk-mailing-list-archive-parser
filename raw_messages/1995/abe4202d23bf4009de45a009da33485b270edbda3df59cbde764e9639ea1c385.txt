How do you propose to protect entities wanting to utilise this function from

a) people sniffing the tcp packets coming in to discover who is maintaining
   a web page,

b) the above LEA attack where your own lines are monitored and data is tracked
   back thru the various networks to the web page maintainer?

c) an open LEA confrontation where they issue a warrant demanding any and all
   info you have on the web page maintainer. (e.g. co$ doesnt like whats on
   one of the pages)

The same again for the anon shell accounts.

Apart from a once off mailed to you via remailer, the creator of a web page
needs to maintain their creations. This implies a means of accessing it that
is repeatable. Wether thats via a dialup account or over the net, it can be
traced. It's only when the entity uses channels outside of the jurisdiction
or capabilities of those monitoring that some anonymity can be achieved.
(Implies they weren't monitored entering the blinding channels in the first
place).
