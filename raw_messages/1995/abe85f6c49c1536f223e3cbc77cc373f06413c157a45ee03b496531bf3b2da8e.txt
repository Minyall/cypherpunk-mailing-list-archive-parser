     I get something similar:

ionia:/usr/people/pjm/src/ssl> brloop

 +++ Command failed -- brutessl missing ?
Scalar found where operator expected at (eval 12) line 3, near "*($p"
        (Missing operator before $p?)
 +++ FAILED on attempt 1
usage: brutessl [-q] <filename> <checksum> <start segment> <no of segments>
       brutessl [-q] -r <filename> [<no of segments>]
       brutessl [-q] -t [<hours>[:<minutes>]]

     I'll just use the Web keyspace server if I don't get the time to
hack around with it.
