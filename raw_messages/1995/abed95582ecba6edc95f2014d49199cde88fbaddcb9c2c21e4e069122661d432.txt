From memory that particular attack had more to do with altered operating
systems which reported back the correct information than anything to do with
a md5 hole. It is much easier to tell a program to say "abcdef" than it is
to come up with a series of bits that hash to the same md5 result as another
series of bits.

Keep trying Fred... you may get somewhere one day.
