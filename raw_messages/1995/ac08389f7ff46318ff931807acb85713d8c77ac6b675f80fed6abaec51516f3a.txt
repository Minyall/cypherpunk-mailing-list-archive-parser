  Here's a variation, then: Instead of using process-id.clock to
generate the random stuff for the challenge, have your own (P)RNG make
up a bunch of them ahead of time, calculate the hashes, and store the
challenges and hashes on the server.

  The password file is kept encrypted, and only decrypted to run the
above. You could even do the whole thing by remote access, making up a
batch of id: pairs of challenge/repsonse on one machine, encrypt the
thing and send it to the server via remailer chain.

  The reason for the "stealth" bit is because the locus of control is
moved to the remote machine, which may itself fall prey to attack. So,
the supervisor needs to login as a Mere User (could have several
accounts like this, and/or change them frequently) so as to not leave a
trail of bread crumbs back to the cottage.
