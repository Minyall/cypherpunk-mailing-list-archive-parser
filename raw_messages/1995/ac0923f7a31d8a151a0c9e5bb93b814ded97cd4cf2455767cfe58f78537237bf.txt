Speaking only for myself, I would resist government access to my data or
property. Court orderd warrant or not. I firmly believe that the majority
of "lawful" acts the goverment in its various incarnations commits every
day is in violation of not only the US Constitution, but of the natural
rights given to me as part of my humanity. I therefore hold that I have
right, if not the duty, to resists these acts in anyway possible, upto and
including the use of lethal force. The number of citizens who share this
opininon are growing every day.

--anon, due to the denoucement of the Bill of Rights by the criminals in
high office.
