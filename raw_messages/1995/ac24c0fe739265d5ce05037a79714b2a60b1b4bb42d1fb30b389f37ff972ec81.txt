Any punishment on the books for politce who knowingly violate the law seems
pointless, since they can technically be prosecuted for violating civil
rights anyway.  As it is, juries tend to believe police testimony no matter
what side they are on (prosecution or defense).

It's rare that police are prosecuted for brutaliy cases, and corruption
trials fizzle out because of the "blue wall" effect.
