OK, you expected this, but here goes anyway.  This isn't a one time pad
because the "randomness" isn't really random -- it depends on a bunch of
plaintext.  Technically from your description this looks like a plaintext
autokey system.  A true OTP requires honest to goodness physically random
key material for the pad.  It may be quite strong, but it just doesn't
fit the definition.

Sigh.

People keep throwing OTP around because it's the only known perfect system --
until we get quantum crypto, I suppose -- but few companies actually want to
go to the trouble to implement the real thing.  And with good reason -- it's
a nuisance to do secure exchanges on the keying material.
