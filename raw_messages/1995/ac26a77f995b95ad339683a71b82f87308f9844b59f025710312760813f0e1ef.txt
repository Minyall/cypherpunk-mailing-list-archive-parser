After reading the lawyer's threatening letter I tried to check out the 
two newsgroups mentioned, and was told they do not exist.  (This is not a 
local filter here; Eskimo does not censor newsgroups.)  So have they been 
deleted?  If so, by whom and how? What is 'rmgroup' and who has the 
authority to remove alt. groups?
