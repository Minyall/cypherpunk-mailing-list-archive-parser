Heh.  It's not QUITE so simple.  :)

If you're running an ELF system, you have to pretend it's a sys v system 
(or, alternatively, remove all the leading underscores in the .globl 
names in the assembly language (*.S) files.

Also, you should upgrade to the latest 1.2.x version of linux, as there 
was a fairly large memory leak until 1.2.11 or 1.2.12 or so...
