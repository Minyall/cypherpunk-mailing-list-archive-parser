I suspect that this is not an RSA keysize, but an RC4 keysize.  Does
it specify 40bit RSA keys?  Or does it say "40 bit cryptographic key"?
I suspect something closer to the latter, in which case I highly doubt
it is an RSA key.

A 40-bit RSA key can be broken in seconds.

a 40-digit RSA key will take a few days.
