They do, add:

application/x-shell; sh %s

to your .mailcap.

They had better stop supporting mailcap alltogether, after all *any*
of the programs in there could have buffer overflows, or other
security problems.  I'll bet some of them even do, anyone want to
see if sox (a program that transforms sound files from format to
format - frequently used to convert .wav files to .au files) has
any overruns in the chunk handling code?

Sure, and they had better find a way to keep us from editing the binary
and adding whatever insecure features we may want to their program.

obcrypto: mabie it would be a good idea for programs to list problems that
are beoynd their control.  To many people it may be supprising that anything
in their .mailcap could hurt them.  To others it is hardly a shock and seeing
alot of messages about it tends to get rather boreing, esp. as a few people
jump up and down and yell about the Danger To Us All...
