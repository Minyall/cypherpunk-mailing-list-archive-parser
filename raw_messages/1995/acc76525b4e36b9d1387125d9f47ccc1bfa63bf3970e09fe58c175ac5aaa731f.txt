I don't know which is more annoying:
	The silly 3/4K of Comments that the freezone remailer puts out.
	(The use constraints are useless to email recipients, after all); or

	That some anonymous bozo is posting open WWW data to cypherpunks.

I hope that the first, at least, can be fixed.

Avoid clutter; note the reply-to.
