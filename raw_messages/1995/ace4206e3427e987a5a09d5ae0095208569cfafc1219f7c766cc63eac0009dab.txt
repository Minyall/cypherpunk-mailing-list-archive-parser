You miss the point!  There will be no "international effort"!  Here are the steps:

1.  Write a program limited to keysize, carefully constructed to isolate those portions of the program which define key size, GAKedness, etc.
2.  Get it export approved.  Export it.

THEN

3.  Announce that a "US-only" version of the same program is being released, and include the minimal component which replaces the limited software.  Release it, only in the US of course!

The system I describe doesn't even violate the spirit of the rules.  If anything, it bends over backward to implement a foreign version of the software which ALREADY is export-approved at the time it was, um, upgraded.

True, it's possible to sneak the extra component out of the country, but hey, it's also possible to sneak an entirely new program out of the country.  I'm not suggesting that the company who writes the component takes it out, it'll happen regardless.

If the order of the versions was reversed, the USG might complain that the export version was "too similar" to the domestic version.  That's why you wait for the export approval before you write the domestic version.
