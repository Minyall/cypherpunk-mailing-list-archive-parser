Well, a couple other c'punks have mailed me to determine a time and a 

place.  It looks like everyone wants to meet in the lobby of the 
Tropicana sometime Friday before Hacker Jeopardy.  Nobody has stated 

a concrete time yet so I guess we'll all just wander through the 
lobby every now and then.  Any suggestions on a time?
