Try Harry Browne (http://www.rahul.net/browne).  I'm 100% certain that he 
would be willing to support cryptographic rights and freedom of internet 
speech.

The Religious Right brings their agenda to the public spotlight because
they become incredibly involved in local politics on a nationwide basis
and have the knowledge, means, and money to influence politics at this
level.  Very few people who are outside the political process realize the
amount of organization, dedication, and dollars required to achieve
political validity.
