On ABC's latenight news program I just saw a story that renewed my faith 
that there is a God and he is brown.  It seems that the Alabama Milita 
was able to film a ATF event that was truly horrifing to behold.  Nigger 
Hunging Licenses and the works.  Well our friends in Alabama gave the 
tapes to ABC and the story was blown wide open.  Our friends from Alabama 
in the pursuit of the ATF did the world a great service and completely 
restored my faith in America.
