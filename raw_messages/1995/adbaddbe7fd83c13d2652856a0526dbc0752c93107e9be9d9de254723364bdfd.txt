One important thing to note in an academic environment is that if you 
have foreign students who are on non-green card visas, you may need to 
get an export licence if they can access the server. I expect you'll 
probably get the licence without too much hassle, and you're unlikely to 
be indicted for this, but it's something to be aware of.
