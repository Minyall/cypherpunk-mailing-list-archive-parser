Sounds cool, but...

I already have PGP on my Macs. Why would I want this?

I suppose one use might be in a public lab, where a secret key and
identity would be inappropriate. Or maybe to encrypt your PGP keychains if
you leave them on a physically insecure hard drive (though you could use
PGP conventional encryption for that).
