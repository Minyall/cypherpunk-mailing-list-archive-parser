<plonk>! I'm so tired of listening to this no-researching,
no-paying-attention, out-to-make-money freak I just can't
stand it. Consider Mr. fc@all.net hereby removed from my
mailbox by virtue of the autofiltering capability of my
lovely mailreader.

Fred: *RTFWP* and stop complaining about things you know
nothing about. Feh.
