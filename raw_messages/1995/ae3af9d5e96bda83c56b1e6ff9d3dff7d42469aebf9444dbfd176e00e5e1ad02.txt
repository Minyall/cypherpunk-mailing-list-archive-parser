I've given plenty of justification. You can't reverse map keys. Isn't
that bad enough?

Ahem.

Next you'll tell us that the hosts.txt database was a great idea and
you see no reason why we should have built the DNS. After all, host
addresses are only 32 bits, so the problem of mapping them into
hostnames should be easy to do in a flat database, right?

If you'd like to volunteer to run the centralized databases containing
the (at least) five billion keys for the population of the planet,
including handling tens to hundreds of billions of hits against them
per day, and probably tens of millions of updates per day (perhaps
you'd like us to enter them by hand, too?) and you'd like to supply
this service for free, then we will certainly be willing to talk.

Until you volunteer, however, leave the engineering to the people with
some experience in building large scale systems?

(Sure, TRW can store 100 million records in a giant database and index
them purely by a single unstructured number. 'taint cheap or fast,
however, and it certainly isn't amenable to decentralized maintainance
of the data.)
