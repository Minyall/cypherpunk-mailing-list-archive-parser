Found this quote from the Electronic Telegraph, the online version of
a UK daily newspaper. (world news section, Weds 20th Sept)
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/et/access?ac=116192744309&pg=//95/9/20/wunab20.html

"Editors forced to print manifesto of Unabomber

By Charles Laurence in New York

...The heart of his argument is that industrial society has led to ways of 
life for which people are fundamentally unsuited. He calls for a 
crypto-anarchic revolution and a new order based on small, village-style units."
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Uh? Crypto-anarchic? Surely he's not one of ours? ;-) ;-) ;-)
