The UK government looks at many things. Just because the US govt wants to do 
something daft and the UK wants to watch does not mean the UK wants to emulate 
it.

The UK laabour party is opposed to key escrow "we do not accept the "clipper 
chip" argument". The Tories have less than half the level of popular support and 
are barely recognisable as a government.
