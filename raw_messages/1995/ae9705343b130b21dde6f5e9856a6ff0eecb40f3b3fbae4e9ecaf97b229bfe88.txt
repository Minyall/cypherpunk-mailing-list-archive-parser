The new netscape mail reader is quite nice, but a little too
automatic for my tastes. If one mails a java applet as an
attachment, doing "Get New Mail" with the mailed document
as the next message, automatically starts the applet in your mail
display. Of course, the wonderful Java security mechanism is
protecting you. 

Otherwise the java mail stuff is quite reasonable. I predict
it gains wide acceptance.
