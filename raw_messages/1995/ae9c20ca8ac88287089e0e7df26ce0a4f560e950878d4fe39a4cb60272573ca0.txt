The next DC-area cypherpunks meeting will be next Saturday afternoon
at Digex's headquarters in suburban Maryland.  Please mark
your calendars.

Directions, maps, and exact time will be published soon.

Doug Humphrey says that the office is less than one mile from
public transportation. Carpools worked for the last meeting,
so I expect rides from Northern Virginia and even Baltimore can
be arrainged.
