Duh.  The point of the article the original poster quoted was that
there's little risk to individual *consumers*.  If someone sniffs
thirty thousand credit cards from a poorly secured web-site, the
consumers are still only liable for $50.  Of course, the card company
gets a big bill, and probably will try to sue the site to recover, and
both will pass those costs back to the consumer, assuming they
survive.  The total cost is still pretty small to the individual.
