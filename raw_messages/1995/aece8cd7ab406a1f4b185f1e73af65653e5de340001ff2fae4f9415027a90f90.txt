Or c2.org, which might then make things interesting if the theft is detected.
(in a very perverse, and tooth-gnashingly aggravating way, of course).
Would Sameer cooperate with the LEAs to catch "an anonymous suspect using
his service"? 

What if it's an ecash password getting stolen? Who's liable? (lemme 
guess, your money's gone, tough luck!) What if you're just a dumb 
gullible computer newbie who trusts ecash for its vaunted security? 
"But how was I supposed to know that if I let someone surf my 
shoulder, I'd lose my bank account!?" I'd say buyer beware! but he'd 
sue and the public will want a law ("Damn it, consumers have to be 
PROTECTED!").
Credit only has $50 worth of risk, most people are more interested in 
keeping their $ than their privacy. Just look at the number of them who 
enter contests.

Disclaimer: I don't have a marktwain account at the moment, so I can't
say a thing about the security of the system. I wish them the absolute best of 
luck.
