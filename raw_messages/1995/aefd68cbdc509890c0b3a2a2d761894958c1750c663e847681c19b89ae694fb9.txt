Reviewed in The New Yorker (August 21&28 issue) is the novel 
"Galatea 2.2" by Richard Powers, wherein a neural net is nurtured
by an English Literature professor "to counterfeit human responses
to the Master's Comprehensive Exam, which calls for the interpretation
of set texts".  The review makes me want to read this book.
