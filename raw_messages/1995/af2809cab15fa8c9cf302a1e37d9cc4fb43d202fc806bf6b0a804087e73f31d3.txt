   "Internet Users Spooked About Spies' New Role."

      Web Review reported last week that the company in charge
      of assigning domain names, Network Solutions Inc., had
      been acquired by Science Applications International
      Corp., a closely held company which has many former
      intelligence and defense officials on its board. Web
      Review raised questions about whether SAIC is acting as
      camouflage for the government. Users of the Internet,
      which was originally created as a communications medium
      for Defense Department researchers, are reacting to the
      news with hostility. "I don't want a spook corporation,
      particularly a private spook corporation, to be anywhere
      near a control point on the global cooperative
      Internet," says James Warren.
