I don't think the differential Cryptanalysis attack helps very much. You
need a somewhat improbable quantity of chosen plaintext to attempt it.

You would get further with a direct attack I suspect. In any case lets do 
RC4-48 or RC4-44 first as proof of ability.


Another idea, lets crack CMDF, IBMs weakened key DES.

After DES the only other crack of interest thats in range is the meet in the 
middle attack on two key DES. Clipper looks a bit off in the distance still.
(We will get it one day, probably not until 2010 though).

I think we can probably do DES within two years.
