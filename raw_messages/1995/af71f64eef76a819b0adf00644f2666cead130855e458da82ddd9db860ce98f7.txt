The what U.S. law says and what U.S. officials can enforce are two
different things.  You are in violation of ITAR if you send crypto
software from Mexico to Europe over the INTERNET if it is routed
through the U.S..  Think of it like drugs being shipped through the
U.S., the drug lord that sent it throught is just as guilt under U.S.
law as the mule that is carrying it.  The problem is that ITAR was not
writen to take the current situation into consideration.  It is writen
to deal with physical equipment and concepts that only a small number
of people understand.  Given those perameters ITAR would work, but
given the current climate of readily available crypto software and
wide spread understanding of crypto technologies ITAR cannot do what
it was designed to do.

Quite to the contrary, U.S. law applies whereever the U.S. can enforce
it.  Their are  many U.S. laws that the U.S. attempts to enforce
outside the U.S..  One example is that the U.S. law allows the
abduction of those who have murdered U.S. citizens outside the United
States.  This law is in place in an attempt to protect U.S. citizens
from terorism.  If you do not believe me just ask Manuel Noriega
(sp?).
