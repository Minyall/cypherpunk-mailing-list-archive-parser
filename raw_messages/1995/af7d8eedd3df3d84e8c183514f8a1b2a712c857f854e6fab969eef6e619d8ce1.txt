EXON is a control character sent to some terminals to stop input and
output.  To restore normal mode, you send an EXOFF.  See an ASCII
chart for the exact figures.

(Yes, I am just being a little sarcastic.  But, you know, EXON would
stop input and output, so the analogy is a little scary... anyway,
Exon is a gas station, right?)
