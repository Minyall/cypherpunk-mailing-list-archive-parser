Lets train them. Someone post their email addresses so we can send them all
the RFCs for their education. :) They need to know what the hell they are

I wonder if the biology lists get this, some wannabe hero posting how billions

mentioned a well known fact that an amount of various bacteria and toxins
exist in all living mammals.

Werd.
