It sounds like you are liable to start reinventing parts of the field of
information retrieval. The automatic construction and comparison of vectors
of document parameters, as you suggested in the part I omitted, is one 
approach that has met with some success. (The common problem is, given a set
of query attributes or a model document, to find relevant documents matching
the query or similar to the model document. A variety of relevance measures
has been considered.)

I can't give you any specific pointers, but I advise you to check out 
existing implementations of these and other techniques for information
retrieval before you spend too much time writing new code.

FWIW, I _do_ think that such tactics would be very effective in combatting 
much of the spam served up these days.

Last time I looked, Raph's software already encrypts ping messages to 
remailers that have PGP keys. I assume you intend to perform the spam check
after removing the optional outer layer of encryption on each incoming
message.

Perhaps the ping messages would survive unscathed if you only applied the
spam scan to messages larger than some minimum size. I haven't seen too many
1 or 2 line spams.
