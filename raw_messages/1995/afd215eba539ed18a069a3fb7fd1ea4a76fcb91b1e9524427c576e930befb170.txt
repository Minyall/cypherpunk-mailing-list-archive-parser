Many idiot savants can multiply extremely large numbers, though I have 
not read of numbers with a hundred digits being involved.  Factoring 
large numbers is an extremely different kettle of fish, and I know of 
no writing about idiot savants doing difficult factoring.  If you have 
references to any such performances, I'd like to read them.
 
Szent Georgi's remark was addressed to general intelligenc in everyday 
life, not to bravura arithmetic.  My scepticism about all things IQish 
was supposed to be indicated by my use of quotation marks on "IQ".
