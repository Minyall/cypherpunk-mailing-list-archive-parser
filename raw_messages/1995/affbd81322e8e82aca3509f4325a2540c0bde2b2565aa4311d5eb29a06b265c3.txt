Encryption does little to protect you from hidden cameras and microphones (or  
informants!).  If you already know your target then you can probably get  
around encryption (sure it's not as simple as a wiretap, but hey, nobody said  
it had to be easy).  Encryption prevents 'fishing expeditions' and  
unauthorized monitoring;  this is what the LEAs don't want to admit.
