All this netscape-bashing reminds me ...

Doesn't anyone think it's sad-funny now that every styrofoam coffee cup has
to be labeled "Warning The Beverage You Are About To Consume Is Hot!!" 

The reality is, we don't want to get burned.  But the coffee is hot. So
you try to have some reasonable compromise since lukewarm coffee is just
not appetizing.
