Deep thinking Duncan, government bad, me good. . . . . . 

I presume in your moral superiority you also refuse to use public roads 
and bridges, purchase your food supplies on the black market to ensure 
that they could not possibly have been USDA inspected, and in every other 
way endeavor to never eat the fruit of the poisoned tree that is the USGovt.
What a heap of self-righteous horseshit.  

Just call me a modern Mengele, and excuse me while I go bathe in the 
blood of millions. . . . .
