Gidday all

I emailed Jim Clark day before yesterday about his comments re key escrow.
He responded.  As it's not good form to post private email, might I suggest
that one of the 'elders' here put to Jim a list of questions on the proviso
that his answers can be posted to the list.  You never know, a lot of
speculation might be confirmed or denied.

cheers

Peter
