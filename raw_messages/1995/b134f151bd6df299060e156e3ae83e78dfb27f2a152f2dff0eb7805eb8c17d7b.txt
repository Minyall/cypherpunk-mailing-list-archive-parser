I'm not so sure. There may be hidden patterns we don't notice. Its on
little things like this that a cryptanalyst would try to pry open a
hole in a system. I'm unwilling to predict that the patterns are
unguessable based purely on gut instinct. As Bob Morris of the NSA has
said, never underestimate the effort your advesary will go to in order
to read your traffic.

I'll stick to recommending radioactive sources for now. Quantum
mechanics is your friend, and detectors from places like Aware are
cheap.
