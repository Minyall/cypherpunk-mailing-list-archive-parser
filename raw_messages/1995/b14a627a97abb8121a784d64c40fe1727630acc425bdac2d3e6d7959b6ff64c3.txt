If I understand, you can't sue the governemtn for just trying to pass a 
law, or for even passing it.  What has to happen is that somebody needs 
to be arrested and charged with breaking the law before you can challenge 
them.

Although publishing an "Enemies of the Constitution" list all over the 
net, listing which congress-critters opposed the constitution (suck as 
Exon) might be interesting.  Might even make a good web project.  *ponders*
