Due to the ITAR, you have to get it from Lance Cottrell by request (and you
have to be in the U.S./Canada):

Message size can best be handled by using a remailer which uses messages
which never change size. Mixmaster is now ready for testing.
It still does not run on Linux or FreeBSD. I don't know what else it does
run on. It works great on Sun machines with gcc.

Since it is export restricted, send me mail and I will send you the name of
the hidden directory to get the file.

His primary account is loki@nately.ucsd.edu; he also has a dialup account --
lcottrell@popmail.ucsd.edu. He's on the c'punks list (Hi Lance !).

In addition to being backwards-compatible with the Finney/Ghio/Hughes format
of remailer messages, Mixmaster supports a new message format in which all
original messages are chopped/padded for transmission, resulting in a uniform
packet size. Mixmaster also automatically reorders messages of all formats, 
using a fixed-size pool.

Mixmaster is designed around PGPTools, with the intent to support full use of
PGP. Unfortunately I've seen some empirical evidence that PGP messages don't
quite work with the system at present. Neither of the Mixmaster remailers of
which I'm aware ("mix" and "q") is indicated as supporting PGP in Raph's
current list. Solving this apparent problem, and porting Mixmaster to Ultrix
(might be trivial, I haven't tried yet) are among my top c'punk priorities
right now.

Of course it would be nice to produce an exportable version of Mixmaster too...
