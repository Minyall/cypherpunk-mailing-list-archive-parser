So?  The ITAR doesn't control export to Canada.  Export the source code
to Canada, compile, validate, sign, and put on CD in Canada, and export
to the world.

I also seem to remember a while back (Mar/Apr) someone reported here that the
Canadian bureaucrat responsible for executing import/export rules said
that he didn't consider crypto to be restricted by Canada's rules.
