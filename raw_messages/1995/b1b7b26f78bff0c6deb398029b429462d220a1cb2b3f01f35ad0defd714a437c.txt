Perry - I don't think NTP goes down to the sort of resolution that 
appeared to be where the signal is here, and for quantisation reasons, I 
don't think it can work over a public routed internetwork. I'm still open 
to having my mind changed here; my network weenie gut instincts tell me 
that routing is too non-random for the signal to propogate. 

[I may have misread the paper, but the accuracy required seemed to be on 
the order of 10-100 usecs; if I've got that wrong, could someone mail me 
an OOM to be working with]
