Many of the messages in talk.politics.china are anonymous.

They use anon.penet.fi

Many of these messages are in Chinese, not ASCII.

This is an obvious example of legitimate use of anonymity.

In addition this example makes an association in peoples minds
between suppressing anonymity, and discouraging dissent.
