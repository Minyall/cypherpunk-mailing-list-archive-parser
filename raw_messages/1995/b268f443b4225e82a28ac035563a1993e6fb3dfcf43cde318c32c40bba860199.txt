  This idea is similar to an approach I posted a month or so ago
entitled "anonymous name resolution" which uses shamir sharing
to break up the recipient's address so that there is no first remailer
to coerce.

  The idea is that you should not deliver to e-mail addresses on
the remailer network, but to "handles", these handles will be
distributed across a DNS-like system that splits up the handles
using shamir sharing. No server stores the handle->email mapping,
but the whole network can perform the mapping. Remailers don't deliver
the message to the final destination, but deliver pieces of the
message to the anonymous name resolver network which perform the
final delivery.
