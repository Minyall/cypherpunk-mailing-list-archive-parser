This doesn't fall into line with the "mainstream" of personal computing, of
course, but does anyone know if there is a planned release for a Linux
version, preferably with SoundBlaster support? I mention Soundblaster
support because, even though it's old, it seems to be the standard, at least
indirectly. The GUS has a Soundblaster emulation mode, for instance, if I'm
not mistaken.

Of course I suppose the real reason I'm asking is because I run Linux and
have a Soundblaster. :)
