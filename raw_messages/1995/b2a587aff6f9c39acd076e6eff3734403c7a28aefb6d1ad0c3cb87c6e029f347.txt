	I'm impressed.  I accessed it in Lynx and it was
	*perfect* -- not a single inline <IMG> without an 
	appropriate Alt= attribute.

	As a quick test I did a search on something that I 
	new I'd posted to the comp.lang.awk newsgroups within
	that last couple of days.  It found them almost
	instantly (except that it was apparently arranged 
	chronologically -- so I had to hunt through several pages
	of [Next Set of Matches] links to find my stuff.

	(Sorry no cypher relevance I can add to this -- but 
	put that URL in your bookmarks folks).
