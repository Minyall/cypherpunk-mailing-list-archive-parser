I don't quite agree with the last part. It might be educational to do a spot
of cryptanalysis in an attempt to determine the nature of the proprietary
algorithm used. It wouldn't be "cracking" the password protection, but I
think the general effort to "out" proprietary crypto algorithms is productive,
particularly in the case of major software packages.

Anyone feel like putting together some sample plaintext/ciphertext pairs ?
