Hmmm... this could be combined with the "subway" remailer idea too. Have
a message format that can contain multiple destinations and a script lang
also can pick up and drop off messages, and messages can specify if they
are to be picked up or dropped off, etc.... endless possibilities...

I don't have the C/Unix skills to even attempt this though.
