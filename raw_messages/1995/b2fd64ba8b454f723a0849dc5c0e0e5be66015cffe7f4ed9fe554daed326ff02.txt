I've seen the idea of voluntary key escrow discussed before on this list. 
(And no, not the government's idea of "voluntary", either.) A question I 
would raise is this: What would be the ideal setup for an escrow agency? 
If I were to open up an agency for business, what would be some 
characteristics you would look for?
