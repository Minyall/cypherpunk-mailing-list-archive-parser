  Unfortunately priorities are mixed up here.  Reputation should be more 
important, unless Alice is actually a group of teenagers that are just 
having fun at the lists expense, and could care less what they write as 
long as it gets a response.  If the writer actually cared about his 
reputation then a digital signature would be the best way to go, but a 
different encryption scheme should be used for the signature than the 
message.
  Just my $0.02, but if Alice continues to just not care about his 
reputation, and people can't verify that the same writer(s) wrote it, 
then maybe ignoring posts would be a good choice.
  Take care and have fun.
