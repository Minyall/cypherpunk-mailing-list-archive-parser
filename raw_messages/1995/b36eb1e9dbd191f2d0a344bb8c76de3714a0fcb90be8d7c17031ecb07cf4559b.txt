For communication, the only credential Alice needs to ensure that only Bob
can read her message is that she uses Bob's public key. If "Bob the Key"
reads it, presumably it was "Bob the Person" who read it.

(Again, Bob the Key = Bob the Person to many of us. If Bob the Person has
let his private key out, so that Chuck the Person is also able to read the
Bob the Key stuff, etc., then of course cryptography cannot really handle
this situtation.)
