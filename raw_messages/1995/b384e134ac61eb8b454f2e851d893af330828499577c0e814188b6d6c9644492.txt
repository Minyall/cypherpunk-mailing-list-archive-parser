    You say MIME, and you've not completely specified the data format,
    but rather constrained it in a way that most everybody basically
    agrees with, including me.

Could one of the MIME supporters (I guess that would be `most
everybody') explain why anything more than a To: header and an
encrypted block is desireable for the in-the-clear message?

Specifically, why is it desireable to broadcast additional information
about a message for which privacy is a primary concern?
