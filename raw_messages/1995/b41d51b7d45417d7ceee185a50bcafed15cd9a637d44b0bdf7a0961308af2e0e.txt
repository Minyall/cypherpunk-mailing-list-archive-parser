Can anyone out there vouch for the interoperability of PGP 2.6 ui with 
versions of PGP available in USA from MIT & Viacrypt.

What about the legal issue ?
Is it legal for a US citizen to encrypt or check signatures with a 2.6ui 
public key ?
Would sending a public key out of the US be reagarded as export by ITAR?

Thanks
Geoff Klein.
