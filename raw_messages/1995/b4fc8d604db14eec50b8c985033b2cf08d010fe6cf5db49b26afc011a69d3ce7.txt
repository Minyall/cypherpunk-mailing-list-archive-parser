How did you measure the entropy of the output ?

Ah, well the idea is that they can just generate a OTP when they have a 
few spare hours, not that they'd be generating it in real-time. The 
Privtool code does use realtime generation of random numbers, but it has 
a lot of input data other than the audio (e.g. mouse movements, MD5 
hashes, etc).
