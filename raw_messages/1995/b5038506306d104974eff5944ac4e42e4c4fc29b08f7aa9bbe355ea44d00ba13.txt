Nah, I'm not kidding...I have to write code that runs on LOTS of platforms
including macs, pcs, and lots of variants of Unix...I assume there's a
lot of others that do as well...you have to make money where you can, and
even with free software given out to the net, you want to make it portable
as a matter of pride.
