Ha!  I reported a serious problem to Netscape ten days ago, on Thursday
the twelfth.  They haven't even returned an answer to my email yet nor
even acknowledged its receipt. 

Yep, I guess that their check is in the mail ....

Has anyone else seen or heard anything??  T-shirt's, mugs, checks, or 
email being returned or answered??
