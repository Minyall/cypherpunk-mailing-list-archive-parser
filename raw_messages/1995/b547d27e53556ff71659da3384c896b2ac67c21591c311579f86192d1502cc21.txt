I don't run Linux, and every time I open my mouth it seems to provoke
a flame-fest, but I'll risk responding anyway.

I'm told that all version of CFS since 1.0.4 (the latest is 1.3.1)
do work out-of-the-box under *some* releases of Linux and with some
coaxing on the others.

I'm not sure exactly what problem you're having, but the most common
CFS-Linux problem that people complain about has to do with the rpcgen
output not being in the format expected by the rest of CFS.  There
seem to be two things you can do about this:  get a version of rpcgen
that generates the "standard" (original Sun) names for the functions it
generates, or just grab the rpcgen output from the cfs-users mailing list
archive ("echo help | mail cfs-users-request@research att.com" for details).

Or are you able to compile it but not get it installed?  I've not heard
of any problems here.  If so, you might try the cfs-users@research.att.com
mailing list and see if someone there can help out.
