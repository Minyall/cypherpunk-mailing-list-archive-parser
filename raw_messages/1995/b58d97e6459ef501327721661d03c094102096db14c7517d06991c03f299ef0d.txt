I just sent this email to Sandy Sandfort,  and he suggested I 
share it with the list:

-------------------
I was just at BlockBuster Music store this evening and happened 
to go by the 'H's in the Rock Music section  -  and saw Hakim 
Bey's name.  Yes, there is a CD names T.A.Z *.    Blockbuster 
allows customers to listen to CDs before they buy, so I 
listened to it.   Hakim actually reads several chapters from 
his book, and there is odd music at the introduction and in the 
background while he reads.    He has a very nice, deep, clear 
voice.

I guess you could say this is one of those self-help 
books-on-tape   -  sort of a "save time & become an anarchist 
while you drive" CD.
