BTW, I was just reading in LAN TIMES, I think, that Microsoft NT 3.5 is 
about to be giving C2 status from the NCSC. They stated that it took over 
a year to pass it. They also mention that Novell Netware is going the 
same tests and it should have its C2 status in about 6 months to a year.
Though you would like to know.
