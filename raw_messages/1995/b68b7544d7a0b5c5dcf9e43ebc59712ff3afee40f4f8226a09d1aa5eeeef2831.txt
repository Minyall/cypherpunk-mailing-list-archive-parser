  We've already thought of a lot of the stuff you guys have brought up,
and tried to address them in our design.  I'm also taking note on things
we didn't think of.

  There will be various "domains" that you can trust a CA for, including
SSL, e-mail, and payment.  You will be able to enable and disable trust
for specific server certs as well.  You could say, "I don't trust
verisign, but I will trust Joe's Internet Coffee Shop(which happens
to be signed by verisign)".
