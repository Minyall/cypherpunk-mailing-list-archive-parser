Well, what do you think of my latest predicament. My first book, "Agents
Unleashed" will be retitled "Agents At Large" because SAMS, a division of
Viacom, considers any title ending with the word "unleashed" to be an
infringement of their tradedress. They came up with enough legal
mumbo-jumbo about trademark to scare my publisher into changing it.
