The project must be of type "ssl" (look at the properties box to make 
sure).  ssl is the only search engine currently built in to the client, 
more will be added as challenges are planned.

Piete: I notice that you've renamed the original challenge to "sslold" 
and the test to "sslck" which causes the client to not recognise them!  
Any chance you can put them back to "ssl" so folks can test their clients?
