[Describes lots of steps...]

I'm really not that convinced that this is a problem in either
direction. With users everywhere on the net connected via
multi-megabit per second links, high speed CPUs, etc, a few extra TCP
connections and RSA operations really might not be noticed in a half
dozen years.

Again, I'm not convinced either way. I believe we have to wait and see
how fast things really are in practice.
