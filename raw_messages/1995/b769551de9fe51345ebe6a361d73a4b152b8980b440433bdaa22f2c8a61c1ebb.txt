	As someone who has hacked a little I would say that sloppy coding 
(much like netscape's) has helped hackers far more than lack of 
encryption.  Imagine for a moment if sun had included some form of 
encryption (maybe in nfs ?) in sunos 4.x.x,  would it have been 
effective if it had as many holes as sendmail, etc.. ?

	Good algorithms well coded will hurt hackers. Good algorithms 
slopply coded will simply provide hackers with one more toy to abuse, 
while giving average people a false since of security (but you SAID it 
was strong crypto, so why did they get my credit card number ?)
