Last week I attended a lecture given by Dexter Kozen at Cornell, on 
"Efficient Algorithms for Optimal Transmission of Video Data". He
mentioned in passing a couple of approaches to choosing data that may 
acceptably be lost in the process (i.e. without excessive picture quality
degradation). One scheme (which I believe counts as a "corona method") 
involves simply discarding the LSBs of all the encoded pixels or whatnot. 
This method was not at all a focus of the talk. Anyway, I thought
I'd mention it as another minor potential threat to the use of LSB
steganography in video transmission, e.g. MPEG streams.
