I don't know which is the "best" encrypting file system for MS-DOS.  I
currently use Peter Gutmann's SFS, and am very happy with it.  I have used
SecureDevice (from Max Loewenthal and Arthur Helwig) in the past, and
found it painfully slow on my 25MHz 386SX.  I also know of Mike Ingle's
SecureDrive, but I have not used it.  SFS and SecureDrive require a
separate partition.  SecureDevice uses a container file instead of a
separate partition. 

You also asked about Linux.  I think that Matt Blaze's CFS would work 
there, but I don't know.
