	Are you sure TA is still an art?  The NSA has (presumably)
spent thousands of man years on the problem.  Hal, Wei Dai and others
have done some very good work.  While I've only skimmed the surface of
it, its clear that clever statistical work comprises a lot of TA.  It
may be that the FBI has a couple of Suns handling the whole remailer
network right now.

	Also, if anyone wants to lok at the archives, the best thread
is subject reordering vs. latency.
