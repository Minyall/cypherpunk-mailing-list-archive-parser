It's a PGP-aware mailer for SunOS/Linux, and has the most
highly-integrated PGP interface that I know of (e.g. just tick a
check-box to encrypt/sign/remail). Even a newbie Windows user can handle
that much..

Well, someone's (mm@qpsx.oz.au, dunno if they're on the list) already done 
that for MS-Mail, at least in Beta form, according to their article on 
alt.security.pgp... However, their message implies that you have to use 
extra commands on the menus in order to deal with PGP mail, it's not 
just there waiting for you to tick the box..
