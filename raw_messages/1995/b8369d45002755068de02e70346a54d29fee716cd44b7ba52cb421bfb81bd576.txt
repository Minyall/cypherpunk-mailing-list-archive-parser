Yes; however It's not so much the compression ratio I was concerned with 
other than that it demonstrates the level of abstraction achieved in the 
analysis.  For crypto we wouldn't really mind if the intermediate fractal 
file were actually larger than the original and I assume that these 
techniques can be lossless if we are willing to accept this tradeoff.

What I think is remarkable about the example of compression and
enlargement is that with the process of enlargement, image *detail* is 
added in a manner consistent with the original.  (!!!)  By altering the 
decompression with a hidden message one would of course be, replacing 
or adding information, and if the goal were to have this new information 
"blend in" with its container, then perhaps we could learn from fractal 
compression.
