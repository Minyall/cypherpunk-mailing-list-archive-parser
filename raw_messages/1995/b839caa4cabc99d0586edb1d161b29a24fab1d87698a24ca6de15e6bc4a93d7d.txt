I, and many other Linux users that I know, have repeatedly contacted
Netscape offering to pay for a Linux version of Navigator - we have usually
been either 'brushed off' or completely ignored.  And now there is no
mention of a Linux port of v2.0 - not surprising that this 'rumor' is
running around.  I think a statement by you or someone else at Netscape
supporting a Linux version would go a long way in reassuring the Linux
community, even if it's something that is going to take a while.

And you might want to drop by the usenet comp.os.linux.* hierarchy - 
they're already working on ways to use your html extensions to design
web pages  that can't be read by Navigator ...
