Fi! You would not suggest that anyone would do that, do you?

There are other ways to get it out, no? For instance, shortly after it
is out, call the police stating that your home was burgled.

Items missing? A few disks of publicly-available freeware.

So what? *The Security of the Nation is at risk!*


Good luck!
