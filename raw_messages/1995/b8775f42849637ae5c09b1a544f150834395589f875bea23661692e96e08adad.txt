BTW, I compiled it and confirmed that decryption is the inverse of
encryption for at least one (key, plaintext) pair..

It looks very much like the sort of typo you would get from a
mistranslation from assembly language if the target architecture had a
*4-bit* processor. (This is also consistant with the "<<4"'s which
show up in several places in the code).

The typo is consistant -- it shows up every time the key schedule is
referenced; it looks like a semi-mechanical translation was done..
