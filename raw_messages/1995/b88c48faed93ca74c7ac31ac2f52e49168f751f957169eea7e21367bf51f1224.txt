I was being facetious. The point is that the government has no
inherent right to tap our phones -- indeed, it didn't do so for nearly
the first 200 years of our existance, and we did just fine -- better,
in fact. Who among us has felt SAFER since they gained the ability?
Has anyone been feeling more and more safe with time, since the more
and more draconian laws granting the government more and more
authority should have been "fixing" things, right?

Actually, thats a complete misinterpretation of Nietzsche, but thats
another story.
