Let me be perfectly clear.

I have no idea who or what you are. You post constant streams of
unparseable garbage (presumably produced by your very own wetware
rather than a random string generator but its hard to tell) to this
mailing list. So long as the stuff bears some passing resemblance to
discussion of cryptography, well, its not up to me to criticize you
just for being incomprehensable.  

However, it appears that you have some sort of weird problem with
First Virtual that you don't have the common sense to resolve in
private. Please deal with it privately. Its possible that I'm wrong
and that you are discussing cryptography, but as your english prose is
completely indecipherable to this cryptographer there is no way
whatsoever to know, which makes it as good as irrelevant.

PS If your postings are in fact some sort of weird stegonographic
cover for some meaningful message, which is one possible (unlikely)
explanation for them, I would suggest posting them to alt.test
instead.
