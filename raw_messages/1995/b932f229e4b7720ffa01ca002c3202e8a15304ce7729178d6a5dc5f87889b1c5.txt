Perhaps it costs you "nothing," Perry, but not all of us have the
massively parrallel 64-way interleaved banked memory nanosecond-latency
box you have on your desk.

Since RSA decryption is cubic in key size, it takes about twenty times
as long to sign or decrypt a message. Since latency-hiding (for example,
caching the decrypted session keys) is not widely implemented, the user
actually sees the difference.

For applications such as remailers, a 20-fold factor can make the
difference between smooth operation and totally hosing the machine.

Another reason to use small keys is to communicate the relative insecurity
of the machine to senders. A 382-bit key says, loud and clear, "don't send
sensitive or incriminating information using this key."
