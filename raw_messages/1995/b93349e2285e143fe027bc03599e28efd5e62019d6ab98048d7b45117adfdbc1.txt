On the topic of risks for a "major browser" to be tempered/targetted
as a virus :

I asked monthes ago netscape folks to make md5sum and/or PGP digital
signatures (preferably md5sum of each files, this in a file, itself
pgp signed) of the binaries available on their page and on relevant 
newsgroup to reduce possibility of tempering.

[ok it won't help mythical joe six pack's but...]

Maybe I'll got more luck calling from here :-)
