Many people have suggested improvements to the techinical side of brutessl.
I don't think anyone has looked at the user interface side of things. A
simple configure script, and a few more reasonable defaults would bring
quite a few more volunteers. I know of at least a handful of people who did
not contribute because they were overwhelmed by the unfriendly scripts.

While a rough user interface could serve as a basic intelligence test, I
don't think that this sort of exclusion is necessary, given the nature of
the task.
