A graphic-arts chum of mine is really hyper about cycle sales - it will
allow him to produce broadcast-quality commercials on a project-by-project
basis without a huge initial hardware upgrade investment. Is anyone working
on a Java libarary/demo/whatnot that allows plug-in algorithms, work
completion 'fetch next batch' code, and some rudimentary authentication
scheme? If not, I may tinker with this - if so, I'd like to chat :)
