What do you mean "you people"?  There are <lots> of people on this list,
with lots of different opinions.  Don't attribute this kvetching to
Cypherpunks in general.  In fact, don't attribute <any> opinion to
Cypherpunks in general.  Probably most of the non-press members here share
an interest in helping people communicate privately, but that's about it.

We're all individuals here.
