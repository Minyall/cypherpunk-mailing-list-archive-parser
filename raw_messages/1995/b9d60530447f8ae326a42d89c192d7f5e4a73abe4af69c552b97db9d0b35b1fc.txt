I am writting a program called Encrypted TCP Tunneler, which I hope to
finish in a month or so.  It will allow a secure link to be set up between
an ETT client and an ETT server, using Diffie-Hellman and DSA for
authenticated key exchange, and Blowfish for encryption.  A user will be
able to open a TCP connection to the client and have that connection
transparently tunnel across the secure link to a TCP address on the other
side. 

I see several uses for this program, such as secure telnet, secure web 
access, and access to a secure network across an insecure network.  I 
realize the program will no be as useful when IPv6 becomes widely 
available, but that may not happen for a while.  Also, this program can 
be used on top of IP security to give users (as opposed to system admins) 
more control over their own security.

Please send comments and suggestions.
