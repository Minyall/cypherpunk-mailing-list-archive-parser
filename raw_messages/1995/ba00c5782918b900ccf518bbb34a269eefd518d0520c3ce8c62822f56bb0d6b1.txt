Jeff,

Yes Fortezza cards can be instructed to produce a random number through one
of its library calls (someday they'll have a real API).  One of the
diagnostic tools I had tested this function.  What algorithm do they use?
Haven't a clue.  Sources say that the RNG implementation may vary from vendor
to vendor (i.e., GTC, Spyrus, Mykotronix, etc.).
