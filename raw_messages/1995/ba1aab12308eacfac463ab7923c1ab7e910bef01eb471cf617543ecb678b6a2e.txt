   This is quite sensible given that in the Zone universe, you may have no
   idea how much computing power your enemies have, so no cryptography
   that is only computationally secure can really be trusted.

I asked Vernor about this one a few months ago.  He got lucky on this
one.  He thought that some advances in theory might render the whole
idea ridiculous.  It was not the case that he was considering relative
computational power, which works much better in context, especially
given the hints of some computational power beyond Turing machines.

A great one-liner about debating public-key, in any case.
