Hi all,

 I have been doing some crypto consulting to small businesses for a while,
but it looks like I may be swimming with bigger fish in the near future. I
was wondering what "real" crypto consultants are getting these days. I will
be advising these people on the security of systems others are developing,
and helping them develop their own software, but I have no idea what the
market value of my time is.

Reply to the list, or send a message encrypted to the key below to

        Many thanks,
           Anonymous Consultant
