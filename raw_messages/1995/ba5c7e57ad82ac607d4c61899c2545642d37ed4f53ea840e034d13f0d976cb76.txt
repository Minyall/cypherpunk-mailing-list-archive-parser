Much has been said lately about maintaining anonymity for remailer
users while providing some "pay to play" mechanism for the operator.
Absent strong collusion between operators, doesn't remailer chaining
ensure anonymity? Plenty of movie "bad guys" escape by getting on the
subway because no one knows where they'll get off or change lines.
It seems to me that knowing a person entered the system is far less
information than knowing where they exited. As long as remailers have
guaranteed access to other remailers, anonymity should be maintained. 

Re: collusion; I'd sooner believe the Macro$oft/RCC fable.
In a gadda da vida, Billy.
