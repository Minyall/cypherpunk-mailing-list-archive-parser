Owen Lynn sez:
: Eric,

: I was there in 'lanta when you gave your talk at SummerCon, and I
: thoroughly enjoyed it. I was especially intrigued by some of the, um,
: fun you can have with corporations. Are there any books I can read
: that are sort of _Fun with Your Corporation for Beginners_?

Corporation as in a Delaware "Inc" ? Are there transcripts of the
