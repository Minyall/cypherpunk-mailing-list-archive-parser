	To clear up some apparent confusion: The Commerce server is
not the certificate.  The NSCP Commerce Server is an httpd.
Non-profits and educationals still need to pay Verisign for a
certificate.  They do not need to pay NSCP for a $5,000 web server.

	The certificates must be signed by an approved key signing
agency.  Anyone can produce one; to get it to interact 'securely' with
free netscape browsers you need the certificate to be signed.

	There is no word as to how to become a KSA.  Netscpe has
ignored the question on several occaisons.
