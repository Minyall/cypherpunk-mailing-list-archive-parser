One more time. Despite what you read in the papers, despite what most
people - even in the legal profession - believe, telephone wiretaps do
_not_ require a court order. They haven't required a court order in over a
year. The Digital Telephony Bill, which passed Congress by an overwhelming
margin, _explicitly_ allows for wiretap authorizations other than a court
order. The law does not impose any rules for these "other forms of
authorization".

"The captain signed it off" may suffice.
