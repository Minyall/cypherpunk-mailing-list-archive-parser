PPP/SLIP is currently not cheaper per customer - if you figure in the 
time your help desk staff put in over the first couple of weeks of a new 
customer coming on line.  Many people who have barely ever used a BBS are 
deciding they "need their internet connection" and going SLIP/PPP even 
where a shell account would do most of what they want.
