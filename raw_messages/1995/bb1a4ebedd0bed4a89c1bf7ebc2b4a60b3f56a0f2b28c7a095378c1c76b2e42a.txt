I stopped reading com-priv a year+ ago.  One of the "gadflies"
back then (name escapes me -- one of the journalists, I think, but
not Gordon Cook) said that at least the NJ NAP was moved at the last
minute.  He had proof of that.  I don't remember that he had proof that
it was moved at NSA request, although that was his claim.
