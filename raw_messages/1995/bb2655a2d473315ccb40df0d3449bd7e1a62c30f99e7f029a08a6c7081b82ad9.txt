Hi!

I'm going to be along to set up a remailer shortly.

Two questions:

Since I've only limited bucks but have certain needs, can I get a
package deal on a remailer shell account and the MX service?  What
I'd like is to have all mail to xxxx@myname.com to be forwarded to
my shell account no matter what xxxx is.  Preserving the xxxx, though.

Given the goal of limiting remailer liability, what about having
them be anonymous?  Instead of send you a check, send an unidentified
money order.  This would even allow ownership to change on a frequent
basis without the system owner knowing who the current operator is.

Thoughts?  Comments?  Offers to send cute girls?
