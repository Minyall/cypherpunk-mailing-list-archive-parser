As usual, we'll congregate in the food court in the basement of the
Tivoli, and probably wander to a nearby restaurant when we have a
quorum.  I'll try to remember to bring my newly acquired copy of
_SOLVING CIPHER PROBLEMS, Cryptanalysis, Probabilities, and Diagnostics_,
by Frank W. Lewis, for perusal by anyone interested in classical
cryptanalysis.  Email for directions, additional info, etc.
