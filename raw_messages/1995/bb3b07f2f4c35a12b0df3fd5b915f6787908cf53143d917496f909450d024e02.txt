It's got another algorithm byte - the stuff at the beginning that
says --- BEGIN PGP ENCRYPTED MESSAGE ---, letting everyone know
it's PGP.  That's one of the major risks of "algorithm bytes" -
not that it tells the Bad Guys which algorithm you're using,
but that it tells them "yes, this is crypto, not just noise".
