The Interpol, like many national police agencies, already does attempt to
police the Net. While their work against narcotics and money launderers deals
primarily with the phone network, _child_ pornography (which is legal in
places, but like all porn is illegal if non-consensual, as is usually the
case with kidporn), software piracy, and conspiracy/terrorism is hunted for
in cyberspace. For instance, there was this noise a while ago when they
stumbled on a xenophobic European BBS that had a hit-list of 'black' 
sympathizers. Naturally they aren't particularly good at net.policing, and
no one can ever really be.
