The latest issue of MEME has a pretty good interview with Nicholas 
Negroponte of the MIT Media Lab.  Some privacy issues are discussed, the 
idea of intellectual property is touched on, as well as some other good 
stuff.

I'm not sure if it's on the web, but I'll forward the interview to anyone 
who would like to have it.
