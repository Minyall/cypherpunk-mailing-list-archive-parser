	Will there be a commercially licensed version, so that things
built on SSL can be used in freeware and payware?  (Like the recently
announced commercial version of RSAREF)

	Actually, make that "When will there be.." since otherwise SSL
will be yet another standard one company uses.  Such standards are
less than useful.
