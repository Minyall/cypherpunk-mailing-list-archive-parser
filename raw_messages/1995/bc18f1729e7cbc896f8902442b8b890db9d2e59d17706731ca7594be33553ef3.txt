But if by all means available Bob and Alice satisfy themselves that
their conversation *is* secure, then (until they're proven wrong) it
might as well be.  They have satisfied themselves *at least* that
their messages are in fact encrypted at some point, just as if they
walked into a room, looked around, and satisfied themselves that there
are no hidden microphones.  I don't see how you can ever do any better
than this if you're willing to imagine arbitrary powerful
men-in-the-middle.

Gee, in my reality people already *are* bafflingly unreliable.  (You
must not be watching enough afternoon trash talk shows.)

What, however, is the real difference between the MITM scenario in a
purely electronic relationship, and a "phony personality in the
middle" attack on a "flesh" relationship?  You *think* you're working
with a realtor to buy a house, but in fact it's a con artist that
betrays your trust and rips you off.  You *think* you've found the
love of your life, but in reality it's just somebody who wants to use
you for sex.  There are no guarantees.

Let me ask this:  how do you *guarantee* that you're having a truly
private in-the-flesh correspondence with a person?  And, having done
that, how do you *guarantee* that the other person will behave in an
absolutely trustworthy fashion?

I certainly don't know how to solve it, but I wouldn't trust me if I
were you :-)
