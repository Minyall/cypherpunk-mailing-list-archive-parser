It may have been misleading to refer to a radio receiver chip:  the
noise generated by the chip will be entirely internal.  It doesn't
depend on any external signal "sneaking in"; the noise comes from
the effective resistance of the first amplifier stage.  Nothing
is being "received", in some sense; it's just a big hunk 'o gain.

A Zener diode would be fine, but the design is a bit more complex,
especially for wide bandwidths---you need to mess with biasing
voltages, speedy op-amps, interface to CMOS, and all that jazz.
You'd need external power (or a DC-DC converter).  I wanted a
super-simple design that people could just plonk down on a PC
board.  Two chips and some bypass capacitors.
