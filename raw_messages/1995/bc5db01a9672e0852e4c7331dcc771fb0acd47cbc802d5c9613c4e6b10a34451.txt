"Just cough up the peace dividend".

There is no ppeace dividend. There is a massive eco-spill of government 
debt;  quite possibly larger than the GNP capacity of the American 
economy to repay anytime in the next century.

The debt will be bankrupted, in some stealthy manner, hidden by masses of 
smoke and mirrors. Nothing new here - it's  about the only thing that 
works. For the mosrt recent examples, read up on FDR's confiscation of 
gold in (?) 1933.  Or read the detrails of the currency changeover 
effected by the occupation authorities in Germany (1947 or 1948).
