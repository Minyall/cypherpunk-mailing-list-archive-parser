McNeil Lehrer has a segment on net boogers this evening, 
reported by Time's anxious Elmer-Dewitt.


Diffie, Farmer and Shimomura, all beautifully coiffed, offer 
sagacious views.


It includes a clip of Kevin, unbeautifully cuffed and mutely 
eloquent. Says most of the charges against him have been 
plea-bargained away.
