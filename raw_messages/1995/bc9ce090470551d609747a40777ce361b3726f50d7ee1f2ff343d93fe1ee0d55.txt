Finger reports that it is indeed a linux (1.2.9) box with a low load
average (0.00, 0.00, 0.00 right now), but that Mr. Thomas is on from
nemesis.ogi.com.

nemesis refuses finger, telnet, and ftp connections, but, on WWW
connect, asks for a userid and password for the "Marcam Development
WWW site at nemesis.ogi.com."

Marcam (http://www.marcam.com) makes something to do with computers,
so Mr. Thomas could well have a bunch of computers at his
disposal... (Even so, 50000 is a big number)

I can't actually figure out what, specifically, Marcam makes.  They
produce applications which reduce costs, increase flexibility, and the
whole shebang... but nowhere does it say what the programs *do*...

Smells like an NSA front.
