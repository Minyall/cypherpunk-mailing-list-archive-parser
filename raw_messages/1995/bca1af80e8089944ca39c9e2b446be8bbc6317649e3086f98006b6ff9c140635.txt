Ugh.  That word again.  I'm only 22, but I'm old enough to remember
when there were people called "crackers", and being called a "hacker"
was a _good_ thing.

I know at least one article about the break went, "Two hackers in
Berkeley, California...".

We actually got questions from reporters asking why we didn't just use
our newly-found hole to snoop financial transactions.  I've done a lot
of root-breaking in my (short) time, but I work for the Good Guys (TM).
