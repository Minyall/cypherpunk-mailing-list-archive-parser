In the Time Magazine of this week there is an article about a new way
to make war. Instead of sending bombs, tanks, and soldiers, the
enemies computers and communication networks are attacked by sending
viruses and worms and by using backdoors to sabotage the infra structure.

How many exported software products might have backdoors,
vulnerabilities, and hidden procedures which are harmfull if ever
activated?

Any opinions?
