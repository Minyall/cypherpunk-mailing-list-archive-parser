I, too, have only skimmed the code briefly.

What isn't clear to me is how much entropy they are assigning to these
sources.  Certainly if they manage to get at least 128 bits of entropy
then it doesn't matter how many non-random bits they mix into the hash.

I think they are simply throwing everything but the kitchen sink in,
and assuming that the overall result will be a sufficient number of
bits of entropy.  But it would be nice to at least see a few comments
on how many bits they expect each individual source to provide.

I also noticed that they use $HOME/.pgp/randseed.bin under unix, but
they don't bother with %PGPPATH%\RANDSEED.BIN on PCs.  I've sent Jeff
a private message about this.
