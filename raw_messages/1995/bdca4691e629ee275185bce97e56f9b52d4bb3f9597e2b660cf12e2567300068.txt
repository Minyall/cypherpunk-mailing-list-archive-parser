The Washington Post ran an article today in the Business section. Its
byline said Elizabeth Corcoran.  It refered to the four hour attack figure.
It appeared to be mostly a rewrite of the Netscape press release -- nearly
no quotes, no quoted local sources (TIS, Denning, etc.)

I expect that many papers that are far from Silicon Valley will
print it with a similar spin.
