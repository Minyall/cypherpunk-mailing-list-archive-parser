Here is a question for all of you cyber legal types out there.
This question presupposes: 

The NIST will complete its work on the GAK standard. But no law will be
passed (yet) regulating the use of encryption in the U. S. (The GAK standard 
is an attempt to create an environment in which such laws can be passed.) 
In the U.S., Big Company INC will start marketing a GAKed encryption 
product domesticly.

A bunch of cypherpunkish types will immediately try to organize a boycott
against BIG COMPANY.

What are the cypherpunks legal risks?

I seem to remember that back in the 70s, the NAACP lost a big case
with respect to their boycott in a southern city. As I recall there were people
in the street begging money for the NAACP because there was a > 10**6 $
judgement against the NAACP and they needed that much just to appeal.
