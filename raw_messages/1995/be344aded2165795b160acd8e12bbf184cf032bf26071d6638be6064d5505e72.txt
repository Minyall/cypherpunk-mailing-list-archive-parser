I've been on this list almost since it start.. and in that time I've become
a freelance writer.. as have other more well known list members..

I think the thing to understand is that there is always room for
misinterpretation.. by reporters and by our own flames (if the list
traffic is any judge..)...

To speculate further on the human condition would be off topic..but
it's clear the Cypherpunks is a very valuable thing to many people for
many reason and I think (from the point of self interest) to all of
society..
