Right - using DH exchange is probably appropriate in situations where
there is no pre-established credentials for the party on the other
machine.  Inter-domain authentication while possible in theory is not
often carried out to any great extent in reality.  Companies don't trust
each other, or at least are not concerned by this lack of security for
inter-domain communications.
