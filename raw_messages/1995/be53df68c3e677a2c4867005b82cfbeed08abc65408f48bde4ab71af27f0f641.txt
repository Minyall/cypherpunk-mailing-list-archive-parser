I've collected more presentations and comments for last week's NIST GAK
meeting. I've got CDT's presentation and new policy response, VTW's 
presentation, and David Lesher's post from talk.politics.crypto.

htpp://www.isse.gmu.edu/~pfarrell/nistmeeting.html
is the starting point.

If you seem more, please forward it to me. Thanks
Pat
