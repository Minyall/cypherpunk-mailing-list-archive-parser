Hold on, you *never* sign directly at key signing parties!

Never take your key where:
  - it could be stolen
  - you suspect others may wish to influence your signing
  - somebody might spy your passphrase (hidden cameras in ceiling)

You take fingerprints, and sign when you get back home.


Re the timing subject, do you think it'd make a good party trick?

  * Think of a number between 20 and 30.
  * for 4-5 numbers a, "Multiply the orignal number by <a>"
  * the number you are thinking of is <number>

Now, anybody have statistics for mental arithmetic?
