  We are counting unique installations of netscape.  We have no way
of mapping that information to a user name.  We don't save any
information about you when you contact our web site.  The Navigator
doesn't make connections to our site behind your back.

  We are very sensitive to privacy concerns.  A bunch of folks now
working here revolted against an effort to track keystrokes and
mouse clicks in Mosaic while they were at NCSA.  One of those
folks was marca himself.
