Hi,

I had a talk today with our Office Manager which reveals an other
reason why we need anon. system.

That is to say a good reason we can hold up to the press, media and
other people..

The Example:

Job Ads..

This are often non on an Anon. basis. For example, the new york times
will function as an anon. forwarder of job resumes...

The office manager needs to have both the company name and the name of
the person getting the resumes to be kept anonymous...
