They can. Maybe not from you, but people were poking holes in Netscape before 
*anything* was offered. Greed isn't the sole motivator of people.

A bit too mercenary-like for my tastes, and a bit lacking in ethics. Tracking 
down security holes and selling them to the highest bidder without giving 
details to all doesn't just hurt Netscape.

This sounds like a better idea. And it isn't mutually exclusive with the "Bugs 
Bounty" or T-shirts.

From what I recall, Netscape has hired decent programmers. I don't know about their internal business practices. From what I've seen, though, they have the right attittude about fixing security, rather than sweeping it under the rug and suing people who alledge security faults. Certainly their release of their PRNG code is proof of that.
