Hmm, I was also thinking good about responsiveness on the security
issue (though the way they behave regarding html extensions is still
not fair imo, but that's another debate), and I have modified my
netscape security page accordingly, but, dropping Linux as the list of
UNIX supported host is certainly not a good thing at all, I
urge/pray/suggest... that listening Netscape folks here try to put
it back, PLEASE (It is not that difficult to compile under linux is it ?)

(source :

[...]
SUPPORTED PLATFORMS 
[...]
UNIX: 
            Digital Equipment Corp. Alpha (OSF/1 2.0) 
            Hewlett-Packard 700-series (HP-UX 9.03) 
            IBM RS/6000 AIX 3.2 
            Silicon Graphics (IRIX 5.2) 
            Sun SPARC (Solaris 2.4, SunOS 4.1.3) 
            386/486/Pentium (BSDI) 
)
Or maybe it is just a missing item in the list ? [i hope!]
