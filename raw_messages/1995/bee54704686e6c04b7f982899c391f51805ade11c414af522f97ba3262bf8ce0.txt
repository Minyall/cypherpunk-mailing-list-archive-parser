  anyone know if there are any PGP or general crypto XCMDs for hypercard? 
i'm prototyping a front-end to control some premail stuff and some secure 
WWW server apps, and it would be convenient to have something like this. 
  on related notes, anybody know about XCMDs that talk to MacTCP...? and 
can someone send me status or a pointer to the PGP library for windows?

  please reply to me personally; i'll summarize to the list.
