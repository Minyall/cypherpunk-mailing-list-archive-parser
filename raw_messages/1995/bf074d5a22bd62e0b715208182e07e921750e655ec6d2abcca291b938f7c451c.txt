[ I shouldn't be posting -- I'm legally not supposed to be on the net. 
But hell... ]

I've been compiling and editing a remailer standards document, following 
the format of the Internet RFCs [mainly because I think it's elegant]. 
I'd be glad to make it a `formal' RFC, registered with the IETF... But I 
have no idea how it's done. If anyone out there wants to tell me how...
