	Well, uh, yeah.

	VoicePGP hasn't been completed yet, much less released. If it's 
been cracked, that's very ... suprising.

	VoicePGP uses Diffie-Hellman and 3DES with three independent 
subkeys. If anyone has come up with an attack on D-H or 3DES that works 
in ten minutes, I'd love to hear about it, as I'm sure the rest of you would.

	Call Security was cracked by Don Coppersmith [if you don't know who 
he is, shame on you: he led the IBM Lucifer/DES team] about a day after the 
announcement on sci.crypt. Call Security != VoicePGP.
