This speaks for itself.  "They or those like them," indeed!

I never made any claim that PGP is "secure".  Quite the contrary -
I've been complaining about the security implications of PGP's
monolithic structure and complexity since I first saw the code, though
I did state the basis on which I trust it little less than I trust
other software of equal complexity.  Primarily, however, I jumped in
to this discussion to take issue with your unfair implication that
there is reason to suspect deliberate wrongdoing on the part of the
MIT people.  If your remarks are based on some specific information
you know about some person or group, please tell us.  Otherwise, it
would be a shame allow your credibility to taint these people in the
backs of people's minds just for the sake of a casual, throwaway
rhetorical device.  There is no need to raise the specter of an evil
conspiracy to make your point.  It's irrelevant and beneath you, based
on what I've read of your earlier work on viruses.

Feel free to have the last word if you'd like, since we seem to AGREE
that PGP needs more analysis and scrutiny.
