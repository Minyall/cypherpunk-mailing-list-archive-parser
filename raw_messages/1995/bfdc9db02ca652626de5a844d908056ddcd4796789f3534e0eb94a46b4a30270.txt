True. On the other hand, many of these other companies are actually doing
commerce Right This Minute. As a vendor, my primary interest is availability.

Digicash stands to lose out in the marketplace. Why? Because you can't
actually buy and sell real goods for real cash right now. One day,
sure, but not now. By the time they deploy their system, consumers who
aren't as concerned, or knowledgeable, as cypherpunks will have made
some other system the market leader.

Chilling thought. I hope DC can get a backing bank sometime soon.
