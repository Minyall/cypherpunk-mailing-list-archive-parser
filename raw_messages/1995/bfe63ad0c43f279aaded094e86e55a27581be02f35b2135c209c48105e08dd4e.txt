NFS is not a valid example of a one-vendor internetworking protocol.
In the early days of NFS Sun worked amazingly hard to get all the major
Unix players to support it.  They all but lent out engineering staff;
they hosted several 'connectathons', where everyone tested interoperability,
made the license minimal cost (if not free), etc.  And, of course, there
was nothing competing.
