Do you have a pointer to a source for this information ?  I've been searching
through NCSC Orange Book stuff and M$'s web server, to no avail. 
http://www.microsoft.com/BackOffice/techbriefs/tech4000.htm, the Win NT Server
3.5 Technology Brief, only says that NT was in the final evaluation phase as
of June 1995. 

I haven't been able to find on-line copies of any NCSC Product Evaluation
Bulletins, or a current Evaluated Products List. The closest I've seen is
http://www.itd.nrl.navy.mil:80/ITD/5540/xtp1/epl.html, which lists items
evaluated or under evaluation, at the A and B levels.

The status of NT's evaluation for C2 is a recurrent topic on the firewalls
list, so I'm surprised I haven't seen the final approval mentioned there.
