I wouldn't bet on it. I did a similar hack with perl, with a much more
conservative 5 seconds to 32 bytes. That didn't cut it, when I ent'ed the
result it gave 6 bits of entropy / 8 bits of output.
I do recall posting it here.

Um.. I would try to generate bits quickly, then securely, so for example
you get a 2k buffer and do it 5 sec / 128 bits. Then slow down and overwrite
the buffer and give warnings if the user wants to use the bits too early.
