Couldn't you either create the address in a register, and then do an 
indirect jump through the register, or push it onto the stack and do a 
ret ? You could do something like 

	mov ecx, address + 01010101
	sub ecx, 01010101
	jmp [ecx]

I'm not certain of the format for BSDI assembler, but I presume that's 
possible. You could modify the value you add and subtract to make sure 
there are no netscape-invalid bytes in the compiled code.
