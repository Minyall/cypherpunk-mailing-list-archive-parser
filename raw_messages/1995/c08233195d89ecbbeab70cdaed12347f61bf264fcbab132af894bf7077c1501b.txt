The chaining is not dynamic (but its is maybe patcheable) ? 
I don't think there is support for encryption (ssl patches maybe?) ?
Also, CERN httpd is a huge thing, maybe some smaller proxy would
do... 
My development is/could be based on my httpd, but simplified... I'll
have a look at standalone already existing proxies before reinventing
the wheel...
