	Yeah!  Really!  We're talking about Matt "Honey I broke the
chip" Blaze here.  Single handedly did more damage to the clipper
chip than any other individual or group!

	Perry, I liked your reaction to the last chump like this

	We should find out what drugs they are taking and where we can
buy some!  They are obviously VERY good considering that they no longer
