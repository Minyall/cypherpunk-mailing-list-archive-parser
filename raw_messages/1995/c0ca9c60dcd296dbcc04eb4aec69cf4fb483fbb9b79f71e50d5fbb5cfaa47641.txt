Thanks to everyone who offered help on the MD5 for DOS.
Greg Broiles pointed me to the pgp source, which may do the
trick. (There is MD5 module in pgp[?]) I will investigate.

For everyone's info, didn't find a freestanding dos 
implementation, tho.  My copy of Schneier didn't have the
disk, so I don't know if it's there, either.
