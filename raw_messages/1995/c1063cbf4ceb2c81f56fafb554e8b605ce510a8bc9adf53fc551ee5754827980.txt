At least I know that my cellular carrier is safe for now.  The phone company
in our area still can't handle ANI from the cellular switch.  The default
number for our carrier ends in 0000 which happens to be my number.  I get
calls every month from people with 800 numbers verifying what number this
was.  I have to explain that someone from our cellular system made a call to
their number but the bill defaults to mine.  Its no big deal since I work
for the cellular carrier though.  ;)
