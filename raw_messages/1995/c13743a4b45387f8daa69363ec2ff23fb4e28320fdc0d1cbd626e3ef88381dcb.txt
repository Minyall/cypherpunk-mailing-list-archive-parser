One thing that David didn't mention is security add-ons to the "network
computers" that are supposed to be rolled out within the next few months --
the successors to X terminals, $500 boxes with a good screen/sound,
cheap cpu, and a few megs of ram and flash memory to hold a web browser.
I expect some folks to make a good living by writing add-ons (including
crypto add-ons) to these gizmos.
