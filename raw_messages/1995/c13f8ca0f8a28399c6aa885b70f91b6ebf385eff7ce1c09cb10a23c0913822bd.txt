To whom it may concern:



This fellows proposed  actions are those of a blind fool who cannot
see the forest for the trees. A such he is nothing more than part of
the problem.

He sees foreign immigrants, legal or illegal, as being a problem.
The problem he is seeing is not any problem created by the immigrants
who are looking for something better, but one created for the very
purpose of distracting such fools as him from the underlying problems
his state this Nation faces. 

He has bought the lie spewed by the talking heads and other
psycological operations that have told him to think the 'illegals'
are causing some sort of problem.

Prop 187 and such proposals are nothing more than a method to have 
implemented systems and plans, not to correct the alledged problem, 
but to implement an underlying plan that was the desired goal from 
the start; namely a national ID and tracking system.

This is a typical tactic, race against race, religion against
religion, etc. all to divide us into small, blind, ineffective,
bickering groups who have little voice and no cohesive political
power.

If his actions do not accelerate what is already occuring then the 
real enemy is alseep, as it is a wonderful opportunity for further 
psycological operations that will benefit them in numerous ways.
