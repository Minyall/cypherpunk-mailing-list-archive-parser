Perhaps if you reviewed the material on which my comments are based, you
would have a different opinion, and perhaps not, but to make your
comment based on an apparent lack of knowledge of the basis for my
opinions indicates both a lack of willingness to spend the necessary
effort checking before you make such statements and a lack of desire to
engage in more than rank speculation.

To get an idea of the basis for my comments, you might start by reading
some of my writings and look through the citations I use as a basis for
my opinions.  If you would like a reading list, look under Management
Analytics in my W3 site:
