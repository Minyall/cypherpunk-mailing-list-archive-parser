   Bill Gates in "The Road Ahead":

      A complete failure of the information highway is worth
      worrying about. Because the system will be thoroughly
      decentralized, any single outage is unlikely to have a
      widespread effect. If an individual server fails, it
      will be replaced and restored. But the system could be
      susceptible to assault. As the system becomes more
      important, we will have to design in more redundancy.
      One area of vulnerability is the system's reliance on
      cryptography -- the mathematical locks that keep
      information safe.

   Excerpted in Newsweek, November 27, pp. 67-68.

   Rubberneck the roadwreck with Steven Levy in "Bill's New
   Vision."
