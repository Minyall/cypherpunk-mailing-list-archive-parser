If I'm wrong (and I would not be suprised  - I'm relying on fuzzy
memories here), please consider my abject apology tendered.

Namespace collisions seem to happen quite frequently in titles. I can 
remember when TMC made a big deal out their intention to air
'Brainstorm", the 1983 film with Natalie Wood. I settled down to
watch, and up came a black and white movie with a totally different
plot - it turned out they had been sent the 1965 film of that name,
and no one had checked. Looking in the (ex)Cardiff film database, I
note that there is now a 3rd movie of the title (1994).

A couple weeks ago my daughter was making a big deal about 
wanting to watch 'The Red Shoes" on Disney. I was thinking of
the 1948 ballet movie, and told her I didn't think she'd like it. She
insisted, and it turned out to be a 30 minute (and charming in
cloying sort of way) cartoon.
