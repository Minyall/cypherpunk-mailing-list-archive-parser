Clinton's recent high-profile resort to executive orders reminds me of 
Yeltsin's 'democracy by decree'. I await with interest an American Chechnya.

However with the latest one he seems not to be ordering anything new, he's
just pulled something out of the legislative hat, he's just using powers
he's been given under the cited subsections of the Foreign Intelligence Act.
He seems happy to follow whatever little safeguards it has. How that Act
was never ruled unconstitutional beats me. 

Why is Clinton kowtowing to the Notional Security Agency and the Federal
Bureau of Instigation all of a sudden? Is this a 'law-and-order' shift to
the right of a New New Democrat?

Can we all stop insulting dogs? Lawrence Detweiler can be safely refered to
as LD. Rottweilers, as a correspondent writes with "great umbrage" in last 
week's Time, are "handsome, noble, courageous and steadfastly loyal."
