Dear All,

I haven't seen the next two responses, yet they comprise all the 
responses that ten news groups had made as of this posting, in my
newsreader here at MM.COM. I am told there are now more, yet I think
it's kind of a moot point (david@winternet.com was the reporter).

So I am going to import the text now and read it finally.
I have read the text, and I giggle a little, at who sent it.

Now you already have had the advantage of seeing copy by Mr. Horwath.
Mr. Logajan didn't. And didn't for a number of days. Nor did anyone
anyone else either.

LOOK AT THE GROUPS MR. LOGAJAN IS RESPONDING TO. HE IS ONLY REPLYING TO

ONE, NOT TEN GROUPS. AND, EITHER HE OR MR. HAS CENSORED NINE OTHER GROUPS

FROM THEIR RIGHTFUL REPLIES. I DO BELIEVE, WHEN YOU LOOK AT MR. HORWATH'S

PRIOR POSTING, I THINK YOU WILL FIND THAT HE DID TAMPER WITH THE POSTING.

AND, WHAT YOU GET AS A LESSON HERE IS JUST WHY THE REMAILER PROGRAM IS IN

TROUBLE. THERE JUST HAS TO BE PLAIN AND SIMPLE TRUST. MR. LOGAJAN IS UNDER

THAT SIMPLE DELUSION, FOR THE MOMENT. YET AS CYPHERPUNKS, THERE IS A KIND

OF AN UNSTATED UNDERSTANDING THAT WE DO NOT DO THIS TO OTHERS OR OURSELVES.

Mr. Horwath at least owes Mr. Logajan an apology. For misrepresentation.

Mr. Horwath owes nine newsgroups an apology. For telling them (through 
ommission) that mn.general is more important than they are. 
It was about this point I was on the list again. 
The damage was done, and now repairs were under way. 

Now, the third and last response I know of, to this point.
