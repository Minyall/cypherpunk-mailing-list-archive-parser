Sigh.  Some anonymous poster drags up "Christopher Seline"'s
wildly inaccurate article about TEMPEST.  Aside from having a reverse-
engineered deacronymization of TEMPEST (which isn't an acronym and
isn't about Transient Electromagnetic Pulses), misunderstanding 
TEMPEST certification, not getting its legalities right,
it's in general just plain confused and sensationalist.
