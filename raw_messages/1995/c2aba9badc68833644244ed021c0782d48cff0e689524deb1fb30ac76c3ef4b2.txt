  The hash of just the card number isn't good enough.  If you collected
a bunch of certificates (they are public) then you could start guessing
valid card numbers and trying to match the hashes with your database.
The Mastercard SEPP proposal uses a salted hash, where the salt is
a shared secret between the bank and the user.
