What I don't understand is why the law-enforcement is so concerned 
about bruting things. It is probably quite easy to tap the keyboard,
smart force, exchange the binary with the real thing etc for them?

(Unless they want to read it all from a nice tipped-back armchair in
a certain location? :-))

What I'm saying is that this kind of attack should work quite easily
in the one-by-one cases, but not on a large scale, malicious data,
trojan horses, outright bugging. So why all this Clipper (son-of-X)
fuss? 

Ok, not for all data, especially not for the "untouched, rarely used"
ones. But is this any different from hiding your diary in a very safe
place anyway?
