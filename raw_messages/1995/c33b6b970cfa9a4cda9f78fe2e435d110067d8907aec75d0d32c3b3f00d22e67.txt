Perry,
	Many people are interested in cryptology because they don't
want the NSA (among others) invading their privacy.  The Foster story
concerns the chief NSA privacy-invasion of modern times:  spying on
domestic banking transactions.  So it's relevant.
	The Grand Inquisitor role is getting a little old.  So if
you want to continue to play it, my response is:  Fuck Off.
