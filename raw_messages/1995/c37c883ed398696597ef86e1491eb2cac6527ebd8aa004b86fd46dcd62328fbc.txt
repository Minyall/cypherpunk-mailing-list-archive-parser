That's certainly true.  But what about liability insurance?  That's one 
of the key aspects of my retention of a professional.  Being cynical, and 
somewhat knowledgable about human error, I want to be sure there's 
someone to turn to if the advice/treatment/whatever turns out not only to 
be wrong in hindsight, but in foresight.

Having taken, and passed, bar exams in three states (3 for 3 for those of 
you thinking I was forum shopping), I can tell you that they weren't that 
big of a barrier.  You can flunk (over several tries) by failing to 
prepare at all, panicking, being an extremely poor test taker, or, well ...
