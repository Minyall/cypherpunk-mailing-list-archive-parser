The same authors presented papers on similar themes at MCSA `94 (Workshop on
Mobile Computing Systems and Applications). See 
<a href="http://snapple.cs.washington.edu/mobile/mcsa94.html>the MCSA `94
home page</a>, which has links to PostScript versions of the papers. They
even had a panel on "Privacy & Anonymity", apparently !

The relevant papers are:

Anonymity in a Mobile Computing Environment 
     N. Asokan - University of Waterloo.

A Method Providing Identity Privacy to Mobile Users during Authentication 
     Didier Samfat and Refik Molva - Institut Eurecom.

On Travelling Incognito 
     A. Herzberg, H. Krawczyk - IBM T.J. Watson, and G. Tsudik - IBM Zurich.
