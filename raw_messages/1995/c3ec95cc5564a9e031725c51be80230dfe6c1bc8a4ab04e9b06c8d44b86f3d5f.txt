The show was Thursday 10/19, All Things Considered.

BTW, there was another interesting quote on the 15th on ATC -- a segment
about the DA office in New Orleans -- with a DA claiming that the
presumption of innocence is a legal fiction which *starts* when the trial
starts -- implying that from arrest to trial, the person is guilty.

Interesting way of thinking....
