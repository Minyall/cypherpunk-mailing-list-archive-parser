This issue (the penet address in Ed's .sig) has been covered on the list 
before. The next time around I think I'll write a short FAQ.

The direct address is easier to use, especially for people whose mailers
don't allow them to add arbitrary email headers. Note that the ratio of
users of the various cypherpunk remailers to users of anon.penet is even 
lower than the S/N ratio on this list in December.

In certain parts of Usenet, many people routinely advertise addresses at
anon.penet (and similar services) in their .sigs (as Ed does) to make 
pseudonymized replies as convenient as possible. This is not a new phenomenon.

Happy New Year !
