If you want to bar access to your site from a Netscape browser, such 
can easily be accomplished.  If memory serves, every browser, when 
connecting to a site, exchanges certain information about the client 
with the server.  One can gain access easily to that information.

I believe that Netscape uses "Mozilla" as their keyword when 
exchanging browser-specific information.
