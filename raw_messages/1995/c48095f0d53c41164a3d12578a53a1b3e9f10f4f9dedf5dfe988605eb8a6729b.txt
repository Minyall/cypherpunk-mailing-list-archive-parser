It seems that your embedded viewer doesn't want to work on my
UNIX box.  It makes it quite hard to comment on your
guidlines.  Apparently, from the way you're presenting this you
have no real desire to get any industry consensus.  Perhaps you
only want people that use Windows to have an oportunity to comment.
Mac users and Unix users not welcome.  I find the whole need to 
have yet another viewer annoying.  Haven't you guys heard of 
industry standards?

Annoyed,
