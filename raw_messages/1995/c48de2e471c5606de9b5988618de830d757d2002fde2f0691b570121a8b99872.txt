I don't believe legal liability is the issue. many businesses operate
despite the fact that they have large liability for what they perform.
the issue is balancing the cost they are guaranteed through their
charges with the liability they face. you are incorrect in thinking that
individual credit card users buy credit cards based on the
liability to themselves, from my point of view. individuals, even
if they are theoretically liable for large fraud costs, simply are not 
going to be able to be held accountable for them.

you seem to be saying that if credit card companies one day guaranteed
they would be responsible for all fraud charges, we would have cybercash
*now*. but credit card companies already do largely have to absorb the
costs of fraud. they are *already* liable. and again, I don't think you
will find the market really cares about liability prior to using 
the service. the individual generally
assumes they are not personally responsible for fraud in the card, and
the companies generally have to adhere to this paradigm.

what if tomorrow a new credit card company started up saying, "we are
not responsible for fraud. all fraud is the responsibility of the 
customer?"  they would be laughed off the planet. such a plan is not
even feasible. the consumer will simply cancel the credit card if they
perceive they are being charged for fraud, and not pay the company 
insisting they are not liable (despite whatever agreement they signed).

but this has *always* been the case. how is it not the case now? *all*
banks are liable for the security of their schemes. why do you think they
are not? why do you think they care so much about security?

why do you think that nobody does not already realize this? isn't it
patently obvious to anyone who starts such a system?

who is proposing that consumers or merchants pay if a system is broken?
why do you think that this is the case? what is more likely is that
these fraud costs will be hidden in transaction charges, just like
they are with current credit cards. the individual consumers and merchants
will then be given the "illusion" that they are not paying for fraud,
but this cost is actually invisibly included in their "transaction
tax".

for the above reasons I don't at all understand why you insist that acceptance 
of liability is the problem delaying introduction of digital cash standards.

but one distinction I do realize has to be made in all this is the
difference between "fraud" and "breaking a system". the latter is
a far more potentially serious problem with cryptographic security than
the former. in fact cryptographic security attempts to deal with all
fraud by making "breaking the system" impossible, and succeeds to the
degree it accomplishes this.
