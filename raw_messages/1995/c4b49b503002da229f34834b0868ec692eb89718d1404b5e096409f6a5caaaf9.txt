I doubt it. The only sort of Bosnian engagement that might make sense would
involve a fairly conspicuous effort with a large number of troops. I can't
see what a few thousand Green Berets could accomplish there.

Frankly, I'm quite puzzled by these signs. I can't think of any country that
seems due for a quick invasion by the USG, but the increase in granularity of
the GPS information suggests an operation of greater magnitude than just a
strike against terrorists, drug cartels etc.

Is it time for Bay of Pigs II already ?  ;)
