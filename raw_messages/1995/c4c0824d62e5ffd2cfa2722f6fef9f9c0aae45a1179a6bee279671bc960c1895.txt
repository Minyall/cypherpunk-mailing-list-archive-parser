   It just occurred to me when reading this another method for ensuring the
   "I can't tell what's in it" condition with a data haven operator.  Why not
   use a secret sharing system where the contraband data is split into a number
   of pieces and sent to different havens?
   [...]
   Ok, Eric, go ahead and blast your holes in this argument :)

How do you know that what you the operator of the storage service gets
was generated by secret sharing?

The suggestion of having certificates that say "I encrypted this" are
interesting, but merely transfer the problem onto that signer.
