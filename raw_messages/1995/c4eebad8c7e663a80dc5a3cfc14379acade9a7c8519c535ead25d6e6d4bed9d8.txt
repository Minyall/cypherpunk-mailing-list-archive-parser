Well, I know some shops have so called 'switch' or 'smart' cards to debit 
your account, some of these are on their own credit line, others are not.

I have an account with a bank in Britain which gives me a "VISA" Card 
which is actually a 'direct-debit' card.  I can use it (and have) all 
around the world as a regular VISA card and in any 'VISA compatible' ATM.

As soon as my balance drops to zero, I can no longer use it.  And when I 
do, the money jumps out of my account immediately and can no longer be used.

This is a bank-issued card, and also acts as my ATM card to access my 
current account - there is NO charge for this.  I'm not sure exactly how 
that works.

Whether or not VISA would accept a proposal from First National 
Cyberphunks or not remains to be seen...
