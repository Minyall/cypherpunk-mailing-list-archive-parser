	I have read that Visa intends to begin a digital cash system, 
using both discardable and recharable cards that would implement secure 
cash transations.  The system is now in use in Australia, and there are 
plans for use during the Olympic Games at Atlanta and a pilot project in 
Thailand.
	Does anybody know if this is truly "cash"?  Is is tracable, and 
what encryption does it use?
