I have finaly been goaded into using SSH. I seems like a
great tool, but I have one major worry. When I install
SSH, it generates the host key right away. When I run
ssh-keygen, it generates my user key right away.
Where is it getting the random numbers. Before I dive
into the source I was wondering if anyone else had
looked into this?
