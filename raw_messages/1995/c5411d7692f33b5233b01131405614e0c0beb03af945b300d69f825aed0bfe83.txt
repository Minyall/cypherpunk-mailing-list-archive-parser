According to an article that was out on the AP newswire (check under
<URL:http://http://www1.trib.com/WIRE/CURRENT/>), the "1%" figure
applies to actual capacity.  In other words, if there's a switch with
50K subscribers but actual capacity for 5K simultaneous calls, the FBI
wants to be able to make 50 simultaneous taps.
