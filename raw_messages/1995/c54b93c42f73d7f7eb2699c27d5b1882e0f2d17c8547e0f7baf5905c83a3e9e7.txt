Not much...(!)  People who don't have the strip at all aren't breaking
any laws, and they aren't required to get strips added.  It's just
that the DMV won't give out new cards that don't have the strip.

Presumably just like the post office and zip codes: you don't *need*
it, but it speeds things up if you've got it.
