 I forgot to add. There is no reason User X has to run his remailer
immediately. His software could simply commit to running a remailer for
1 hour at some specified future date < some threshold. Any messages
sent to him for remailing would be queued until that time. Therefore,
all your technique would tell you is that the user remailed a message
sometime between date X and date Y. if Y-X > few days to week or two,
the intelligence gathered on User X is miniscule. Traffic analysis would
detect User X using the remailer network anyway.
