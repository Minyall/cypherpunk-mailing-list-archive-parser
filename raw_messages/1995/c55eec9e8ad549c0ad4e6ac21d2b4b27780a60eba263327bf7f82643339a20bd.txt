Does anyone have the FIPS reference for the latest SHA? I'm writing up
the SHA-AH document and I find that I don't have such a reference --
the best I've got is 

"Proposed Federal Information Processing Standard for Secure Hash
Standard", Federal Register, v57, n21, 31 Jan 1992, p. 3747-3749

And I know that this has since been corrected.
