You might want to take a look at the paper I mentioned, then: I
believe that irradiation of the OTP EPROM to return all bits to "ones"
is too blunt a tool to do you any good. A virgin EPROM has a value of
zero in the suggested scheme. And, as mentioned, flipping random sets
of bits is strongly likely to get you caught.

Note also that the encoding is strongly tied to the laser-etched serial
number on the chip, so replay attacks between two different chips --
i.e. copying a fully loaded chip to a virgin chip -- won't work.

However, it does open up the scheme to replay attacks, if you can load
the chip with value, spend it, irradiate it, and then successfully
reprogram the chip with the exact same values you recorded.

Good point.

I seem to remember PROMs actually undergoing physical, rather than
electrical, state changes (that were presumably nonreversible). Am I
recalling old technology, or am I just plain mistaken?
