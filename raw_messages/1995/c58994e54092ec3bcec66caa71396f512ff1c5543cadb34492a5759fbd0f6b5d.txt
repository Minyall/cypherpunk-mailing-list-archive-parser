I like this a lot, except:

If B doesn't add a Cancel-Lock to each article he sends, he loses the
ability (because of Alice's Cancel-Lock) to cancel his own articles.
Cancel-Locks should only be added (or honored?) if the message
contains a Cancel-Lock from the originator.

I'd also like to suggest that added Cancel-Locks be generated from
something less than the full message -- perhaps from just the message
ID.  Intermediate sites are unlikely to maintain full copies of all
messages, and ought to be able to generate cancels in response to a
(possibly corrupted) copy returned to postmaster from another site.
