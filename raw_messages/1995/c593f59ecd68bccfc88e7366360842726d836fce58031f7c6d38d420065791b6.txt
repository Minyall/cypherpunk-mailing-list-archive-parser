Hmm, 
how hard could it be to eliminate West page numbers?

There couldn't be more than a couple of cases on each page, 
if each page number were replaced by links to each case, a
lawyer could tell on the first glance which of the three was
right and mark it, assuming a reasonable HTML/SGML editor or
something.  Seems like it could be done as a part of daily work
and the results accreted somewhere.
