I too have though about this question.  While I write crypto code and know
some areas quite well, I also seem to be blessed with the ability to
displaying my total ignorance in other areas in very public forums.  Since
I have no professional reputation to protect (I don't work in the
crypto field) and don't really have any 'aspirations to become an
authority', I feel I can do this so long as I also make
an effort to answer the question in the area of my expertise and to
also share the information I gain.

The difference between ignorance and stupidity is that one decreases 
with time :-).
