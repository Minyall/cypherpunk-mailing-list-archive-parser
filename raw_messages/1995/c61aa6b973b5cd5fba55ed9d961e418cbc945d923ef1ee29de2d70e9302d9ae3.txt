I wasn't aware of that -- I believe that this may have happened
because those of us who cared didn't attend the zoo in Stockholm. The
meeting was a complete joke, with the Microsoft people and others
making it clear that they didn't intend to follow the process. Many of
us who cared decided to do better things with our time instead of
showing up in the aptly named Weapons room for the second session.
