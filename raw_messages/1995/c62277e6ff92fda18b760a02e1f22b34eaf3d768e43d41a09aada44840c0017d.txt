If you do give the user control, what is an acceptable mechanical
implementation? Let's say I have a file encryptor which allows the
user to choose between DES, 3DES, IDEA, Diamond, and RC5. Must I
require the user to tell that program what cypher was used to encrypt
the file she wishes to decrypt?

Is storing the cypher type as part of the encrypted file a weakness?
