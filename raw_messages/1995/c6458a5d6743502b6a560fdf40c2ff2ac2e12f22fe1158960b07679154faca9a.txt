Still in catch-up mode. . . .

As the person who evaluated Courier for Intuit, I feel compelled to
point out that Intuit does *not* endorse SSL.

I agree with all of Perry's criticisms, and offer a couple of my own:

1) since SSL is a sub-application-level protocol trying to solve an
application-level security problem, it leaves communicating nodes
vulnerable to early-termination attacks.  SSL MACs authenticate
individual SSL records, not application messages.

2) since only fools run http servers on secure network segments,
network admins are faced with the problem of clearing sensitive data
(presumably "protected" on the line by SSL) out of the DMZ in real
time.  This is a pain.

Fortunately, Courier suffers from neither of these infirmities.
