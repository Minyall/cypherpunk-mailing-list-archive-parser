Everyone --

This morning, without any warning, the local university decided to change
all their mail aliases. Mail sent to "mclow@coyote.csusm.edu" now bounces,
and the new address is "mclow@mailhost2.csusm.edu".

Please update your address books.
Sorry about that :-(

P.S. Those of you who send mail to Laurie, her email address is now
	"lclow@mailhost2.csusm.edu"
