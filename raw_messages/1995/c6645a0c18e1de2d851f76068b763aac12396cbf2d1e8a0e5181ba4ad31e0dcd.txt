Well, that was the whole point of the challenge, wasn't it ?
Why didn't the journalists didn't write their articles one month ago
when Hal posted his challenge ?

What I find surprising is that it took as long as one month.  I was
even surprised when it wasn't done after two weeks, and that's when I
started working on it.
