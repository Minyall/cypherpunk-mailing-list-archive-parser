   For a while, we were all convinced that the FCC left all these rules
   impossibly vague on purpose, just so that you didn't even know how to obey
   the law if you wanted to.  Everyone a potential criminal.

Just like the banking world, where it's no secret at all.

Did y'all know there's a separate market segment in the banking
business called "Compliance"?
