No matter what they say in the press, I doubt it will take more than a few
weeks to reverse engineer the new RNG seeder and figure out where the data
comes from. 

I am hoping it was more of a PR thing than a technical thing.  I hope 
that Netscape tells us their RNG seed so Cyperhpunks don't have to go to all 
the trouble.  If they tell us, we can let them know if it is a reasonable 
mechanism or bogus.
