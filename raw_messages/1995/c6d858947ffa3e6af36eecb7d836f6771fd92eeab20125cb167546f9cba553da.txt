Note that with event-release crypto, the houses could make a public key
available, with the secret key to be held until the death of Tom Target.
That key pair could be used by any of its anonymous buyers while the
crypto house remained ignorant not only of the content and authorship
of the messages, but even of the messages' existance -- nothing at all
to subpoena.  The same key could be used by Tom to encrypt his will, by
the assassin's employer to encrypt the payment, and by anyone to place
a bet on whether Tom will die within a certain period of time (by using
ecash that expires, like Digicash).
