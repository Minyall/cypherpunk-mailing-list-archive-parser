Now it seems to me that any ecash scheme, whether cleared on-line or
off-line, with or without double-spending-detection, will put the
payee at risk of identification by a collusion of the payer and the
bank.  As far as I can tell, Chaum's off-line,
double-spending-detecting DigiCash Ecash is no more or less
susceptible to this attack than is any other scheme.  (This is
because the e-coin must have a unique ID or serial number, and the
payer/bank collusion can trace the passage of that serial number to
identify the payee.)


TC May has stated that Chaum's off-line strategy enables
payee-identification by a payer/bank collusion, but it seems to me 
that this is incorrect, because payee-identification is *always*
possible by a payer/bank collusion under any scheme.

Right, if the bank allows anon accounts and/or accounts that can be
created and used with very little time/effort/expense.  Now if the
bank doesn't allow that then you could have a chain of
money-laudering "remailer" type services.  They will deposit the
coin for you and withdraw a new one, thus making it untraceable
*unless* they themselves are in on the collusion.


Perhaps you "chained remailer" people can apply your expertise to this
and invent for us a method of laundering your e-coin through a chain
of such services, making sure that a collusion of payer, bank and
*all* launderers is necessary to reveal your identity, and making
sure that the launderers themselves can't steal your coin.


Sounds impossible at first blush.
