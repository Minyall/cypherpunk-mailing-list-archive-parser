    If strong government resulted in liberty and freedom, then the
    most intrusive, all-encompassing governments would result in
    its citizens having the most liberty.  Is this the case?  I would
    look at the (former) Soviet Union, Iran, Cuba, East Germany, etc.,
    for your answer.


In all things, moderation. If I like salt on my steak, that does not mean
the most salt is the best.

Thinking in fundmentalist extremes severely limits your room for creative
problem solving.

You don't do that when you discuss cypers -- you don't take rigid sides of
"subway" vs "mixmaster", and paint the other side as fools becauase their
system would be silly if taken to its extremes. You learn from one another.

Be as creative about political possibilities.
