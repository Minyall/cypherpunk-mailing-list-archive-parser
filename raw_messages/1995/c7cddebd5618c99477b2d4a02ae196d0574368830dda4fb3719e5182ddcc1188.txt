To loosen up the often so serious discussions on the list, I propose a
little game. PGPFone's release is about a week away. PRZ is trying his
hardest to keep it from being exported. Still, I have the feeling that
some irresponsible cyphercriminal will break US law and export PGPFone
anyway. Let us bet cyberbucks on how long it will take for this crime to
happen. Here is my initial offer:

I bet e$50 that PGPFone will have been exported 24 hours after its final
release has been announced to this list. Who is willing to take the bet?
Perhaps someone is willing to bet at less time?

Have fun,
