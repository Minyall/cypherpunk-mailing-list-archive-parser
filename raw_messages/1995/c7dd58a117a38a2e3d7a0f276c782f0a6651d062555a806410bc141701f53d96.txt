The papers on Key Escrow scanned by John Young are available for FTP from:

ftp://ftp.teleport.com/pub/users/alano/nist.zip

They have been seperated into seperate text files (7 in all).

I will have an HTML version available from my web page soon.  (I am in the
process of converting the text to something HTMLlike.)

Comments/flames/etc can be sent my way, to John Young (jya@pipeline.com)
and/or to /dev/null (davenull@netscape.com).

Enjoy!
