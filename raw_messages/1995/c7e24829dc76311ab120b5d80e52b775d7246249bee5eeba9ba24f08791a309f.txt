I wouldn't mind hosting a remailer, but I am two UUCP hops off the net.
Does someone want to give me a San Jose area UUCP account directly to an
internet system?  An MX record holder would be nice.  My current domain
master is in Dallas, so mail to my machine actually goes through 4 UUCP
hops before it gets to me.  I want to get my own domain and get closer to
the net.
