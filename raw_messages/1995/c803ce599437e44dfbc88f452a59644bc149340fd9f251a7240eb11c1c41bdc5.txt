Would it be possible for the Cypherpunks mailing list remailer to parse the 
Subject line to include a CP: at the beginning, or some notation so that 
Cypherpunk messages can be easily 'filtered' out from my Inbox?

Also, about Microsoft's .PWL file format. Will they be releasing the 
new encryption method? Or are we not supposed to feel safe that our 
passwords are protected in Windows95.
