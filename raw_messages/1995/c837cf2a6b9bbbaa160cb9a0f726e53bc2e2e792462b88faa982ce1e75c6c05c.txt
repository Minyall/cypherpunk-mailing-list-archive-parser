You're absolutely right. I wasn't thinking sensibly about HTTP.  I wanted to
make an argument about the time it would take to search the pool and serve a
results page. But upon reflection, I don't think that even holds up under my
HTTP delusions of yesterday, let alone a realistic view. Please ignore the
"reasonably long" part of my previous statement. Thanks for pointing that out.
