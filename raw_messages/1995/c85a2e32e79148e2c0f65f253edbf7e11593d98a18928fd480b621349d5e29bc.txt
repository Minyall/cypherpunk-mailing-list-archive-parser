If the YFTLA could diffuse actual source of a method *supposedly* stronger than 
IDEA and get away with it, could they not equally qell get away with planting 
their man Zimmermann and having him publish PGP with a cunning trapdoor?  Let's 
see, to lend cred to that though they'd probably have to have him arrested on 
trumped-up charges and generally harassed ...

Many people only THINK they know what cynicism means.

Seriously: I've not been round long enough to have a good idea how likely my 
proposed scenario is.  You can all probably tell me things about Z's provenance 
which blow my little theory sky-high.

cheers,
