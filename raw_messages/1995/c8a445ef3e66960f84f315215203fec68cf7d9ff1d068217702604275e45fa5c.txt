>First, half a million chips is not that big a deal...the Connection Machine
had up to 64,000. Very few cryptographic problems of interest to us will be
affected by a mere factor of a million or so.

	While the cryptographic stuff isn't much of a problem, how about text
analysis of multiple sources, possibly via a neural net simulation (which IIRC
a massively parallel machine is nice for)?
