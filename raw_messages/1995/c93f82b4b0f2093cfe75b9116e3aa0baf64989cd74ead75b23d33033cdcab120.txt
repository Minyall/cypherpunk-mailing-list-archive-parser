In 4.4 kernels, you just configure an alias address.

For, say, SunOS 4.1.X, John Ioannidis released a virtual interface
driver; I saw the thing posted to the net recently so I suppose its
public now (though I'm not sure J.I. knew that was going to happen.)
Its not hard to set such things up; no real trickery needed.
