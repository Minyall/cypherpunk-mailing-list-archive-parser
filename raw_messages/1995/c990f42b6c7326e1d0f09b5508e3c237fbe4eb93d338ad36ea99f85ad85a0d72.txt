So far, I talked to the NYT and the WSJ yesterday, as well as the SF Chronicle.

This morning, one of the University's publicity people
<rls@pio.urel.berkeley.edu> forwarded Marketplace (a radio show)
and CNN (sending a camera crew) to me.

I've also received email from various people, including someone who
works in security at the Pentagon.

I wonder if I should tell them I'm not an American?
