Hello,
  I have looked over the paper, but I will look more closely this weekend 
(finals going on right now).
  The main question I have, since my programs run over a network with 
dumb terminals is this: If someone can get the timing information why 
would they need it, since they can read the message.  So how can this 
attacker get the timing info without being able to read the message 
(unencrypted)?
  Thanx.
