Yea, like the UNIX-HATERS mailing list, or the appropriate 
comp.*.advocacy group.

I read this list to hear about *cypherpunks*, and while it is true that a 
good cypherpunk will write code, he/she should do so under the OS of 
his/her choice and not engage in OS holy wars.  There need to be good 
cypherpunk tools for *ALL* operating systems/enviroments, flaming people 
over their operating system is not a good way to accomplish this.
