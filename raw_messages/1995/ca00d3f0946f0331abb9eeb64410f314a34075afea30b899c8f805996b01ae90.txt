As far I can tell from netscapes web pages and the java mailing lists 
there only way to add to the runtime is with DLL's. Jave is only being 
used for applets. And whatever they may say their scripting language is 
not Java. (An engineer at Sun that worked on getting Java to work for 
Netscape said that Sun had nothing to do with that half cooked scripting 
language).

I for once can wait till HotJava is more stable. You can modify it at 
your hearths content. And learning Java is easy enough.
