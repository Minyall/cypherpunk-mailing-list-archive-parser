||
||   I just verified in GDB using a stack trace that the Netscape overflow
|| bug I mentioned is indeed a static stack buffer overflow. It trashes
|| the stack.
||
||   What this means is that in theory, it is possible to get a simple
|| URL, if clicked on, to execute some code on someone's browser.
||
||   Now the hard work begins...

This is a new feature of Netscape 2.0, part of the Java package
I believe... ;-)
