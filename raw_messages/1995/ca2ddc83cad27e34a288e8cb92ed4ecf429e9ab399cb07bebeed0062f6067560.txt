  OK, Perry was right, and it was wrong of me to argue with him based
only on the code that I have personally seen.  As we have already
determined, I have not reviewed every line of code in netscape.

  Not that I want to divert attention away from netscape(OK, maybe I
do :-) ), but does this bug exist in any other common browser?
