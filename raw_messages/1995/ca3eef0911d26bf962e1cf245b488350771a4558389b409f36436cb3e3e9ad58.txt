A few weeks ago, someone anonymously posted a uuencoded version of an
add-on to the OS/2 System Editor that claimed to automatically use PGP
to encrypt and/or sign ASCII documents.  However, when I uudecoded it
with several different versions of uudecode, all I got was garbage.  I
sent mail to the poster's anon.penet.fi address, but didn't get a
response.
	Did anyone manage to get a clean file or know where I can FTP it? 
Thanks.
