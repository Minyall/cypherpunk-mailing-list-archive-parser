  The extra gigits I was refering to are the ones on the front of the card 
  but not embossed.

Wow, you learn something every day. I've never in
my whole life (well, my American Express life,
over 15 years) noticed those four digits. I've
never been asked for them by anyone, or noticed
them being written down, either. Exactly when and
how are they used?

Greg.
