The Cypherpunks Key-Cracking project is complete, but AFAIK no one's
reported the successful key. Either people haven't completed all the
key chunks they've signed out for, or something's wrong with our
methodology.

A third alternative is that the lucky lottery winner just missed the
results, and a fourth is that I just missed it.
