The "key" here to the legal analysis is likely to be that the 
*employer's* law firm does not represent you and that the information 
disclosed is not privileged.  The law firm's duty is to represent the 
corporation, not you.  Certainly, such things as how you came to reveal 
it and what your position if the corporation could come into play, but in 
general, that firm is NOT your lawyer.
