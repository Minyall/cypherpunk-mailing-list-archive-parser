Thanks to a referall by futplex I see the error in my question....
Netscape is infact offering money and other freebees but some Kevin Mitnick
would rather have fun with it like messing with netscape or wait for the
Final v.2.0 to come out then have alot of fun!!!


anyway thanks again Futplex,
               the one and only,
