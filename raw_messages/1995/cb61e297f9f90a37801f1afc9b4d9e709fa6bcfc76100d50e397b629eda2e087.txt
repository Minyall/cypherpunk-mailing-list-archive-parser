You haven't paid for liability claims.  Why do you think you should be
able to pursue them?  I don't know of *any* software which is
guaranteed.  But now you have the opportunity to change that.  Point
out all of Java's problems, and then sell them a solution that fixes
those problems.

Again, sounds like something you could sell.  Sell an HTTP proxy that
only passes Java content if it's been signed by your company.  And, of
course, sell the matching signing service.

There are no problems, really, just business opportunities.
