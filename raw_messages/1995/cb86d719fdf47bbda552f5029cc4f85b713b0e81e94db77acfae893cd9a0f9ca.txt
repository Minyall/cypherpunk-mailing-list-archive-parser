I've been saying this for a long time, and I want to triple-reiterate
it -- PGP needs to be broken down into simple Unix-philosophy style
tools, or it isn't going to be useful in the long run.

I'll also note, yet again, that unless PGP quits this bad practice of
identifying counterparties only by a number, it is NOT going to be
universally deployed. Counterparties need to be identified by a name
that can be looked up in the DNS -- meaning "joe@foo.com" rather than
some key ident number.
