This guy's home page is a hoot - he's into UFO contacts and dolphin
communication.

After writing to him and getting back a description of his system, it's
clear that he's clueless. He seems to think that info sent to a vendor
using his system can't be sorted out from the gazillion other packets
on the Net. 

I described to him sniffer attacks, subverted routers, etal, and
reccomended some basic reading (Cheswick & Bellovin, 
Kaufmann, Perlman, & Speciner, and Schneier). He said he'd
look into it. (Yes, I know there's plenty of other attacks, such as
OSPF spoofing, but I didn't describe them).

I think we can educate this guy. 

speaking only for myself,
