I don't think that there is any serious worry for Netscape. Their
security is fine-- it's just crippled by the US Government. They
could probably start distributing binary versions of their software
that used full 128 bit keys in several hours. It's just that the
Government gets pissed off about these things.

In general, it just adds more flames to the fire started by the 
letter written by Microsoft, IBM and Lotus. Their point is bolstered
by this easy attack.
