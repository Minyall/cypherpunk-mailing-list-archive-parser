There was a recent review in network computing of about 60 or so
different CDROM recording devices. The cheapest one was about $500 from
Liberty. The most expensive was I think the one from Kodak, for about $20k.
The capabilities of each are different. Some include buffering, some don't.
However, the pre-mastering software used to make file systems on a CDROM
(HSFS, UFS, DOS, ISO-???? (forget that four digit number) is sold separately,
but generally not too expensive. There are also single and multi-session
CD 'burners'. The single session mean you have to do the entire disk in
one session, and generally if you mess up, you need a new disk. The multi-
session devices let you start a session, and pick it up with more information
at a later time.

Most of them are designed for multi-media or audio recording, but you can
generally get pre-mastering software that will work with something like
CD-XA.. etc..
 Check your software for compatibility before purchasing the hardware.
