   That would have been a fine piece of work except that Java cannot
take complete control of Netscape. It can't replace the toolbar
buttons, it can't override default protocol handlers like http, etc.
The open location button, as far as I can tell, does not have Java
hooks and will always function as it is supposed to, by stopping
all running Java threads, and going to  a new page.
