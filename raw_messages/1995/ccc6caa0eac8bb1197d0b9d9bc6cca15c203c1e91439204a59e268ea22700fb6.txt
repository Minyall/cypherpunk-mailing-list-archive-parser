This is only going to work if MD5 is not a "group"--that is, if there is no
simple algorithm which is equivialent to md5(md5(x)). I doubt that's been
proven.

Rather, you'd be better off using DES in any of the ways that Schneir
describes (page 338 and following) and reiterate that many times.
