The technology to reduce cellular fraud, through encryption and
authentication, is easily implementable, but for some reason neither
the operating companies nor the manufacturers want it.

In contrast, European cellular (GSM) products do implement
encryption and authentication (at least as far as laws allow).
GSM mobile phones can be equipped with a slot for a card that
identifies the subscriber.  Billing is based on the subscriber's
identity, not the phone's.

I'd say that the problem isn't just a lack of a proper payment
model, but also an unwillingness to provide adequate technology
to the problem.  Of course, the GSM approach does nothing for anonymity
or digital cash.
