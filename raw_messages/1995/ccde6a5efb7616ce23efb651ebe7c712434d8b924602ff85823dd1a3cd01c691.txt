Does anyone know what the laws are regarding the export of PGP into 
Canada?  I know that it is not allowed to exported overseas but what is 
the ruling on into Canada.  Some sites say that it can be exported into 
Canada and others say that it can't.  Can anyone out there give me some 
information on this topic?
