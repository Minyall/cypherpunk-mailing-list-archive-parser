The celluar companies "solution" to this problem for AMPS phones is 
laughable.

My understanding is CDMA based digital celluar go a long way toward 
this.  CDMA uses direct-sequence spread-spectrum based transmission, 
should keep everyone but the TLA's out.

Consider getting digital celluar service.  The current widely deployed 
digital celluar standard, TDMA, is less secure than CDMA above, but is 
more than enough to keep 99% of the cell bandits out.  CDMA should be 
available from USwest and Pacific Telesis (possibly others) by the end 
of the year.
