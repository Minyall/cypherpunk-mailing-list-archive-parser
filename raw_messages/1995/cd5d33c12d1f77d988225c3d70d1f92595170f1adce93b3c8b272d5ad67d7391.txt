I have to concur on this point.  Posting conspiracy tracts to cypherpunks, or
posting algorithm ideas to the conspiracy list, only serves to dilute the
primary function of the list in question.


J. Orlin Grabbe's actions in this respect are harmful (though of course
I don't think they are malicious.)
