I have gone back and improved the "Netscape GAK?" page based on a good
nights sleep and some helpful suggestions (thanks you all who mailed me
about the page). I would appreciate feedback on the page, especially from
Netscape or its employees (in an official or unofficial capacity). I have
tried to be even handed in my presentation of the information, while not
hiding the fact that I strongly disagree with the stance that Netscape has
taken.
