First, it may not be true. 
 
Second, if it is true, people frequently define the ability to do something
as a "privledge" not a "right." As in a hypothetical "Use of student
accounts at O.U. is a privledge extended to the students by the University.
By using our computer you keep to our rules, including abandoning any
notion you might have that your communications are in any way private" etc.
etc.
