Well, nobody, really. Actually I feel kinda guilty about posting this
in the first place.

Sorry. I did leave out one key piece of information:

> host cm.org
cm.org mail is handled by panix3.panix.com
cm.org mail is handled by not-a-firewall.panix.com
cm.org mail is handled by panix4.panix.com
cm.org mail is handled by panix.com
cm.org mail is handled by panix2.panix.com

That, in conjunction with the fact that moose@cm.org is the email
address given for the cancelmoose, does point to the connection.

However, after a little further investigation, I don't think it really
is Mr. Nagengast. It actually appears that panix.com is running a
little remailer. As Dave Winer would say, cooooool.

You're right. My sincerest apologies.
