  Here is a quote from Microsoft's Internet Explorer 2.0 Beta announcement,
which can be found at http://www.microsoft.com/windows/pr/sept2895.htm:


    Internet Explorer 2.0 also provides users with a secure environment.
    Complete support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and RSA encryption
    allows integration with secure sites. In addition, Internet
    Explorer 2.0 will support Private Communication Technology (PCT),
    which is an efficient and secure upgrade to the SSL protocol.
    Internet Explorer will also support Secure Transaction Technology
    (STT), an electronic payment technology jointly developed by
    Microsoft and Visa International, as soon as it is available. 

  There is that pesky word "secure", five times in one paragraph.

  What if they replace your "integrity shell"?

  We are working on clarifying our security claims.  Here is an
example from the San Jose Mercury news on Aug. 17, 1995:

    "We have said for a long time that given the right amount of
    computer power, that a 40-bit key encrypted message could be
    decrypted," said Mike Homer, Netscape's vice president of marketing.

  Here is one definition of the word "security" from the Webster's
New World Dictionary, Third Edition:

    protection or defense against attack, espionage, etc.

  Note that I make no claims that this is Netscape's definition of
security in our products.

  Billions of dollars have not been invested in Netscape.  An examination
of the prospectus and the current stock price will bear this out.

  Here is a quote from the Netscape prospectus:

    The Company has included in its products an implementation of the
    Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL"), a security protocol which operates in
    conjunction with encryption and authentication technology licensed
    from RSA Data Security, Inc. ("RSA").  Despite the existence of
    these technologies, the Company's products may be vulnerable to
    break-ins and similar disruptive problems caused by Internet users.
    Such computer break-ins and other disruptions would jeopardize the
    security of information stored in and transmitted through the
    computer systems of end users of the Company's products...

  Of course anyone who is interested in investing in Netscape's
stock should get and read the entire prospectus.

  It would have to be many billions of dollars before it becomes
"a fair chunk of the world economy", and I think that even the
most optimistic projections of internet commerce put that many
years in the future.

  I don't think that it is reasonable to expect that everyone who
asks for an official company position on some random mailing list
will get a response.  The people who make such statements are not
usually on such lists, and the have other forums for making public
statements.  Perhaps you should call our PR department for a statement.

  You are certainly free to "stand your ground", but I am also
free to not respond to you.
