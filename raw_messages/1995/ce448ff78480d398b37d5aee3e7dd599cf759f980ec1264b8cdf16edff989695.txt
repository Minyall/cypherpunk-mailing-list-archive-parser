Not only that but it's common now for DNS servers to give short TTL
for the answers (multiple A recs for load balancing), no big deal
to have pseudo-subdomains that are pointed at a different server
(Even over slip/ppp) than normal name service.

I believe the root servers answers for intermediate nodes are cached
normally, so key.george.bub.com doesn't cause a root hit after
bub.com has been resolved.

Quite a few domains do run their own name servers, and it's not too tough
to create auto-update scripts, etc.

There's no reason that DNS has to be the only mechanism.  Default
to one method then fallback to others, like direct IP port connection
for query.
