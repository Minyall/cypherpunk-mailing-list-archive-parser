The provider is allowed access ONLY for QC purposes. Getting back to thhe 
original point, the provider's ability to interpret the contents of the 
message is in no way required to monitor the system and cannot be used as 
a justification in itself for prohibiting use of crypto. 

Also, what if someone outside the system emails encrypted messages to the 
user. What authority would the sys admin have there??
