   12-27-95. W$Jug:


   A test of superfast cable modems at Boston College prove
   addictive to speed freak faculty and students downloading
   junk data in seconds not minutes and hours, thus
   accelerating mind-rupture.

   And, an editorial red flags the telecom billions giveaway;
   nags Republicans to shut the geyser and not-reg the I-Way.
