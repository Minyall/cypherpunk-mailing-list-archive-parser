I find it bizarre that what little is going on in real integration of PGP for e-mail users is not mentioned on cp, perhaps unknown, certainly not of interest to those who should be interested.

What is going on is going on with respect to Pegasus, and what mention of it there is is not on cp but on the Pegasus Mail list.

Apparently cypherpunks *don't* write code, and PMail people *do*.

Do a million registered users and an e-mail program with hooks already originating outside the U.S. penetrate anyone's consciousness?
