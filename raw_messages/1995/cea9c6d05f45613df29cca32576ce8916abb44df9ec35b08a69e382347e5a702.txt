I absolutely agree with you on this point.  I'll point out again that this
is the same problem as creating a rating scheme for the security of
*products*.

It is popular these days to jump on the risk assessment bandwagon and
forget about assurance.  This occurs because people think risk assessment
is a quick fix that you can do after the system is built and configured.
Some holes cannot be patched.
