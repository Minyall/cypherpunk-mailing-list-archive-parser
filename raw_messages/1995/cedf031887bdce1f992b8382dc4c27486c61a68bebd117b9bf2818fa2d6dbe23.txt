Many types of business dealings are exempt from sales tax, through
arrangements for resales.

I don't know if the "skims off 4% to 10% every time" point accurately
describes how the current Digicash model works, but certainly this will not
fly as a long term rate. So many monetary transactions happen in the course
of business that even a 4% fee _per transaction_ would rapidly wipe out
most of the value.
