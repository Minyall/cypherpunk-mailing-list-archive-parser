I read a review of this book in the Standard <ducking rotten tomatoes> with
in the last week or so.

If you think *I'm* hyperjargonate, you should see how this guy does it.
Hear tell he practically invents his own language...

May be worth a read if the local library has it, though.

Cheers,
