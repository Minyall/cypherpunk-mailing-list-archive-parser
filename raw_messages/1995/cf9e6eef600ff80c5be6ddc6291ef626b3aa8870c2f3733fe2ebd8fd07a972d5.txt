	I'm not sure thats true.  Allow me to argue by analogy.

	A car company, hearing the FBI's laments about cars being used
as getaway vehicles after bank robberies, starts a program of putting
explosives in all their cars, with radio detonators.  In an
unfortunate accident, some of the explosives go off for no reason,
injuring the owner of the car, etc, etc.  It seems to me that the car
maker would be quite liable for doing something stupid (putting
explosives in the engine block), even though they didn't cause the
explosion.
