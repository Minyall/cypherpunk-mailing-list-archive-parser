The detailed discussions of planning such a port probably are inappropriate 
for cypherpunks.  Lord knows we need to conserve space for Foster conspiracy 
theories.....

I think a seperate list might not be a bad idea.  Either on your server or on 
something like vger.rutgers.edu, which is pretty much the linux mailing center 
of the universe right now. :-)

We should probably also check on comp.os.linux.networking and linux-net@vger.rutgers.edu to make sure someone isn't already working on this.

The ideal author would be outside the US, since the patches would need to be mailed to Linus for inclusion in the kernel, and that brings up some interesting ITAR issues.
