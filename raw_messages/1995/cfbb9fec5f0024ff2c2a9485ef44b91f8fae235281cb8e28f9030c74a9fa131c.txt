Lots of people are discussing all sorts of weird souces of radioactive
material to use in a detector for an RNG.

None of this is necessary. Scientific supply houses will happily sell
you small calibrated sources for use in your lab, classroom, or in our
case, machine room (:-).  There is no need to find objects to
dismantle or silly dangerous radioactive sources. You can get a source
that produces exactly as much activity as you need very cheaply.
