It might be even better to note that the amount of NFS traffic that passes
outside of a given local network/geographical area is small NFS does
reasonably poorly from a performance perspective over WAN connections in
general so most organizations don't use it for more local are use.
WUarchive allowed it for a while but it was infinitely slow compared to
ftp.  I suspect that a protocol analysis of a major interchange point
(MAE's, NAP's, etc) would show NFS traffic at far less than 1% of the
total.  

The NFS threat should be delegated to that class of problems which are
characterized as locally insecure, which can be easily exploited by a
malicious user (internal or external who has broken in), locally useful,
something which can be made better (kerberos version for example), but
generally isn't for ease of use.

can you look into it :-)
