> Subject: Kerberos
|| We are studying kerberos, the security system implemented by MIT's
Athena network.
|| Has anyone started, considered, imagined or completed any similar
security
|| systems, preferably using public key cryptography (as opposed to a
single 56-bit
|| DES key)?

The Open Software Foundation's Distributed Computing Environment has the
concept of a central security registry (which is currently based on
Kerberos).  I haven't delved too deeply into them, but the OSF website has
some DCE RFCs about adding public key capabilities to the registry.  They
should be off the OSF home page somewhere at <http://www.osf.org>.
