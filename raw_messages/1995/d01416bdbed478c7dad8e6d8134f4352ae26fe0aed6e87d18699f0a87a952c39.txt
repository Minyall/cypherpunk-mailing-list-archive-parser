It seems to me that not finishing a game is the same as knocking over
the board.  It's a loss for the player waiting to move, and a non-game
for the other player.  This should solve the not-finishing-a-game
problem in short order.

For the problem of playing a fake unrated player, try variations on this
scheme.  Track the players each player plays and reevaluate all players
scores in relative terms.  To get a rating, players must engage in games
with enough other players to form a valid statistical basis - at least
100 games with rated players for 10% accuracy. 

	Start with provisional ratings in the 1-10 range based on
	comparrison with other players regardless of who.

	As players play other fully rated players, add a temporary
	rating based on relative performance and post both relative
	and 1-10 ratings.

	When players reach 100 games within the rated group, they get
	an official rating.
