Unfortunately, in order for a coin to be POTENTIALLY spent in an off-line
way, the protocols require that the identity of the withdrawer be
embedded, in blinded form, within the coin data.  It is this step that
Tim and others object to, because among other things it requires
participants to securely identify themselves to the bank, hence does not
work well in a fully anonymous society.  The reason for this requirement
is that if the coin is double-spent, this is not found out until
afterwards, and so the identity of the cheater has to be available so the
bank can go after him.

So letting the payee choose whether to deposit the coin right away or
wait until later will not address this basic privacy problem with offline
cash.
