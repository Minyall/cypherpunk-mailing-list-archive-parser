Nor do I.

But in practice, PGP is not used this way by the masses.  They use standard
distributions withou alteration.

Sounds like this is not very random - I agree that "the user may provide
highly repetitive input".  Just because one type of input is more
repetitive, doesn't make the other truely random.

You left out "with some qualifications".  This is the part where I have concern.

You missed the "but conservative assumptions need to be made" part.  Hundreds
of random bits are possible, but how many actual bits of content are contained in
PGP input.

You missed the "However, it may still fail against a high grade attack
on small single user systems, especially if the adversary has ever been
able to observe the generation process in the past.  A hardware based
random source is still preferable." part and your reliance on the term
"may" as "does" is overly optimistic.

Not demands - questions.  Why is it that you are unwilling to take
questions as questions and instead translate them into demands? You
could have answered my questions without all the other side comments. 
Why didn't you? I interpret this as being defensive, which means to me
that you are not as sure as you outwardly indicate and that there may be
some lingering issues.  So I ask more questions.  You respond with more
posturing and fewer answers, so I become even more concerned.

It's probably my fault for not asking them in the way you are used to
hearing them, or maybe we are all over-sensitive about our work.

Which is why we need very small programs (which PGP is not) that do the
security-critical functions.  We can then analyze these programs and
determine many important properties with regard to their security, which
we cannot do with PGP.

Thank you, but I think it may be too hard to do for a much larger piece
of code.  There is another gentleman who is now working on formally (and
automatically) verifying these properties.  Perhaps his results will be of
value in your problem and similar problems for other programs.

I think that some of the popular literature sections may be considered
pornography (Fanny Hill, the Kama Sutra, etc.) and in order to comply
with the applicable laws, I thought it would be prudent to warn off our
fragile youth.
