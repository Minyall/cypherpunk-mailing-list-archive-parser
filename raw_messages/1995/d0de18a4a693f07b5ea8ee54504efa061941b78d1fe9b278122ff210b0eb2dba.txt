I'm a little new to this, but I thought the whole idea behind keys was
not having to whisper "secrets" to someone on the other side of a
crowded mall. Most people don't have the luxary of connecting their
computers back to back with someone on the other side of the world
just to ensure a secure communications path. Ther would have to be
some mechnisms to ensure that secure delivery of your "secret", and
that brings us back to key management, so the whole thing is rather
self defeating.
