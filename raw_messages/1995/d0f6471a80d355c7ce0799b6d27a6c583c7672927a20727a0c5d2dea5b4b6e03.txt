Note that most of the MBone tools already has encrypted sessions
built in them, and have had that for at least a year, and that the
MICE project in Europe has tried to put encryption into the last ones.

There is also a lot of standardization efforts going on within the
IETF community, for example within the MMUSIC group, chaired by
Mark Handley from UCL, London <M.Handley@cs.ucl.ac.uk>. They are
standardizing the session control protocol, for example, using one
called CCCP. They are also concerned about security, thats for sure.
