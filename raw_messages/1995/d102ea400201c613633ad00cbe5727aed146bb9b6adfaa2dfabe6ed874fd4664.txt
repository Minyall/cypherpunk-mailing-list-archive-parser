An early version of NRL's 4.4BSDlite based IPsec/IPv6 implementation
is up on ftp.c2.org in an appropriately export controlled directory.

This isn't an official distribution -- I'm just putting up the code I
got because there has been some interest in it. I've been hacking it
in to NetBSD of late.
