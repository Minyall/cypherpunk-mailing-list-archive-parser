AOL DROPS RESTRICTION ON WORD "BREAST"
America Online, which has been making efforts to police its own service by
purging obscene or vulgar expressions deemed to be offensive, has changed
its mind about the word "breast" and reinstated it as an acceptable term of
discussion.  A contributor to a breast cancer bulletin board had called the
purging of the word breast "outrageous and potentially life-threatening."
