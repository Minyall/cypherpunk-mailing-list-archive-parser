It would be within the capability of smaller animation houses to render
a feature length computer-animated film at high quality without
significant capital equipment expenditure or excessive rental costs.

If the granularity of transaction is per-frame (not unreasonable for a
night's worth of cycles), the evil participant problem is avoidable
since each frame would have to be inspected by a person, and payment
for a correct frame approved by same, before it's integrated into the
film.
