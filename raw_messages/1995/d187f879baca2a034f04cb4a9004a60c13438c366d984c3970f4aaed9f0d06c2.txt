Web of trust is a mess because it attempts to link keys to 
physical people, which in general cannot be done.

If we stick to a lesser goal -- constancy of identity -- 
this is not so hard.  In general it is impossible to prove that 
Bryce is the "real" Bryce, but it is trivial to prove that 
Bryce is the same Bryce who has a certain Web page, and the
same Bryce who posted a certain article in archives.

We should blow off this attempt to do the impossible.
