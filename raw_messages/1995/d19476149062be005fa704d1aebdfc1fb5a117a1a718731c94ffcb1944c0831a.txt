Still, messages intended for the DH could be identified by the publically 
known mailer address.  Some sort of protocol where each message to the 
remailer results in a new and different encrypted send-to block being 
returned to the sender would seem to be required.  Avoiding traffic analysis 
on these messages would require you to place a new and different encrypted 
reply-to on each message chunk.

I was assuming this--on the basis that the DH would not want its location 
know to the presumeably large number of clients.
