	This is a failure in the (TCP wrappers?) that should be
reconfigured.

	Since the service you are providing is available without any
authentication, there is no reason to match hostnames to IPs with a
double reverse lookup.

	Since your server is secure, what does it really matter where
the connections are coming from?  If netscape chooses to hide host
information, they should be allowed to.

	Cypherpunk relevance?  Its wrong to demand authentication when
you don't care.  Airports, bars, 'anonymous' FTP servers and the like
should all take the level of authentication they need.
