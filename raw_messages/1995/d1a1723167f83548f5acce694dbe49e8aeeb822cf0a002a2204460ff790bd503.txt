Is there an actual quote - did an identifiable government person actually 
use the 'belt and suspenders' line? This is getting to the point where 
journalists could have something to hang a story on.

I think we can infer from this that the USG has, or soon expects to have, 
the ability to brute 64 bits of key.

A shame certainly, but I suspect you meant 'sham' (not a spelling flame, 
the difference in meaning is important).
