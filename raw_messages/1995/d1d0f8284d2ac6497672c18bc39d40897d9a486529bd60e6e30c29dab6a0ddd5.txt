   "In an unusual interview Yevgeny Primakov, head of the
   Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, discussed problems
   and challenges facing his intelligence agency in terms that
   often sounded like testimony that CIA Director John M.
   Deutch gave the House intelligence committee Tuesday.

   In comments that echoed those of his U.S. counterparts,
   Primakov charged that some post-Cold War budget cuts in his
   agency developed 'because the [Russian] press ganged up on
   us [and] many newspapers wrote absurd things about us,
   including statements that foreign intelligence was no
   longer necessary at all.' His remarks about media coverage
   were similar to recent statements by Deutch and his
   predecessors, R. James Woolsey and Robert M. Gates."
