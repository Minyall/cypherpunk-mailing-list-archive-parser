Actually, it's probably worse than you think:

There are govt's out there that won't let you import code that is
"encryption ready". You must prove that your software is tamper proof
before it can be imported, and tamper proofing means that you can't
bolt on security. Also, I believe the export laws disallow "plug in"
security in the US...

The crypto legal world sucks.
