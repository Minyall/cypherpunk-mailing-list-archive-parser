Hi bruce, Hows it going? I'm back from DK and the UK. I understand you're
just coming back from JP (wow what world travelers we are!).

have you heard from Sutherland? Do we have a title? page length? It seems
to me that we should take out some of the clipper stuff and put in more on
CKE since thats pretty hopt at the moment and will further distinguish us
from Hoffman's book.

We have also moved upto 56kb FR here in the office. Are you still
interested in a home page here? Or do you have one we can link to?

Dave
