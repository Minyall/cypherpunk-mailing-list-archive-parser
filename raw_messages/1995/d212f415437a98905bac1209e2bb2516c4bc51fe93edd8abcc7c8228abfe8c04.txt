  Rather than get into a big fight about how safe it is for netscape
to be reading PGPs randseed.bin file, I've changed our code to not
do it.  Instead of reading ~/.pgp/randseed.bin, we now get the name
of a file from the environment variable NSRANDFILE, and pass that
file's contents throught the RNG seed hash.  If you decide that its
safe, you can set the env variable to point to your randseed.bin file,
or any other file of random bits you care to use.
