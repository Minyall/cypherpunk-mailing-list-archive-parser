You are incorrect. Applets are DESIGNED to be tightly constrained in
what they do. You want to bet your career that there are no bugs in
the implementation of this design? The thing keeping you from opening
sockets or doing file-io is a very thin scrim. Are you *certain* that
it is bug free? I'm not.

Are you willing to bet your career that its bug free? Thats my question.

Don't get me wrong -- Mosaic also bothers me, as does Netscape. Java,
however, gives me the willies.

*designed*. Can you be certain that both the design and the
implementation are bug free?

I like systems that are more fail-safe. About half a dozen
simultaneous bugs would be needed to break some of my more secure
firewalls, for example. Java does *not* provide security in depth.
