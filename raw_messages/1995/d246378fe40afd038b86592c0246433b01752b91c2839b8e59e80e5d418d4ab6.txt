Let me illustrate this with an example. During my visit to the Center 
for Disease Control in Atlanta, I saw original lab notebooks of experiments
designed to cure Aids, Hanta virus, etc. A noble cause.


But all of this noble research was obtained by holding the entire 
population of a nation in thrall.  These people were threatened with 
death if they didn't support this research.  Armed men herded resisters 
into camps guarded by high walls and barbed wire.

All government research Nazi or whatever is soaked in the blood of 
millions.
