   I am concerned about the ethics of having a paymailer feed into the free
   remailer soup - how would their operators react if I'm effectively making money 
   (no matter how little) off of them?

There is no ethical problem.  How do they know someone isn't making
money off them already?  If they haven't considered that, they should.
