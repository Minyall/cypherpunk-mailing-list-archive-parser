I don't find it too hard to believe that the Dutch would make a test like 
this.  Security at Schipol can be pretty intense.  I find it a little 
harder to believe that they would goof and let the bomb-oid get away, but 
mistakes happen.  What I find difficult to swallow is that they would 
*tear* the man's luggage to insert the article.

In my experience, the Dutch are almost obsessively careful in taking care 
of their own property and that of others.

FWIW,
