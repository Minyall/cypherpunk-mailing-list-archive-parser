I will gladly put up any nist-meeting papers, comments, drafts, etc.
on my webpage. Please send them to me. (pfarrell@netcom.com)

I am even willing to type in some, but that is known to cause typos,
as I can't type, and even spellcheckers can't tell real words
such as 'sham' from 'shame'

Right now, I'm pretty down on the two days, but lets keep the information
flowing.
