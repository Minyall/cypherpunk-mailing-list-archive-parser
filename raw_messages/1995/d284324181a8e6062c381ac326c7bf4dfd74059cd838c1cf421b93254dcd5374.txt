  I tested your crash page on 1.12 for SGI, and 2.0 on SGI and Windows NT,
and none of them had any problem.

  I spent five years working on the X server, and my credo then was that if the
X server crashes, its a bug in the X server, no matter what wild
shit the client throws at it.  (I feel the same way about netscape now...)

  I suggest you complain to your X server vendor.
