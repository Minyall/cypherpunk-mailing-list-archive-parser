Matt Blaze sez:

: Source code for the latest version (release 1.3) of CFS, the Cryptographic
: File System, is now available upon request for research and experimental
: use in the US and Canada.

[..]

: If you would like a copy of the CFS source code, please read to the end
: of this message and then send email to:

: 	cfs@research.att.com

: DO NOT REPLY DIRECTLY TO THIS MESSAGE.  You must include a statement
: that you are in the US or Canada, are a citizen or legal permanent
: resident of the US or Canada, and have read and understand the license
: conditions stated above.  Be sure to include an email address in a US-
: or Canada-registered domain. The code will be sent to you via email in
: a "shar" shell archive (a little over 300K bytes long).


Now, this would be very handy, unfortunately I'm no American or Canadian.
