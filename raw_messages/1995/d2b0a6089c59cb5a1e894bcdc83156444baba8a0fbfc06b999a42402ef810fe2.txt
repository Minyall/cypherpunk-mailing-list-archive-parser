     Sorry for the rude question.  I have been following this thread 
     closely but must have missed the original message regarding using 
     radiation detectors to produce random numbers.

Generating good random numbers is key to operating a solid 
cryptographic system. I've argued that computer interfaced radiation 
detectors are the optimal way of generating such numbers because they 
are hard to screw up -- biased diode noise and other sources are too 
easy to misdesign or misuse. Aware is a source of such detectors.
