    Sallie Mae's commercial paper is NOT backed by the full 
    faith and credit of the US government.  They carry a specific disclaimer 
    to that effect.  It is true that many personal student loans (GSLs) from 
    banks are guaranteed by the government.  The system was recently reformed 
    to remove the riskless subsidy to Sallie Mae, which is 100% privately 
    owned, and very profitable.
    
    Similarly Fannie Mae and all other priavetly held GSE's are only backed 
    by an "implicit" federal guarantee.  Although the only time one of these 
    got into trouble the feds did bail it out.

I inferred (perhaps erroneously) a tone of correction in your message.
For the record, GSLs and GNMA loans were the only loans which I
explicitly claimed were backed by the full faith and credit of the US
government.  Thank you for your clarification wrt Sallie Mae.
