Government does indeed "order society."  However, "order" does not
equat to liberty, luxury, or to individual freedom.
 
If strong government resulted in liberty and freedom, then the
most intrusive, all-encompassing governments would result in 
its citizens having the most liberty.  Is this the case?  I would
look at the (former) Soviet Union, Iran, Cuba, East Germany, etc., 
for your answer.
 
Individual liberties do not necessarily result in an "orderly
society."  In fact, an imposed "order" on society, by definition,
must result in limited liberties.
 
Apply this to anonymous remailers, and encrypted personal mail, and you can 
easily see how the government imposing "order" would
result in the end of those activities.
