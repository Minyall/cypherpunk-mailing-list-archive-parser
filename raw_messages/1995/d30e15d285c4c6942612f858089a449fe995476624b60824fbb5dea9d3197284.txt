Er, you're kidding, right?  drand48 isn't in Posix either, for example.
Someone who runs on Motif and Mac has strdup as the least of their
worries.  But just in case it's stopping anyone:
	char *strdup(const char *x) { char *p;
	    return (p = malloc(strlen(x) + 1)) ? strcpy(p, x) : 0;
	}
(Deliberately written too-cleverly.  Lame compilers will need to cast to 0)
