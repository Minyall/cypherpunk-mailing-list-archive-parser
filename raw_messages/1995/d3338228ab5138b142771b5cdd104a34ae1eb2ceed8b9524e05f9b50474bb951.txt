The NSA has been mentioned in many recent movies, even in television shows
(like "The X Files"). I haven't been keeping a list, but the last Clancy
movie, "A Clear and Present Danger," had references. And in more than one
movie the reference to "NSA agents" doing various things is made.

The NSA has a high profile today. "No Such Agency" is clearly marked as an
exit on the Baltimore-Washington highway, and of course even has a museum
open to the public.

Even the National Reconnaissance Organization is public knowledge, partly
because of the Burrows book "Deep Black," and partly because of the
controversy over the huge building out near Dulles Airport.

Some things are mostly secret, though. The cover of Consular Operations was
almost blown some years back by former agent Ludlum, but ConsOps has faded
back into obscurity.
