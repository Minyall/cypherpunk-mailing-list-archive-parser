Okay, that doesn't sound so hard...

Have a look at
http://www.cs.monash.edu.au/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/~jirib/random?RandValue
where you replace RandValue by any text string.

Please do not try to break the implementation, I *know* you can overrun
buffers, use shell metacharacters and generally stuff around.
Just don't, OK? Thanks.

Feel free to try to break the algorithm, though.

Well I don't keep track of entropy, so that doesn't apply, does it...

I reveal md5 hash of my seed only.

Well, entropy put in must be greater than entropy used or lost through
cracked connections. (Ie not just "initial", also entropy put in along
the way.)

I fail this point either way.

Yup, I do that (though "quality" would be quite a bit of a euphemism, and
the file is hardly protected at all).


Have fun!
