Along the same lines, I just picked up "Cryptography, Theory and 
Practice" by Douglas R. Stinson (CRC Press, 1995). It seems to be 
very comprehensive but lacks the readability of Schneier. This is 
definitely not a beginner's book, but it would be useful to someone 
seeking greater insight into the math behind crypto.
