  Thanks for digging this one out.  I looked and didn't find it in
our local spool.

  The above appears to be total trash:

	1) Netscape does not know about multipart/parallel, and will
		bring up a "save as" dialog when it is encoutered.

	2) The whole multipart/x-mixed-replace, multipart/parallel,
		server push thing is not interesting.  The final
		part with the naughty postscript could just be
		the main document.

	3) Netscape does not ship with a helper app configured for
		application/postscript.

  If a user configures a postscript viewer that has not had the
file operations disabled as a helper app to any web browser then
they are opening themselves up for a world of hurt.  The same is
true if they just download the file and run their viewer on it
manually.  The same is true if they configure /bin/sh as an
external viewer.

  Obviously everyone should heed perry's warnings and emasculate
their postscript interpreters before using them to view files
of unknown origin.
