I don't think that's what was meant. After all, using telepathy as a 
secure channel, you'd still need a comm protocol. The last time I checked
protocols and algorithms are one and the same. Since elementrix doesn't use
algorithms, we shouldn't defame them by claiming they've invented secure
telepathy.        

Now wouldn't that be interesting to patent?
(One wonders if elementrix employees occasionally indulge in guilty 
glances at Knuth and Sedgewick without their bosses' knowledge.)
