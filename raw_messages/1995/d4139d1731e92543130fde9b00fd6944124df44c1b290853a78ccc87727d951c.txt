As a somehow related note, my experience with some past jobs is that in
some circumstances the employee turnover rate is high enough that a manager
will give a neutral or good rating simply because they have no experience
with a previous employee who clearly did not deserve a good rating.

Something similar could happen with mailing lists... hardly anyone can
remember when a 'newbie' posted to a list a few years ago, irregardless
of whether a person is still worth a certain rating after a time.

Then again, with a lot of material being archived, it might be easier in
some circumstances to review a person's contributions to a list rather
than rely on a rating... or maybe send a trusted rater to research an
author on the 'net for you rather than maintain a huge database of
ratings that will need some form of interpretation.

Then again, (as Tim and others noted) there's alws killfiles and manual
glossing over of threads, etc.

Litigating in a society of pseudonyms may have it's own problems anyway...
(imagining suing a trusted friend of yours who prefers to give you much
needed crticisms through a pseudonym so as to protect the friendship...
on example off the top of my head)... How can a 'nym be held legally
accountable as a non-'nym?
