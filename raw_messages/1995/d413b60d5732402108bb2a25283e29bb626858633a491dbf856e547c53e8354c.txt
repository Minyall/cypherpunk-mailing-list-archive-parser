The problem is that you are using the wrong command....

This is the correct behavior of "pgp filename".  If you want other
behavior, you should tell PGP how you want it to behave.

A very noble effort, combining PGP with mailers.  Btw: When you run
"pgp filename" and filename contains public keys, it will ask you
before it adds them to your keyring!

You can use "pgp -d" to force it to do a decryption (although you
cannot specify which key to use for the decryption; it will choose any
of the keys on your secret keyring).

Well, I'm not exactly sure what you want.  You can give PGP no
password and it will tell you to whom a message is encrypted.  You can
call pgp -ka and it will _only_ add keys (and complain if you are
given anything else).  There is no way to ask PGP "what kind of
message is this"; that is sort of what the ASCII ARMOR header is for.

No, you should, at this point, consider working around the problems in
the monolithic PGP, until a more modular library is available, to
which multiple end programs can be built to do multiple little tasks,
as Matt explained.

Does this help?
