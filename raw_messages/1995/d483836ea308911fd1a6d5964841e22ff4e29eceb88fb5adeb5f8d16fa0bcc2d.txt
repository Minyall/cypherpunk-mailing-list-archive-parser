There would be on a secure "multi-user, unattended server". They are not
easy to come by and they arn't really Unix. I don't get on my soap box very
often but I couldn't resist your execelent opportunity. I think that
security requires good crypto and good OS security. There are Orange book
rated systems that are rated to run hostile software in the same machine
with Top Secret information.
