I would very much like to see this law tested. I think it could prove fairly
important to attack it with a well-planned, benign test case rather than wait
for the next National Liberation spam or a death threat. 

I don't live in PA, but I would be willing to participate as the defendant in
a test case under the right circumstances. Presumably I would open an
account with an ISP in Penna., set up a remailer on the account (need to find
an ISP that clearly allows that), and have somebody send a message through it.

We would need to design a promising test case and find an attorney willing &
able to offer pro bono services. 

Any comments or suggestions, esp. from legal types (who of course are not
offering formal legal advice to anyone :) ?  Is this realistic ?  What would
it take to elicit a prosecution for such a test case ?
