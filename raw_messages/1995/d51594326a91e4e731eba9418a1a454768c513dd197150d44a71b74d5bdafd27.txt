Sorry, up all night coding, and forgot to briefly describe what Private Idaho is:

Private Idaho is a freeware, Windows frontend to PGP and the anonymous remailers.  It provides a simple, easy to use interface for encrypting and decrypting messages as well as preparing messages to send through remailers.  Although quite usable by crypto-novices, there are a number of advanced features for more experienced users.
