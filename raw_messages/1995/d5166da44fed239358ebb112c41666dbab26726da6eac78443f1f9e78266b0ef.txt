I'm presuming that the consumer is aware of the key escrow.  It would 
indeed be foolhardy for Netscape to try to hide that, given the liability 
problem and the cypherpunks available to discover the "hidden" escrow.

I they tell you about it and you buy it anyway -- tough luck.


Same with the cars.  Would *you* buy Pinto with explosives in it???? 
(leaving aside the "inherently dangerous" argument for the moment on the 
products liability claim).
