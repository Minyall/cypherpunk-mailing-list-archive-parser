Doesn't quantum coherence require molecular precision if it
is to work on 1024 bit PGP keys? If it works, such keys can 
be instantly factorized. It would be nice to follow that progress.

If human engineered molecular nano works, we'll have much 
more than PGP to worry about. Copies of copies of 
replicating disassemblers could rip the Earth apart in three
days, assuming doubling every 20 minutes like bacteria,
but not limited to proteins.

That would have a big impact on digital cash networks!
