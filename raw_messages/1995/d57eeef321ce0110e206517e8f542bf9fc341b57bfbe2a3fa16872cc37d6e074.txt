My point is that anyone at any level can make two different types of
statements, those for themselves and those for the company.  If Jim
Clark makes a statement as the President of Netscape, then he is
speaking for Netscape.  If he makes a statement as Jim Clark, then he
is speaking for Jim Clark.  It is possible to not believe in something
ethically, yet see a financial advantage in supporting it.  Their is a
distinction that must be made, though admitedly the line does become
fuzzy when a senior person makes a statement, this is because he is
often the one driving the policy.
