   Hackers Alert Netscape to Another Flaw

   By Bloomberg Business News


   Mountain View, Calif., Sept. 25 -- The Netscape
   Communications Corporation said today that a third flaw had
   been discovered in its Internet access software by a group
   of computer hackers who call themselves the Cypherpunks.

   The hackers -- computer users and mathematicians who try to
   discover weaknesses in computer software and networks --
   found a design flaw that can shut down Netscape's Navigator
   browser software, which helps people travel on the
   Internet.

   Two American college students last week broke Netscape's
   software security code, a design flaw that could jeopardize
   financial transactions done using Navigator. A month
   earlier, a French hacker broke a different Netscape
   security code.

   "We are learning a lot from these problems," said Michael
   J. Homer, vice president of marketing at Netscape. Shares
   of the company, which sold its first stock to the public
   last month, rose $4.25 today to close at $67 in Nasdaq
   trading.

   The latest flaw found by the hacker group is a programming
   error in Netscape software used to navigate the World Wide
   Web, a part of the Internet made up of photos, sounds and
   drawings.
