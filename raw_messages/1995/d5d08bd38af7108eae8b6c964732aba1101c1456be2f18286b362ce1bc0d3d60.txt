The question is: What is obsene? What the community in NYC considers 
obsene is sure a lot different than what the community in Elk River 
Minnesota considers obsene. (They've been trying to eject their one XXX 
bookstore for years now while NYC has the American Museum of Pornography 
at 42nd Street ;) ;) :) ) As you can see, obsenity depends where you are 
geographically located, at least according to our highest court. If 
community standards say it is obsene then it is. They never legally 
defined what constitutes something as being obsene or an obsenity.
