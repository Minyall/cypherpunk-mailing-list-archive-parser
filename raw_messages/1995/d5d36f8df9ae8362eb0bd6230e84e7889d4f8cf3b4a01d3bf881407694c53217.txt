There are several approaches - in the immediate-clearing model,
you can tell if someone's spent coin 111111111111 because the bank keeps
a record of which coins have been spent and refuses to pay anybody
who tries to spend the same coin later; this almost forces you to use
on-line clearing solutions.  Chaum's blinding protocols
make it possible for the bank to sign a coin without being able to
trace it to the person withdrawing the coin, so she can spend it anonymously.

Another model uses the protocols Tom described which place a random chunk
of the spender's identity into the coin - one chunk gives away no information,
but two chunks have an extremely high probability of doing so - so you
can go prosecute the guilty double-spender later (or just debit her account
twice...)
Then there are the non-anonymous models.
