I can think of two purposes for "duress codes":  1.   To yield 
little loot to the thief, thus leaving more of it in your possession
and discouraging theft.  2.  To summon help in the form of physical
force.


The first use is susceptible to the "give me more or I cut off your
little finger" approach.  So we are again faced with the great
importance of a good police force.


Let us not forget about the value of such when constructing our future
visions.
