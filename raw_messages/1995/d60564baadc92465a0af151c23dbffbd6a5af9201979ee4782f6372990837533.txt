The problem with that approach is that if the system is heavily loaded,
it can take an arbitrarily large amount of user time.  Somewhat better
is to sleep for a random amount of time after you're done.  That will
smear out the time distribution making it harder to get a statistically
meaningful number of samples.  It also increases your latency, but
doesn't hurt throughput on a busy system.
