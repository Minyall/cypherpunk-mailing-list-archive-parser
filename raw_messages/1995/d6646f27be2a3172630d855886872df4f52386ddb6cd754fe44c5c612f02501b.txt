Dear Cypherpunks,

   I used "PGP - A" to armor SUPERWIPE 1.04R for the first 10 C'punks to
request it. I assumed that all the users would be PGP 'enabled. In case
anyone of you weren't, please make another request for SUPERWIPE & specify
that it be sent with UUENCODE armor & I will resend it with the UUENCODE
armor.
                                          Yours Truly,
                                          Gary Jeffers
