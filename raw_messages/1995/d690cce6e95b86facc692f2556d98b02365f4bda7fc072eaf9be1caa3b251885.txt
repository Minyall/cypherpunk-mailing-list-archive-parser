They know it's secure because they made it secure.  If they don't care, I 
don't particularly see why the remailer should care.

It strikes me that this is a very weak defense.  Legal beagles will probably 
argue that the remailer should have either prohibited encrypted 
communications or else was in collusion with the sending party.
