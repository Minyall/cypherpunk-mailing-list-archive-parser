What was the alternative suggestion? Many KRB5 folks, including Ted T'so,
have said that using ASN.1 is the biggest mistake in the KRB5 protocol.

Hunh?  The points of ASN.1 and BER (DER? -- a little mavros joke :) 
*are* irrelevent to Kerberos.  Wasted bytes in your security protocol
should most definitely be a concern.
