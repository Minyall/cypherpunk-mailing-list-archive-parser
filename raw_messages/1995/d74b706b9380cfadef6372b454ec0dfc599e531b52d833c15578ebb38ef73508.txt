   "Company Says Electronic Mail Was Opened to Find
   Pornography."

      America Online gave the FBI access to the mailboxes of
      its subscribers to identify several thousand users who
      viewed images of children in sexual poses and to trace
      messages beyond AOL to many more computer users
      nationwide. Because electronic mail has a life of days
      or weeks, can be traced and can be easily copied without
      alerting the owner, reading the mailboxes was
      particularly effective. It was unclear how much
      information about subscribers is routinely kept and how
      much private information was provided to the FBI.
      Actions of users can be recorded and can reveal much
      more personal information than the records a telephone
      company.


   "F.B.I. Chemist Says Experts Are Pressured To Skew Tests."

      Officials at the F.B.I. crime laboratory have been
      accused by one of its chemists, Frederic Whitehurst, of
      pressuring forensic experts to commit perjury to help
      secure criminal convictions. With opinion polls showing
      public support for the F.B.I. eroding after
      Congressional hearings into the Branch Davidian siege,
      the accusations regarding the laboratory are in some
      ways the worst blow yet.
