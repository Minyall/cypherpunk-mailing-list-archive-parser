Not so -- you merely have to broadcast to enough people.  
But then the topology, and hence the complexity, gets worse.

This however merely reduces the bandwidth waste from n^2 to n*lg(n)


A further wrinkle -- forming DC nets of DC nets, can reduce the
bandwidth waste to lg(n)^2, which should scale adequately to cover
the cosmos, but then the complexity gets really scary.

And when you try to figure how to deal with denial of service
attacks in a big DC net that tries to use bandwidth with
tolerable efficiency -- I don't know if anyone has figured out
what would be involved -- I certainly have not.
