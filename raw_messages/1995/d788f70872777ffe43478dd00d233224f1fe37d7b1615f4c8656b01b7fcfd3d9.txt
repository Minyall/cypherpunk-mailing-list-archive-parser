This is a serious problem.  On the other hand there are civil penalties
for violating the ITAR that can be imposed without any showing of
willfulness.  So the non-willfull exporter is still at risk, even if he
does not know it.  And if people are not informed in general, then the
boys from the Office of Defense Trade Controls and NSA, can selectively
inform only those whom they wish to harass, which is perhaps the
nastiest aspect of the ITAR.

The only long term solution is to establish that the ITAR's provisions
relating to cryptographic software are unconstitutional and void.
