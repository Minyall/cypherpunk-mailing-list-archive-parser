[various comments about extraterritorial reach]

Laws that affect the behavior of citizen-units, no matter where
they go, rest on the theory of "personal jurisdiction".

Note that in addition to ITAR, the various laws on money laundering,
as well as the RICO statues, apply to US citizens wherever they
may be. Ditto for tax laws -- one of the little gems that I
learned last week was that penalties to failure to report worldwide
income are going to be substantially increased. I guess they're
not getting very good compliance for some reason...
