Got to agree with Bill here.  Book, TV, movie, etc. stories are
not about "what" they are about "what if."  For our purposes, it
was sufficient that THE NET plausibly created distrust in 
solutions provided by monolithic big brothers.  A lot of elements
echoed arguments about Clipper, this Alltel conspiracy stuff,
secret back doors, manufactured justifications for government
mandated or endorsed security programs, etc.  Of course the
nominal enemy was an evil corporation, but it, could certainly 
be read as something more.  The "Praetorians" are taken right 
of history, and can only be interpreted as a governmental group.

I hope the movie is very popular.  It helps us by inducing 
healthy cynicism with a dash of paranoia.
