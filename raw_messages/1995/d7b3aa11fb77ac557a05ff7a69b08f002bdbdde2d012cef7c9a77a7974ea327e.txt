Harmon:

   Have you forgotten polite society?  Have you forgotten what your 
mother (should have) told you? "If you can not say something nice, don't 
say it."  --in particular refrain from personal attacks.  It is one thing 
to criticize, but it is another to blather unintelligibly without any 
knowledge than your own bias --and maybe your own intellectual ignorance 
and bigotry.  if you have not walked in the other's shoes, keep silent.

   now, if you will please excuse us, Perry has code to write --and I 
have code to write.  

   lastly, if you can not onserve reasonable decorum, sign for 
alt.christian and post heretical ravings, and if you are desparate for 
attention or your name in lights, join alt.flame and have at it.
