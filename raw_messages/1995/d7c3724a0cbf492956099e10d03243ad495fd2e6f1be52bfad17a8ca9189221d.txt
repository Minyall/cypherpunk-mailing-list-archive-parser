  The ITARs are currently keeping us(Netscape) from distributing
our US-only products to people within the United States.  We have
asked for clarification from the government about network distribution,
such as how much verification of location and citizenship of the
recipient we must do, and have yet to receive a response.  That
makes it more than just an export issue, at least for us.
