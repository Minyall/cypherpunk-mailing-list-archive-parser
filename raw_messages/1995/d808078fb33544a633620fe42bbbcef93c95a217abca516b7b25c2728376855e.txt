I can't speak for ISPs in general, but when I still ran a public-access
system, the absolute last thing I wanted was to be thought of as a
common carrier.  While common carriers are held blameless for the
content of traffic they pass, they are also heavily regulated.  In
general, a common carrier may not refuse to provide services unless
special circumstances exist.  Want to bet Usenet abuse won't be one of
those circumstances?  Spammers would love such a state of affairs.  (and
remember who wrote that whine)

I'm for keeping regulation out of the Inet whenever and wherever
possible.
