Ziggy has long been a libertarian/right winger.  Note a Sunday strip of a
few years ago.  Ziggy bends over and looks closely at some red ants who are
carrying picket signs reading "Down with Communism", "Freedom Now", etc.
Ziggy observes "It had to happen sometime."

Since we are being semi-irrelevant here, yesterday's Broom Hilda strip was
good for the net "Universal Access" wars.  Broom Hilda sits down at a
computer to take a ride on the Information Superhighway.  The computer says
"Sorry, the information superhighway is a toll road."  "What's the toll"?
"Brains."  So Broom Hilda gives up and sets off on a tour of the back roads
of America.

Note the proof that competition provides better service than
government-monopoly Universal Service.  After years of being one of the few
Local Telcos that charged residential customers metered rates for local
calls, NYNEX (New York Telephone) has announced some flat rate pricing
plans.  Nothing like a little local loop competition.
