There are 2 bills.  Senator Grassley's repressive Anti-Electronic Racketeering
Act of 1995 (S.974) has no co-sponsors.  

Senators Leahy, Kyle, and Grassley co-sponsored the National Information
Infrastructure Protection Act of 1995 (S.982).  I haven't seen any analysis
of it, but I did a quick read of it and didn't see anything alarming.
