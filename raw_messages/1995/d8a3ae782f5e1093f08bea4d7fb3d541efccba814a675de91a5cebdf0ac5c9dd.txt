This should be fairly straightforward: take the existing winsock.dll
or winsock32.dll and rename it. Install the NEC DLL with the old
winsock's name, then have the NEC DLL do a LoadLibrary() to attach the
original version.

Asynchronous requests are the best way to implement I/O under Windows
(3.1, '95, and NT.) Any app that's threaded (Free Agent and Netscape
come to mind) will benefit, as will any user who's using a
multiprocessor machine.

If you're willing to assume the existence of Win95 or WinNT, you can
always spawn a new thread for each connection.
