 A friend of mine recently told me that Phil Zimmerman was distributing a voice
encryption program over the 'net. I dismissed his comment thinking he was probably 
just confused and thinking about PGP. Lately though, I've been wondering if he was 
right. Does anyone know of any voice cryptology program that encrypts voice throught 
a modem connection? Thanx...
