Duncan aptly points to the WSJ article, lots of c'punk topics mentioned.

Meanwhile, here's a taste: 
 
 
   Mr. Willis says the libertarian concept has particular 
   appeal to people in the computer industry. "We have more 
   members in one computer company in Seattle than in some 
   whole counties, and that company is Microsoft," he says. 
 
 
   Indeed, when Mr. Frezza, the Philadelphia computer 
   consultant, last month launched a computer network of like- 
   minded thinkers called DigitaLiberty, he was so overwhelmed 
   with responses, especially from college students, that he 
   had to temporarily shut down the group's electronic 
   mailbox. 
 
 
   One member of DigitaLiberty is Bruce Fancher, a 23-year-old 
   who in the late 1980s earned brief notoriety as a hacker 
   who broke into computer systems, though he was never 
   charged with a crime. He is president of a computer 
   communications company called Phantom Access Technologies 
   Inc. "Being involved in computers or the Internet, you 
   inevitably move toward being a libertarian," he says. "It 
   is basically possible to keep all of your secrets from 
   prying eyes, particularly the prying eyes of the federal 
   government."
