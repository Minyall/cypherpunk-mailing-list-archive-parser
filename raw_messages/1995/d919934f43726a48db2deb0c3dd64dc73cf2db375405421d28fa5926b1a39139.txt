	If there is no expectation of privacy when a key is escrowed
with Bob, or my companies attorneys, then would there be any
expectation of privacy under Clipper?  Perhaps this is a powerful
argument we should expect to have used against us...

government, the defendant should have known his communications could
be listened to, and thus has no expectation of privacy."
