There is a new O'Reilly book out called _Computer Crime_ that covers the
entire arena in more detail than you'll be likely to ever need.  I hope.

It's decidedly oriented towards the law enforcement community, not
"Computer Folk". Though the title focuses on crime, you'll find what 
you need here.

Not to worry, we'll just outlaw all unlicensed cryptography.  After all, it
works in France. You don't see weekly terrorist attacks over there any more
now do you ?             - futplex@pseudonym.com -
