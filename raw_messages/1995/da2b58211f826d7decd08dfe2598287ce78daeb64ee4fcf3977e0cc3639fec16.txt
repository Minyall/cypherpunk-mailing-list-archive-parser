As long as the programmer's not American. They could contract it to a 
Canadian though. We don't have freeware export restrictions on non-US 
crypto, but I'm none too clear about everything else. All the same why not
contract it to Eric Young or whoever it is who's doing an independent
version of SSL (or whatever it's called) Down Under (was it Australia or 
NZ?) ? I don't see why geography's a problem.
