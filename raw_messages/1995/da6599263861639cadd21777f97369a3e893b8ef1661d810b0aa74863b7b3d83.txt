   I don't believe that's correct; under User Manager, select
the Account option under the Policies menu item; it lets you
select whether to lock-out the account after a given number
of invalid logon attempts, and to set the number.  The main
problem here is that by default, I don't believe the 'lock out'
option is enabled (and thus, brute-force attempts at Guest
or a similar account might indeed work).
