Just skip this silly little message if you know enough to
optimize the brutessl code.


Didn't know of a better place to put this, so please no flames.

Hopefully everyone on here is accomplished enough to know
optimizing the brutessl code helps immensely.  If not, well I used

gcc -O6 -funroll-loops -fomit-frame-pointer -finline-functions -c search.c
gcc -O6 -funroll-loops -fomit-frame-pointer -finline-functions -o brutessl \
                     brutessl.c search.o

To go from 5,000 keys per second to 10,100 keys per second.
