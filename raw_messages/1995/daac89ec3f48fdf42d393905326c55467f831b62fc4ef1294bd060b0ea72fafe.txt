I don't think you read the rest of my note.  I don't think it's
completely clear that I don't pay rent to my employer for my computer.

And still this reminds me of tenants property rights.  (And I do agree
the connection is rather thin, but work with me here.)  An apartment
manager can get in to an apartment for a variety of contractually set
reasons.

Maybe what all this means is that, at some point, employees will begin
demanding explicit contracts w.r.t. computer system policies, just
like for basic stuff like salaries & benefits.  Indeed, I know of
several cases where engineers being courted demanded and got perks
like window offices or an extra few PTO days in their initial offer;
why not a contract for what is and isn't "mine" on the network?

(In that light, it'd probably develop that those without such a
contract would be left on poor legal ground.)

(And we'd better stop before Perry yells at us :-)
