	Bruce Schneier is running a contest. First person to come up with 
a significant attack against full Blowfish (no partial round variants) 
gets $1000. The contest ends in April. Last time I heard, he had gotten a 
very interesting attack from someone, but not a complete one. He plans to 
reveal the results after the contest ends in April.
