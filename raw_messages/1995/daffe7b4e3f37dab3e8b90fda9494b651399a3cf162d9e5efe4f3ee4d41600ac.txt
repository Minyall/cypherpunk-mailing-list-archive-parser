A friend of mine has a business setting up networks for business's in the 
Baltimore area. He contracts out the security end of the setup to a firm
called "Smoke and Mirrors". They create firewalls and handle encryption
capabilities. I think the company is in the baltimore area, and was 
wondering if anyone on the list has heard of this company? With a name 
like smoke and mirrors I guess they better be good. Anybody know?
