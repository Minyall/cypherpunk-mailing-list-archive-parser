FANTASTIC!!!!
I think we've all been waiting for / building this.
Kudos...

Quibbles/suggestions:

ssh, while an obvious name, already collides with a nice shar decoder and
a different kind of secure shell from CFS.

Probably a worthwhile collision though.

Second: 

It would be very helpful if the socket connection could be made (optionally)
through a telnet proxy for firewalls (with optional quoting of problem
characters).  I've actually done this with TERM and a helper program.

I may produce a patch for this.

Third:

Of course support for S/Key and tokens/hand held authenticators would be
useful additions for some situations (although inferior to RSA...).

Forth:

Someone needs to crank out a Windows/Mac client... (Lower priority, but
still useful.)

Fifth:

udprelay etc. could also be borrowed from the term suite.

Sixth:

Integration with TCP/NFS and/or client-server CFS would be fantastic.
(One local CFS server acting as a secure client over tcp to a remote
CFS server.)
Remote encrypted mount of an encrypted partition...
