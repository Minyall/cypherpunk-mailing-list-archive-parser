There is a well written essay on the "preeminence of unix" at
http://gnn.com/gnn/bus/ora/features/history/index.html.  It
essentially says Unix has survived for so long because universities use
it, and you could license it fairly cheap.  Most people (I'm talking
about 90% of computer users, even more in the future) couldn't care
less about features such as tying apps together with shell scripts, 
pipes, and some bubble gum.

What are some "robust crypto tools" that are available for unix, and also
aren't available for DOS/Windows?

I kinda think the reason more tools aren't available for PCs (Windows/Mac)
is because there is no appreciable MARKET for such tools yet.  If there
were, since PCs have a market share an order of magnitude or two larger
than unix, such tools would have a greater influence anyway.
