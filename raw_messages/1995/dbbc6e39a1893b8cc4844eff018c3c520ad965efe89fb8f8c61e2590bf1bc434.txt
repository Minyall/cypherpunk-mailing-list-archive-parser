I've put a (slightly expanded) revised version of my paper, "High-
Bandwidth Encryption with Low-Bandwidth Smartcards" in my ftp directory.
This paper describes a little protocol for exploiting the secure key
storage facilities of slow smartcards but with the host processor
doing most of the actual work.
