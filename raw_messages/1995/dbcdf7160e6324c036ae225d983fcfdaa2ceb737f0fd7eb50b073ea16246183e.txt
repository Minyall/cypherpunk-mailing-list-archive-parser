This might be nice, but questions of "upsetting the system of checks
and balances" aside, you can't do it.  It would violate Article I,
Section 6 of the Constitution, which says that "for any speech or
debate in either House, [the Senators and Representatives] shall not be
questioned in any other place".  "Speech or debate" would cover the
vote on any question.

Therefore, the only organization which can hold a
senator/representative liable for passing a bad law is the one which
passed the law. :(
