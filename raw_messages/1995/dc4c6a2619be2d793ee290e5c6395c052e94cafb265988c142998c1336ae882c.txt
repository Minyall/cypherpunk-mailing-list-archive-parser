I also like the idea of DNS-based public key distribution, but
what Matthew said is true. 

What about this:

Let the DNS-Server export the address of a machine which runs the
public-key-database for this domain, similar to the MX record for
the mailserver.

If you need the public key for a person identified by the email
address or for a host identified by hostname or IP address, you
could ask the DNS server where to get the public key.

The database host could run any program suitable to local requirements
and export public keys with a certain protocol...
