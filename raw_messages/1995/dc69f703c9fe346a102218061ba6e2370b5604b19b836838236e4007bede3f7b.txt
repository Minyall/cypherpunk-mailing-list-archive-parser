Reality check.

Accountants _know_ how to do books that deal with cash.
Most small business keep their books on a cash basis.
Cash was how the world worked until recently.

Accountants know how to meet acceptable auditing standards when
transactions are in cash. I learned this from the CPA I live
with.

Seems to me this list doesn't have enough folks with a grounding in
non-technical issues. Until the last 30+ years, the world lived
on cash. I like cash. I assume I'll like electronic cash once
people remember what cash is and model it correctly.

Got to to get my beauty sleep before tomorrow's GAK export meeting...
