Sending mail without valid commands to majordomo will give you a help
file.  You don't *really* want the actual list address to be published
everywhere, do you? I think the noise/signal ratio is high enough already.

cypherpunks-request@toad.com would have been better, because it gives a 
more specific help file. URL would have been better still. But not the 
address.
