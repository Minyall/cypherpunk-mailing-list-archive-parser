By the way, I'm really sick of the naming schemes on these laws. Its
only a matter of time before some 1984ish wag creates the "Omnibus
Universal Love and Happiness Act of 1998" providing the death penalty
for possessing trace quantities of marijuana or some such. The
Orwellian names on some of these bills are simply astounding.
