The commonly used method is to generate a random number, then interate up
(or down, it doesn't matter), testing each number in turn for primality.
One doesn't have to test too many numbers to find a prime, as I explained
in my last post.

It is indeed true that the entropy or randomness lies in the selection of
the random number that one starts searching from.
