On the subject of Netscape:
   Now that Netscape is making the Commerce Server available
for free to students, faculty, libraries, etc. (i.e., groups
with limited ability to cough-up $290 to RSA to get the 
1-year digitially-signed certificate needed to make it operate 
in "secure mode"), does anyone know of alternative methods for 
producing such certificates?
