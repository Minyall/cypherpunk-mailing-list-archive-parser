It seems to me that the cure to the scientology situation is to get TROs
claiming that they have your copyrighted material and seize their
computers for your examination and removal, file law suits in each of
the venues against the CoS and each of the individuals (jointly and
severally) in each venue, publishing all information on the servers
containing it via anonymous remailers (from accounts gotten free via
Compuserve, AOL, delphi, etc.  and/or paid for with cash) to mailing
lists all over the world, getting the entire contents placed on-line in
a country that doesn't enforce copyright restrictions and get pointers
to it from all over the web, send massive email to all church members
(the list gleaned from their computers) giving them all the details of
the internal church financial dealings, and on and on.
