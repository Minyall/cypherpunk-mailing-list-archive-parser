Well, not quite.  The "Open Mall" is part of OSF's new advanced technology
offerings.  Free source for non-commercial use, fetchable from the Open
Mall, a Web server.  You'll be able to find the mall (in a week or two)
from OSF's home page, http://www.osf.org/.

The Java ATO includes ports to SVR4 (dunno whose) and HP, and more
importantly, a study of the security aspects and implications of Java:
is it truly a "safe" language to write in?  And what does safe mean, and for
whom (server, client, user, hardware, etc)?  The study will be a paper, also
avail from the mall.

See http://www.osf.org/comm/press/950276-ato.html for mroe details.
