   An article posted on sci.crypt stated that quantum factoring
   is real and that an article was posted in this month's Science
   magazine. The author of the post says this would make factoring
   a 10 bit number the same time as factoring a 100000000 bit number.

You can bet your ass and your mother's and grandmother's donatable
organs that if this were possible, then the legislative initiatives
currently underway would not be: they'd just let us use RSA and get
a false sense of security.

   A wonder how long it is before every major government in the world
   has one of these. Makes RSA's future kind of moot doesn't it??

Well, it would probably "prove" many-worlds right: in which case
we're probably going to be invaded from the one where the Nazis
won WWII, or the libertarians won Shay's Rebellion.
