I understand this exactly, I face my university's restricting account 
security measures and virus paranoia every time I log in.

And I'm all for component ware becoming a reality. It's just that
some of last week's java screaming seemed a bit shrill. What doesn't seem
a "big deal" to me is that the security problems of the past also apply 
to Java. It's not that it's irrelevant, it's that it's obvious. The 
internet worm, as far as I know, was written in C (and some vax asm?).
I'm just saying, "yeah, so what else is new?",  "secure" software has holes.

I'm happy someone's trying to give some thought to language security 
during the design phase (no matter how ineffective, Perry).
