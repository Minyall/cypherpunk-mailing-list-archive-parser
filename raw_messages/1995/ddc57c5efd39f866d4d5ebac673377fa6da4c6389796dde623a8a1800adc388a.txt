This is standard practice with (snailmail) mailing lists. When you buy a
ome-time-use mailing list, there are always names in there to detect resale
or reuse of the list. There are people whose job it is to scan the junk
mail they get and report when they get mail to specifically encoded names
(which would indicate that the mailing list has been reused or merged with
another list without permission).

I see nothing wrong with doing something similar with Phone Books (and I
seem to remember reading that has been done in the past).
