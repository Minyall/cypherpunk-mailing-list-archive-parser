hello all,

while this message has zero cypherpunks content, i'm posting this
information request here because i think there is a good chance that
someone on this list can help me with my question.

a friend of mine who has an mcimail account is having trouble getting
messages to a person in the far east with an address that looks like 
this...

<FLAST+PERMATMS%Perigon@mcimail.com

the 'flast' represents her first initial and last name. 

i've never seen a "%" or "+" in an address before and am wondering
if anyone out there can tell me what they mean, or if they can be resolved 
to a typical net.address. 

thanks for your time.
