Pardon but... why? Whats the reason for wanting to do this?

If a firewall has been set up to stop UDP, then it should stop UDP. If
the firewall has not been set up to stop UDP, or has a mechanism like
the experimental versions of "socks" currently being played with that
relay UDP, then there is no reason to want to do the above. I don't
really understand what the idea is here.
