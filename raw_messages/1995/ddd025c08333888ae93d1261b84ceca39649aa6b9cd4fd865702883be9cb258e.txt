   This is interesting; during the last week or so that I've not been 
current with the list, I've started to implement a data-haven that takes 
information over sockets or MIME e-mail, and requires the use of PGP 
keypairs for the data.  I don't *WANT* to know what data they're 
transferring me.  If digicash would ever reply to one of my applications, 
I could sell it on a digicash/day basis.  Blah.  Neat idea, but the $ 
part is kinda limiting.
