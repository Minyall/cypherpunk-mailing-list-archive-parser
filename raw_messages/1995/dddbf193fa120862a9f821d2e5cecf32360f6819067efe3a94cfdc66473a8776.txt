I posted this query recently with no replies, then again it's not been
"duped" back to my account either, so I'm not sure if it went through.

I've written some fingerprinting code for MD4, MD5, SHA, RIPE-MD and HAVAL
in assembly language for 386 machiens and would like to make it available,
not sure of an ftp-site... pref. ITAR-safe or are those algorithms not
covered under it?
