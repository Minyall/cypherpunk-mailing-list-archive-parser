UNIX?  user hostile?  where have you been lately?  ever hear of X 
windows?  Indigo Magic Desktop?  these and zillions of other innovations 
have made UNIX more user-friendly than any other operating system I have 
used (which includes DOS, Windows, OS/2, and NeXTstep, among others).  
The only real barrier left to UNIX becoming the OS of choice is 
commercial app support (things like word processors and etc. becoming 
readily available and inexpensive).
