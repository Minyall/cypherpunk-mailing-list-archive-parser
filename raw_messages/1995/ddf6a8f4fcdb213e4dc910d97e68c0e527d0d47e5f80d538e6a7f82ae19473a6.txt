Actually, you guys are trying to repeat the whole history of the
law merchant (today's commercial law).  The basic problem was how
can a buyer in one city acquire goods from a seller in another
through agents acting at a distance when neither knows the other
and neither is willing to risk loss on the transaction.

The use of bankers, as either trusted or bonded third parties,
acting as escrowees under the control of a letter of credit was
the result.

Buyer, B, deposits money with the bank, E, with insructions
to release the money on proof of receipt of the goods.  E gives
B a receipt and a written promise to pay.  B trades the promise
to pay to Seller, S, in exchange for the goods.  S, who either
trusts E or has access to his bond, is willing to accept E's
promise to pay, which he then negotiates.  The result is that
B and S have a secure transaction without trusting each other,
and E gets rich.

Notice, we don't care about the reputation or identity of either
B or S, and a very few trusted or bonded Es can facilitate
many many transacrions.

Incidentially, you all are using the word "escrow" correctly.
An escrow is an arrangement in which property is deposited with
an escrowee to hold until the happening or failure of a
contingency, at which time he delivers the property according to
the escrow instructions.  House sales, in which the seller deposits
a deed and the buyer deposits the purchase price pending proof of title
is only one kind of escrow.
