Not at all -- but it's been *my* experience that people who rely on 
titles and degrees and such have very little else to recommend them.

I am as unenvious of Mr. Cohen as I am of Bruce Schneier - and Bruce has a
lot more of my respect.  Just because someone writes a "very innovative
thesis" on viruses doesn't mean they know diddly about anything else,
especially cryptography.  Where is Fred's paper?  I've got Bruce's book on
my shelf that I can read for myself and *that's* a classic in the field. 
When "I can read Fred's paper for myself, then I can judge the merits of
his degree.  Until then, I consider him no different than any other PhD
whose gotten themselves a degree and become convinced that the doctorate
entitles them to pontificate upon any and every subject under the sun as
though they knew absolutely everything about any subject that happens to
catch their fancy. 

Just remember - PhD means 'piled higher and deeper'.
