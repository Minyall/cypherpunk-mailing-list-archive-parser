Thanks for the post.  I think there are a few interesting points, and 
some of the things I do to try to make things more difficult for a 
potential virus.

First, my secring is on a PCMCIA memory card, as is the versions of PGP, 
in this case DOS and Linux.  A virus is unlikely to attack both, and when 
the memory card is in, the network and modem cards are out.

Second, I think PGP is statically linked by default.  If it isn't this 
shoudl be changed - there was recently a CERT alert about telnet services 
being compromised by switching DLLs.  The code can also be cross compiled 
and burned onto a CDROM which would make it difficult to infect.
