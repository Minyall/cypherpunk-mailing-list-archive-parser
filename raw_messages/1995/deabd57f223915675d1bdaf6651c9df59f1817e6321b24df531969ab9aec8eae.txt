According to Christopher Andrew in "KGB: The Inside Story" the Russians 
started to reuse one time pads near the end of the war due to the sheer 
volume of secret information being sent.  This was discovered by Meredith 
Gardener of the ASA in 1948 and later exploited to crack these messages.

The operation goes under the names of Venona and Bride.  The latter is 
used in Peter Wright's book "The Spycatcher's Encyclopedia of Espionage".
