<Yet Another Alarmist TV Show About Child Molesters on the Net:
<snip>
<Anyway, the mainstream media trashing of the Net continues.

And the trashing will continue.  It is the classic scenario.
Feed the media negative press clips about the entity you wish
to discredit (here, the Net), e.g.:
1.  All those pedophiles out to lure your children;
2.  Big coverage on catching some of those pedophiles;
3.  First page coverage on breaking Netscape's code with the
    headlines that your sensitive information such as your
    credit card numbers, etc. can be retrieved (ignoring that
    the reason was to show Netscape's poorly structered code
    would allow this and, therefore, preventing it before it
    could happen);
4.  Expect cryptology to crop up in the Oklahoma bombing trial.
    There already has been articles of those involved having
    allegedly used that *damned* Net to correspond.

Now, the stage is set.  The general public will demand that the
Net (the bastion of perverts and radicals) be controlled,
monitored, and censored - all as a result of a carefully
planned methodology of those specific powers that be.  Having
the general public believe that their children and the national
security are being threatened makes it a much easier task for
*them* to attain their goals.  After all, who wants to be
bothered with proposed legislation when you can have Jane and
John Doe yelling for what may have taken *them* a while to 
attain by "normal" routes?
Never underestimate....
