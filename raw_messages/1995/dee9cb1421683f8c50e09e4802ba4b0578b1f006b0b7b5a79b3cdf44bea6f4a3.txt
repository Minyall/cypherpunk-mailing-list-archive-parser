My favorite numbers game is "fixed".  Choose a number from 1 to 1000.
The least chosen number is the winner, and it pays off 1000:1.  This
least chosen number would have to be published in some non-repudiatable
way, but that's not too hard.  The fun thing is that you get to play with
the minds of all the other players...when would be the first time that
the same number was the winner two days in a row?  Or how many times
with 666 be the winning number?  Or whatever.  Bet all numbers, and it's
a wash.
