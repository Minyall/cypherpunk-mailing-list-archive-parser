	It doesn't appear that these people seem to care about
cash-like anonymous token-based payment schemes. Is that a valid
assesment? What is needed to make these people start caring about
that?
-----------------
	I doubt that anyone from a CC company is going to have much enthusiasm
for anonymous payment methods. One way in which they (and the credit bureaus,
of course) make money is via the information they can gain from credit card
usage.
