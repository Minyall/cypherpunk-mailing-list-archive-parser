If nothing else, Jeff, it will expose those "millions of users, who
have no idea what PGP is" to PGP.  And, hopefully, some of those
"millions of users" might even take the time to grab PGP and take a
look at that, too.

In other words, there is nothing to lose (except a little bit of time
and effort, and a small amount of storage space) and there is a heck
of a lot to gain by including PGP signatures.
