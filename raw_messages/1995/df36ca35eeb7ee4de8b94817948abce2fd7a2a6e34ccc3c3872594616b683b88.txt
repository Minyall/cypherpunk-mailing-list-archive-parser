When the list was discussing "key as final authority" a while back,
Wei Dai posted (on May 31) a program called 'addid' which allows one
to add arbitrary strings as user IDs on other peoples' pgp keys.
These appear just as though PGP had added them itself, and are signable
and displayable by regular old PGP.

As an exercise, I grabbed Hal's "insecure key" from the keyserver,
and used 'addid' to add a new ID to it, which I then signed.

Here's the output of 'pgp -kc 0xcbd301':
Key ring: 'pubring.pgp', looking for user ID "0xcbd301".
