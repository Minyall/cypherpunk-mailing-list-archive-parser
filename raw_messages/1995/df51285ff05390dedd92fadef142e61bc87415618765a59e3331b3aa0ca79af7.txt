Its an article about the cypherpunks, mostly bullshit and hyperbole.  I
especially liked the parts about "Larry Detweiler" and this quote from Jim
Kallston, of the FBI: "We're not trying to stop technology," Kallston said.
"We're trying to collect information on criminals and terrorists and child
pornographers."  What happened to the fourth horseman Jim?
