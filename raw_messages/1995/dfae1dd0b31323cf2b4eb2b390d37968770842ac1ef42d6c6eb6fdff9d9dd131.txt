   In this model the owner of the machine (who is not himself a remailer,
   only a seller of accounts) simply ignores all such issues of
   mailbombs, spams, request for address blocks.

   [the form letter might include]
   "If you have problems, talk to the
   sender, not to me."

In order to make such a discharge anywhere near believable, you'd have
to provide a way for the complainant to get in touch with the sender.
The sender in this case is the remailer operator.  It would also be a
standard courtesy to forward the misdirected mail.

   Currently the
   remailer sites = remailer accounts, so they have little or no
   protection.

One of the services that RiaB might do well to offer is subdomaining.
It's pretty easy to direct all subdomain mail, which includes
postmaster mail, to a single email address.
