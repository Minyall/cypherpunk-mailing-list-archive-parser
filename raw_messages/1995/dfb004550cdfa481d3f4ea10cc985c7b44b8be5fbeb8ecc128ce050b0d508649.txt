Some readers may not know they can use Yarn/UQWK under DOS or OS/2 to
read this list as if it were a newsgroup.  Yarn has Filters which can
be used to move email from various lists to pseudo-newsgroups, and the
threading, References, etc, work nicely.  PGP signing/encryption is a
menu choice. A hook for a MIME processor is provided. Trn filters may
be used to filter the real newsgroups before the mail and news is
packed by into a SOUP packet by UQWK.

There is a Yarn list: yarn-list@lists.colorado.edu
