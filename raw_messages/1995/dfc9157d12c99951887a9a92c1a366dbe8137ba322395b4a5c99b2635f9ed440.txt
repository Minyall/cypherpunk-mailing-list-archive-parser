You are reading more into my writing than I intended. I know
of no other classified court than FISA.

But A. Michael Froomkin noted that my best friend Geoff's slide
said "(e.g. FISA)" and asked, since you used "e.g." what are the
others? Geoff mumbled and rambled. I took it as a no comment.
There were a bunce of lawyers there, including Sobel from EPIC,
Danny W from CDT, etc. Perhaps they know of more than I do,
I'm just a techie.

Deals are, of course, possible. But right now, a clearence means
US Citizen. AFAIK, the only legal discrimination allowed in employement
ads is "US Citizenship required" which is code for "clearence required"

OK, I'll grant you that there arn't many of them. Still, why
you don't address my question: why use it if you have an IQ above
air temperature? You traffic and low visibility ideas have merit,
but why open up to FISA?

You left out the :-)
Actually, you'd have appreciated the November DC-cypherpunks meeting, we
spent a couple hours driving arround, mapping spook facilities.
