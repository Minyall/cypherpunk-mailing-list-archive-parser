Speaking of testing stuff....  

After my last question about C'punks slogans, I've messed up some
stuff and  haven't storage of the list since, therefore I don't have
any of the replies.  If anyone would like to compile a list of what's
been said (if anything) and  mail to to me (to jsled@ctp.org), I'd be
eternally grateful.

Also, if anyone is fluent in procmail (I think there are a couple of
you  floating around), please mail me at jsled@ctp.org...

Thanks a bunch, sorry for the annoyance.
