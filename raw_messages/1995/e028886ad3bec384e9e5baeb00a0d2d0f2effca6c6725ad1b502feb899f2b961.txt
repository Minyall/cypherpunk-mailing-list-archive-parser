OK - I dig this, but brutessl on my Linux box is still complaining about 
usage...(sorry about the bandwidth but I assume other people are probably 
having similar problems)

+ eval brclient -dklLtssl|(read a;nice -20 brutessl - $a)|(read a;echo  
$a 1>&2;
 echo $a) |brclient -AlLtssl
++ brclient -dklLtssl
++ brclient -AlLtssl
++ read a
++ read a
++ nice -20 brutessl -
usage: brutessl [-q] <filename> <checksum> <start segment> <no of 
segments>
       brutessl [-q] -r <filename> [<no of segments>]
       brutessl [-q] -t [<hours>[:<minutes>]]
