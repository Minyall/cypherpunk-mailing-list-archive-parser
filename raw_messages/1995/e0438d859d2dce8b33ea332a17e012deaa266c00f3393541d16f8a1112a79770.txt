I've been playing with the cryptotcp program available from utopia..  It
has some bugs but works pretty well, if you don't mind waiting 20-30
seconds at the beginning.  It does a Diffie-Hellman exchange and 3DES over
telnet.  How hard would it be to add some sort of authentication to this
program?
