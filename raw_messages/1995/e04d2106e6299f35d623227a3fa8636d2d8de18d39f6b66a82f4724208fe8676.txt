I remember that the discrete log problem is quite a bit easier
in GF(2^n), but I don't remember how much easier.   Let me try
to look it up...

A. Odlyzko has a paper recommending that people should not use
GF(2^n) for discrete log applications; in it he states that you
will need at the minimum n > 800, and probably n > 1500.  (And
you also need to choose n carefully.)  A quote from the abstract:

``Hence the fields GF(2^n) out to be avoided in all cryptographic
applications.''

I don't know enough about number theory to judge for myself;
but you can read the (long) paper yourself at

I hope this helps!
