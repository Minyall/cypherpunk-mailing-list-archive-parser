I see that can happen, but there is also:

++ brclient -dklLtssl
++ brclient -AlLtssl
++ read a
++ read a
++ nice -20 brutessl - 2977 d42f 1
usage: brutessl [-q] <filename> <checksum> <start segment> <no of segments>
       brutessl [-q] -r <filename> [<no of segments>]
       brutessl [-q] -t [<hours>[:<minutes>]]
++ echo

Where apparently I did get d42f, but brutessl 1.02 choked - I am going to 
take the advic of the other poster and add the "--" to the command.
Again this is on a Linux box.  I suggest that other Linuxers check their 
logfile for this behaviour.
