The fact that the key is only 80 is *major* compromise.  I would 
recommend that package to no-one.   With only a 80 bit key you dont 
*need* trapdoors, granted they may be more "convienient" but the fact is 
the 80 key *can* [and certainly will] be broken...

Summary: Don't used it.


Btw, this is not an opposition to RSA, RSA is very good - it is an 
opposition to the length of the key...
