I don't think it would be any easier to set up. Harder perhaps, since its
sole purpose is money laundring. However, if there are several Ecash
currencies there is a legitimate need for Ecash currency arbitration. Who
is to stop the following protocol?

US Ecash -> Swedish Ecash
Swedish Ecash -> US Ecash

The resulting coins are no longer traceable unless the repayer cooperates.
The repayer (or in this case currency arbitrator) keeps of course a
percentage at each transaction. No different than a Casa de Cambio. It can
be set up anywhere and even be done anonymously. I am working on an
implementation.
