Two hours into it, and the key numbers that brclient is returning
show about 5% allocated already....  That brings this to closure
in around 24 hours - 12hours for 1/2 the space.

Although - I also just checked the status, and it doesn't seem to be up to
date with the keys I am getting, and it doesn't show any that it
does have under my name as being acked.  This could be just a delay
thing I guess, but it could also be that I just updated brloop
and brclient to the latest versions.

Has anyone else thought of putting Damien's slave code that 
checks for idle tty's, etc into brutessl?
