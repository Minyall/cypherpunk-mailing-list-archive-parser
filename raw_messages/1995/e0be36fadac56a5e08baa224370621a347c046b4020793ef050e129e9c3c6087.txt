Another, and less onerous alternative, is to simply stick encrypted reply-to 
blocks on messages to newsgroups.  At that point there's no real difference 
between the anon post and a post from a system that doesn't provide real 
name<->userid mappings, and the flames can go straight from the newsgroup to 
the instigator without involving the remailer op.
