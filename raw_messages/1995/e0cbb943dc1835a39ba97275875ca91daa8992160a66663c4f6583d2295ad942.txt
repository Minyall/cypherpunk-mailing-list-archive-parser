I take a long term view of security. Basically I don't trust security software 
until it has been released in a stable condition for a few years.

The comments about Credit Card numbers miss the point. The volumes of trade on 
the Internet today are so small that the number of card numbers floating arround 
is insignificant. There are much easier ways to find them than cracking the 
Internet. This will not be the case in a couple of years time where the trade 
volumes are far higher.

Visa and Mastercard will be comming out with a spec which will have very tight 
requirements for implementations.
