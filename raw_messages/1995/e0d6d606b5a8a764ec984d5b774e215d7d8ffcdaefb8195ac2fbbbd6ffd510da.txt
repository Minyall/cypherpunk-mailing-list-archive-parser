With every session of Congress, previously legal acts become illegal. Has
anyone worked out a function of this growth (number of crimes in the books
vs. time)? I am not looking at the numbers of laws passed, but at
individual acts that are defined to be illegal. If this has been studied,
what is the formula? If anyone with access to more appropriate lists could
please give me a pointer/forward the post there, I'd be grateful.

TIA,
