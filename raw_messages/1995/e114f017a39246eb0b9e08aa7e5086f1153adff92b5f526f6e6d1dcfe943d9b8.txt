I've gotten the gate up, but still working a few bugs out. Cypherpunks 
are welcome to use it but if it is abused, I will have to remove general 
access.

Until I can write a script to pull all the newsgroups from the active 
file and place aliases for them in sendmail, the only way to use it is 
via a Newsgroups: header. The address is mail2news@news.wsnet.com.

Let me know any bugs you may find.
