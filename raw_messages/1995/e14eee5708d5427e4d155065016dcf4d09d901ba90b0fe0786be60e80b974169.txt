I just installed the "Open Encryptor" PGP interface for Pegasus  Mail.  I found that when you sign a message and queue it, it stores your password in the clear on the hard drive. Apparently
it doesn't sign or encrypt the message until just before
transmitting it.  So it stores your PGP private key password
with the message until it sends it.
