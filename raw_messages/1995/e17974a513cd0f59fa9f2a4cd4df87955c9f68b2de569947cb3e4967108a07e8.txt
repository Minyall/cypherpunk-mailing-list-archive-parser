It is dangerous that the general reaction is that of
'them being stupid', since that will prevent others
from stepping forward and reveal their own 'holes'.

I decree that 'all holes look stupid once located'.

But 'any non-trivially large program is bound to have
holes' => 'all programmers are stupid' (except me,
because I found the hole?)

Jeff, your and Netscape prompt response to this is
what counts - holes will always be uncovered, it's the
time before they are patched that really matters.
