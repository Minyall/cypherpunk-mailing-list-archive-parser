Yes, it seems I misunderstood you.  There would have to be some binding
between the key of the merchant and some identifying information that
would allow the user to verify the merchant's identity.  This could take
the form of a True Name for the merchant and a trusted CA.  Another
approach would take the form of an FQDN, an IP address and a trusted CA.
In this case the software would have to verify that the FQDN and IP
address match the URL and DNS lookup, respectively.  Unfortunately, this
also requires that any time the IP address changes that the merchant get
a new certificate.  Also, the CA must be checked to verify that the
certificate hasn't been revoked, or you run the risk of an attacker
getting the old IP address.

Does anyone see any other options?
