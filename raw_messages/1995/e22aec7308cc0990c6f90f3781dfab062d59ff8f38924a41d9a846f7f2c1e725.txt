	Unfortunately, in this case, insecure credit cards are not an
	obstacle to banks making money, so why should they care?

At the risk of sounding like Perry, if you think that the major card
issuers "don't care" about cutting (or eliminating) fraud, you're not
talking to the right people.  Fraud eats away a big chunk of revenue
and can quite significantly affect competitiveness in a market with
thin margins.
