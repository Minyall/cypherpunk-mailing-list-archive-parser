What do I have to do if I want to bring cryptographic 
equipment _into_ the USA temporary (for use or demo) and
want to take it back home after some days or weeks. 

Since I am in America then I am under american law. 
The _export_ of my own crypto stuff is not temporary. 

Does the american law allow me (a foreigner!) to take
out any cryptographic material, even if it is my own thing?
