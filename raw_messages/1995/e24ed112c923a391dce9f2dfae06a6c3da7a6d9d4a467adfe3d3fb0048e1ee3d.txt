As a security consultant, I'm very happy about Java because once the
holes are found in it and massive, Morris style worms are launched
with it, I'll be laughing all the way to the bank.

I exagerate only slightly. I don't believe Java to be secure, in spite
of the claims. Its too complicated, and it operates in an environment
who's correct operation is required for it to remain secure. Good
system design says that you want a system's failure mode to produce a
secure result, but thats not what Java does.
