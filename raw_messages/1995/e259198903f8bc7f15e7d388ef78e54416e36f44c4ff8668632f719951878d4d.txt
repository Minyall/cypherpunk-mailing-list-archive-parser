Subject: checkfree/cybercash diff

Hi all,

I studied both websites regarding their wallet system. I noticed a press
release that checkfree will license cybercash technology and develope
products. I saw _no_ release that checkfree has already released a cybercash
wallet compatible SW.

But I cannot find any difference between cybercash wallet and checkfree wallet.
Is it behind the open part of the tech information?

Who can make things clear???


read you later  -  Holger Reif
