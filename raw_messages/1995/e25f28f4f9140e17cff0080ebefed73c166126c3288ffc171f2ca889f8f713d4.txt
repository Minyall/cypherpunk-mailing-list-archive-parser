< Collective holding of signer keys >

There are protocols that allow a group of people to collectively hold a
key. A message is passed down the line, each person in turn operating
on it, and at the end it has been signed. In this way the board of
directors can sign a message without any one person having the key.

These protocols can probably be combined with a secret-sharing system,
so that a message can be signed if a certain percentage of the
key-share holders collaborate. This allows voting, with the object of
the vote getting signed only if >50% vote for it.

Taking a share away from someone is a bit of a problem. If someone
needs to lose his voting privileges, you probably have to generate a
new key and sign it with the old one, then revoke the old one.
