Why worry about dumpster-diving?  Even credit card receipts on carbonless
NCR paper are prey to the hungry eyes of underpaid cashiers or the 
waiter who doesn't think you wrote in a big enough tip. 

A security scheme is no stronger than its weakest link.  Even with the
attack Goldberg and Wagner discovered on Netscape SSL, the weakest link
in credit card transactions lies elsewhere.  I find it curious that
USA TODAY didn't include over-the-counter credit card transactions in
its poll.
