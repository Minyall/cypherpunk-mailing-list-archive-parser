i was able to get to hks.lists.cypherpunks group quite easily using NCSA 
Mosaic.  i set my news server to nntp.hks.net and then told Mosaic to go 
to a URL with this format, 

news:hks.lists.cypherpunks  

surprisingly, this worked quite well.

on another note, i recently checked out the internet credit bureau as 
well and will write about that soon.  very interesting and a little scary 
too.

after removing the brain i simply placed it in a jar on my bench and
connected it to my calculator. it didn't do anything but it looked cool.
