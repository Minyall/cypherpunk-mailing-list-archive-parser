And my "Bryce's Easy PGP" script, whose creation was inspired
by Mr. Hayden's PineSign, does both encryption and
signing, and supports decryption (ugly but usable with Pine).
BAP is an sh script, so it useful with many Unix message
utilities.  I myself use it for all my messages with mh and
trn.


You can buy BAP for 2 US $, payable in Mark Twain Ecash, at my 
WWW site, <a href="http://www.c2.org/~bryce/Niche.html"> 
the Niche </a>, or if you are one of those backwards blokes who 
doesn't have Ecash yet, e-mail me and I'll give you a 
complimentary copy.
