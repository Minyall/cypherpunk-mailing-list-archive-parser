I concur with Steven, but only so long as the piece is more or
less sympathetic.  I think Phil has gotten an amazing amount of
positive press.  In the scheme of things, this may prove to be 
more beneficial for the Cypherpunkish agendas than even his 
creation of PGP.  Phil's image--cryptographer as puppy-dog--will 
help us a lot more than the "evil kiddieporn/terrorist/hacker" 
image the FBI and Diane Feinstein would prefer the public to see.
