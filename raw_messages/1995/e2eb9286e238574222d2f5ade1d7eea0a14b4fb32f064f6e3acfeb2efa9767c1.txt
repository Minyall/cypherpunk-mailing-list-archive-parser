To each their own. There's not enough time in my life to fix all the things
that are wrong, even if I knew what they all were.

My "positive rep," such as it is with certain people, does not depend on
producing flawless documents.

In fact, there are different kinds of people. Some favor "closely reasoned"
arguments (A implies B implies C implies D....), some favor "imaginative
leaps." Where I am depends on my mood.

Oh, but it does. Suppose Alice pays out the same piece of digital cash to
Bob, Charles, Ellen, Dave, etc. Each thinks they've been paid, each gets to
the bank, each finds the bank will not honor the digital cash, as Alice has
double spent.

(Note: Any schemes for "re-blinding" must still allow "uniqueness"...and
must still point back to Alice. Else the scheme/scam above will work.
Online clearing, in which only the _first_ to present a digital cash claim
gets paid, does not have this problem.)

I will this time, but people generally should not expect out-of-band cc:ings.
