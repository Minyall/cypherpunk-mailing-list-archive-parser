What's with the facetious questions? Only an idiot would guarantee a piece
of software to be error free. I am highly confident that there is very
little probability of a raider applet doing significant damage. That's as
much as I can say of any of of any of the systems I use... and its saying
alot given that the thing is executing code it pulls off the net. Is there
still room for cleaner code? Definitely, and I think we'll see some of it
as Java goes Beta and then production.

I think that the high level architecture of Java provides as much security
as such a product can possibly provide. By the time Java becomes widely
distributed (it is still in Alpha3), I expect it to have features that deny
access to any applet not signed by somebody in a list the user creates, a
sort of web of trust. On top of this layer, Java already offers rudimentary
firewalls. The combination of these layers should be quite effective.

Of course, Netscape will probably find a way to screw their implementation
up :)
