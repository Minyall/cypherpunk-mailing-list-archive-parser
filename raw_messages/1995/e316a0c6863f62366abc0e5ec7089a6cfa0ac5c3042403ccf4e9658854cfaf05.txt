Dear cpunks,

after reading several articles about government sting operations in the US
and Bavaria, I'm thinking of starting a not for profit to collect and
diseminate information on law enforcement on the net. I know how to register
a NFP Corp, and certainly know about mailing lists and web pages, but other
problems still remain to be solved. Specifically:

1) Is it better to be a national or state registered NFP? (Given the level
of LEA hassling I might experience.)

2) What if I start a mailing list and nobody shows up? Whose participation
should I ensure so that the effort is a success.

3) What are some good sources of information for LEA's on the net?

Any suggestions would be most welcome.
