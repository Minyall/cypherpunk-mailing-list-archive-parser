Could you clarify the export restriction on "plug and play" encryption ready
products?  I am about to embark on a project that I want to be distributed
freely that would be designed around a generic encryption intereface that I
would wrap around a real encryption core such as PGP,etc.  I wanted to include a
BS encryption in the freely distributable package to prevent export woes.  The
project is in design stages now and I don't need this additional headache.
