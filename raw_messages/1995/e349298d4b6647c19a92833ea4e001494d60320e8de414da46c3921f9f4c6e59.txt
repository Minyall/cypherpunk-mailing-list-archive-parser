Erm, nope.  The "First World" (or old world) was Europe and Asia; the "New 
World" (not frequently referrred to as the second world, but hey...)  The 
third world was the developing nations.  THAT (as far as I was taught in 
history class, so it MIGHT be a lie...) was how the terms originated...
