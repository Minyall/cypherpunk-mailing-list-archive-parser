Lets say, Mr. Weinstein, that you shove some code onto the stack along
with the return address, and the address happens to be the code.

If you don't believe it can be done, its easy enough to demonstrate it
on your machines, which I believe suffer from the syslog(3) bug, which
your company hasn't patched so far as I know, and which afflicts the
Sendmail daemons you ship with your machines. See the recent 8lgm bug
report if you want details.

Its usually true on modern machines -- its very difficult to rig
things otherwise given the way that lots of the dynamic loading works
these days.
