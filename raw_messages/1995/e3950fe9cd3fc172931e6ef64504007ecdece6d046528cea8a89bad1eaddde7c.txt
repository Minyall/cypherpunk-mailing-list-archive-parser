For legal purposes, perhaps, set up shop on the Islands.

Then have a site somewhere else -- backup of your corporate system, 
nothing more.  And, of course, a net connection -- all for redundancy's sake.

If your Euro/American site is merely a mirror of a legal site in another

Hmmmm... this all still needs work...
