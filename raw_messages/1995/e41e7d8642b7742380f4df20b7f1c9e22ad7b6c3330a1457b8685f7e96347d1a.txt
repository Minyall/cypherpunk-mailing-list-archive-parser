Blinding and unblinding is just multiplication and division in
modular arithmetic, right?  So it oughta be transitive, right?
I actually don't know, and I am eager to find out.

You mean he can now deposit the note with the bank for credit?  
Although he won't actually deposit it until later, some random 
amount of time after this transaction is finished.
  He *could* give the note to Charles, who would deposit it, but
Charles would not be able to protect his own identity when
accepting it.  Bob might as well just turn it in to the bank.

It sounds good to me.  Bob will check the note for the bank's sig
after he has unblinded it.  Thus he knows that Alice didn't cheat
him.


Can a more astute mathematician than myself evaluate this scheme for
us?
