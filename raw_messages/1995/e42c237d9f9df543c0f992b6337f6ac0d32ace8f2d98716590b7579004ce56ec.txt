I suddenly got very cold.

I thinnk the world has seen enough of 'revolutionary justice',
both in the Soviet Union; there are some fascinating passages
of Lenin about avoiding the bourgouise invented 'justice' concept, 
and that the revolution was well 'above' that whole thing,

and im Germany.

And I guess in current China.

When the people and the govering establishement has lost contact
this much, you're in for trouble.

(Ok, remember I'm a dumb Swede, that still happens to believe that
State and People doesn't have to be enemies. And I do believe in a
sensible dialog between different interest groups etc etc. Flame
away, I'm just dumb anyway. ;-))
