Oh, come on, Perry - your memory must be decaying.
I've met Jude 3-4 times in the last 1.5 years, including at
Bay Area cypherpunks meetings (the long boring photo-shoot for
the NY Times Magazine, for instance), and it's been referred to
in the past that "cypherpunks" was her pun.  She's also the one
who put out requests for character contributions to a novel
she's doing, which went to the list.  Besides, if you're grumpy that
you haven't met someone, you need to get out here to the left coast
more often - New York winters must be getting to you :-)
