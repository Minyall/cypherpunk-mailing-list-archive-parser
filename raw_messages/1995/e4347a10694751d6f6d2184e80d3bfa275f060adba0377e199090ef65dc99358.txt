Here in SWB territory there are residential and business rates for ISDN.

Be shure to multiply these costs by 2 since a singe 56k is approx. half of
2 B's that have been bonded. I specificaly looked for a provider who didn't
charge according to how many machines I have on the other end. I am buying
the ability to send a certain amount of bits over a wire in a certain amount
of time. Whether those bits come from 1 or 100 machines is irrelevant.

I would have no problem w/ interNIC chargeing for registering IP's (which I
hear may happen sooner than we realize) since I got a full 'C' when I set up.
We already use 23 of the addresses and will be looking at adding at least a
couple of more in the near future.

In the case of the CombiNet 160 the choice of 'idle-out' or 'tear-down' is
one of software. The codec is programmed via a serial line (which the dox say
can be hooked to a modem, as if anyone was that stupid) port and has its own 
little menu system. I keep both my B's running all the time.

Take care.
