While Dr. Fred may have a (diminishing) few defenders left on this list, I
have found that <Plonk!>ing him was useful, at least until his latest
series of trolls stirred up the unaware.

I agree with the people who say that if he's ignored, he'll go away. After
all, it has worked before, yes?

Prove to me it won't work. ;-).

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
