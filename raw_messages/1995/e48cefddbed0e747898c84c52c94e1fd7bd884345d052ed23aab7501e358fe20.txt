A slight correction: SCO shipped the C2 version of their Open
Desktop 1.1 as the standard (in fact, only) version a few years
back.  The howls of outrage from their customer base (due to the
non-standard-Unix behavior) caused them to back off in the next
major release.  Last time I tried to install their software, C2
had been made an option.  (Of course, AFAIK, they never actually
completed a C2 evaluation.)
