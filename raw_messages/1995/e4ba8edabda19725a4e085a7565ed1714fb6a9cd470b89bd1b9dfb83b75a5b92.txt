Two of the Java attacks I outlined in this forum and got abuse for.

> While HotJava prevents applets from actively opening connections that
> violate the user-selected security policy, it allows an applet to accept
> connections from anywhere.  At this point, an applet only has to use any one

> do the active open.
> 
> HotJava also allows an applet to set the proxy servers that the browser

> their web surfing.

Attacks 31-49 work here.

> Please note that these bugs are specific to the 1.0 alpha 3 release, and are
> _not_ bugs in the Java language itself, nor do they apply to Netscape 2.0
> beta 1J, which doesn't permit network connections.  We have notified Sun of
> these problems, and are presently writing a paper on these and other issues.
> We will make more information available on our Web page after we hear back

Drat - Sun doesn't offer awards.
