Thank you for posting that.  I've been increasingly frustrated with people
who assume that they have some need for a one-to-one 
'nym<->Real-Life-human-body mapping.  I would have been posting on this
topic myself, but I am busy.


Thanks again, and I hope you go ahead and start PGP-clearsigning your posts
so that my high opinion of you can become more firmly fixed.


:-)


Regards,

Bryce
