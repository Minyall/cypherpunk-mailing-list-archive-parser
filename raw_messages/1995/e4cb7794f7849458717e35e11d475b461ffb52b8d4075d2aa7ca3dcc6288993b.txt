Six years ago, you could walk into a Bank, show them your driver license,
and open an  account.
Today, you need several pieces of ID.
Three years ago, you could withdraw money from your own account without
having  your checkbook on you.
Today, they make you pay for a "counter check".
One year ago, you could walk into a bank an cash a check drawn onto an
account at the very same bank.
Today (Coast Federal), they make you pay a $10 check cashing fee.

The US banking industry has gone to the dogs. The day a non-US bank offers
an account that can be accessed over the net will be the day I close my US
accounts.
