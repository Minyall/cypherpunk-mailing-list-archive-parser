Precisely.
Again, if the judge issues the warrant, the damage is done, exclusion is 
pointless.  The concept that police should be expected to know the law is 
apparently, silly.  I suppose you don't want police "second guessing" 
judges, but personally I wouldn't mind the implications.

The review process allows the warrant to be overturned and the evidence 
excluded if the issuing judge's basis for signing the warrant is "clearly 
erronious"  (from memory.)  Where there is good faith involved by all the 
parties however....
