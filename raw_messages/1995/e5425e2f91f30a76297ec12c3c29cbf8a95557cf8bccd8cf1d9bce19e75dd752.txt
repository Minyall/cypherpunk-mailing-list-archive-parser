	Note that this uses SSL and that messages are encrypted using
premail -- the entire remailing chain is not in the clear
anymore. This is still a single point of failure system, but secure
against attacks which do not involve the compromise of c2.org. (Unlike
the non-encrypting one on http://www.c2.org/remail/by-www.html)
