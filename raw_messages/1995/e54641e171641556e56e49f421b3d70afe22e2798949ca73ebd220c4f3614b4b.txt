For those interested in reading up on the IPSEC work, check out
ds.internic.net's "internet-drafts" directory. The following are the
drafts that you will want to look at.

draft-ietf-ipsec-ah-md5-03.txt
draft-ietf-ipsec-arch-02.txt
draft-ietf-ipsec-auth-02.txt
draft-ietf-ipsec-esp-01.txt
draft-ietf-ipsec-esp-des-cbc-04.txt
draft-ietf-ipsec-photuris-02.txt

I believe that the -ah-xx.txt draft is missing.
