I think it is time this kind of software is outlawed! I mean, it is a 
criminal instrument, and the only good it does is to embarrase good
old well-meaning companies trying to make a profit. Besides, the 
customers should know better than to buy stuff over the net! And Netscape
said AS IS all the time, didn't they?

(Just joking! :-))

But seriously, I wonder how long it will take before bruteXXX programs 
will be classified as "criminal instruments"? As well as real good 
random generators, I guess? (I don't think they will outlaw the XOR
op, so to get rid of one-time-pads they have to go for the random gen...)
