   The Economist of Oct 7-13 grins at Net banks and smirks at
   their telecomms bedding wetting betting, titters at the
   "French hacker's" 120-comp hoist of Netscape and the
   Russky's heist of Citibank, and knee-slaps at the
   "slanging" match of hateful yoked-oxen Visa and MasterCard
   dragging long ropes of intertwined shit.
