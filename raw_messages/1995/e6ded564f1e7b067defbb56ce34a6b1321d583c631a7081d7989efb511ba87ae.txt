Subject: Internet Police

According to an AP story, Wisconsin Attorney General James Doyle says that
police must monitor the Internet to stop child porn, drug trafficking, and
fraud.

"We need to see that police are surfing the Internet just as other people
are," Doyle said. "This is a good example of where the law is slower than
technology."

Doyle made his comments in a speech to the Wisconsin Chiefs of Police
Association Conference.
