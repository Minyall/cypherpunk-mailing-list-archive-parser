I am not familiar with those models, but if they work like a regular AMI
bios, try hitting ctrl-alt-delete at the password prompt.  On many
passworded bios it will get you right past it.  That will at least give you
enough info to see if there is anything worth saving.  (I have no problem
giving out that trick since I have found most bios passwords pretty useless
unless used against the most clueless of users.)
