  Place: Sparcy's cafeteria, building 21, Sun Microsystems
               Mountain View, California

  Directions: Take 101 to Amphitheater Parkway.  Turn left
               onto Garcia, and drive about 1/2 mile and turn
               onto the first genuine side street which is
               named Marina Way.   Drive about 1/4 mile and look
               for a right hand turn onto Coast.   Building 21
               will be on your left.  It's on the corner of Coast
               and Marina Way.   There's plenty of parking there.
