   What is it precisely that you might want to encapsulate that MIME
   can't encapsulate?

Perry, you're missing the whole point, just like the exchange a few
days about a remailer format standard.

MIME is primarily a packaging standard.  MIME does not define the
innards, the payload, the contents.  MIME is only a start at what the
complete data format should look like.  You say MIME, and you've not
completely specified the data format, but rather constrained it in a
way that most everybody basically agrees with, including me.
