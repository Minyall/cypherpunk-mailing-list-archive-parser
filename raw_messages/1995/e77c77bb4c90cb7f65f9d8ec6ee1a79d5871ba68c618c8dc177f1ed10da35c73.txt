The certificate would identify the entity you're having commerce with.  It
doesn't have to have a name, the certificate would replace the need for a
name.  If you wanted a name, you could use the certificate to access it.
The certificate would give you a public key that would be the central
identifier.  Associated with it might be many attributes of the key-entity.
You might use the key to find out a name, and bank account number, or
an ip-address to use to communicate with.  Don't think of it as being a
name, "Egghead Software", and this is the key associated with it.  Think
of the key as the central thing.
