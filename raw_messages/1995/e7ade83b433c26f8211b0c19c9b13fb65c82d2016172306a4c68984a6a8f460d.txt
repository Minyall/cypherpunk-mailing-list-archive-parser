  I agree with a lot of what you say Jeff. What I would do is set the string
limits to be whatever the specs allow. For instance, in the case of
domain names, the limit is supposed to be 256. In a mailto: just what
is the limit of an RFC822 valid e-mail address? 

  I will say that Netscape is a very robust program. I have created documents
with 10,000 nested <UL> lists, and the program didn't dump. I have
created forms with 10,000 selection widgets with overlong labels and variable
names and it handled them (didn't diusplay them very well) However, I am
a little weary of netscape allowing lists and forms having 10,000
levels. For one thing, although the 10,000 nested lists didn't crash
netscape, they did use up all the swap space on my computer except for
300k. A 10K byte document was able to exhaust 32megs of ram.

  When I combined supernested lists, with overlong FORM variable names,
and an extra long title, I did get a few sporadic coredumps. Some people
may have a religious position on browsers limiting SGML/HTML nested
structures (because they feel the browser should be able to handle any
"legal" document), but I for one am more pragmatic. 

  I hope you don't take my criticisms as an attack on your programmers.
Netscape is my all around favorite application. I just want to see it
improved and safer.
