Random time won't save you - it just increases the noise, thus reducing
the effective bandwidth of the covert channel.  To get the time, I only
need to do enough repetitions of the same computation to eliminate the
effect of the randomness and I have the same resulting information about
the key.

The only way to completely remove covert channels is by making the
measurable time completely independent of the actual time.

One way with the RSA might be to do the encryption with the key and the
inverse of the key (hence all 0s become 1s and 1s become 0s).
