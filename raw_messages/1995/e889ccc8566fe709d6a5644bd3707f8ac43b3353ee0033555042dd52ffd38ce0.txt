  Just a clarification of my last message.  I didn't mean to imply that
we didn't know about using time/position from mouse events, RFC 1750,
reading from the microphone.  I knew all about this stuff, but made
the fatal mistake of assuming that what we shipped in 1.1 was
"good enough", and that I could look at it later, after I had dealt
with a bunch of other stuff that needed to be done.

  So far I've received several very thoughtful replies, with lots of good
suggestions, most of which I already knew about, but some new ones too.

  Thanks to those who have responded already, and also to those who
will respond.  I'm sorry, but I can't guarantee an individual response...
