     The random number seed generation code is now available for review:
     ftp://ftp1.netscape.com/pub/review/RNGsrc.tar.Z
     
     My platform is DOS 6.22, Windows 3.11
     
     Can someone suggest a program (and where to get it) that will run on 
     my platform and extract the tar.z files into DOS ASCII files so that I 
     can review the key generator code?
     
     Thanks for your help.
