Well it took me 30 minutes to find my first repeatable 'core' dumping
bug in the v2.0beta when I started playing with it this morning.
How stable is that?  Mind you, the bug appears to be probably due to a 
missed variable assignment.
 
I have an idea about where to look for more bugs but I'll 
probably wait some time before I start looking in earnest, I suppose the 
challenge is to look for bugs in the final release version :-).
