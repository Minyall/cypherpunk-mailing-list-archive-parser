     I know of two companies which are developing products incorporating
cryptography. At both, the original plan was to distribute only a weak
exportable version. Marketing & distribution didn't want to deal the hassle
of stocking different versions, and worried that the export version would
be seen as inadequate.

    Since the bruting of export SSL by the cypherpunk's key-cracking
ring, this policy has changed. It is now clear that the exportable 
version can be cracked, and probably will be cracked, with all the bad 
PR that entails. Both companies now plan to release export and
domestic versions.  (Some overseas sales are better than none, and 
not everyone needs or uses the cryptographic capabilities).

     Speaking only for myself,
