My "Bryce's Auto-PGP" fits the bill.  It is an sh script so it can be
integrated without too much trouble into Pine, Elm, trn, tin, mh, etc etc.  
I have personally tested it with Pine so I know it'll work.  You can e-mail
me for a beta copy, or you can ask for a v1.0 copy if you don't mind waiting
an unspecified amount of time for beta-testing to finish.


Regards,

Bryce
