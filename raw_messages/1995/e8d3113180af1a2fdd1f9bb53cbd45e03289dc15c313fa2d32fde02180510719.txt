Hello?!@# Guess no one is home. Lets see do I look like I work at Netscape?
Nope. Iam just repeating what I heard them told you for days now.
And my guess is no. They PR department is just a channel to get answers.

Do the White House PR department define policy? I hope not! But they are 
the ones what give the conferences and answer questions. Man, some people
have a tick skull.
