	"should" is very different from what is.
	Hell, -no- change "should" be necessary. Reporters "should" be
aware of the issues and write good articles. But they don't. Some "Do
not redistribute w/o permission" isn't going to stop a reporter from
printing an article about your post, if they think it will get them
the front page and a raise.
