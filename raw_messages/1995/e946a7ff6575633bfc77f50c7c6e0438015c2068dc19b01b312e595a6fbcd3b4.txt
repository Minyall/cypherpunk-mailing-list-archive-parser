It's been far too long since I cleaned up the namespace clutter on
alpha.c2.org.  So I have deleted all reply blocks which point to
remailer@jpunix.com, remailer@tower.techwood.org, usura@replay.com,
myriad, wmono, desert, nately, and all the other dead remailers I could
think of.  I did this with a grep/awk script, so I hope it didn't maul
any valid addresses.  There are probably still a lot more dead addresses,
but hopefully this cleans up the namespace somewhat.
