Internet email is highly dynamic.  Hosts can be up/down.  Routers can
be up/down.  Gateways can be up/down.  Routing databases can be out of
date.  Cables can be cut.  Load averages can affect whether a host accepts
SMTP connections.  And so on.

Sending one message and rigorously studying timestamps in the Received
lines and using that to draw conclusions about mail propagation is a
complete waste of time.
