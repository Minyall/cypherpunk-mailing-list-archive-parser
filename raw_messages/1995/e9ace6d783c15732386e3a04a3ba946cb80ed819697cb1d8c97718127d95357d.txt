Dang, I was just working on my "death to netscape" page before 
I started reading my mail.  I had done the text, and was going
to start stripping background out of the dirty pictures, so that
my server would not drop to its knees.  The text is visible when
viewed in netscape, but the pictures are not.

Should have done the fun part first.

Let us know when the position is put on the web.
