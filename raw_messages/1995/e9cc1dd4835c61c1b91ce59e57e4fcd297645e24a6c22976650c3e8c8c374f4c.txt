The book "Temporary Autonomous Zone" is available online at wiretap.spies.com
The most recent issue of Mondo 2000 talks about the CD with Hakim Bey and
the producer.

I also saw another e-book site that had some more of his stuff, can't 
remember what it was though.
Of course, one could always just buy them on paper (remember that?)
