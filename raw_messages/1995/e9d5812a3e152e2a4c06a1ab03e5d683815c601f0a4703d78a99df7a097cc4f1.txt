I don't know myself.  That's why I still occasionally think about it.  It  
is sometimes comforting to think there is a US agency with the expertise  
of the NSA.  At other times I wonder if we're getting the most for our tax  
money.  Unfortunately, it would be impossible to generate a meaningful  
cost/benefit analysis even if the NSA was not a secret agency.

Of course, if we did not pax taxes there would be no need to wonder if  
we're getting our money's worth.  A self-funded,for-profit NSA?  Now  
there's a liberatarian idea if I ever heard one.
