I just *love* hearing statments like this from people who have probably
never started their own businesses.

Corporations are no more or less than their component people.  If the people
running a corporation care about an issue, the corporation will act upon
it  -- bounded by the interaction of their survival instinct with their
assessment of reality.  How could it be otherwise? 

The literature out there abounds with counterexamples to the "corporations
are automata" idea (for some reason, they love to harp on Ben & Jerry's).
