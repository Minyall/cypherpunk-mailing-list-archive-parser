Doling out keyspace _does_ require central coordination, though
the job can be delegated to _trusted_ volunteers, or delegated
with redundancy to semi-trusted ones.

As far as safe viruses go, I've had more free lunches than safe viruses,
though I've been offered both out of "charity".  Some of the lunches
were good, and charitable; the viruses have been, at best, mostly harmless.
Perhaps under Safe-Tele-Java-Script it will be possible to send
self-modifying self-reproducing scripts around a network to unsuspecting
machines, but I doubt it.

Yeah.  In this case, the lifetime of the versions was less than the
expected lifetime of some of the searches.  Automated version-checking would
help, but the version changes made it difficult to communicate even simple
requests like "Give me a number".  Perhaps it would make sense for version
upgrading to include changing the server's TCP port so the old versions
don't hose the servers for the new versions.

Randomness doesn't help much, since it's hard to be sure you
sweep the whole keyspace.  Redundancy does help, but it's still tough
to protect against sufficiently malicious attackers.

You could do that.  But simply asking for more numbers after you've
finished the previous batch accomplishes much the same thing;
special tuning may be more useful for folks with MasPars than 486s,
where redundantly giving out unacked search space can do more.
