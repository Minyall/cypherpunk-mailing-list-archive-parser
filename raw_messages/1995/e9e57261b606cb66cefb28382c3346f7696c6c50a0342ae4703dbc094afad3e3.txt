Yep, it's optional. You can specify the account id of the recipient, in 
which case it's encrypted into the ecash message somehow, or you can 
leave it blank, in which case anyone can deposit it in their account. Or 
at least that's what the DigiCash people told me.

I think it only works that way if you select email payment, when it gives 
you a box for the account id to pay to.
