Yes, they are far too cheap to hire, they would go off somewhere and smochze the 
info outa folks.

If they ever want an anonymous proxy server they are wellcome to use ours.

Seriously folks I'm very pissed about the abuse of log file information. The 
Whitehouse restrict browsing privilleges to a chosen few. The attempt to make a 
big deal out of it could have cost someone their job (it didn't in this case).

If we are serious about privacy I think we should be very clear that we respect 
the privacy of Whitehouse staffer and staffers in the Senate and House. I'm not 
being partisan about this, I have put a lot of effort into getting participation 
from the right as well as the left. I've just not been very successful in that 
area.
