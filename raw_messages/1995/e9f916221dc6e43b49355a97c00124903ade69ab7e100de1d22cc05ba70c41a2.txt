I agree strongly with Tim May that this (fun) little joke has gone far
enough.  I enjoyed it while it lasted, but the CJR was clearly frivolous,
the T-Shirt was clearly not a munition, IMHO, and that's that.  Write up
the experience, post it on the web somewhere (I'll provide a space if you
need it), and call it a day.
