     Since you're sure to get a number of long responses to this
question, I'll keep mine short.

     I don't want to give anyone my keys.  I do not harm anyone by
refusing to do so.  Therefore, anyone using force to take my keys is
acting immorally.*

     No.  I don't choose to give Louis Freeh my keys.  I don't choose
to give Brian Davis my keys.  I don't choose to give Tim May my keys.
Any use of force to compel me to yield my keys is unacceptable.
