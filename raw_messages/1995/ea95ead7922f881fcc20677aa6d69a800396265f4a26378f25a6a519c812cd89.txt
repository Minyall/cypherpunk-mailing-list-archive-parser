The ACLU (aslong with us and numerous other groups) are all very aware of 
S. 314. I briefed the Telecommunications policy Roundtable, which is over 
100 public interest groups interested in telecom policy, about it last 
week and we are all gearing up to nail this sucker to the wall before it 
is included in  the telecom bill. If you havent called and screamed at 
your senator and congresscritter, do so now already (202) 224-3121.
