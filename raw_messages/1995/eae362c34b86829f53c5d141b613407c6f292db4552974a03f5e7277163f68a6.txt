hal pointed out to me that

	pgp -F

will do exactly what i want.  it will work.  the behavior of pgp -F (given
keys, for instance) is not well-described in the docs, but it will do what i
want it to.

as hal said, i can catch the stdout for the data, and catch the stderr for
out-of-band info about the data, and this will work fine.

and the product of all this is going to be quite cool.  i'll post it when
it's finished.
