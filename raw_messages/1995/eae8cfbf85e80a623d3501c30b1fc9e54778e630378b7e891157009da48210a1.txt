Just a nomenclature peeve - I'm not sure of the precise time and 
place the (first|second|third) world meme originated, but it seems to
predate 1970, and until very recently it's meaning was clear:

First world: Western (and Westernized) nations - mainly the US, Canada, Western Europe, 
Japan, Australia, & New Zealand

Second world: Communist bloc (I can still remember the Cultural 
Revolution. Prior to that, the Communists seemed a monolithic force, 
marching in lockstep.)

Third world: The rest, mostly poor nations. 

Back then, the world was a simpler place.
