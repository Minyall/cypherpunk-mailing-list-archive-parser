As the Tired, Poor, Project gets it's next machines ready for their
next recipients, I will be able to finally upgrade to a 386, and pass
this 8088, to the next recipient down the line. (yeah!)
<blink>I would volunteer to be your pre-alpha tester</blink>.
I know that if I could run it anybody could be taught to run it. For I
would always be grateful in learning how it was done in the first place,
and will always help those farther down the line than me.
