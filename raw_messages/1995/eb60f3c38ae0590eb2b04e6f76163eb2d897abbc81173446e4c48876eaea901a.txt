	A daemon per user, or per machine?  Either way, I think you
run into problems on a big multi-user machine.  (Either its an extra
process or two per person, or its a great target for attack &
subversion.

	Its an interesting proposal, but let me ask you this--Why is
it better than a libpgp (or pgp.dll) that offers a variety of services
to programs at multiple levels (ie, offers full one call RSA/IDEA
encryption and compression, as well as ascii armoring, or offers each
of those as a seperate function.
