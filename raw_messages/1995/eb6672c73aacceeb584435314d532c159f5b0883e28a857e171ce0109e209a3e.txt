C'punks,

Eric Hughes and I are calling dibs for the FEBRUARY Cypherpunks
meeting.  On February 10, we will host the meeting at our offices
in downtown San Francisco (easily accessible by BART and Muni).
More details later.

After the meeting, I will be hosting a gala costume party in the
large, elegant Oakland house owned by two of my co-hosts.  I will 
soon be setting up an invitation on a web page provided another
co-host, C'punk hero-of-the-revolution, Sameer.  Stay tuned.
