On Sunday's Point-Counterpoint on CNN, Sen. Richard Lugar who is pushing 
a Federal commission on gambling mentioned gambling on the Internet half 
a dozen times.  His motive seemed to be to give the Feds an excuse for 
getting involved in gambling control.  He also mentioned Federal 
regulation of Indian reservations in this context.  What he wants to do 
is discourage state promotion of gambling.

Net Gambling is really on the table.
