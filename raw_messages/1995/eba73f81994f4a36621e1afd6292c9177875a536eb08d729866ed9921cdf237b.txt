Thank you for your useful survey.  May I make two comments about 
the US section?  First, many lawyers believe the ITAR to be 
unconstitutional as applied to some or all cryptographic 
algorithims and software; a court test is likely within the next 
few years.   Second, the American Bar Association Section on 
Science and Technology's Information Security Committee is 
drafting Guidelines and Model Legislation which, if they are 
ever completed, will improve upon the Utah initiative.  
Meanwhile, other states, including California, are considering 
bills that are similar to Utah's.
