	Not really related to the deadbeat dads thing, but we
got a notice that the US DOT has mandated that all air passengers
must present a gov't issue photo ID with a name that matches that
on your ticket.  In addition it says that passengers should:

	* be prepared to answer questions about their bags.
	* be prepared to open the trunk of their car.

	Goodbye freedom, hello police state.
