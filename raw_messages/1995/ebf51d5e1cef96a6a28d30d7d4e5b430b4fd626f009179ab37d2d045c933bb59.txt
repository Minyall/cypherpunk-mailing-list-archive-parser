Sorry, it's Modern Cryptology: A tutorial, 1988.
You'll find good info in <http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/labs/theorique>
(the titles are in french, but don't worry, the text in the "cryptographie
quantique" section is in english and has plenty of links to papers. Also
weird stuff like quantum teleportation. You'll also see Brassard and 
Crepeau's home pages.)

If you run into the listing for the Discover article, please pass it on,
I keep putting that one off.
