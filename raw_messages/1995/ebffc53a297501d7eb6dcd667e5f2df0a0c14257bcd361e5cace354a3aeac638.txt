        "Case Could End Anonymity of Computer Network Users"
               by Brian Bergstein (Associated Press)

Anonymity and freedom of speech in cyberspace are being challenged
by a Caribbean resort owner in a court case that could dramatically
restrict the rights of computer network users.

The resort owner and scuba instructor claim that they were defamed
on a computer bulletin board by an anonymous user, and they asked a
judge this week to force America Online to reveal the name of the
subscriber so they can sue the person for libel.

If Arnold Bowker and John Joslin are successful in obtaining the
name, it could have serious implications for millions of people who
use the Internet to think, write and debate in a world where they
are identified by their ideas, not their names.

Technology experts fear a morass of court cases that would hold
computer users accountable for what they say anonymously.

"What this case brings up is the specter of millions of libel suits
every time there's a disagreement on the Internet," said Daniel
Weitzner of the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington.
"I think it's a critical issue."

Several calls seeking comment from officials at America Online were
not immediately returned Friday.

Abraham Haddad, chairman of the computer science department at
Northwestern University, said the anonymity of cyberspace should be
maintained as long as it was not being used to commit a crime.

"There's really a need to protect people's privacy as long as no
laws have been broken," Haddad said.
