A detail I missed before: the remailers used in pseudonym reply blocks must
somehow deliver replies to the True Name (verinymous ?) address of the holder
of the pseudonym. I suppose they could all finally be routed to the 
pseudonymizer, which would deliver the messages directly to the intended 
recipient (holder of the pseudonym).
