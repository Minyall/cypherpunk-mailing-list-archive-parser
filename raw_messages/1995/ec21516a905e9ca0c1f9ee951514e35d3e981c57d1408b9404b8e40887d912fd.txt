The Administration policy for 40-bit-key encryption will continue

bi-lateral agreements with friendly nations.  In a presentation, Bob
Holleyman of the Business Software Alliance criticized the
Administration's failure to "liberalize export controls on generally
available software employing non-key escrow encryption."  Also, he

implemented in anything like their current form, will prevent key
escrow encryption from ever being commercially adopted."  Mr.
Holleyman recommended a number of features for a marketable system,
including a variety of encryption algorithms using at least 64-bit
keys and user specification of a key holder.
