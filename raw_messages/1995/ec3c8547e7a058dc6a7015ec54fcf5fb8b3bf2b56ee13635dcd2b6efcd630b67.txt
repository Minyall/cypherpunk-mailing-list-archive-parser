The description you give us is meaningless. The strengh of an encryption
alogirithm must depend only on the algorithim and key used, not on the
data (in your case graphics) being encrypted. It is utterly irrelevant
_what_ is being encrypted, all that matters is _how_ it is being
encrypted. Send us the algorithm and source code and we'll take a look at
it.

And by the way, "proprietary" algorithms are generally junk and should not
be relied upon by security concious individuals and businesses. Only
algorithms that have undergone extensive peer review should be considered
for use.
