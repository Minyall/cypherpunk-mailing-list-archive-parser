This is a notification of the first creation of a few pages describing
Canadian Export Controls. Any one who has read the printed document
[Canada's Export Controls] will realise that it's almot word-for-word,
but there's some use for that.

In any case, they currently live at
	http://www.io.org/~samwise/crypto/
It may be that they'll move, but
	http://www.io.org/~samwise/interesting.html#privacy
should always have a pointer to them.

The pages were written this evening. Tomorrow morning I'll look at them,
scream, wonder what I was thinking, and rewrite them. This is so that
there'll be a few more screams. :)
