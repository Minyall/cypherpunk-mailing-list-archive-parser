Hm. Can we maybe head off the Ideology War before it becomes unstoppable?
Cypherpunks write code, and do lots of other stuff too, but I'm hoping that
endless political wars is something cypherpunks don't do, or at least try
not to do on the cypherpunks list.

[It's possible that the ideology of the list is as homogenously
anarcho-capitalist as it seems, but I'd bet there's enough anarcho-others
to sustain several never-ending political 'discussions' of the sort that
will make the list even less useful then when we spent dozens of messages a
day talking about logos.]
