True enough, but there are sometimes rough consenses on technical questions,
and if it were clear enough that these were collective in nature and not to
be ascribed to any particular person, e.g.:

 for commercial applications, and that Netscape seems to have taken less
 than due care to choose an appropriate random seed for its session keys."
