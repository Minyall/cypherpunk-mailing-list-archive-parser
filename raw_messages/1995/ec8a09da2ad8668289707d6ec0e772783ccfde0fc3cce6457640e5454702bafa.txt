I have a good friend who writes for the Times.  Last time I spoke to
him, he was frantically trying to get in touch with the Business editor
because a piece he'd just written had been hacked to bits, with several
inaccuracies introduced.  He probably couldn't reach the guy, and I bet
the mutilated version got printed (I don't know for sure, since I don't
read the Times).  This is standard.

It's almost a rule that whenever there's a story on a subject you're
familiar with there'll be major inaccuracies.  So what does that say
about all the others?

Well, that's one reason, anyway...
