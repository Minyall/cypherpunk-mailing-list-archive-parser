No, what's appropriate is what's in the charter. Stuff related to 
cryptography and its offshoots. Conspiracy du-jour is totally unrelated,
and Perry is right, it doesn't belong. I don't see why that's so hard
to understand. Perry isn't acting as a list owner, but the subconscious
reminder to "stick closer to the charter". He's a bit billious, but it
helps to cut out the drivel, so I don't mind so much.
 They (I) object when something is labelled as cypherpunk because many of
the people on this list have completely opposite views on different
topics. There is no gestault.  A mailing list does not make a common
personality.
