Granted.  For my particular library, there are no major 'if statements' I 
believe (I'll check) after you get out of the mod_exp function and into 
the mod and mul sub parts.  As for the multiplier, I just had a look at 
my old 386 book and yup, it does take an argument dependent time... I've 
been around pipelined RISC cpus too long...
