Last reminder!  Come to the Federal Building in SF this Friday at
10:15AM, go upstairs to Judge Marilyn Hall Patel's courtroom, and Be
There for the first skirmish in the trial of crypto export controls.
450 Golden Gate Avenue in downtown SF, two blocks from Van Ness.

We've gotten a lot of press interest.  Both the legal-newspapers in
SF, the Examiner, and many others will be covering it.  Some of them
breathlessly asked, "Will the cypherpunks hold a demonstration?", but
what we will demonstrate is how the legal system can turn against the
bureaucrats and authoritarians who currently hold crypto hostage.

This will be a low-key meeting, quietly bearing witness, at least
before we adjourn to a probably rowdy lunch at Max's Opera Cafe at Van
Ness and Golden Gate Avenues.  If you can't come to the hearing, at
least come for lunch!

And don't forget, it's a costume party: Dress like a banker.  Even
you bitbankers.  Even me.  See you there!

	John
