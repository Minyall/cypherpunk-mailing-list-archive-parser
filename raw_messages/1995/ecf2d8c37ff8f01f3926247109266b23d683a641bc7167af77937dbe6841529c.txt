If there is ANY place in the code that I can do a data driven buffer
overflow, I can force you to execute code that I supply. I don't give
a damn if it's in the "security" code. It makes no difference where it
is. If there is a chink, thats it -- you're meat.

Besides, the "security code" obviously was written by someone who
doesn't understand anything about cryptography and yet presumed to
play cryptographer. A person who thinks seeding things off the time
makes for a good PRNG is capable of almost anything.

I have very serious doubts in this regard -- VERY serious doubts,
especially given what I've been told by several former Netscape
employees.
