Someone has expressed concern to me that the cypherpunks archives are
searchable via Lycos.  Said person doesn't mind having the archives
searchable to the smaller audience of people who go to the we-site,
but is unhappy about net-wide searches turning up cypherpunks articles.

Can we try to find a consensus on this?  My initial inclination was to
shrug the concern off (properties of information, etc, as well as c'punks
being a more-or-less anarchy and the express desire for some sort of
searching mechanism for c'punks), but I thought I'd double check as I've
been mostly out of touch for the better part of a year.
