However, radiation detection devices are far easier to assure correct
operation. You can buy pre-built radiation counters with RS-232
interfaces, so its really just a question in many cases of buying them
and small radation sources, the latter of which is available in most
scientific supply catalogs. Unlike other devices, its very hard for
outsiders to tamper with radation sources to make them produce
specially skewed numbers....
