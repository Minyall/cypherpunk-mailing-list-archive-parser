   Is this even technically possible?  That is, wholesale monitoring of  
   disparate portions of the net from a single access point.  

If I were doing global Internet monitoring, I wouldn't be doing it
in-band.  Too much cooperation by the vendors required; too much
discovery.  Rather, I'd gain access to the trunks directly and do my
own demodulation and decoding.
