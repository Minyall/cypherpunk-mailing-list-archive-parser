Ok, I'm happy to announce a new anonymous remailer, the Tower Anonymous
Remailer, at remailer@tower.techwood.org

Standard cpunks remailer, installed from the remailer installation
script 1.01 from ftp.csua.berkeley.edu, supporting pgp.

Here's the server's public key, which I have submitted to 
io.com:

-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: 2.6.2

mQBNAy8iqAQAAAECALHjiFPr7Is0NptniDkYJ9UnRFM3Pn9Lz7mrPd58uo/EPMF5
bm3TjfAmdMlw2oBTtm7Ch3dsfBY44XEEwzVRkb0ABRG0NlRvd2VyIEFub255bW91
cyBSZW1haWxlciA8cmVtYWlsZXJAdG93ZXIudGVjaHdvb2Qub3JnPg==
=Rfb5
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

Response times should be good.  (Note that my network's connection
to the backbone is being changed in the next few days, and this may
affect things in the meantime.)

Anyplace else I should submit the key for maximal exposure?  

How might I go about being added to the "ping list" ?
