I suppose I should have elaborated in my original post. Of course I know
of Jude's role in cypherpunk history; in fact I thought it would interest
cpunks to know that she was interviewed. As for the 'charter' - it was 
no doubt WIRED's creative interpretation.

Speaking of which, the list membership has hit 640. I'll be posting a
membership profile soon, since it's a year since I saw the one that
got me out of 'lurk mode' when I discovered I was the only cpunk in this
region.
