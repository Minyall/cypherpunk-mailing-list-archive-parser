In any case, Trumpet Winsock has got a buit-in socksifier, even in the 
non-time-limited version 2.0b. It's activated by the "Firewall setup" 
dialogue box, and seems to work: I've just tested it with a sockd 4.2b 
running on a Linux box. NEC's DLL will add the same functionality to 
other stacks, but experimental encrypting relays could be tested right 
now with Trumpet Winsock.

Think about it, this could be the ultimate encryption hook: I don't think 
that NSA could arrive to ban firewall support...

Now for a catchy name for SOCKS-based encrypting relays: what about 
"SafeSox"? :-)
