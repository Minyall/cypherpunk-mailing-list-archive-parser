I think you've confused whatever poorly designed GUI you've chosen
to use with UNIX.  The GUI on my workstation at work doesn't behave
like this.  It's not as intuitive as my Mac, but it does bear a
rather frightening resemblance to the Windows system that my brother
has on is Compaq.

Unix isn't a GUI, or even a UI.  It's an operating system.  And it
performs that function better than most.
