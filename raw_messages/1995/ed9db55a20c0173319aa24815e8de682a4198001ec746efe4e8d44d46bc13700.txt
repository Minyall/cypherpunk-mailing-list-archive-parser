The point is that what if there's a MIMT who is changing the signatures
on the hfinney posts? What if originally they were signed "Alice" but
then a MIMT went and substituted "Hal"?

Then any reputation I attached to Hal should really go to Alice, no?
And even when I get a certified key for Hal, I still can't really put
the reputation onto it, since maybe the reputation really belongs to
Alice.

Doesn't this bother you?

At least with digital signatures I can be certain that the same person
always signed the messages (and that ri cannot repuditate them), even
if I don't necessarily know who that person is. (I guess the issue
becomes plagiarism rather than impersonation.)


Hope that makes sense...
