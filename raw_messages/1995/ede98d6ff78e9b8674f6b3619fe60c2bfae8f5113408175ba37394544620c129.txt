Hi,

	The specs for STT are now available. Due to various circumstances
too complex to explain these are currently being served via the W3C web server 
at :-

http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Payments/STT.html

This does not constitute an endorsement of these specifications by W3C nor
any representation of the fitness thereof. 

Note that these documents may well move in the future.


For more payments related info see:-

The roadmap has been updated appropriately.
