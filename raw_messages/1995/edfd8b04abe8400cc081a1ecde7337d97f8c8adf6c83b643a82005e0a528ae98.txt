This seems to be one of these devices which use the celular phone
network. In Germany they are also available ("Modacom") and use the
D1/D2/E-Plus networks. These networks can localize a sender in many cases
with a precision of about 20-40 meters. Not the best way to keep the 
physical location secret...
