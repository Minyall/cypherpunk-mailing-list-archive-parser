Isn't it?  If an attacker does not know what cipher is used and breaking
each is computationally expensive (though not prohibitively so) doesn't
that add extra complexity?  IE, if cipher A, B, and C are attackable in
large but not prohibitive time, wouldn't an attacker have to spend more
cycles to break something that was randomly one of those?  I agree that
it's not a significantly large jump, but if an attacker has to go through
all the possibilities for A, B, before breaking something in C, it seems
that there's a small increase in strength (Not being argumentative,
really... I understand that this increase in strength isn't enough to
warrant any significant effort.  Just want to clarify the answer in
my mind).

Sure.  Ideally, a user could say "use A" or "use randomly A, C, or D" or
even "use A_x(C_x) or B_x(D_y)".   I'm not certain the "accept" is a great
idea, but what the hell... any theoretical general system should have
support for such a decision to be made, right?  As failure modes
multiply...

Great... that's the answer I was looking for, and what my gut feeling
was.  I'm trying to determine how much rope is too much for a first pass.

Related: is there, in general or in any known specific cases, any loss of
security in using sym. cipher A on ciphertext B (of another sym. cipher) with
the same key?  With different keys (I would think not, but I vaguely
remember mention of something here long ago)?
