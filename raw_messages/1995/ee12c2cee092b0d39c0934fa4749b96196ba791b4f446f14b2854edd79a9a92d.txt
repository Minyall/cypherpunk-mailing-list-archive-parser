Despite loud squawking, "chaos" will not ensue. Instead, the private
sector will take over assesing risk, which it has always done better.

An example: I'd rather jump into a full bathtub with a plugged-in,
UL [Underwriter's Laboratories] certified TV set than take the FDA
approved (but very dangerous, IMO) prostate drug called "Proscar."
While there is only one UL (by choice, not force) and only one FDA
(by force, not choice) I can easily imagine a  lawyer-certifying
companies like UL for appliances, probably tied [like UL] to the
insurance industry. [I am not a lawyer, or a doctor either.]
