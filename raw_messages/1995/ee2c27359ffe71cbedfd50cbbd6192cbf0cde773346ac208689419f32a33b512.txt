        Here's an article about a commercial company that is doing speech
over the Internet.  Maybe someone would like to help them add encryption.

TrueSpeech Player enables real-time audio over Internet

SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A., 1995 SEP 1 (NB) -- DSP Group Inc. 
(NASDAQ:DSPG) announced a new Windows product, TrueSpeech Player, that is 
freely available on the Internet. The TrueSpeech Player enables TrueSpeech- 
encoded speech to be played in real-time over the Internet.

Kurt Magdanz, director of business development at DSP, told Newsbytes, "The 
TrueSpeech Player utilizes the TrueSpeech compression technology bundled in 
Microsoft's Windows 95 and Windows NT. True Speech is a very high quality 
algorithm which compresses speech. TrueSpeech 
Player allows users to decompress TrueSpeech in real time."

With the TrueSpeech compression algorithm, speech is communicated in real- 
time over standard telephone lines to computers capable of communicating at 
data rates of 14.4kbps (kilobits per second) or above, Newsbytes was told. 
Because the TrueSpeech Player converts compressed speech data in real-time, 
World Wide Web site visitors have access to high-quality speech over the 
Internet in real time, said Magdanz.

"The TrueSpeech Player is our first step in enabling high-quality speech 
communication in real-time over the Internet," said Yuval Cohen, vice 
president of business development with the DSP Group. "World Wide Web site 
and content developers can immediately begin developing TrueSpeech Player- 
compatible content without paying fees."

"Content developers who wish to create TrueSpeech Player-compatible speech 
content should visit our World Wide Web site for detailed instructions on 
how to use this new product," said Cohen.

DSP Group is currently developing an advanced TrueSpeech Server software 
package which will offer content developers tools, interaction with the 
TrueSpeech Player to enable advanced features, live broadcasting capability 
and enhanced server control with diagnostics, said Magdanz.

The TrueSpeech Player can be downloaded freely from DSP Group's World Wide 
Web site, http://www.dspg.com .

DSP is headquartered in Santa Clara, California.
