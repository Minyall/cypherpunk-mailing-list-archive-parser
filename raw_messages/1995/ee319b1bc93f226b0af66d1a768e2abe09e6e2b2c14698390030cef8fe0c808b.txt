|| As is mentioned in the README, more will need to be done to find more
|| bits of entropy. (Too much of a good thing is still not enough.)
|| However the security team believes that the RNG seed is no longer the
|| weak link and candidate for attack.  So I am personally volunteering
|| to have my had shaved if a discovered deficiency in this code results
|| in an easily attacked generated seed. [You will be expected to show
|| your work. :-)]
