Certification is needed to avoid another person intercepting, re-signing,
and substituting hir own key.

Certification is needed to avoid another person diverting the ecash
(a disputed unsigned key practically useless). In fact a much simpler
attack is denial-of-service: simply dispute the key (send another one
to the keyservers), and let the resulting uncertainty cut off the profits.


Also, if you insist on govt-is-root, you need certified pseudonyms
to set up a pseudonymous CA (ie a CA whose real identity is unknown).


Hope that makes sense...
