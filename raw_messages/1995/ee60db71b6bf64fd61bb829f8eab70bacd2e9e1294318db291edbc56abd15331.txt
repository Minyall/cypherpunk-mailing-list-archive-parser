Mark Twain Ecash does allow for ASCII email payments.

With a Heavy User account you can move a hundred USD in or out of the  Mint
fee of charge.

For the second hundred USD the rate is 3%, but the money movement fee  is
counted against your monthly fee of $2, so you only pay 3$ - 2$ =  1$ for
the second hundred.
