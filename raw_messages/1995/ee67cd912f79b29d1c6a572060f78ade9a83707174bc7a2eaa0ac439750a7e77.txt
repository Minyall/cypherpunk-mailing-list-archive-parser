On a fair number of occassions I have been told that federal type folks
have made statements to the effect that there is no such thing as a "TOP
SECRET" classification of US government docs. Since really secret things
tend to get neither confirmed nor denied, I am inclined to believe this.
Thus SECRET is the top classification in today's government/military. If
anybody knows otherwise I would be interested in the information.
