The answer is to have some non-USA entity build shareable full fledged 
full powered crypto libraries and provide them for free for the rest of 
the world and for all machines.

On Windoze DLL's or WIN32's would be needed, on PPC Mac's shared Lib's, 
on 68K Macs, an INIT that hooks itself via Gestalt, on Unix, shared 
LIB's, etc.  I would also include routines for asking the user for a 
passphrase to prevent the running application from grabbing that password 
and providing weak security.  Or a program running in the background that 
handles all the calls via IAC's or whatever... (like AppleEvents to PGP)

All with full free source, etc and PGP compatibility, etc.  Then the rest 
of us could write code that uses that library.  Whoever wants crypto just 
downloads the library from whereever and uses it.

In this case, would code written in the USA be exportable?  

Wei's library would have been perfect for something like this... too bad. :-(
