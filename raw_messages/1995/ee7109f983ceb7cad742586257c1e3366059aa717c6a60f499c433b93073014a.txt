	And that this is the segment of the user population that is most 
important to commerce online.  But I still hate to see these types of 
solutions being used to try and cover something that should, and could be 
fixed in the underlying protocol itself.  Wouldnt AH and ESP take care of 
a large portion of the existing security holes?  Certainly not all of 
them, but it would solve alot of problems and make development of secure 
applications much easier.

note: is anyone working on implementeing some of the things outlines in 
R(1825?) ?  I think Perry posted regarding it awhile back, but havent 
heard much about it since.
