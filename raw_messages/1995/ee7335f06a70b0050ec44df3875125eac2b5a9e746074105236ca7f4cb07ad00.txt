	The real threat model that Dimitri seems to be worried about
is spammers, so lets address them.

There are two types of spammers, commercial and personal.

	The commercial spammer wants to get messages into hundreds or
thousands of mail boxes.  The effort to do this, per mailbox, needs to
be very low, or they go for people with worse filters.

	The personal spammer is more difficult, since they seek
specifically to annoy you, and can thus be expected to expend more
effort.  They can possibly get a copy of each signed message that
comes to you, but of course, you can cache filter them.  A problem
occurs if they can get their spam to you before the legit message, in
which case you need to wade through tripe to get to the real message.

	The personal spammer is a social problem, and I recommend
using social methods to fix it.  An auto-responder that says "Please
grow up" might do the trick.
