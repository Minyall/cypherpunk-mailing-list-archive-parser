Toleration of divergent views is not one of those issues that breaks 
out well along left-right polarities.  E.g., Andrea Dworkin's closest 
aliies on porn are on the xtian right, not among her fellow radical 
feminists [contrary to the image promoted in some mass media].  
Threats to Catcher in the Rye in libraries are far more common than 
incidents like the one in Menlo Park.

Legally, that's a question yet to be resolved.

In any case, this is hardly cyrpto-related.  I would far rather lurk 
as the mathematicians discuss factoring.  I learn more [even if I 
only get one word in three :-]
