No doubt about that.  One's a real product, one's (primarily) a piece
of puffery.

Note in particular the distinction between Fred's server and a real HTTP
server:
It does not run CGI scripts (i.e. no forms support).  It does not have
per-user access control.  It does not have URL mapping.  It cannot
redirect.  All configuration is hard-coded into the binary.  It doesn't
support user directories (e.g. http://site/~yourname).  It doesn't do
server-side includes.  It can't process the HEAD method.  It cannot create
a directory index (if no index.html is present).  It does not support
conditional retrieval (i.e. "If-modified-since").  It is slow (requires
a separate process for each request).  It is initiated by inetd for each
HTTP connection and hence relies on that program's security as well (the
"line-by-line analysis" of inetd is conspicuously missing from Fred's
self-congratulatory whitepaper -- not to mention the OS on which it is
intended to run).  It does not even have the capability to identify the
content type of the retrieved file (apparently you must embed
"Content-type: text/html\n\n" [or whatever] at the beginning of each HTML
source file).

I'm not saying it's completely useless, only that it does not constitute
an HTTP server in the usual sense of the word.  Hence, Fred's continued
boasting of this prodigious feat of programming prowess is complete
bullshit.  And, incidentally, the programming style, with its reliance
on global fixed-length buffers, shared variables, lack of prototypes,
forgotten function arguments, absence of error checking on system call
returns, etc. is more suggestive of a first year CS student than an
alleged PhD, *and* demonstrates a style more typical of a BASIC
programmer than a C programmer.  Don't try this at home, kids; this is
NOT the way to write "secure" software unless your whole program fits
in 80 lines too.

Big deal.  It is the web equivalent of "Hello World".
