Heh heh heh
 
Somebody should tell that to the guy who's pulling them down 500 at a time.
I have to settle for 32 x 7 at a time, in order to manage runtime at 9 hours.
And the clever thing is, I have to stay connected to all 7 machines in order
to keep running.
 
Good thing there's an incremental notice, so I can restart if I lose carrier.
 
You know, this is really fun. Too bad the prize isn't something really cool,
like a free wastebasket in case Windoze 95 comes my way...
 
 
Sorry, just felt like it was my turn to babble...
