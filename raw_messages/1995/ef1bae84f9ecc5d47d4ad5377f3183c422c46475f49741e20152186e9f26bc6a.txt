No problem. You just have to be careful when you are generating your
wordlist, that's all.

One would need a great deal of inspiration to make it work. However,
I do think that it is possible.

How about the numerical cmavo? You'd want to encode numbers. And you
don't want people to know they are numbers, because they could
count the digits (to get order of magnitude). Same for spelling cmavo.

How about the tense system? You'd want to encode that because it could
give important hints to locations (and times). Then again you could
probably avoid using the "a little to the north and a long way east" tense
altogether...

How about the attitudinals?

Like I said, I only glanced at it, but how about NAI and GAI?

I'm not sure I'd agree here. I suspect you are overestimating the regularity
of lojban grammar (then again maybe I'm underestimating...).

Yes (though I'd feel quite confident doing it for Esperanto).

Yup. If it's really a problem - ambiguity in language has been with us
for a long time and nobody minds much. But I guess you wouldn't want
arbitrary ambiguity in your text (you could have an interactive coder
which immediately alerts you to all alternative meanings). Or you could
put marks into your text to separate the word parts (like some beginner
Esperanto books do) thus eliminating the problem.

I'm sure you could easily find wordlists giving the "first X" words of
Esperanto - you could just standardize on one of them.


Mi esperas ke tio cxi sencas...
