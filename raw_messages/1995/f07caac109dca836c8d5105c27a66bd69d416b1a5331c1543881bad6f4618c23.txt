Unfortunately, this approach is easy but doesn't really succeed in adding
undetectable padding.  The PGP message, once the ascii armor is stripped
away, has a byte count in it.  Anyone can de-armor the message and see
that this byte count does not match the size of the file.  So you also
need to bump this byte count to match the added bytes.  That's all my
perl script does that I posted.
