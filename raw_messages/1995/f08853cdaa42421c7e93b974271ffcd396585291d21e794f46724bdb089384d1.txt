Who cares?

And if I did care who the "cancelmoose" is, I'd care more about the trail
of evidence "Anonymous" thinks links "cancelmoose" to the eponymous moose

Oh, did I tell you I discovered the real identity of Jack the Ripper? A
finger of ripper@netcom.com reveals some very interesting information. Film
