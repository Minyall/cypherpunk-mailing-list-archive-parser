Go ahead and trust that no one can do it, then. Considering that NTP
can synch up clocks over the net with astonishing accuracy with
multiple probes, it would be hard to believe that you couldn't
similarly dramatically reduce the effects of network delays for the
purposes of mounting an attack on an RSA key, too.

However, if you don't believe it is possible, why, go ahead and ignore
it. Not my problem what you do.
