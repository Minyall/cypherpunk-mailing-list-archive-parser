An attack on the attempt. If the key owner also volunteers a server,
then half the CPU cycles will report to that server (and be given
useless chunks of keyspace) thus halving the CPU power available to
the usual server ("half" in an infinitely naive world, of course).

The approach I suggested basically corresponds to everyone maintaining
hir own server; servers that trust each other will coordinate.
An attacker can of course NAK the key segment, but only those that trust
the attacker will take any notice.

The difference is that in this scheme everyone does coordinate, only
it's peer-peer rather than client-server.

I think that's where it came from. I really should provide citations,
shouldn't I...

Similarly in the peer-peer approach, the effort is coordinated but
untrusted NAKs slow it down only slightly. The only "solicited" NAKs
will be your own.


Hope that makes sense...
