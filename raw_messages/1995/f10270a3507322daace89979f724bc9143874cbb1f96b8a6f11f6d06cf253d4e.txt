I too got tired of Netcom's anon ftp server.
An unaltered, ASCII copy of Tim's CP-FAQ is available as
http://www.isse.gmu.edu/~pfarrell/crypto/CP-FAQ
This is a low usage site, so response should be fine.

BTW, there is a page for the DC-area Cypherpunks as
http://www.isse.gmu.edu/~pfarrell/dccp/index.html

And a guide to every US GovernmentWWW page that I could find
(including locations of spook facilities) starting at
http://www.isse.gmu.edu/~pfarrell/government/usgov.html

Other crypto related resources are available starting at
