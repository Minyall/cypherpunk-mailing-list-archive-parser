As my final word on this thread, let me say that if you are really
interested in the 9th Amendment, by far the best legal article on 
the subject  that I know of is Charles L. Black, Jr, On Reading 
and Using the Ninth Amendment.   I have not visited the Cato web 
pages, but their journal tends to be on the shallow side.  I am 
far from LEXIS right now so I can't give you a citation for the 
Black article, but it is brilliant.  It would also make a 
libertarian's hair stand on end.  For hours.
