This used to be the case.  However they've fixed this, and won't let you
use your 10 free hours until they have a valid number.

I've been told that Compuserve still accepts any credit card number as long
as the checksum is valid.  I haven't tried it. (Note that as long as you're
only using the "free hours", you're not stealing any services.)
