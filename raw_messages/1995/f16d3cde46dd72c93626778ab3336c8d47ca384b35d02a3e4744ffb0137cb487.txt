The Zen of UNIX

  "Unix teaches us about the tranistory nature of all things, thus
   ridding us of samsaric attachments and hastening enlightenment.  For
   instance, while trying to make sense of an X initialization script
   someone had given me, I came across a line that looked like an
   ordinary unix shell command with the term "exec" prefaced to it.
   Curious as to what exec might do, I typed "exec ls" to a shell window.
   It listed a directory, then proceeded to kill the shell and every
   other window I had, leaving the screen almost totally black with a
   tiny white inactive cursor hanging at the bottom to remind me that
   nothing is absolute and all things partake of their opposite.

  "In the past I might have gotten upset or angry at such an occurance.
   That was before I found enlightenment through Unix.  Now, I no longer
   have attachments to my processes.  Both processes and the disapperance
   of processes are illusory.  The world is unix, unix is the world,
   labor ceaslessly for the salvation of all sentient beings."
