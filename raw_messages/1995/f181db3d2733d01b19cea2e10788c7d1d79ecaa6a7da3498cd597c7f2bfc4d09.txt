No.

Replace cancel with
	1.  Legal wants you to destroy this document
	2.  The site security officer wants you to destroy the document
	3.  The license has expired and you must destroy the document
and so on.  I don't think my life has been all that interesting, but
I've had all of those things happen.

Of course there is no guarnatee that indiviuals don't have private
copies, etc., but you have this situation currently and it works.
Replacing cancel with setaside makes Usenet architecture useful for
many business semantics/requirements.  That's not something I'm willing to
trade away and I am surprised that others would...
