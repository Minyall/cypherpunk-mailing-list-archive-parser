When I've thought about this, it's been from the p.o.v. of message
senders being able to earn prepaid service tokens (not unlike
digital cash) for offering their machine as a remailer for a set
period of time or number of message or total bandwidth or
whatever. This activity could be completely asynchronous to any
origination of messages, and, in fact, a regular habit of accumulating
tokens like this would make for excellent cover traffic.
