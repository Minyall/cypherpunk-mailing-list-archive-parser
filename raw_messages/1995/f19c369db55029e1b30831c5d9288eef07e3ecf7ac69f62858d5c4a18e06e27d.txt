A few months ago I decided that what the world needed was a friendly-
looking "PGP" icon which we could all display everywhere and which 
would catch people's attention.  I quickly rejected pictures of locks,
chains, safes, keys and so forth as appealing too much to those who
go for tech and tools.  I wanted something that would appeal to my
mom.  I finally settled on a big-pixel ("digital") blue envelope 
with a big "PGP" stamp across the seal.  (Alternately I considered
having the "PGP" stamp in the upper-right-hand-corner "stamp slot",
but this wasn't as fitting a metaphor...)


After shopping around and finding nothing like it available, I sat
down at some stupid Windoze paint program and created one.  It's not
very pretty (I'm a better programmer than graphic artist, I think),
but you can see it/get a copy at 
<a href="http://www-ugrad.cs.colorado.edu/~wilcoxb> The Niche </a>, 
my home page.


I hope someone makes a nicer-looking version soon so I can use it.


Sitting down and trying to draw a nicer-looking PGP icon is on my
(very long) list of Things To Do.  I'm considering scanning a real
envelope and super-imposing the "PGP" stamp digitally, but that
would probably look even uglier...


Regards,

Bryce
