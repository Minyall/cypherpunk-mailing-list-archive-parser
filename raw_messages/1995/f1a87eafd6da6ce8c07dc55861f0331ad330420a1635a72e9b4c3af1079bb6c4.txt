Friend, 
 
 
Edupage, 28 November 1995, reports: 
 
             ONLINE ANONYMITY IS ALL RELATIVE 

America Online has revealed the real name of a subscriber 
who called herself "Jenny TRR" to a Caribbean resort owner 
and dive instructor who claim they were defamed in remarks 
she posted on an AOL bulletin board. 
 
AOL gave the subscriber a chance to object to the action, but 
says she didn't attempt to fight the subpoena.  AOL's assis- 
tant general counsel says the service doesn't disclose infor- 
mation about electronic mail, which is protected by the Elec- 
tronic Communications Privacy Act, 
 
         unless it [ electronic mail ] is part of 
                a criminal investigation. 
 
The item cites: Wall Street Journal 24 Nov 95 B1. 
 
 
There's two types of criminal investigations: those of crimes 
and those that are crimes. 
 
 
Cordially, 
 
Jim
