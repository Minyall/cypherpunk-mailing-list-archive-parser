- From the node of Bryan Strawser:
: 
: 
: What John is attempting to do is have a nymserver like anon.penet.fi,
: where folks can create an alias and send/recieve mail/postings to it.  
: However, unlike Julf's system, a secure nymserver would prevent the owner 
: from being able to divulge who the real-life person is behind the
: alias because of the PGP encrypted reply block and other options
: involved.
: 

But how does one ensure that no logs are kept on the server, and how
does the encrypted reply block work (I can't see how this will shield
identity from both of the communicating parties)?
