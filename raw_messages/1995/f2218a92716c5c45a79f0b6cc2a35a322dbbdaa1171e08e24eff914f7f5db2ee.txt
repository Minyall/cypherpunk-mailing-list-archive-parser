The text of the actual copyright notice seems to have a much friendlier slant.
It resembles a GNU or FSF-type freeware license. Apparently you're just not
allowed to charge *more* than a flat fee:

- From the bottom of the cited Web page:
"Copyright 1994 by Pepper & Corazzini, L.L.P. All rights reserved. 
Reproduction is permitted so long as no charge is made for copies, no copies
are placed on any electronic online service or database for which there is a
fee other than a flat access charge, there is no alteration and this 
copyright notice is included."
