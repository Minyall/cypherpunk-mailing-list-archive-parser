Hi,

i am using a prog called twinsock to have an internet connection via my 
shell account. The program provides a winsock for my windows progs and it 
comes with the complete source. When I first started to use it, I thought 
that it must be fairly easy to add some packet encryption to this 
program. But then I realized that it wouldnt work over a tcp/ip 
connection, only over a telephone line. But maybe the twinsock code might 
be a good starting point for some encrypting winsock. Unfortunately, I am 
not a good enough programmer to estimate how much work it is to come up 
with such an enhanced winsock or even start to make one myself.
