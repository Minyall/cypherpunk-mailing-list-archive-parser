The best book to read is, of course, Volume 2 of Knuth's "Art of
Computer Programming". Many of the algorithms in use today are a bit
snazzier but Knuth explains all the general principles of how such
things are done.

BTW, any good hacker should own all three published volumes. Its *the*
classic.
