This has somewhat undemocratic aspects when applied to political free 
speech. A person has ONE vote regardless of his wealth and as far as 
access to the political process this same principle must be maintained 
otherwise democracy is lost. 

At times freedoms for corporate entities and freedoms for individuals are 
at cross purposes, freedom for individuals must always be held in the 
higher position.
