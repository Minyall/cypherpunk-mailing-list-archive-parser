I also suggest "A Course in Number Theory and Cryptography, 2nd Edition"
by Neal Koblitz, published by Springer Verlag.

"Applied Cryptography" is certainly the book of choice, but Koblitz
is an excellent secondary reference for covering a lot of the relevant
mathematics in more depth.

In my opinion, "Applied Cryptography" was written from the perspective
of computer science, "The Codebreakers" was written from the perspective
of history, and Koblitz's book was written from the perspective of
mathematics.

They are all nicely complementary.
