Thaddeus beat me to the punch, as I was going to say just about the same thing.

The work by Adleman on "vats of computers" is intriguing, but is no real
solution to the problem of exponential or superexponential growth: a
problem that Adleman's vat could solve with a fish tank full of DNA
computers in a day could be easily outpaced by a key length "only" a bit
longer.
