  How about if the systems allows you to get a certificate that
has any name in it that you want, where the issuer makes no
claims about the identity of the owner of the certificate?
How about if the software lets the user decide which CAs they
will accept certificates from?  Given these two features,
would you still consider requiring a certificate to be bad?
