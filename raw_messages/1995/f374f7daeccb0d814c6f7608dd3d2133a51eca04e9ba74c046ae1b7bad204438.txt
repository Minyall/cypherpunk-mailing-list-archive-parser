I feel leery about these things if only because, as I've noted, trying
to get these things "just right" and make sure that you are getting
noise and not, say, high frequency hum from your own switching power
supply, is very hard. You can set up a geiger counter if you are
merely moderately competant. I don't know who I would trust to do
analog stuff "just right". Do things a little wrong, and you merely
have a huge search space and not an impossibly huge one -- the sort of
toehold cryptanalysts want.

Agreed.
