I use Hal Finney's 'Chain' a lot: it is an easy way of automatically
building a remailer chain.  But it won't PGP correctly with the Usura
and the Flame remailers because these two have e-mail addresses that 
have changed and/or are different from the addresses specified in their
public keys (Usura, for instance, is now <usura@replay.com>, but this 
is not the address given in its public key ID). 

Is there a way for me in PGP to edit and update the information contained
in the public keys of others?
I would want to add an "also known as" line for 'Chain' to spot.

   O.A.
