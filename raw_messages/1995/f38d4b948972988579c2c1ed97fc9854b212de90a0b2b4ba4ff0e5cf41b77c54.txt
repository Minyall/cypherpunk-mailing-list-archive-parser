   You are right here. However, our observation is that an interesting
   chunk of the world is moving towards using X.509 based certificate
   infrastructures for many things.

It's that interesting chunk that RSADSI is pointing out to you.  When
you see the world through the eyes of a vendor ...

And you know, of course, that PEM really stands for Patent Extension
Mechanism.

I don't really blame you much.  I mean TIPEM handles all the X.509
stuff just fine and PGP can't get out even the simplest of libraries,
or even a partial library.
