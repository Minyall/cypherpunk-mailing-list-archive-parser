Thanks for the info.

  It may be a bug in BSDI's Xserver then. However, the overlong
domain bug is also a bug in the NIS code. So while the crash
may not occur within Netscape code itself, I am a little wary 
that it is not performing sanity checking. If it turns out to do nasty
stuff to Windows clients, then it may be significant.
