A freestanding implementation of MD5SUM (compiled from that in the PGP 
distribution) for DOS is at
ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/public/md5sum.zip and on the Colorado Catacombs BBS 
at 303-772-1062.

I suggested to Phil Zimmermann that he should put this in the next PGP 
release along with the compiled DOS version of PGP, but there hasn't been 
a new release of PGP since then.

Happy New Year!
