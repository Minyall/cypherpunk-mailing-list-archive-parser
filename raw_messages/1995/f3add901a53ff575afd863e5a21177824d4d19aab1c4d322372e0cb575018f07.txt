  Yes, I get the idea about spewing the signed hashes everywhere.  The
problem I have is with the user of PGP.  That will help cypherpunks,
but does absolutely nothing for most of our millions of users, who
have no idea what PGP is.  Perhaps its enough to assume that if anyone
is tampering with the distribution, some cypherpunk will stumble across
it...
