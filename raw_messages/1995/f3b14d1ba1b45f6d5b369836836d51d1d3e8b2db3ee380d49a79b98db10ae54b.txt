I presume you mean SHA-1.

I would prefer to see MD5 deleted.  A 128 bit hash simply seems too
marginal in length for long term use in most hash applications.  I
would much rather see something like Haval as a second hash algorithm.
It can be faster than MD5, and can easily be tailored to the hash
width you want.  If 128 bit hashes are really needed, use Haval's
128-bit option.
