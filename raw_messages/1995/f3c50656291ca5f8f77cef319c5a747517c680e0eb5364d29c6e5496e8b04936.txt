It's not too hard to think of a compression scheme that needs extra 
information to be passed from client to server; the obvious example is 
some sort of dictionary compression with external dictionaries (can be 
very effective for short messages where LZW etc never get a chance to get 
going). 

Another, more likely case, is where the object could have been compressed 
by several schemes, and a scheme ID is needed to determine which 
alogorithm to use. 

The real issue would appear to be intent, though. If it's obvious that 
the real intention for the hook is to allow encryption to be added, 
the State department can jump on it.
