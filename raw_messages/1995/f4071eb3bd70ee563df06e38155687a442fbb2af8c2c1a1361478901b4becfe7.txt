Just a dumb question: when brutessl-brclient-brloop will find the key, 
will it report it to the keyserver right away? What I mean is can I just 
start the brloops on my machines and log out, and not have to look at the 
display all the time?

BTW how can I log brloop's output into a file and not to the screen?
