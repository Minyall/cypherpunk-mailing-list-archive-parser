What about when the CA signing key is stolen, factored, or otherwise falls  
into the wrong hands, thereby possibly making every signature made by the CA  
worthless, or at least questionable?

I assume liability will be based on the CA's efforts to ensure the integrity  
of the signatures it makes (and therefore the confidentiality of the secret  
key components), but what constitutes due diligence?  As we all know,  
security measures cover a very wide range and can reach ridiculous  
proportions on both ends of the spectrum...  How much security will be  
'enough' from a legal standpoint...?
