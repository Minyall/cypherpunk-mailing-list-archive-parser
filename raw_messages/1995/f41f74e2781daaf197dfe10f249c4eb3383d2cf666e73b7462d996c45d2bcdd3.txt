Whoa there !  You've just made a huge conceptual leap, from "value of the
Bugs Bounty program" to "value of the discovery of a security flaw". I think
nearly everyone agrees that the latter is significant. There appears to be
great disagreement about the former, as Alice de `nonymous has demonstrated.

There's been a specific response to your claim, which so far you have ignored.
It would seem that you are far more interested in impugning Netscape's motives
than discussing the security issue you raised.

Ooh, I like this idea. Find a flaw, get a MiG-29 ! Of course, we knew that
Netscape Communications Corp. must be a KGB front. The Commies are still 
hoping to undermine U.S. national security. Did you notice that we heard
about the White House browsing Web pages right about the same time that
KKlinton relaxed the supercomputer export controls ?  Adding insult to
injury, they want to foist surplus Soviet goods off on us....
