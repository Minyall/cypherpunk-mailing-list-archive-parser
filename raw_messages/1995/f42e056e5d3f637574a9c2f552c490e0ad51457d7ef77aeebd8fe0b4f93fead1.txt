Actually, he was at the last Bay Area Cypherpunks physical 
meeting under another name.  At least he learned that Eric Hughes 
and I are not the same person.  Unfortunately, Tim May was not in
attendance so no telling what he thinks.  

In addition, he has been fairly active on list of late.  I think
you all know which poster is he.

Hell, I don't care, just as long as he isn't frothing.
