Using only the tools provided by the spammer, and without compromising
system security in any way, we have obtained the full list of email
addresses that were used by the bulkd@valleynet.net direct email spammer.
I am not going to tell the public how to get it because I do not want this
list to fall into the wrong hands. 

There are several curious features about the list that strongly suggest
that it was purchased from other spammers. I *strongly encourage* the
person who formerly used the bulkd@valleynet.net account to apologize to
news.admin.net-abuse.misc and provide us with the source of the list
immediately.
