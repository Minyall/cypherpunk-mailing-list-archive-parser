   ATLANTA (Nov 29, 1995 - 09:44 EST) -- Harbinger Corp. has announced
   new software aimed at making the Internet safe for commerce, a move
   that could dramatically reshape the small company.

[...]

   TrustedLink, the product announced Tuesday but not available until
   next year, will let firms connect via the Net as well as through
   Harbinger networks, he said.
