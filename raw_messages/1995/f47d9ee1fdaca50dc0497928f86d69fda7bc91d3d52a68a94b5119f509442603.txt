Maybe someone could start writing an internet draft about "encrypted
voice transmission on the internet".  It should address several
issues:
  - compression methods, sampling rate differencies, encoding methods
  - encryption methods used for bulk data: at least IDEA, 3DES, DES
    (3DES and DES required, IDEA optional but recommended (for patent reasons))
  - key exchange and authentication methods.  One good model could be
    that used in Photuris (see the internet draft
    draft-ietf-ipsec-photuris-02.txt at e.g. www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us).
    Photuris is essentially Diffie-Hellman followed by authenticating
    the other party via signing the exchange.  (Authentication is
    important to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks).
  - specification of the protocol for modem-to-modem connections

Provided that the compression method is patent-free, all of the
related crypto patents expire within about two years (assuming
something other than RSA can be used for the signatures - see the
Photurs draft).  (IDEA should be optional because its patent will not
expire in near future).

I think it would be a good idea to set up a mailing list for this.
