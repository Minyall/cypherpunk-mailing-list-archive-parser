Yes, I was confused.  jpp@markv.com had yet other valid objections.

I have a novel sense of cancelation in mind. The check is canceled by the
mere fact that the bank knows the Secret that produced the SH(Secret) in
the check. The bank need not acquire or maintain a signed check revocation.
This is sort of like Chaum's spent bills. This requires the client to trust
the bank during the penalty transaction or to require escrow service. I
have modified the original to describe this better.

Any bearer. Just as any bearer of a Chaum bill can spend it. Only he who
spends it first, can spend it. Disseminate your hat checks carefully. That
is another reason that Getty, in the example, holds the hat check
carefully.

Good points. I anticipate more complex broker services here.

I like the idea of a penalty for delay in retrieving the data aside from
penalty for loosing the data. This may be strategic in the bank's arranging
for the storage and retrieval from other sites and banks.

Thanks. I will try to produce an emmended version thru ftp soon.
