	Please be aware that the current capacity of the
telephone system in the United States (and for that matter,
most of the developed world) is only capable of supporting
between 15 and 20 percent simultaneous telephone
conversations.  If the FBI wishes to set up a system that is
capable of monitoring 1% of the total number of lines, that
equates to a ability to tap 5%, not 1% of all calls in progress.

>As the FBI's "interest" shifts from area to area, the whole
>country could rapidly come under the 1% surveillance
>directive.
>1.5 million telephone intercepts.  Or more.
