I pointed the latest beta (Solaris 2.4) towards this URL:

http://java.sun.com/JDK-prebeta1/applets/CardTest/example1.html

...and, lo and behold, it core dumped with a Bus error. It's unlikely
that the bug is in Java itself, as I was able to successfully run the
example from Sun's JDK appletviewer.

Not impressed yet.
