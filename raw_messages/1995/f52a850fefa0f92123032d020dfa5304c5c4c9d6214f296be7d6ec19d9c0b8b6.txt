I'm sorry-- what do you mean by "the recipient of funds is non-anonymous"?  
I cannot envision any centralized currency system in which a user's funds
were *not* known to the bank!


Secondly, there is a tremendous difference between a person being able to
identify you as the recipient of their money (which they can pretty much do
anyway, with less surety, just by saying "That's him!  He's the one I gave
it to!") and a third party such as the bank or a government being able to
monitor all your transactions.  For such an organization to perform that feat
on a DigiCash user they would need the cooperation of all of the people with
whom he exchanges currency, and if they have that, then cryptography seems
irrelevant.  :-)


I hope I'm not missing anything here.
