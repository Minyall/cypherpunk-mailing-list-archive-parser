I quite agree that no one can read the Arms Control Export Act as
authorizing the definition of export in the ITAR that requires, among
other things, that a foreign person get a license that the ACEA says
that he can't get, before discloing cryptographic software to another
foreign person ``in the United States or abroad''.

The ITAR violates not only the first amendment to the United States
Constitution, it also violates the separation of powers doctrine.  But
it still says what it says.  (And that is why it is unconstitutional.)
