It's funny, this thing about names and reputations.

You see, I know the name "Bob Silverman," and his company, Mathworks, a
whole lot more than I know the name "don@cs.byu.edu". Mathworks was heavily
in the news last fall during the Pentium debacle (including someone I used
to know from Intel, Cleve Moler).

I've only seen the posts of "don@cs.byu.edu" since 8-29-95, just the last
two weeks. (I don't claim to have a complete archive, as I delete a lot of
stuff. But this is the earliest don@cs.byu.edu post I can find.)

Certainly I am not impugning the reputation of don@cs.byu.edu, just noting
the irony of him asking for if anyone knows who Bob Silverman is. Strange
days.
