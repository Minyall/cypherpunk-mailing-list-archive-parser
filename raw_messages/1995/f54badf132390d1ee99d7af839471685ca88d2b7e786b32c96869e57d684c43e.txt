    good choice of expletives.... 

    'who the fuck are you.?'  --nobody, I guess. 

	I have a Piled higher and Deeper in information techniques
    from Zuerich (undergrad at Harvard in physical chemistry --boring);
    I've been around since before the dawn of arpa net, probably as long 
    as TCMay --but I've never held a "job"; 
	I've personally coded two 250,000+ line packages which made me
    more than comfortable, even if one did go down the black hole (and
    countless other things like the bit-slice firmware to replace the
    B3500s in missle silos); 
	I have been charged with crypto offenses by the Feds; and, I have
    been charged with "treasonable" technology export by the Feds; and, a
    long time aog did more than one tour in USMC special operations in SE 
    Asia --as a BNCO and chopper pilot. 
	Oh, yeah, I forgot, I hold a license to practice before the court
    in a couple European countries. 

    read the following while playing 'Hotel California'

	So, who the fuck am I?  --just another aging 300 lb gorilla, 
    long haired hippie California freak with an outlaw chopper. 

	So, who am I?  Nobody, I guess  -just attila.
