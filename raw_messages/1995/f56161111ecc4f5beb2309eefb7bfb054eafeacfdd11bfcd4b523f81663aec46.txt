I sure hope no one does.  The ITARs seem to contain a 'scienter'
requirement; that you must know (or have a reasonable idea) that you
are breaking them for it to be criminal.  If he thinks he's ok, he is
until someone tells him otherwise.

	I am not a lawyer.  That is not legal advice.  Go consult a
good ITAR attorney if you want to try that at home. :)
