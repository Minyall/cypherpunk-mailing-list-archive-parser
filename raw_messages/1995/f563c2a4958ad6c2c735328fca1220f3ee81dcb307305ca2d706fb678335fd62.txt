It's already been exported.  Evidently, one of those who bought the commercial version sent it to Europe as soon as it was out.

I note the site removed it, however, probably because Netscape Comm. Inc. requested that they do so.  Netscape generally objects to anyone else carrying their browser (.edu sites with prior permission excepted).
