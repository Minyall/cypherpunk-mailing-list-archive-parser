OK, lets start some traditional politics.

Anyone know what commitee has jurisdiction?

Then the next step is who is on the commitee?

Then which cypherpunks are constituents of the commitee members?

At least some on the list write software for a living, or run ISPs and this
could effect their livelihood. Talk economic impact, not buzzwords
like "freedom" and apple pie.
