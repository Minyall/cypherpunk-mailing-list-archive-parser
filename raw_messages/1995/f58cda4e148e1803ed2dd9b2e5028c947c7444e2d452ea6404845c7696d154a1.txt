I speak for myself. I am not an official Netscape spokescritter, and
have no desires to be one.

I don't have a lot of spare time, but I do consider reading the
messages going to cypherpunks as part of my job. (Well at least some
of each message. :-)

On what topic?

I am not quite sure what problem you are talking about? NFS and MITM
ftp attacks?

Can you expand on this? I am not aware that any of the executables
we have shipped do this. If you get a compromised version of any
program (i.e. one that some attacker has changed) then that changed
version will do whatever the attacker has built it to do. This is not
a Netscape specific issue.

Firewalls and proxies help against many attacks. Without knowing
which one you mean, it's impossible to respond intelligently. (In
particular I know of no sites that allow NFS packets to cross a
firewall boundary.)
