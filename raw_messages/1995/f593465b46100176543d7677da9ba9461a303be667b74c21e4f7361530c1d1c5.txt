We currently have PGP installed on our 2 central email servers that
have approximatly 20,000 users. We haven't integrated it at this
point into Pine, etc mostly due to time and resources. 

I don't know why inability to read e-mail would cause liability,
and moving 2 million messages a week, I don't think that anyone
could be expected to know what users are sending. We only respond
to complaints.
