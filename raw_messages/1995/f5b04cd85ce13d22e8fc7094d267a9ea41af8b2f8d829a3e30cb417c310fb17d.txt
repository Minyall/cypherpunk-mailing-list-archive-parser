Since access to a private key should always be strictly mediated by the user  
any Java implementation would probably pop up a panel asking permission for  
every single private-key encryption operation requested by the applet.  The  
timing attacks require many timed encryptions to get enough information about  
the key.  Even if the user was completely clueless and had no idea what the  
applet was trying to do I would imagine that they would get tired of clicking  
"OK" long before sufficient key information was leaked .....

Of course it would be a lot easier for the applet to just try to read the  
secret key file, encrypt it with an embedded public key, and post it to  
alt.anonymous.messages.  Depending on how security was setup there might be  
only one or two panels that the user has to dismiss.  It would probably get  
past the same number of clueless users that a more complicated timing attack  
would fool.
