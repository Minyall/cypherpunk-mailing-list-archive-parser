>>Does anyone know the ostensible justification for this?  

Isn't the NCSA government-funded?  If so, they've probably got
less slack in what they can get away with than private citizens;
the NSA's got more leverage over their funding, especially if
"Supercomputer Applications" are often military or civilian-govt.
Not only do they have to worry about ITAR as law, they have to
worry about their continued cash flow.
