A DataHaven is only as good as it's been tested.  You could pay for a
tiger team to attack it, but why bother?  Just take some nudie
pictures of a girl >=18 years old who looks <18 years old, announce
publicly that you have kiddie porn for sale, sit back and let the FBI
test your DH for free.  Be sure to charge enough for your eventual
legal defense...
