I'm not convinced that your last point is true. It appears that the signed
Bobnet-access-number is still just a transferrable ticket. Charlie can
place an order with Bob, forward the Bobnet-access-number to Alice, wait for
Alice & Trent to do the blinding & signing tango, forward the signed Bobnet-
access-number to Bob, and get the goods from Bob.
  
Charlie can't use the signed Bobnet-access-number to prove to Trent
that he's Alice. In fact, since it's unblinded, Charlie can't even prove
that he's linked to a particular validation performed by Trent. (If Alice
foolishly gave him the blinded version too, he could show that he shares
Alice's knowledge about this validation.)

3. is OK as long as Alice trusts Trent. The trick is selecting a Trent
trusted by both Alice and Sam ;)
