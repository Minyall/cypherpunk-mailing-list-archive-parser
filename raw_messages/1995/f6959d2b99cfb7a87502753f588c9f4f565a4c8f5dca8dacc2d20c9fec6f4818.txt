Err...  If software companies were to follow your line of logic, software
boxes (all sorts of software) would become covered with fine print.  As
would ads for the software.  Although I'm sure industry lawyers would
welcome that, personally I think it would be quite sad.

A stupid example:
I can replace copy on your machine so that it does a delete instead.
Does that mean that the OS manufacturer has to warn a user about this?

There's a point at which one has to hand off the assessment to the buyer.

This is my own opinion and also that of anyone who agrees with me.
I'm reading this group because it's very interesting for me personally.
There.
