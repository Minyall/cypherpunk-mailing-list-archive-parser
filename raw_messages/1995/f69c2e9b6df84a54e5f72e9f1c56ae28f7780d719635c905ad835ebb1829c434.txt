	the basis of the seizure is for evidence collection.  then they
    take their sweet time scrounging the disks for evidence.  If no
    evidence is found, they give it back --eventually.  I saw one case go 
    by a couple years back where they were trying to make the computer an
    accessory to the crime (I dunno, maybe it was supposed to auto-dial
    and drop the dime --no that's in 18USC as failure to snitch!)

	of course, if there are drugs involved, they confiscate it as
    spoils of the criminal act and the equipment is impounded and
    eventually sold after conviction for the benefit of their slush funds. 

	I would imagin you have seen plenty of the latter one in the
    Federal attorney's office. this also gets into the issues of private
    cryptography and that _everybody_ should give up privacy protection,
    first amendment rights, etc. so uncle can catch a few dopers, gun 
    runners, and other assorted malcreants [sic] --like the difference 
    between {mis,mal}feasance: in both cases you get fucked, but 'mal' is
    intentional...
