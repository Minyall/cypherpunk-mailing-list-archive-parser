I've been trying to get True Names by Vernor Vinge, and have been told it's
out of print (like most good cypunk ), does anybody have it scanned? 
I realize this is without permission, so does anybody have Vinge's address?
(e-mail or otherwise) or could anybody ask him? Btw, does he have any other
crypto/anonymity related stories? Thanks in advance.
