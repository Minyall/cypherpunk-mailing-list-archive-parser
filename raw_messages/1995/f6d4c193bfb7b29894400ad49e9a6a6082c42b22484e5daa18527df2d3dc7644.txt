That's if you're accusing the merchant of fraud. I'm positing someone's 
using a stolen credit card number.  (Yes, these will still exist for at 
least a while after e-cash becomes commonplace).  If I'm a merchant, I'm 
going to really want (if I know it's possible) to ship only to what's 
been "the address on the card" (or, in reality, in the database under the 
card's number) so that it's harder (not impossible, harder) for people to 
defraud me.

No; you're going to steal from your enemies by having them ship things to 
you without payment.

Note that in an ecash economy, this isn't a problem.  The original post 
was about the transition between the current economy and a "cypherpunks" 
economy, during which I suggested that encryption would be used to 
protect credit card numbers (and be a "proof of identity" -- which I was 
claiming wouldn't work without ecash (proof of non-fraud payment))
