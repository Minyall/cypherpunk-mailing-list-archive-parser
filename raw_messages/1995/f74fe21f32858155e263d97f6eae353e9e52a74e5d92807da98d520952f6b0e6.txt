What I'm waiting to see is who sues RSADSI for recovery of royalties
paid to Cylink. Imagine how Apple, Lotus, and all of the other
bigcorps using RSA must feel right about now: they licensed a patent
from the wrong people, and it appears that RSADSI may have known that
their rights had expired.

What about Roger Schlafly's suit? Anything new on it?
