There are going to be a lot of factions involved with this one. Some
desirable, some not. (I leave it up to the individual to make the
judgment) Maybe we can learn something from the military and apply c3
(Command, Control and Communications) to this. Set up a forum for
coordinating efforts, delegate tasks, most important communicate so we
don't waste resources on redundant efforts. The religious right has
successfully been doing this for years. Perhaps a dose of their own medicine
is in order. Anyone care to create a newsgroup? ;)
