This is unnecessary, since there is no "true" ecash. DigiCash's ecash in
its current form, the only version David Chaum is willing to licenese, is
fully traceable. Popular Cypherpunk's myths nonwithstanding.

First, the recipient of funds is non-anonymous by design. Second, any payer
can trivialy make the recipient of a ecash note known by revealing the
blinding factor. For purposed of lawenforcement, DigiCash's ecash in no
more secure than if the (insert horseman here) billed his fees to a credit
card.
