WHy should airplane crashes be more of a cause for disseminating the 
Surveillance State than Greyhound Bus crashes?

I'd be more sympathetic to arguments about an airline's right to write 
it's contracts as it pleases. Though they are Common Carriers; they can't 
just offer Contracts of Adhesion at will.
