                   FUHRMAN key escrow

   Fuhrman seems to be a Godsend to us. He is helping to destroy the
public's perceived legitimacy of state authority. If things keep moving
the way they are, Fuhrman may join the names: John Crapper, Quisling,
& Hooker. In which case, I propose the term, Fuhrman key escrow, to
substitue for the term, mandatory state key escrow.
