Timing is everything...

I happened to be flipping the channels while on the TV in my hotel room
Friday evening between 8 and 8:30 when I saw someone wearing the UK crypto
shirt on a talk show on French TV3.  I know no French.  A guy was standing
up wearing the shirt, turning around, holding it out for the camera, etc.
Someone sitting down was talking about it to the moderator -- I heard
words like cryptographique a few times.  When the speaker pointed to the
"may be illegal in France" part, the guy took the shirt off and the crowd
laughed.

The segment was about 10 minutes.
