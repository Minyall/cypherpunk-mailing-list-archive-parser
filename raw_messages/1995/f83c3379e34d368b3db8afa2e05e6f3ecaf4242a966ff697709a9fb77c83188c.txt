- From the node of Hal:
: 
: Another interesting quote: "Zimmermann is not in danger of being indicted
: for willfully exporting PGP. Rather, the U.S. attorney's office, here, is
: considering charging him for making PGP available in such a manner that
: it could be exported by a third party."  What the hell is this?  Can
: anyone point to the statute they may be referring to here?  This seems
: awfully broad.
: 

In a related story:
The U.S. attourney's office is also considering charging GM, Ford, and 
Chrysler for making automobiles available in such a manner that people 
could run someone over and leave the scene of the accident.
