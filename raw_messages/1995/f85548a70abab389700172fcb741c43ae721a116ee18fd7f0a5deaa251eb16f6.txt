   Exactly how does this work at your location Eric? Here in Southwestern Bell
   we don't use the D except for call initiation and termination. There is no
   useage tarriff other than this. 

The standard residential tariff here in Pac Bell is flat rate duing
non-business hours and per-minute during them.
