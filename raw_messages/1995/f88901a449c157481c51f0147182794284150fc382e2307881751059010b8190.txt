	Since the size of the net is more than doubling each year,
over half the people online at any given time are newbies.*  It is not
reasonable to expect a newbie to understand IP routing.  Neither IP
routing nor the design of the backbone is intuitively obvious.
Therefore, it is not reasonable to assume that a user in Italy or
Germany has any idea that their packets might travel through the
United States.  

	Nor is it reasonable to assume that a user outside the US is
familiar with the ITARs.  They're an obscure set of regulations, on
the surface contrary to the First Amendment, and not even well known
within the United States.

	I find it hard to believe that given the obscurity of IP
routing, the backbone design, and the obscurity of the ITAR that a
jury would find a foreign person guilty of unknowingly violations of
the ITAR.  Any comment on this line of reasoning from our lawyer
friends?
