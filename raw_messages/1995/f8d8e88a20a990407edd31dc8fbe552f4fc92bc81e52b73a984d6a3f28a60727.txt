Here's an important bit. "Transmits or otherwise makes available" is 
different from the earlier law. It DOES pleace a burden of responsibility 
upon the provider of service. NOTE that unlike other portions of the law, 
boths old and new versions, this part DOES NOT include the word 
"knowingly". Crucial, crucial point.

No anonymous annoying! Does this mean we can't raid IRC channels anymore? 
Or flame people from anon.petit.fi (sp?) accounts?
