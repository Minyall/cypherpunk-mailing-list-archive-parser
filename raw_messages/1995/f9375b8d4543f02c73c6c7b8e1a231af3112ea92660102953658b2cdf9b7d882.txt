Hi,

	A number of people have been proposing hacks on commercial payment 
systems. Could I point out that this is not necessarily a good idea? One vendor 
I spoke to has a contract clause with sublicensees which requires a legal 
response in such situations. His opinion was that attempting such a crack on a 
"live" system consitituted conspiracy to commit fraud and organisation of the 
same could involve RICO penalties.

	It would seem prudent to approach such projects with a little caution. 
If a request were made for a sample of material to work on most companies would 
oblige and a refusal would provide protection against legal tactics. Most 
sensible companies would see the advantage of offering a reward.
