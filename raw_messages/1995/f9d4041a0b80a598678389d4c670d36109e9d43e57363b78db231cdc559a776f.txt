   why would you give the haven owner free run?  I mean naturally he does 
   have free run with your data once he gets it, 

That's exactly the reason, namely, to make the agreement between
individuals match the underlying nature of information.  This is
different in the trust in silence about the user.  This is also not to
say that the operator can't undertake to make assurances about where
bits go and don't go.

   I am sure you 
   woudln't want your data stored ona  public access Unix system, or in 
   plaintext.

So don't store it in plaintext.  The operator of the data storage
facility has no responsibility for this.

   if the datahaven is turned into a data broker

I don't know about you, but I don't like paying money for random bits.

   well what would be thepurpose of this data haven you propose except as a 
   extra storage pace for data, like if you dont have space on your own 
   drive?

Even when you've got enough of your own disk space, it's still subject
to failure.  Putting data in multiple places reduces the possibility
of unrecoverable catastrophe.
