Well, it clearly can't be done over the internet.   But it's really just a
matter of putting a "place" field within the signature, in addition to the
"time" one.   And you'd have to trust the "stamper" to only stamp stuff as
"Cleveland" that he had a way of knowing was in Cleveland. It's really up
to him to figure out a way of verifying that. Maybe American Express
offices will start place/time stamping, and you have to physically go to
the AE office in Cleveland OH where someone takes your file and place/time
stamps it.
It's not as elegant as time stamping, because you really need face-to-face
contact. And you need to trust the stamper not to lie about his location (I
can't remember how much you need to trust a time-stamper, but I think it's
less).
