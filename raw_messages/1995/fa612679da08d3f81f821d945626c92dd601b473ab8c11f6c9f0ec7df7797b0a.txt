Um..  You can't give people copies of something and then destroy all 
copies of that thing unless you can trust those people to destroy
*their* copies of it on your request.  If you *can* trust them to do
this, then the ratings-system solution I mentioned a minute ago will
work.  Just ask everyone to set their useragents to "delete" when they
encounter a "deleted, signed The Boss" mark on an article.
