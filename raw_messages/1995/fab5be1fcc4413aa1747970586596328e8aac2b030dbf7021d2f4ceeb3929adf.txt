  I have not been "assigned duty" on this list.  I'm here of my
own free will.  I want to keep up on whats going on in the
cypherpunk world, and sometimes tap the expertise of the list.
I'm not some corporate flack assigned here to "feed the chimps".
My personal feelings definitely lean toward unimpeded strong
crypto, personal privacy, freedom from govt. surveilence, etc.,
and I was interested in this stuff at a personal level before
joining netscape, or working on security stuff.
