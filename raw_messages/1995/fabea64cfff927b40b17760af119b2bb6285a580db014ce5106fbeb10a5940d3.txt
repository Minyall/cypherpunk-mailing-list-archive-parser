I'd have to agree with you (Ray) completely about the need for
standards for the voice internet communications software.  I 
think it would be best to draw up a standard and disseminate
it rather than wait for one to emerge out of a product.  If 
a standard is designed, it could be designed with portability
and extensions in mind, whereas if something like InternetPhone
became a de-facto standard, it would probably be more 
difficult to add upon and port to alternate platforms.
