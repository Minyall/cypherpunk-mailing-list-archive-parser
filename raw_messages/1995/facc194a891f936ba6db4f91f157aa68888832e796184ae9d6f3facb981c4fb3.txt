I just picked up a copy of "Cyberspace and the Law" -- when I'm
through with it, I'll post a review. It looks to be a nice, broad
survey, but it looks suspiciously thin for a book on law :-)

While I'm posting, have I missed any good rants from folks who've had
a crack at the DigiCash beta test? I had a few criticisms of the end
result, but I'd rather not introduce further redundancy.
