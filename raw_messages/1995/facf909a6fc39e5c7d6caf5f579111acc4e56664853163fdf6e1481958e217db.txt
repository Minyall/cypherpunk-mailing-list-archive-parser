The US Libertarian Party Platform supports crypto, and the LP has issued
press releases critical of the FBI Telecom (wiretapping) Bill and Clipper. 
The LP was also part of the coalition against internet censorship this
year. 

The LP is the third largest political party in the US, and party members
hold over 150 elected and appointed public offices in the U.S.  They will
again have a presidential candidate on the ballot in all 50 states next
year as they did in the last election, and a potential LP presidential
candidate (Harry Browne, http://www.rahul.net/browne) will be in the
CityVote debates which will be nationally televised next month.  The LP
was also the first party to have a female candidate who won an Electoral
College vote.  For more details on the LP, you should go to
