"Me too," except the numbers are higher.

I would think that you would worry more about your users getting a false
sense of security from storing secret keys on a large multiuser system
than about being held liable for naughty PGP-encrypted traffic. I don't 
see how you could be held liable anyway. How is PGP that much different 
from allowing your users to set a password on their account? It makes it 
harder for root to invade their privacy, but in general, we have very 
stringent requirements that must be satisfied before we'll read user 
directories or mail.
