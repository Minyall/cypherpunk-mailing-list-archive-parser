While any foreign account is of course better than any home country
account, Sweden is not really a place that I would like to keep
my money.  High taxes, rigid controls, intrusive and unpredictable
government, and, most importantly, the country has repeatedly 
teetered on the edge of bankruptcy.

I would wait for some more solvent foreign country to get into digicash.

More to the point -- few people will accept or spend digicash 
unless those unreasonable charges come right down.
