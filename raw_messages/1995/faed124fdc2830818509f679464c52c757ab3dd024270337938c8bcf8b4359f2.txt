   Time magazine of Augst 21 has a breathless cover story on
   cyber war, infowar and farside warriors, with a piece on a
   Rocky Horror Rand war game. Someone who knows the URL for
   Time articles may want to wave it.

   Or, for squeamish ossifragers who do not want to be IDed at 
the
   Time stakeout:


   TYM_eup (about 36kb in 2 parts)
