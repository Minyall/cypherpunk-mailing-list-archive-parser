GNU code sounds like it would fit the royalty free bill.

Try the GNU multi-precision library: gmp-1.3.2.tar.gz from all good
GNU sources.  I get my stuff from ftp://src.doc.ic.ac.uk/gnu/ if you
don't have a GNU ftp site to hand.

There's a function

	int mpz_probab_prime_p(mpnum, SURETY)

which returns true if the prime passes SURETY probablistic prime tests.

I think if it passes say 25 tests, then there will be less than a
1/2^25 chance that it is not prime.

Also, on:

	http://dcs.ex.ac.uk/~aba/rsa-keygen.html

I've got some code Aggelos Keromitis <kermit@forthnet.gr> wrote using
the GNU mp library for generating RSA keys, it uses the probab_prime
function, like this:

        while (!mpz_probab_prime_p(&p, 25))     /* Find a prime */
          mpz_add_ui(&p, &p, 1);

Where p is a random starting point.  Ie just add one and repeat.  It
would be faster to check for some more obvious things like even nos,
etc.  But it seems to work well enough, and generates working RSA
keys.
