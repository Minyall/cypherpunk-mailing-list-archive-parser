I too thought it was a spoof initally. Hell, what Senator would be dumb 
enough to name a bill this way if it was real. If I were trying to pass a 
bill of this nature, it would be double-speak all of the way. But alas it 
is true...And I thought the DT bill was bad. 

Both of my congresscritters have been faxed and queried as to their 
position. I'll inform the group when they fax me back. I would urge 
others to do this. This will be unbelievably bad if we loose this one. 
The ramifications on this bill are still hammering me in the head.
