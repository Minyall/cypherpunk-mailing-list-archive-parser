I recall that anon.penet.fi can be used by those whose mailers don't allow
them to add new headers -- the extra headers can be placed in at the top
of the body and it'll recognize them.  Likewise cypherpunk remailers let
you add headers with ##. I've taught at least one extremely "non-technical"
user to use the cypherpunks remailers successfully.

My question was "why". I think I see the answer now.  Thank you.

Happy New Year!
