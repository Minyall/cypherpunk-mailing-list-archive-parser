Okay. Here's my 2-bits.
I run on the MacOS, but how hard could it be to port this code? If anyone
is willing to do this (I assume it's not written in Pascal, which is my
only language of any consequence), I will run it. It will be available from
now until I graduate in '98 during the school months. If anyone wants to
try this from scratch, we could try it in Pascal. I would be very willing
to do the developing as well as host a discussion list for anyone who jumps
in.
I will take no responce to mean that all options are not going to be
pursued, and that this discussion is just that, a discussion.
