Hello,

Thank you for emailing NetManage Technical Support. WebSurfer 4.6 was
designed to work on Winsock 1.1 compliant systems. Since you are
running Winsock version 2.0 this may be the reason for the
application not working. We will report this to Engineering so
hopefully in a future release WebSurfer might be able to support
this new Winsock version.

Thank you for considering Chameleon WebSurfer,

won't start on my pentium 100 w/ 20Mb running qemm 7.04, windows 3.11, 
winsock 2.0 rev B on a novell 3.x LAN.

Netscape runs fine.

This might help:
