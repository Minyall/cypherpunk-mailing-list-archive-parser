The Fifth protects you against *compelled* self-incrimination - in
particular, the right to be free from the "cruel trilemma" of

        o       conviction of a substantive crime, based on your
                (true) testimony
        o       conviction of perjury, for lying when asked to incriminate
                yourself
        o       contempt of court sanctions, for refusing to answer

but your hypo doesn't seem to create that forbidden situation. In
particular, you're free to simply not send the message at all.

will return when the Unix box is net-functional again.)
