Beyond having the willies.. This is more than just scary, it feels like
rape when you think about it for awhile. Everything you buy, on credit, is
recorded and sold to someone who wants to know your secrets. Everytime 
you make a banking transaction, someone is watching and compiling the 
data. 

Is there any legal recourse to get your name removed from the sellable list?
Or is it too late and we can not save even the vestiges of our privacy?

Oh, but if only I had the 'hacker' skill to break into such a database..
I have always been against the destruction of data.. but there are 
exceptions...
