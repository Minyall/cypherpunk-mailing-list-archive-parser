Sorry for the brain fart.  I've been up without sleep for a very long
time...  Ever since I attempted to attend the Austin CP meeting which
didn't take place, then I was in Dallas most of yesterday and last night.

I am running on nicotine, caphine, and....  Its *Dr. Dobbs 
Journal.*  Appologies to the publishers and for those who are sending
me corrections...
