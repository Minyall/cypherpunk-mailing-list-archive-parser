The PGP sources build on most UNIX platforms.  Have you read the
setup.doc?  Have you followed the instructions?  What Unix platform
are you using?  In general, all you need to do is:
	1) build rsaref:
		cd rsaref/install/unix; make
	2) build pgp:
		cd src; make <platform>

Modulo a few quirks, that should be all.  Look at the PGP FAQ,
Buglist, Fixes, and Improvements Page for a list of known bugs+fixes
in PGP 2.6.2:

If you need more help, email me offline (i.e., do not cc: cypherpunks)
