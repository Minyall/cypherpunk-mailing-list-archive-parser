Brian:

    	There is no way Cohen can send the police to confiscate toad.com, or
    any other computer without some form of criminal complaint --other 
    than by himself as citizen whistle-blower.

	I read the situation as Cohen was planning to attempt to make the
    actions a _criminal_ conspiracy. _If_ Cohen was successful in
    convincing either a state or Federal DA to seek a grand jury
    indictment, then the local police or the federal marshalls could be
    issued a search warrant to collect evidence. 

	I can see Cohen trying to present his case before the Federal 
    bench! In fact, I might be willing to pay admission.  Cohen lives in
    Hudson OH which is also the location of jis private <all.net>. Hudson
    is in Summit County and Akron (the county seat) has a branch court of
    the 4th Federal District (or used to).

	In West Virginia hill towns they teach the 3Rs: reading, 'riting,
    and the route to Akron, which is referred to as the capital of West
    Virignia. I can see the tremendous empathy of these people for Cohen's
    cause. <g>

	As I mention above, getting a DA's attention on questionable
    slander, is a bit far-fetched!  Tactically, I would think Cohen would
    find it necessary to actually win a civil suit which clearly indicated
    there was not only slander, but there was a malicious conspiracy to
    discredit Cohen. 

	Until Cohen actually manages to score a civil victory, I believe
    he is dead in the water. 

	Cohen should probably include me in his action --my idea of 
    discrediting Dr. Fred was putting him in procmailrc. Dr. Frederick B. 
    Cohen became Fred Cohen so part of this thread (missing anything from
    all.net) bled through.  No more, so I will not even see any of the 
    falderol if Fred*Cohen is anywhere in the text.
