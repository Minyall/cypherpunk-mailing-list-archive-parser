The problem with a _free_ remailer is obvious -- like many
other Internet resources, it can suffer from the tragedy of
the commons. 

Even a negligible fee would do much to prevent gross remailer
abuse. It may not be feasible to make remailers in to an
industry, but this isn't the point -- it will keep the utterly
lame from using it for pranks and their ilk.
