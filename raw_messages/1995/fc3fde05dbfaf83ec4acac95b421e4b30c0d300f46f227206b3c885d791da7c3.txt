There is a patent by someone (I think it was IBM) on how to pack RSA
keys in small space.  I think they were putting them on the magnetic
strips that you have behind every card.  I'm afraid I don't have the
patent number saved, but I have seen the patent document myself at the
patent office.  No, I'm afraid I don't remember how they encoded it.

Using that method (or something similar), you could probably encode
the keys into acceptably short strings with S/KEY-style encoding.
