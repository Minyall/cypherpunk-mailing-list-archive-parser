If anybody ever actually uses the cypherpunks archives via NNTP on hks.net,
please let me know immediately (we don't log).  I'm probably going to be
putting a reasonable expire time on the group and archive the articles at
expire time: if people use it, I can set up a "cypherpunks archive group"
for NNTP access.

This won't affect folks who use the NNTP access to read cypherpunks
normally: I'll probably set the expire time to something like a month.
