How about if you control the operating system and everything, is
it then possible to demonstrate that you don't have other copies?
(Ie escrow agent is able to prove to customer that info destroyed.)

Presumably this would be based on QM, EPR 'paradox' or something like that.
I've read about something called "Quantum Eraser", but I don't know
whether that could be used to store useful info (the vague description
was from an "isn't time weird" viewpoint and erased boring stuff).

Anybody better in QM?

However, I don't think that you'll be able to provide "only one copy",
because once that copy is received and read once the recipient can
recreate it.


Hope I'm making sense...
