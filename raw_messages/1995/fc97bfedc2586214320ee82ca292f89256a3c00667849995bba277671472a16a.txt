I think we've discovered another potential nasty.
I accidentally sent out the SECRET key not the
public key. I believe the problem you suffered was
because it added it to secring not pubring.

No I'm not going to make the passphrase public. I
apologise for any inconvenience to people who
added this to their secring.pgp, it was certainly
not intentional on my part to do this to people.
You should probably delete it.
