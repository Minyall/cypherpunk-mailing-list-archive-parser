I don't think any of us disagree with that. I think what we disagree about is 
getting Netscape to accept our revenue. :-) I've tried calling and emailing to 
buy a copy of Linux, and the answer was always, "It's not available for 
Linux." Despite what's on their FTP server.

I mostly want the stronger crypto in the US only version, but Netscape has 
said they are trying to make that available for FTP, so I can wait. I also 
want Java, but no one has that yet, and they 2.0 will probably be available 
for Linux, so I can wait for that too.
