Not so.  VeriSign can only vouch for identity, not intention.  I can fork
out $300 (at last count) and get a signed certificate for my fake company.
 If the stakes are high enough, I can incorporate fairly cheaply, get a
business license, and then I'd have a real company I could submit as.

Or, if I'm lazy, don't have enough money, or unwilling to leave a paper
trail, I'd break into someone's weakly secured server and steal their
certificate.

In either case, I've obtained a "legitimate" signed certificate for
illegitimate purposes.  That's why I don't think just verifying the
signature on the certificate is nearly enough.
