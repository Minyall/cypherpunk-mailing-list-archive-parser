"I agree" that shrinkwrapped licenses are problematic, at best.  I don't 
think the analogy applies, though.  Maybe I'm mixing threads up, but I 
thought the topic was "Why would anyone agree to escrow keys commercially 
-- given the high risk if the keys get out?"

If that is the topic, then the keys would be escrowed by one of two 
parties:  the software developer or the customer.  If the customer does 
it, through an active act on his part, then no problem -- he's expressly 
consented (not a "shrinkwrap license" problem in my view if he send them 
his key ...).

If the software developer gives the key to the C/GAK escrow agent, then 
all that should be necessary is to warn the consumer that there is a 
backdoor through the escrowed key.  Then the consumer can buy the product 
or not, but knows what he is getting so can make a choice.

As long as the escrow aspect is not hidden, I don't see any fraud.  The 
remedy is the marketplace.  It is a long fall from $5,000,000,000 ...

Not a lawyer on the Net, although I play one in real life.
