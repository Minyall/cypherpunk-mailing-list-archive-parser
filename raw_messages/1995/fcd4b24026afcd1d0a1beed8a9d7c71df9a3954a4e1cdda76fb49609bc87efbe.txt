Since you are using Micro$oft Network, you must pay the extra 10% fee to
Bill Gates or he won't give you access to use the remailer.

Just kidding.  But seriously, if online time is so expensive that you don't
feel you can do a simple lycos.com search for "remailer", then you really
need to find a cheaper Internet service provider.

That said, point your web browser at the following:

http://www.stack.urc.tue.nl/~galactus/remailers/
http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~raph/remailer-list.html
http://www.well.com/user/abacard/remail.html
http://electron.rutgers.edu/~gambino/anon_servers/anon.html

And learn to use Lycos. :)
