	I am curious on whether there are any applications of the directed
Hamiltonian path problem to cryptography, zero-knowledge proofs, etcetera. My
reaosn for asking is that I've come across something in my field (molecular
genetics) that can be used to solve such problems in a couple of weeks or so.
