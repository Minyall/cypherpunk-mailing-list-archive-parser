(Add to the list of things to do: make a recurring post describing cpunk
 services available at various places, incl. c2.org, ftp.csua.berkeley.edu,
 hks.net, Tim's Cyphernomicon, etc.

 Anybody else willing to put the whole burrito together, or should I add it
 to my TODO list?)

Somebody asked where the cypherpunks archives are.  Recent traffic is 
available via nntp from news://nntp.hks.net/hks.lists.cypherpunks;  Traffic
older than that, back to June 94 at
news://nntp.hks.net/hks.lists.cypherpunks-archive, and back to the beginning
of the list from

    ftp://ftp.hks.net/cypherpunks/All/cypherpunks.archive.[0-3].gz

The archives are extrememly difficult to navigate through right now, but
the raw material is there and available.  One of these days I will finish
the harvest and/or hypermail installation to facilitate access.
