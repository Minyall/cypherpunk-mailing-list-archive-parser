This depends on location.  The Feds require that banks use the same ID to
open an account that they would require to cash a check.  The banks on the
Left and Right Coasts are fairly restrictive (more restrictive than they
have to be).  Banks in the Heartland (particularly the Intermountain West)
are much easier.

With a little work, it is still possible to open accounts with "soft" ID in
the more relaxed regions.  Since these banks are accessible by ATM and Fedex
and will soon be on the net (in some cases), they can be convenient to use.
Likewise Canadian banks (which routinely offer US$ accounts).  In the soft
ID category, I place Employment ID and Student ID which you are free to make
yourselves as well as the new secured credit cards; some of which can be
obtained in spite of one's lack of existence.  The latter make very good ID.

This will be the most interesting story of the next few years.  I will be
anxious to see if the new ease of "switching" money reverses the trend
toward decreased financial privacy caused by the war on money laundering.
