Just heard on the radio "How child pornographers are using the 'Net to 
turn your home computer into their playground and why you can't do 
anything because of lax and permissive legislation."

All this over some very discordany chords to make it seeem more ominous.  
Gotta love the evening news here in CT.

From the same people that had a feature of 'MArtial arts weapons as 
weapons of mass destruction and how easy they are to get.'  I wonder if 
the producer is a closet facist or a ratings freak.
