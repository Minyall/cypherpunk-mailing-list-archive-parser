Anything more specific on the above info? 

  robo, syrinx, c2 all running on c2.org
  alumni, portal run by Hal Finney
  hacktic, replay run on xs4all / by Alex de Joode?

ok so far, but flame is xs4all/de Joode as well?

flame used to be:

  Slovenian Anonymous Remailer <remailer@flame.sinet.org>

Does the fact that it is now listed along with hacktic and replay now
imply that it is no longer / never was in Slovenia?

The reason for asking is that jurisdictions are interesting properties
for remailers.  The more jurisdictions available the better the legal
morass can be created by remailing through 101 different jurisdictions.

Speaking of which, these new additions:

  ford <remailer@bi-node.zerberus.de>
  ecafe <cpunk@remail.ecafe.org>

are welcome aditions both being in Europe (Germany, and UK respectively)

Any other European/Australasian cypherpunks care to add a remailer in
their jurisdiction?

                                  ...just another one of those...
