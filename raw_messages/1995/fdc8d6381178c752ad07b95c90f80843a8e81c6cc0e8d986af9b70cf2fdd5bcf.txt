One of the most interesting things SAIC does is run places that
monitor seismic events.  S.E.'s, by the way, are things that might be
earthquakes but could be A-bomb tests.

SAIC ran the Center for Seismic Studies in Arlington, VA.  Rick Adams,
co-founder of UUnet, made one of their machines, seismo, the UUCP hub of the
world for a couple of years.
