I've never seen something transformed so.  Talk about munging characters.
 
I'm suprised there are no control characters in this.
 
Whats was meant:
 
"I'm from the NSA, I'm here to help your crypto."  
 
"You have no where else to go!"  (as said by a seven foot robot cop in
black leather).

(and it wasn't even over a MODEM)
