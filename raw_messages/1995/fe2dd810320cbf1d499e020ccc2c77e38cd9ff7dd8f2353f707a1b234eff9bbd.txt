  Good question. My guess is, Netscape doesn't do any processing on the
mailto: hyperlink at all, but merely passes it to a real mail delivery
agent like Sendmail (or it uses MAPI under Win'95). Which begs
the question, if Netscape is executing an external delivery agent,
there may be the possiblity of sneaking an attack in there and getting
the shell to execute something.

Hmm, let me try something.


WOW!! Unbelievable! Stop the presses! I Can't believe no one ever discovered
this before! Try a page with the following URL

 test 

Muahaha! Yet another security hole! Clicking on this mailto brings up
an xterm on my machine!  Simply change the xterm& to "rm -rf /" and
bingo!


Sheesh. I better stop before I am on Netscape's most hated list.
