1. What kind of pseudo random number generator does Netscape use?

2. If it is a cryptographically secure sequence, doesn't that run up
against ITAR restrictions?

3. Can we improve upon the brute force algorithm in a non-probabilistic way?

4. If we are happy with a 5% yield, we can restrict ourselves to the same
5% of the key space for each message.
