Hi All -

Last week our team published jointly with Visa the STT specification.  
Since then, we've received some comments that the wire formats and 
protocols section for STT have not been complete enough for developers 
to implement.

We're very interested in feedback and specifics on this.  We worked to 
keep _only_ the detail we felt required to implement STT -- the 
language is intentionally terse.  However, it is in everyone's best 
interest that the STT spec is completely understood and implementable.

We want your participation in this.  We've set up an alias direct to 
our team to respond to your comments:

Non-technical flames direct to:
