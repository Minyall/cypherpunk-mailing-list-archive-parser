I have updated my survey of cryptography regulations worldwide. It is 
available at URL

http://www.kub.nl:2080/FRW/CRI/projects/bjk/lawsurvy.htm

Please set pointers to this URL rather than copy the file, as I 
intend to regularly (i.e., about once every two months) update the 
survey. 

I greatly appreciate comments, corrections, and additional 
information.
