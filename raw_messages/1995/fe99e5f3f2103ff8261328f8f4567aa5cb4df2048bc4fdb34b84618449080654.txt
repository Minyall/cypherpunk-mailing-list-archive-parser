My problem is not that people will bitch about my DH.  My problem will
be arfholes or yellow journalists uploading K*dd*e p**n to my DH, then
making a long report how I cater to p*dofiles and other evil denezins
that pop from time to time.  Then, I get the police knocking at my
door, asking me to come to Club Fed for a looooonnnggg vacation.

Of course, the DH will be hidden by a good remailer (anon.penet.fi), but
it is trivial to use traffic analysis to find where the DH lies.  Just
monitor traffic from/to the remailer and do a series of store/retrives.
Then for confirmation, forge a mail from the dh site to the remailer with
the password (obtained from sniffing) to yourself.

This is the main reason I haven't worked on this code for so long, as
well as finals and other distractions.  Until I find a decent solution
to this problem (The alpha test will be a snap... just allow certain
people to send/get and ban all others, but once in full working mode
this ceases to be a solution.) I am hesitant on setting up a working
DH.
