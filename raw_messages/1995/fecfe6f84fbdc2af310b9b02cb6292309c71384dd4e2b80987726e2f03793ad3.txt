If I am out of place for posting here, forgive me; however, I do believe 
this germane.  Compass Bank here in Alabama is joining twenty other banks 
around the country to offer dial-in banking via Quicken's new software 
release.  Does anyone know or have heard of the security mechanisms which 
are to be built in to this product, specifically authent and encryption?
