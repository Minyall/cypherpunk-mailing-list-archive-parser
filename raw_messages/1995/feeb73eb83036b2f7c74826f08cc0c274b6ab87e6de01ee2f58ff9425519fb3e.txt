in response to the recent barrage of nonsensical bullshit here, I was 
wondering if anyone knew the archive site or procmail, the mail filtering 
program? I think this is a good time to school everyone in the basics of 
Killfiles.  I have never wanted to killfile a person before, this is a 
big step for me. 8)
