- From the node of Vladimir Z. Nuri:
: 
: Vernon Hills, IL.
: 
: Vernon Hills, Illinois, a Chicago suburb, has passed legislation allowing 
: citizens to check out radar guns from the local police department to 
: catch speeders in their community. The radar guns are combined with 
: cameras in order to instantaneously capture the car, license number, and the 
: rate of speed. The citizens can check out the units for a week at a time. The 
: police have stated that they, at this time, will use the data to issue 
: warning letters to the violaters.
: 

Got a neighbor you don't like?  Rent one of these here radar guns and
get a set of tuning forks.  Set up the unit to catch your target, and then
just hold a tuning fork up in front of the unit (but out of range of the 
mounted camera).

PS -- Didn't traffic cops have one of the highest rates of testicular
cancer by occupation due to the widespread habit of resting radar guns in
their laps without switching them off?
