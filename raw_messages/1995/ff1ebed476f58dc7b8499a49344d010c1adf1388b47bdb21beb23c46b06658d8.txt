Hello again cypherpunks:

Sorry to continue "beating a dead horse" here, but I forwarded a few
C-punks' messages regarding the Elementrix "Power One-Time Pad" to
this person, and I thought you might be interested in her (somewhat
cryptic <g>) response.

Forwarded message follows:

So, I guess we know what they *aren't*, but not what they *are*...Is
this the first example (in modern history) of encryption that's *not*
done by using an encryption algorithm, or am I just missing something?
