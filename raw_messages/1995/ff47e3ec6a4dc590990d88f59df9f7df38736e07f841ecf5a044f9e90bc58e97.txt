My feelings exactly.

Are we going to fall prey to the medias asault on porno and resort to 
self-censorship?  If a data haven resorted to filtering out all gifs and 
jpegs, or even porno, then it wouldn't be one I wouldn't use it, for my 
porn, nor for my other data.  If it is going to be a datahaven it can;t 
fall to such things as filtering data for controversial subject the owner 
doesn't like.
