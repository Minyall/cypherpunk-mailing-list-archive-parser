Perry.  Normally I try my best to ignore you.

But I will simply repeat, I have never signed a post, and have no 
intention of beginning to sign any posts, until I establish a secure 
machine in a secure complex that is dedicated to that purpose.

I like to think that I take my security somewhat seriously.

And I would ask whoever DID post the PGP key under my name, to please
issue a revocation certificate.
