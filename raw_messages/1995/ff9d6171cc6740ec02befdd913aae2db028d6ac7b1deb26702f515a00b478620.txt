    You've obviously never attempted to get a Windows product working for 
someone whose previous experience with a computer is limited to "Solitaire".

    I've done work with this ISP, and I can tell you it's nearly the most 
frustrating experience I've had in my life -- Windows has bizzare 
conflicts with software eating other software, ports getting set up 
wrong, and just general nastiness.  Even the slickest software needs 
helpline time - for whatever reason.
