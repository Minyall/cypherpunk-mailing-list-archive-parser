And I can't :)

That's more of what I was looking for.  I suppose that (I'm still using
PGP as my example) there could be a shared PGP key, signed by Helen and
myself, where only the two of us know the passphrase, with a keyid of
"David Smith <dsmith@midwest.net> on behalf of Helen Jones <helen@devnull.org>"
or something similar.  The obvious problem is that in sharing the pass
phrase the security is weakened.  (Paranoid threat model: at some point
we have to decide on the pass phrase, and we are videotaped/bugged/spied
upon while this takes place.)
