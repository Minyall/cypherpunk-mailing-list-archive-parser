As a start on a Web page, here are some things I thought of. What else? What
are the initials of some of the world's intelligence groups (CIA, NSA, KGB,
DGI, MI5(?), ???)

1> Antennas - more than TV/Ham/CB/Satellite (or 'unusually' shaped antennas).
2> No, or *very* few, visitors (esp. kids)
3> Visitors are seldom the same, or almost always the same.
4> Doesn't talk about job/company.
5> Activity at 'unusual' times.
6> Not very 'sociable' (keep to themselves).

Or, tell me to forget it, it doesn't belong here.... :-/
