Umm, I dont know.  How is MIT PGP flawed?  Besides a few known bugs,
of course.  There shouldn't be much difference, code-wise, between the
MIT version and the International version.  The major difference is
that MIT PGP has a license to use RSAREF which makes it legal to use
w.r.t. patent issues in the US.

AFAIK, there are no versions of PGP which do not use RSA.  They
all do.  The only difference is that MIT PGP uses RSAREF, whereas
the International versions use a non-licensed version of RSA.
