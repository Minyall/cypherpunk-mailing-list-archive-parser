Developing these things is actually eaiser to do in UNIX than 
Windows.

I guess it depends on where you wish to being.  Do you wish to write 
a remailer from scratch, or do you wish to just run a remailer?

In either case, take a look at what other people have done, one site 
I like is ftp.hacktic.nl, there is source for a number of remailers 
there, among other things.

You could compile that, and see what you like and dislike about a 
given remailer, and then adjust the code appropriatly.

Most are written in C, so if you know C, you won't have very many 
problems.

One thing to note, UNIX privilages, you would want to run your 
remailer as a deamon, a constantly running program(similar to a  DOS TSR 
or NT Service). I am not sure if your ISP gives you enough access to 
run deamons.

Good Luck
