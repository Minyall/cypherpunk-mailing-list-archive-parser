Heh... it gets better.  I very foolishly sent off
for more info; among their requirements: you pay $5
a month for the service; you can't receive mail, only
send it (which anyone can spoof for free!); you can't
send to anyone in the domain of *.whitehouse.gov.

Would somebody please just mailbomb or spam
these hosers into oblivion, please?
