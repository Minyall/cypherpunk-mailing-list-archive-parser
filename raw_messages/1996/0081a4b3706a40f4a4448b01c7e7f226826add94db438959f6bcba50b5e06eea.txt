     GOVERNMENTS MOVE TO LIMIT FREE FLOW OF THE INTERNET

             (Feb 2, 1996 00:17 a.m. EST) 

                       reports: 
 
 
    ...the Internet is slowly being colonized. 
 
 
  Colonized? 
 
    Governments around the world -- from Germany to Iran to 
    Singapore -- are moving to limit Internet access for their 
    citizens.... 
 
 
  Oh I see.  Colonized by parasites. 
 
    This move to cordon off the Internet into private plots -- 
    some call it digital Balkanization -- is seen by experts as 
    one of the most profound changes since the global network 
    emerged as a commercial medium in 1991. 
 
 
  S-s-h-h.  The experts speak! 
 
    Many Internet specialists say it marks the shift...to [a 
    "network"] where users are building nation states, an evo- 
    lution that they say will lead to the Internet's ultimate 
    success as a commercial and communication platform. 
 
 
  S-s-h-h!  The specialists have spoken. 
 
 
    Earlier this week, Federico Mayor, the director of UNESCO, 
    an arm of the United Nations, called for the drafting of a 
    global agreement that would help protect rights in cyber- 
    space. 
 
 
  Mais oui. 
 
 
  Cordially, 
 
  Jim
