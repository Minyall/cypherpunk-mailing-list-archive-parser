   6-23-96. WaPo Mag cover story: 
 
   "Secret Intrusions" 
 
      Government surveillance, terrorism and the U.S. 
      Constitution: The story of a Washington Courtroom no 
      tourist can visit. 
 
      Last year, a secret court in the Justice Department 
      authorized a record 697 'national security' wiretaps on 
      American soil, outside normal constitutional procedures. 
      Is the world growing more dangerous -- or has Big 
      Brother found a way around the Foruth amendment. 
 
   A revealing report on burgeoning FISA wiretap intrusions, 
   featuring FBI, NSA, CIA, Freeh, Kallstrom, Gorelick and 
   little-known Mary Lawton who, before her death, guaranteed 
   the incorruptibility of FISA: "In the modern age of 
   intelligence gathering and federal law enforcement, no one 
   was more important to the management of the most critical 
   legal issues binding the two communities." And what has 
   happened without her "gold standard of legality in the 
   world of counterintelligence." 
 
   A wideawake eye-opener to General Reno's sweetsong lullaby  
   at the Commonwealth Club. 
 
   Taken from a book due out next month: "Main Justice," by 
   Jim McGee and Brian Duffy.
