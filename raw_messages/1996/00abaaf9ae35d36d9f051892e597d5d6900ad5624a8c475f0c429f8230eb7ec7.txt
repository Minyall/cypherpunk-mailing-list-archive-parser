Simple. Incentivize sites/server/payment system manufacturers to require 
certs from their users. This is already underway. See SET. Then make sure 
that the certs/keys are GAK'ed. Yes, I know there is a difference between 
certs and keys. Joe User doesn't. Neither does the media. It is a two step 
process.

Those of us that won't have "reformed", have been shot, or imprisoned, 
will indeed be on the posters in the Post Office. And the banners on all 
major websites.
