	Niether Schneier nor Garfinkel really talk about analysis.
The only book I can think of is Biham's "Cryptanalysis of the DES,"
and thats on a single technique.

	I don't know of any books on 'applied cryptanalysis.'  The
public knowledge is all in the heads of a few practitioners, and the
papers they've written.

	While classical cryptanalysis is not likely to be useful,
traditional cryptanalysis hasn't changed much.  Stealing keys, bribing
people, getting physical access to systems is still far more useful
than trying to brute force a key.
