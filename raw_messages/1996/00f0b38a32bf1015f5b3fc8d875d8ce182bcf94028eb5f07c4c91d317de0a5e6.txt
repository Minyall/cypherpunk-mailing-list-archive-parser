	Notice the use of the word "Collapsing" it was used to refer to a
quick removal of rule/authority.
	I am no proponet of today's system, but no reasonable replacement
has been suggested. Yours included. The problem I have with your system is
basically the same problem I have with todays. Tyranny of the masses and a
system where emotion can be drummed up to kill an idea (or person) where
reason _should_ prevail.

	In the situation where a small group of people do something to
throw the system into chaos, the rules that stop the minority from running
amuck are no longer in place. In that situation, people get scared. Fear
is condusive to rational thinking. When fear takes over people tend to
react emotionally/instinctively. This would (I think, I haven't done the
research to back this up) tend to cause people to back someone who
promises a return to the previous stability (look at Russia).
