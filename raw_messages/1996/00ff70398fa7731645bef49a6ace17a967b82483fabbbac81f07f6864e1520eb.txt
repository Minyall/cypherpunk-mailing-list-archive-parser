   "As privacy grows scarcer on the Internet, people finally 
   start to take notice." Denise Caruso column. 
 
      Tomorrow, the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of 
      Consumer Protection is sponsoring a public workshop in 
      Washington called "Consumer Privacy on the Global 
      Information Infrastructure." The F.T.C.'s intention is 
      to find out how much consumers and the industry really 
      know about critical privacy issues created by what it 
      calls "the emerging on-line marketplace," and to look at 
      various ways to protect personal data. 
 
      Privacy on data networks is a complex issue. It includes 
      thorny questions about anonymity -- who should be 
      allowed to be anonymous in network interactions, and 
      under what circumstances -- and the red-hot debate over 
      digital encryption, which can protect private 
      communication and transactions from all prying eyes, 
      including the Government's.
