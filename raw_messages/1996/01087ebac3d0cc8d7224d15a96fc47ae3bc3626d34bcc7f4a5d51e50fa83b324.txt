You have a point thee - I'll stop, not because IBM or Netscape might mind
my reposting their press releases here, but because I've recept some pretty
rude e-mail from John Gilmore telling me to stop posting off-topic to this
mailing list, which has turned into a playground for Timmy May and other
inane flamers. Clearly, anything "crypto-relevant" is off-topic. Only ethnic
flames about Cossacks (???) and religious flames about mormons, posted 
prodigiously by Timmy May and his cohorts, are on-topic.

P.S. I do have Dr. Argic's permission to repost his collection of materials
on the genocide of Jews and Moslems by Armenians.
