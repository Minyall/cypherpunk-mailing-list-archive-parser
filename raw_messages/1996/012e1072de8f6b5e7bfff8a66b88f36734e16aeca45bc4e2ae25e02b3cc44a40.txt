The current PGP keyring model does not scale anyway.  Suppose one day
every user on the Internet will have a key...  It is not relevant
whether the space per key is 100 bytes, 1000 bytes, or 10000 bytes.
All of these sizes are small enough for it to be quick to transfer a
single key.  There will soon be no way to transfer and store the
entire key ring.  In the long run, the problem must be solved using an
entirely different, distributed architecture.
