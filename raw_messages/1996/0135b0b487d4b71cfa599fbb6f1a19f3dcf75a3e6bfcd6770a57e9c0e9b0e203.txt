   actually you plan to take over the world using a completely different plan.
   It is quite easy to take the bits of the des-encrypted message, and
   calculate the OTP key nessasary to decrypt the message into your real plan.

Yes, but if you _really_ used a OTP to encrypt your real plans, the
probability that the ciphertext would decrypt via DES to anything
intelligible is so amazingly minute that no one would believe you.
It's like _one_ monkey typing out flawlessly the complete works of
Shakespeare.  On a Wednesday afternoon... :-)

   using that particular key means nothing, because a true OTP can generate
   that bit sequence.

And I can instantly break any encrypted message I see, by correctly
guessing the algorithm and the key.  I'd bet against it, though.

In fact, I don't even need to see it!!  I can guess the ciphertext, too
:-)
