Actually, he was charged with inciting hatred against a recognizable group but
was eventually freed on appeal. I think the problem was that the prosecution
could not find anyone who listened to Zundel and didn't already hate the same
groups. Hence, no incitement.

He is currently fighting to get his Canadian citizenship, (he is a German
citizen) while many other people are fighting to prevent this. Zundel believes
that returning to Germany would result in imprisonment.

It's nice to know that the people we imprison for their views are still willing
to go to court to become a Canadian citizen.

Nota: Quebec recently held a referendum on seperation from Canada. 
Just talk about secession of a state in the U.S., and you'll quickly see which
country makes political ideas illegal.
