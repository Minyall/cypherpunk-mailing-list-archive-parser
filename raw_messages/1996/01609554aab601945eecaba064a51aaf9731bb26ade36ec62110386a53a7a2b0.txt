But then the recipient has a PGP-signed message from you which
isn't encrypted (using pgp -d). That person could then impersonate
you. Eg Alice the jilted lover could resend the goodbye message
with forged headers to Bob's new girlfriend to get back at him.

What a sentence. Here it is again, hopefully understandable:

Bob->Alice
  From:Bob; Encrypted(Signed("We're through",Bob),Alice)

Alice does pgp -d, leaving her with Signed("We're through",Bob)

Alice->Carol
  From:Bob; Encrypted(Signed("We're through",Bob),Carol)

Later, when Bob gets another girlfriend,

Alice->Danielle
  From:Bob; Encrypted(Signed("We're through",Bob),Danielle)

Later still,

Alice->Eve
  From:Bob; Encrypted(Signed("We're through",Bob),Eve)
