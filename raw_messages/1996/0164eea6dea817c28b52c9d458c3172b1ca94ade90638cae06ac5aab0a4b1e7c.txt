Ok.. I'm still getting mail regarding the etch-a-sketch keychain. Thus
I'm going to look at how to get em for everyone. :)

Just letting you all know. Don't bury me in 'I want one mail.' As soon as
I have the info I'll get it out to the hungry crowd. Heh. At that point
you can bury me happily.
