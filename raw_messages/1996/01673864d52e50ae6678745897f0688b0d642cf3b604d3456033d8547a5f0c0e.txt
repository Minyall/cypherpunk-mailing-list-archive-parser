So move 100% of the development overseas.  Pick someplace where the labor
is cheaper (maybe the former Soviet Union, but I don't know what their
crypto export laws are like) and develop 100% of the product overseas.  Put
a notice inside each shrink-wrapped box that "This product was forced to be
written overseas, costing American programmers their jobs, by the
shortsightedness of Congress."
