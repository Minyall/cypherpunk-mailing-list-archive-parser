I will point out that complete formal semantics exist for other,
perfectly practical to use languages, like Scheme.

I go further. Java, as envisioned, cannot be made secure. It is too
powerful a language. Furthermore, it is unnecessary for the tasks that
it is used for, which are basically adding fancy wacky graphics and
simple applications and such to web pages.
