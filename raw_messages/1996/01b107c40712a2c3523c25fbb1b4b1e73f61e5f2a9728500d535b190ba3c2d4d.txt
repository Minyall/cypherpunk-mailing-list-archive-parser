We are reconsidering the Canadian restrictions - and may change them -
it is certainly not the ITAR quexstion, but another matter - we expect 
that Canadians will be included shortly - as to the question of using 
Cypherpunks - we are not saying taht we will not make changes based on 
any weaknesses that you discover, we will - but we do believe that if you 
fail to break the system with a spevfic time frame, that is fair game.

Why do you want to make it a one way street? We believe fair is fair - if 
you want to chop off our neck, then we should be able to tell people that 
you tried and could not at some point in time - 

Appreciatively,
Ralph
