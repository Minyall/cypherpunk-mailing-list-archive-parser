Anyone used any LAN encryption devices (ethernet or fast ethernet
speed?)  Something that could do IP AH off the back of an Ultrasparc
would be ideal.  Proprietary packet formats are ok, if they tunnel in
IP.  Needs to use DES, IDEA, or some other well known cipher.  Manual
key exchange is ok for this app.
