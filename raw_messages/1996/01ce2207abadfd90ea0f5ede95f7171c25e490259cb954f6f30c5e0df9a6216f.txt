As someone who has operated an ISP himself, I would say that the
likelihood of this being a system problem is very high. Especially if this
is a relatively new ISP, or if they've upgraded anything at all on their
mail server, it's pretty easy to break the delicate balance of daemons and
permissions such that this problem could easily occur.

It's worth a call to their technical support line (I know.. I'm sure it's
always busy) just to inform them of the problem. Sometimes it'll time out
(if it's one kind of problem) and sometimes it'll hang there until a lock
file is specifically removed (a different kind of problem).

All other comments regarding the likelihood that a sysadmin would try to
read mail in the real environment apply.
