I had heard of this before, but it's odd, because the ITAR says that
among items _excluded_ from the munitions list are items:

121.1 Category XIII(b)(1)(viii):
Limited to receiving for radio broadcast, pay television or similar
restricted audience television of the consumer type, without digital encryption
and where digital decryption is limited to the video, audio or management
functions.

so it would seem a sattelite TV descrambler is not a munition.
