"Low orbit" is used in a relative sense as compared to satellites
in geosynchronous orbit.  The Teledesic satellites will orbit in
the 700km range--hundreds of kilometers above the wispy highest
reaches of earth's astmosphere.  At that height, there will be
virtually no difference in orbital decay from that of 
geosynchronous birds.
