Though it may seem that way, I am not so sure that it is true. I am told
that you can buy a CA driver licence in the hispanic part of San Francisco
for about $50. Hologram and all. Reputations can take years to establish. I
am would feel more comfortable to sign certain statements about the
(on-line) character or technical skills of some people on this list whom I
have never met, than to sign the PGP key of an utter stranger that shows me
his Alabama ID card.
