No, it's Cypherpunks (and others).

Perhaps you are laboring under a misconception.  Cypherpunks is
about the use of technology to protect privacy.  Perhaps you 
were confusing it with that other list you are on:
alt.sex.yourmother.

Let me guess; you weren't an English major, right?

Thanks for your suggestion.

Irrelevant, but it was 1975.  More importantly, though, when did
YOU graduate from law school?

Kind of funny that you included Cypherpunks in YOUR reply, but
don't want me to.  I guess you prefer having a captive audience
of your cronies.  "Freedom Knights" yeah, right.  

So given your above ultimatum, I guess you are going to weasle
out of sharing your vast legal knowledge with us as per my 
request.  To wit:

What a pity.
