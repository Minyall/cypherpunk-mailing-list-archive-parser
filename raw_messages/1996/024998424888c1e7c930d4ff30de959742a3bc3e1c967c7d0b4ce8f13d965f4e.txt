Sure, but we were really discussing Ecash(tm), not accounting. To quote
from the FAPI:

/* An EC_Amount is a signed 32-bit integer.  It represents an amount 
 * of money in units of the coinage's base value.  
 */

Come on, we're not talking cents here. Question is, how do you represent
a one ITL coin in Ecash(tm) with a USD mint? We are way below the cent
level, where no accountant has ever gone before...
