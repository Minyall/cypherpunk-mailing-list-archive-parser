There is an old rule of thumb: Follow the money.

SPA is backed by big money corperations including: IBM, MicroSoft, NetScape, & Novell.

All of these corporations are in direct compition with Sameer and Apache-SSL. I beleive that Sameer has a comercial web server also but the name illudes me at this time. All of these corporations have strong intrest in damaging Sameer's reputation and also hurting him finacialy.


When in doubt always follow the money!
