Hy guys,

I have no idea, who this david is, but it's kind of funny:
someone says: when this guy shows up, you get a mail flodd
then someone replies to that...
And suddenly you notice, that the first guy was right, but I think he had to
be, after all, he was the first wave. (And I'm another one).

So, who is this david? I don't care, and as long as he posts stuff the way
he/she/it did until now, I won't. (Wouldn't you agree, that we have a lot
worse to worry about? - i.e. tonights fight, "Rottwiler" vs. "Cripple")
