   5-1-96 FiTi has an 18-page insert on information
   technology. Its Page One thriller:

   "Businesses fail to halt 'Ram raiders.'

      A sprialling crime wave is causing growing concern among
      law enforcement authorities, insurers and the business
      community. Computer theft is the fastest-growing crime
      in the UK. To combat physical computer crime, a wide
      variety of protection measures have been developed:
      physical restraints, motion detectors, electronic
      tagging, dye sprays, invisible identity tags, microdots,
      smoke bombs, chemical "fingerprints," and software
      monitors. Beyond the threats of hacking and virus
      attacks, as much as 2bn pounds a year is lost by
      computer misuse and "time-wasting surfing the Internet".

      Some of the new-anti-theft products are on display at
      Infosec 96, the UK's first big IT security exhibition,
      at London Olympia this week. The organisers have
      prepared seven fact sheets dealing with security "hot
      topics" such as encryption, disaster recovery and virus
      protection.
