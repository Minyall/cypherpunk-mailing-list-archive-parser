     I knew too many engineering students to believe this. I knew one
(Civil Engineering) who had been a Paramedic, he wanted grease and
dirt on his hands, it may be harder to wash off, but much easier to
sleep off.

     No argument there.

     Hell, that desciribes the ER I used to work in, and it was in a 
college town. (Yes, I do have a sorted job history. Everything from 
a strip joint dj. to working as a designer for a Big 7 Accounting firm).

     In my neighborhood, screams are so common (mostly from kids playing, 
and yes, I do check as often as I can) that most people don't bother to
check. Very different worlds. My wife and I are probably the only ones
who _don't_ watch TV. We have 2, plus 5 computers, and 5 or 6 book shelves.
The TV's were free, so were 2 of the computers.

     Prove? I don't know, but it is some pretty solid evidense. Communism
at it's finest. A community of people who work together and take care of 
each other voluntarily for the common good. <hee hee>
