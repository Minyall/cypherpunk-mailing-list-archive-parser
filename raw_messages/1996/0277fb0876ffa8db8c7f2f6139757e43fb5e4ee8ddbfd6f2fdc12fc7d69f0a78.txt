I an' I am Rastafari, praise Jah!
Jews and Moromons all part of Babylon system, bring
sufferation on righteous Rasta.   Some day Jah
bring 'cryption technology to Rasta, help
Rasta break Babylon chains and reach holy Mt Zion.
 
Until that day, could we keep stupid religious arguments off the list so
we can talk about crypto and related issues?
Thanks.
