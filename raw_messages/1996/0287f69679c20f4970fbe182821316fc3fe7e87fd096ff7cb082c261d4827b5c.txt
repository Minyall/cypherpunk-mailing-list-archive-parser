	The obvious solution in the above case is not to feed in the race
information for governmental decision-making. I recall a similar issue when
NN's were used for college admissions... while they didn't feed in the
applicant's race, they did feed in the applicant's name, and the length of it
turned out to have some correlations. (Why they were feeding in the name in
the first place is another question entirely, although NN's and GA's tend to
work the best when you don't understand the system at hand - which also tends
to mean that you shouldn't try to interpret what information is necessary.)

	It's related to that of the outlawing of IQ testing because of (I'd
say for environmental reasons) blacks having lower IQ scores on average. The
civil rights crowd are arguing for the PC egalitarian viewpoint that everyone
_should_ be the exact same in capabilities (for some absurd view of
"fairness"), and so want people treated the exact same despite obvious
differences and the validity of such tests.
