Thanks for the encouraging words. As the mailers drop off, its seeming
more and more likely that my mailer will need to be temporarily offed
also. (I would like to stress temporarily.)

Unfortunately, fewer remailers means that the mailers that are left will
be bearing an exponentially increasing amount of risk, not to mention the
increase in traffic levels overall.

The suggestion of inverting the sense of destination blocking seems the
most feasable on a short term level... and will most likely be the route
that I take for the near future.

The remailer at this account will remain up temporarily, pending further
notice.
