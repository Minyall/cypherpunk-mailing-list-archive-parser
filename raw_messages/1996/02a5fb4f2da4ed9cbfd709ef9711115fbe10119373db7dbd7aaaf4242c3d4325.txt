It is not possible because all old programs will be broken.

It is also not possible because non-ascii characters have different
meanings in different languages. I mean, words 

ðÏÌÀÂÉÌÁ ÐÁÒÎÑ Ñ,
ïËÁÚÁÌÓÑ ÂÅÚ ÈÕÑ.
îÁ ÈÕÑ ÍÎÅ ÂÅÚ ÈÕÑ, 
ëÏÇÄÁ Ó ÈÕÅÍ ÄÏ ÈÕÑ?

have meaning only to Russian speakers. A German or a Japanese would
never be able to remember a hostname like 
ÄÉÒÅËÃÉÑ.ÍÁÛÚÁ×ÏÄ.ÓÁÒÁÔÏ×.ÒÏÓÓÉÑ,
because in _their_ representation of these characters this text is a 
complete gibberish.
