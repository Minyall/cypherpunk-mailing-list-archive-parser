Absolutely correct.  What we don't have is general firewall discussions and
general conspiricy discussions (which are directed elsewhere).  Perry
performs a needed function.

Such parents would not let their children read unmoderated/unrated
newsgroups.  I think they are failing their children, but they would
certainly disagree.

The people who want a "controlled cyberspace" will not be happy.  I want
explore the consiquences, both technical and social, of taking the control
away from them by putting in the hands of individuals and minor children's
parents.  This approach would destroy their principle argument and make it
less likely that they will succeed.  However, unlike the motion picture
precedent, I think multiple rating agencies will not only be desirable, but
necessary.  I assume that in addition to the Christian Coalition's rating
service there would be a Hottest Pics of the Net service.
