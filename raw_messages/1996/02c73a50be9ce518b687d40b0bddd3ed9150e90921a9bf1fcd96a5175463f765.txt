Useless system for any high security application. May be good for
low-security applications if you are dealing with people who are too
stupid to use tokens.

The reality is that people do not treat their faces like secret keys
(depending on sex, religous beliefs and how many warts they may have). A
regular photo may not fool the device, however one specifically developed
for the purpose may, or if the device has some sort of depth perception,
a hologram or modeled head - all of which can be obtained from publically
availabe data - your face.
