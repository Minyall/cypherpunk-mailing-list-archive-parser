Go back to circa 1974-1976, and the Hart-Schweiker (spelling?) report.
Gary Hart telling about the things he saw in the intelligence reports,
etc., and how scary they were.  Fast-forward to Hart's outing in his
Presidential bid, and that confirms what happens when they can't say
things publicly.

I'm only quoting (minimally) one instance here - there are *tons* of
such admissions on the part of high-ranking people, but they're mostly
forgotten due to the avalanche of disinformation dumped on the people
by the big media every day.

Interesting how many people in the U.S., from the very top on down, know
quite a bit of the conspiracy to murder the Kennedys and Dr. King, but
some of the "intellectuals" on this very list can't handle the reality
of that, so they pretend it never happened.  Or, as Laugh-In said back
in the late 1960's, "In a few years, it'll be 'what assassination?'".
