Sorry for the noise, but could Logos be specific as to the fallacy in
each item he/she is addressing?  I thought that was the purpose of
the Logos character.

     I indicated in my original post that I would be
addressing both logic and decorum. With regard to the
questions above, I was asking Dimitri Vulis to give a
more detailed explanation of his thinking process.  Once
some of his assumptions are made explicit, it will be
easier to make meaningful comments about the rigor of his
reasoning process.
     It was never my intent to nit pick about every bit
of sloppy reasoning by every poster to Cypherpunks. Rather,
I am trying to elevate the general level of discourse via
selective commentary and (hopefully) by example.
     If Dale Thorn, or anyone else, feels that a more 
rigourous attention to logic and/or decorum is called for,
I heartily welcome your participation.

Logos out
