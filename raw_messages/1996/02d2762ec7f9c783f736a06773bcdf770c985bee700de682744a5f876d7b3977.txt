Cpunks: I tried to find the perl script 
premail (v. 0.44) that is described at the 
Raph Levien's page. Unfortunately, EVERY 
place where it is purported to be is screwed up: 
ftp.csua.berkeley.edu does not respond to FTP commands, 
Levien's download page returns premail 0.43 instead of 0.44, 
and ftp.hacktic.nl does not have premail-0.44.

WHAT TO DO???
