Someone asked about biometric ID requirements in HR 2202 "Immigration in the
National Interest Act of 1996".  This passed the House a few weeks ago.  The
Senate may pass it this week or next.  Watch out for stuff to slip back in
in the Conference Committee.

The whole "pilot program" to develop a forge resistant biometric ID card has
been removed from the bill.  The Border Crossing Cards that speed crossings
from Mexico are supposed to have machine readable finger prints or hand
prints added but those can probably be duped by the forgers.

The online SS# verification program is reduced to a voluntary (for the
employer) pilot.
