Indeed. If you indicate your interest, I can post here a more or less
full description of the robomoderator, how it implements secure
exchange between itself and human moderators, verifies submissions,
and signs approved articles for posting (it uses PMApp by Greg Rose).

Your criticisms will be most welcome.

We see no problem with user posting under pseudonyms, as long as they do
not try to pretend to be other real people and do not constantly mutate,
and submit their messages to the robomoderator for consideration.

Sorry if this question will provoke a mini flamewar, but what are
such reasons?
