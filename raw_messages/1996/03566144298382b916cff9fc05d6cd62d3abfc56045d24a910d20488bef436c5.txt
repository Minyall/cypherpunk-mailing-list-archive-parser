You could also set a per-site limit, or a per-minute limit.

Oh?  Would you rather pay $5,000 for some vertical piece of software,
or license its use on a $1/hour basis?  Even if you used it every hour
of every workday, that's only $2,000.

Um, you *do* purchase every TV show.  On the fly.  30 seconds at a
time.  Of course, some cheap people try to welsh [ see my hostname
before taking offense ] on their payments by Going To The Bathroom
during their payment periods!  Disgraceful, just disgraceful.

Hmmm...  Sounds like a job for ...  Super-Shameer!  Profit-making
super hacker privacy protector!  His mail flies through remailers with
the greatest of ease, he's invincible to flames, and and he is cute,
too!
