I believe we *have* regrouped sufficiently, and I am doing my best to give
followup stories what I believe to be the correct spin. 

UMass will be *humiliated* if we play this right. Whom do we call?

For what I think is a good story (I wish they'd credited cypherpunks and 
other people more, but they do need to play up the local angle), see:

 http://www-Daily.stanford.edu/2-2-96/NEWS/index.html

AFAIK, futplex is the only person who has suffered any kind of negative
impact from these events. Except for cpunk reactions to my very poor
postings here, and *one* person who thought I was a Nazi (and who was
corrected, and apologized), I've been getting nothing but praise. 

IMHO, the correct response is to stop whining and trumpet victory, loudly,
and slam Exon and the CDA while we're at it. 

"This story shows that the so-called Communications Decency Act is just 
as ill-advised. If only four people at a handful of major universities 
can defeat German censorship of someone everybody hates, how can we 
expect mere laws to prevent the spread of indeterminate 'indecent' 
material on the Internet, which any teenager is interested in."
