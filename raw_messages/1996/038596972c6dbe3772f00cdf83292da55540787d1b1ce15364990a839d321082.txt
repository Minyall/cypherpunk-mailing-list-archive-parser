Hmmm.

But what about the case of PGP? It's a relatively strong product, and
an international version exists.  I'd guess that PGP 3.0 may implement
other algorithms (PK and symmetric), and likely an international PGP3
would follow... so how could the Commerce Dept rationalize not giving
an export license to ViaCrypt?

And would a similar, but non-compatible, utility that used RSA and/or
IDEA, 3DES, etc. also be exportable? ...

[Problem is that like most legislation the legalise gets confusing to
non-lawyers, and maybe even lawyers not expert in that field...]
