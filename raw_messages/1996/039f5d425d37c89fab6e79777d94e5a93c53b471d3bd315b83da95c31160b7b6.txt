Can't lock him out of the list, but you can either set up a kill file, or find
something like the 3.0b version of Eudora, which has filters; you can set it up
where, if an incoming message has a certain From: string, it is transferred
directly into the Trash mail folder, which is, as a rule, cleaned up before
quitting.
