While I understand your point, I sorta hafta disagree.  (or, at least, state 
my reservations.)

If something is technologically IMPOSSIBLE (or, in practice, not available), 
it won't be mandated by government because it can't be.  The moment 
something exists, it can be forced on people.

I'm not saying we should somehow try to prevent people from developing truly 
voluntary key-escrow systems; rather, I'm saying that their existence should 
alert us to the danger.
