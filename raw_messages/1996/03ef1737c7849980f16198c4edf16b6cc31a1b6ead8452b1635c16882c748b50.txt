Dear Receiver,

I  completed a brief survey (SURVEY: Encryption in Commercial Enterprises)
few weeks
ago. I received quite good feedback and responses. I have now developed a
short summary of
all these responses. If you like to receive this summary, you can send me
your e-mail message.
My e-mail address is mjsus@ix.netcom.com - please, write in the subject of
your message:
"Encryption Survey Summary". Please, include your name and
company/organization in your
message - thanks in advance.

Best regards,

Mark
