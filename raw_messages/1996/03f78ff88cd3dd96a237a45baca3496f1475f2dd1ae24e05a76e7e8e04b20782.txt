   It's not clear to me that the second sentence follows from the first.

   All the time, in medical or official identification situations 
(clearances,  weapons permits, etc) I'm asked how tall I am. I can't 
remember ever being measured. Thus, the answer I give about my height, 
might as well be "made up" by me.

I guess they do have to bother measuring homocide victims - they can't 
talk......
