Douglas,

Why let it bother you? You must understand that the majority of the 
population of the United States is working class trash, the news 
media is just peddeling to the masses, just like the morons that hold 
elected office.

They can keep up the bitching, but that's a good thing, I encourage 
the spread of this kind of disinformation, it keeps even more of the 
masses from getting on for fear of being offenced.

Michael Peponis
