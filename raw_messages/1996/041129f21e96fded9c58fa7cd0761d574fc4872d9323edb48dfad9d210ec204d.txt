... if a tad unrealiable?

The thought of 900 satelites in low orbit, all running NT, makes me
shudder.  Brings a new meaning to the expression "OS crash".

What are cypherpunks thoughts on this?  Who really believes it'll work?

Doesn't the low orbit part mean that the satellites will have a low life
expectancy, meaning a new launch every couple of days? (where's Gerald
Bull when you need him - oh yes, now I remember ...)
