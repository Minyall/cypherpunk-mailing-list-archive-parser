Arun and Marin have been quoting from UN docs and the

Lots of UN declarations of rights have this sort of exception;
"protection of public morals" is something so blatantly vague
and broad that if a government contends that such a concept exists, 
as the covenant does, it could probably force the World Court
to conclude that it permits them to declare as "necessary"
just about anything short of burning witches and heretics,
and humanely beheading heretics, drug dealers, and anonymous remailer
operators is probably ok by this standard.

The UN Declaration (or was it Convention) on the Rights of the Child
is even worse - it strongly states the right to believe in and
practice religion, except when the government needs to interfere
to protect public morals or public order...  On the other hand,
it provides no such exception for the right to mandatory public
education or identity registration.
