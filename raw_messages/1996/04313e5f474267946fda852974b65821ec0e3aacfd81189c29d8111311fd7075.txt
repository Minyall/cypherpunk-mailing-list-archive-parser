	But both Sun's and Netscape's implementations make Frame (new
toplevel) windows have "Untrusted Applet Window" sprawled across the
bottom of them.

	On a (kinda) related note someone from Sun posted to c.l.java
that they're going to be releasing a signing mechanism for applets 
soon.  You'll be able to verify that the code comes from where it
says it does so at least when it steals your CC# you'll know whom to
go hunt down.
