The point isn't whether MD5 can be attacked in a "real life" application, but
that there is a flaw in MD5.  This means that it is weaker than an algorithm
like SHA that has no known cryptanalytical attacks against it.  Besides, a
hashing algorithm with a 128-bit output can be broken as easily as a 64-bit
encryption key.  MD5 shouldn't be used for that reason alone.
