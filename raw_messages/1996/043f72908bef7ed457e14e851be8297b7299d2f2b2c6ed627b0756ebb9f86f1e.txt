I put together a few pages regarding remailers and net spamming. Nathan 
Waddoups <nathan@metareality.com> hosts a well written site dealing with 
the larger issue of netspam, and has graciously agreed to host the 
remailer pages.

I just finished adding your page.  You're linked from the main spam page:

	http://www.metareality.com/~nathan/visit.cgi/html.Spam

...and your page is at this address:

	http://www.metareality.com/~nathan/visit.cgi/spam/html.Remail

Groovy.
