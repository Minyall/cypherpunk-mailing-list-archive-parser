Whoops. I should have said the press conference happened at 10:30 am.
The bill will be introduced in both houses later this  week.

Interesting press conference. Enough is Enough! took quite a bit of time
to rant about the dangers of the Internet. Pedophiles, chat rooms,
illegal pornography.

You get the idea.

Did you know May 20-26 is "Safe Cyber Week?"
