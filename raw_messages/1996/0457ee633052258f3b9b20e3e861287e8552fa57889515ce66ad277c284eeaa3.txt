Dale how long have you been awake? Take a gander at Wei Dei's Crypto++, Peter Gutman's cryptlib, 
and the half dozen other public domain multi algo source libs available at your finger tips.

Anyone with a compiler on just about any platform has access to implementations of blowfish,
idea, des, gost, the gamut.

So Dale, get coding.
