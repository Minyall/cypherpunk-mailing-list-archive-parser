Yes, I understand this. It's quite obvious; being removed from the
subscriber list hasn't slowed Vulis at all. When I was writing the piece
Vulis seemed to have slowed his ad hominem attacks and instead was talking
about censorship (something that is within the charter of the list), but
perhaps the reprieve was only temporary. 

The point I was trying to make at the end and that I may not have done
very successfully is that it would be very difficult to prevent Vulis from
*posting* to the list under his name; he then could do it through
remailers. And blocking remailers is unacceptable. So how does one kick
someone else out of a forum where anonymous speech is allowed?
