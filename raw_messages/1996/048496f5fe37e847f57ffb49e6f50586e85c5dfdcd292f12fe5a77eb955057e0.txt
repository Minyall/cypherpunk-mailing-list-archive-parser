Since a copy of the IPG system has apparently arrived unsolicited in my
mailbox this morning ("apparently" because I haven't unpacked or
inspected the MIME message; "unsolicited" because I did not request it),
I believe it's disclaimer time.

I have entered into no agreements to inspect, test or validate the IPG
software suite.  In the absence of a valid contract for my services, I
shall not inspect, test or offer opinions regarding the security of this
product.  IPG Sales is specificly enjoined from using my nym in any
reference to validation of their product.  Further, IPG is cautioned
against using "cypherpunks" as a validation reference, as my
subscription to this mailing list could then be construed as
contributing to the claim of validation.  This action is intended to
guard against claims of the form "roy@sendai.cybrspc.mn.org has been
unable to break our system", among others.

Note to IPG: I review all contract offers.  Feel free to contact me for
terms, but be advised that I'm somewhat expensive.

Note to c'punks:  apologies for burning listwidth, but this looks like
the proper Publication of Record for this notice.
