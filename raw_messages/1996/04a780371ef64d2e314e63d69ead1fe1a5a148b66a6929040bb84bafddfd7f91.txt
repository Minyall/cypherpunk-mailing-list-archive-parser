With apologies to Maxwell Smart...

Note the most important part of the decision.  The embrace of chaos by the
Chief Judge of the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals:

"Just as the strength of the Internet is chaos, so the strength of
our liberty depends upon the chaos and cacophony of the
unfettered speech the First Amendment protects.
          For these reasons, I without hesitation hold that the
CDA is unconstitutional on its face."

Chaos wins again.
