Subject: mailing-list through a remailer

Does anyone know if the following would work:



Having a mailing-list run through a remailer??



Someone would post (through an anon remailer) about a majordomo type list 
through an anonymous remailer (anon-penet.fi for example).  You would 
send a message to 123456@anon-penet.fi, with a subscribe SECRET-LIST.  
Your message would be anonymous to the list, as the server would be to 
you.  The server would then treat your return address through the 
remailer as your address, and you would post to the anonymous account for 
the server.



It would be double blind, and difficult to find out who ran the list.  If 
you chained the remailers, it would be even more difficult.



Can this be done??



Has this been tried??
