You know, I've always thought it odd how some people misuse the English 
language when they speak in their chosen shorthand.  "bring discovery 
violations"?  How, exactly, does one _BRING_ a "discovery violation"?   
Like, maybe, bring it in a whellbarrow?!?   Is "bring" a proper word in this 
context?  Why not stop using that silly shorthand.

BTW, you seem to have forgotten that this would be an excellent way to deter 
the kind of "knock and smash" warrant service common amongst government 
thugs.  Any argument by the cops that "we must break down the door or else 
they'll erase the data!" is rendered obviously silly if the data is ALREADY 
encrypted and inaccessible. If anything, it would make the data permanently 
inaccessible since it would make (arguably) the release of a decrypt key 
"incriminating" if it were a criminal case. 

Yet another excellent reason to encrypt the data is that it deters 
burglaries, where the purpose of the burglary is to get this data illegally. 
 Given the COS's history, that is a reasonable fear.
