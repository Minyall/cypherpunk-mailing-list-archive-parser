This sounds about right.  When I was an NSA employee ('83), our
introductory briefing included the suggestion (I don't recall it being
phrased as a command command) that we identify ourselves as DoD.  It
was suggested that this might lessen our visibility as espionage
targets.

At the time, the brass would likely have been identified as NSA, as
were the lesser brass in the National Computer Security Center, but
regular employees weren't.

Yikes.  Sometimes age creeps up on you when you aren't looking.  I
guess I'd be an "oldtimer" if I were still working there?  An
"oldtimer" at thirty-three... hmm.
