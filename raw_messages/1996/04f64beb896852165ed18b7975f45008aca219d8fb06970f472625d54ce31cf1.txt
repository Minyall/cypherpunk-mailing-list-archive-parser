Actually, it and the treatment have been around for a very long time.

You are probably right that there are many cases in which the drugs
are given incorrectly because it is often easier to medicate than to
deal with problems by other means. However, that does not mean that it
is always a bad idea to medicate.

As for the long rant from the drug addict that took up the balance of
your posting, Ritalin isn't prescribed for ADD in quantities that get
someone "high", nor are its effects the same on such people.

The person writing this doesn't sound exactly rational.
