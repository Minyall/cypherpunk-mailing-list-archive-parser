Not so:  If the message is encrypted and checksummed with a simple
not non cryptographic checksum, this gives you everything a MAC 
gives you, plus the message is secret.

MACs are only useful in the strange and unsual case where you want
authentification using a symmetric key, but you want to transmit in
the clear.  I cannot see any reason why anyone would ever wish to use
a MAC except perhaps to obey government bans on encrypted messages.
