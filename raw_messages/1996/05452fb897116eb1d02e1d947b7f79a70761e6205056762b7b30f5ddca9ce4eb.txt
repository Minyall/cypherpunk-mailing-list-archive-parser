Well, unlike CFS, loop.c is part of the Linux kernel, which is single-threaded,
so I guess loop.c is also single-threaded.  However, I took care that deadlocks
be avoided (mounting a loop device as another loop device (for example,
hiding an encrypted filesystem as stego) caused me to think a bit, but I'm
fairly confident that it works now).
