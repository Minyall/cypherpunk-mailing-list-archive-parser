	I am just announcing that I am changing the name of my program, Very Good
Privacy (distinct from Pretty Good Privacy) in response to a complaint from
PGP, Inc. It was cool, though, because I got an e-mail message from Phil,
which is akin to talking with God. Just to quell the trademark questions
some people might have, a trademark violation is defined as something where
there is a possibility of confusion with another product; as made obvious
by the hundreds (literally) of messages I have received asking about the
features of this new version of PGP (which it is not). I have not changed
the name of the product on the web page, and will just post a notice of
clarification until I think of a new name. Does anyone have any ideas?
Thanks.
