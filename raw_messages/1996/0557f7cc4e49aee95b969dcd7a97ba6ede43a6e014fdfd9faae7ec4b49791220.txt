I've got the Viacrypt Business Edition for Windows. It arrived late last
week. I don't think the personal edition is shipping yet.
 
The business edition adds features for corporate key escrow and limiting 
features available to users. I've just started playing with the software, but
it looks like some of the user control features are implemented using 
security through obscurity. The windows implementation is ok, but does 
not include DDE or OLE. The floating toolbar looks useful.

4.0 will interoperate with current versions of PGP as long as a normal 
key is generated. 4.0 allows for generation of keys limited to signing or 
encryption. These keys will not interoperate with current versions of PGP.

I'll know more as I use the software. If anyone has any specific 
question, feel free to ask.
