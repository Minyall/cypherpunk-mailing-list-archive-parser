Jeez, is there no place safe from Dimitri's Cabal rantings? There Is No Cabal
fnord. So there.

ObCypherpunks: It's worth noting that Dimitri's reputation capital is so devalued on Usenet that his vote wasn't accepted in the recent soc.religion.paganism CFV:

dlv@bwalk.dm.com                                             Dr. Dimitri Vulis
   ! Vote rejected by votetaker (untrusted site)

This is from Message-ID: <839564931.8926@uunet.uu.net>, btw.
