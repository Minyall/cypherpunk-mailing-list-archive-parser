I don't know about car, but I had been able to rent bicycles and roller
blades (2 other viable forms of transportations) with no difficulty
at all using cash. They did not even ask for a credit card at all.

Only once did they ask for a credit card, but they did not run anything
through or make any calls when I checked the bike out; when I returned
it, they gave me the original credit card slip (plus all copies) when
I gave them cash to settle. 

If I wanted to, I could have run the credit card account dry and then 
rode off to nowhere. The bike was probably worth 1000 to 1500 dollars.
