Incorrect.
The deciding factor is the court's determiniation of whether the 
information was "material non-public information."  As the question of 
materiality is vague, subjective and subject to whim, even a low level 
employee is risking time and fines.  Often materiality has exactly zero 
to do with what effect it may have on stock price.

There is a simple solution to avoiding liability.  Don't trade in your 
own company's stock.

You make the case that it is somehow shocking to think that an employee 
wouldn't be able to buy stock in their employer.  Such restrictions have 
existed for decades.  Why are you so stunned?
