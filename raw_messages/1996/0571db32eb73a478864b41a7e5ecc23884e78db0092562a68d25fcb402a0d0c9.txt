In case anyone's interested, I've finally found the source I used for the 
claim that RC2/RC4 were exportable if the details were kept quiet:
 
  "Details about them [RC2 and RC4] have not been published (including by 
   patenting) in order to maintain their special export status".
   
       -- RSA FAQ, version 1.0, draft 1e, 14 September 1992, p.40.
 
This makes sense - the NSA wouldn't want the details published to stop non-US 
non-crippled versions appearing, and I can't really imagine RSADSI volutarily 
not patenting a new algorithm.
