! How about a NoCeM-moderated newsgroup?
! I.e., several parties can issue 'hide' NoCeM notices for whatever
! material they consider off-topic, including cross-posts. Several
! other parties can issue 'highlight' NoCeM's for articles they
! consider particularly worthy.

With the advent of killfiles and all sorts of filtering capabilities, 
there is no excuse for requiring moderation at all other than for 
purposes of censorship.
