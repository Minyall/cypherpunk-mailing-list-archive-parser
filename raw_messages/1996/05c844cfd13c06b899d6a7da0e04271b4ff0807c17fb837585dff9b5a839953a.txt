PC Magazine's web site has a prominent article reviewing four PC-based
crypto apps: they all seem to be oriented towards storage security not
communications security (to adopt Tim's taxonomy). The apps are from
Symantec, RSA, AT&T, and PGP; their "Editors' Choice" was Symantec's
program, followed closely by RSA's. They seem more concerned with speed and
user interface rather than the strength of the algorithms or their
implementations.

The article won't teach anyone who's read Applied Crypto anything new about
crypto, but it's neat to see that security is becoming a mainstream
concern. (It should have always been one.) There may very well be an
associated dead-tree version of the article as well, but I've lost touch
with the PC market.
