Since we're talking about digits rather than numbers, I can see why base to
some power of 2 might turn out to be significant. The trivial base 2 or 16
to base 10 conversion isn't useful if you're working with a single digit. A
well, its fruitless to guess without looking at the result. Let me close by
saying that in decimal notation, not a single digit of Klarner's Konstant
is known. Not really relevant, but its as close a chance as I get to
mentioning my research. :-)
