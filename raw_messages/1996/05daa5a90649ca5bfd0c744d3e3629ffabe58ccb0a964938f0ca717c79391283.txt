Nope, especially since they claimed a large percentage of those attacks
went "unnoticed".  I fail to see how they can know they happened if they
went unnoticed.  They also neglected to mention exactly what consitutes 
an "attack" or breakin attempt.  Some people far more cynical than the
average sheep would claim that report was used as a tool to justify new
massive expenditures to congress and the public.  //cerridwyn//
