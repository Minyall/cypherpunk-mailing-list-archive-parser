But this isn't a birthday attack. Its a comparison between one specific 
file and one randomly chosen one.

Unless you are aware of some attack that I'm not, this is the most current 
information on MD4 and MD5:

MD4 has had successful attacks on limited rounds.  It has _not_ been 
completely cracked.

MD5 has not been broken.  A weakness has been shown, but collisions still 
cannot be developed.  So checksums should still be secure.  Additionally, 
in this case we are more concerned with the chance of random collisions 
than intentional collisions.

In fact, I was probably wrong to suggest MD5.  It _is_ more secure, but 
speed is his first priority, not security.  SHA1 is a good hash algorithm 
as far as security goes (I've used it myself), but it's over three times 
slower than MD4.
