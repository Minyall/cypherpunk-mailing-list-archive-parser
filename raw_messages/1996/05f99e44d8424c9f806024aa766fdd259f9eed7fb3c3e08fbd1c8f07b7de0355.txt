I just heard something funny on ABC:

Interviewer: Is this the kind of bomb the militias like to use?

Interviewee: Yes, it's a pipe bomb. Of course, you can find out on
the Internet how to make these...

(Well, _I thought this was funny.)

I hereby volunteer Jim Bell to write the Cyperpunk bomb-making FAQ.
Or a more general chemical FAQ including common poisons.
Are you up to this task, Jim? :-)
