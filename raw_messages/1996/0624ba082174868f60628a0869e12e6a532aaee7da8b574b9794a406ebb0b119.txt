Agreed.  I never claimed this.

Again, it depends on the degree of "mutilation."  Distortion of major
features is fairly effective even against partial attempts which are
matched by computer.

Careful.  Even Central Intelligence Agency print requirements are for
criminal background check only.  They will run through FBI files and so
forth and keep the prints for their records, but they are rarely if ever
used as identification verification per se.

This is because not everyone in the world has fingerprint files floating
around.  If you are getting printed for the first time ever and you
distory or mutilate, there's nothing to compare to.  Further, if you just
distort, you're prints later might not match well when computer searches a
nationwide database (which excludes CIA employees in any event).

It's all about application.

To repeat, if you're looking to "estlablish" a false print index,
distortion is a good way to do it.

If you're looking to evade a search which has already narrowed you down
well, hack off some fingers.
