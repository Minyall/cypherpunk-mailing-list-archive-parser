I have seen this meme scrawled on the sides of payphones and on train doors
along the Red Line of Chicago's "Ell."  Is this some form of organized  
protest or the actions of one person?  While not directly cypherpunks related  
I cannot think of too many other types of people who would produce this  
graffito.

Any responsible cypherpunks care to raise their hands?
