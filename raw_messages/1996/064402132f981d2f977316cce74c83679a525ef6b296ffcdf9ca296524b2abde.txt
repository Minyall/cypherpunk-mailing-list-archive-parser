     Ok, you asked. 

     Much depends on my goals. 

     If my goal is simply to get my name/cause in the paper, I would hit 
     major sporting events (Superbowl, World series, World Cup, olympics & 
     etc.) I would also hit cause specific targets (If I were a radical 
     tree hugger, I'd hit Werhauser(sp?) corporate offices, Dow Chemical 
     Offices etc.) If I were a black panther, I'd hit police stations, 
     Klan Headquaters, &etc. 

     These are far to elementary, after giving it some thought (well, it has 
been on and off my mind since G. Gordon Liddy published his open letter to the 
president many years ago:

     If my goal was to basically reduce this country to jelly, it would take 
(In my decidedly none professional judgement) about 20 or so men (20 two man
teams would be better, but the more people, the bigger chance of leakage, but
it would make their jobs easier) Anyway: call it 20 teams. 

     Saturday afternoon (preferably mid may) in 20 Walmarts across the 
country 20 stolen cars go boom (really big boom) at about the same time. 

     Sunday Morning Sarin gas introduced into churches.

     Monday Morning, Rush hour:
     In LA, New York, Boston, Miami, New Orleans, Phoenix, Chicago, 
San Francisco, St. Louis, San Diego, Seattle, Portland, Albuquerque, 
Las Vegas (is there a rush hour in Las Vegas?) Houston, Cinncinatti(sp?), 
Atlanta, Little Rock, Detriot, & Des moines, cars parked along side of 
the highway (near bridges were possible) blow up. Around noon that day, 
thermite and WP gernades (or home made equivalents) are ignited in the 
buisness districts (or casinos of Las Vegas). 


     The government will react with overwhelming restrictions of personal 
freedom, and the militas will react, the government will clamp down further,
the militias will gain popularity & america will divide itself. 
     
     If I were inclined to such behavior, and had the funding, That is how I 
would do it. 


     Other ideas: Random Shelling of business districts, airports and 
subdivisions.
