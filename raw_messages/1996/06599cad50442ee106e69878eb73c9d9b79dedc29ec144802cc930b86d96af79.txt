but upon closer inspection it looks like the House of Representatives'
WWW-accessible version that I looked it up in is out of date. (geez.)

The more current version is located at 22 CFR 120.17; there are some
wording changes in the definition of export but the exemption for launch
vehicles and payloads is unchanged. ("(6) A launch vehicle or payload shall
not, by reason of the launching of such vehicle, be considered an export
for purposes of this subchapter.")
