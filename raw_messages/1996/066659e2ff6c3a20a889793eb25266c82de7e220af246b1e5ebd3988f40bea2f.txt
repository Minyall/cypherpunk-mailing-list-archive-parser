Actually, no.  When I used to edit a magazine, I commissioned an
article about how much "tax" slaves, serfs, etc. paid.  That is,
how much of what they produced, did they get to keep; how much
went to their masters.  The surprising, cross-cultural answer my
researcher/writer found was that they got to keep everthing they
produced except 5-10%.  That's a lot better, percentage-wise,
than for modern "tax slaves."
