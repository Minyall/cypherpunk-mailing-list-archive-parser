If it's a myth, it's quite an elaborate one. On Saturday night I was 
interviewed by the BBC about this.  The producer read the entire article 
to me, telling me in was on the front page of the Times. (My comments 
were not about the specific story, but the underlying security issues.) I 
don't think he was making it up.

Maybe the London Times isn't on Nexus.
