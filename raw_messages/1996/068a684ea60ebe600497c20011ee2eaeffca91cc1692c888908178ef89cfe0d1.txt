     If you want further evidence of their technical skills, look up
my name.  I'm responsible for the corp@spe.com account.  WhoWhere has
therefore decided that I am responsible for every "corp" account in
their database and has attached my name to each and every one.  I
informed them of this several weeks ago but they are evidently not
interested in cleaning up their service.

     Being both socially and technically challenged, perhaps they want
your Fucking Statist input on obtaining a government grant for a
clue-free business.
