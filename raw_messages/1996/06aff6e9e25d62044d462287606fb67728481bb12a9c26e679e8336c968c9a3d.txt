I would guess that most sites censoring http by IP would be doing so by
only censoring the http port.  If the http servers were to be run on
other ports too (perhaps well known ports like DNS), then this would
make life a little harder for the bad guys.  This would be especially
true if their routers were configured to allow ALL DNS requests through
(for example).  This may be a problem for some browsers (I know it's a
problem with netscape), as I mentioned a few weeks ago.

I have some encrypted HTTP relay software if anyone is interested in
setting up a server.
