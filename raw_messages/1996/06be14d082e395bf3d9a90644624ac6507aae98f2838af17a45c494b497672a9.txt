So is your comment. What was broken was not public key, but a particular
key length (and by implication shorter ones). You can do that with just
about any system, even a one-time pad, by brute force, but it won't buy you
much more than sharpening your skills, for longer keys.

One particular public key algorithm (you aren't too specific here) WAS
broken a few years ago, but that was not RSA and isn't used any longer. If
memory isn't playing tricks on me it was the knapsack algorithm.
