Well for a start there is no possible cryptanalytic (rather than 
brute force) attack on a one time pad, the system can be 
mathematically proven to be secure with a very simple bit of 
statistics.

Soemthing like RC4, even if the key were totally random and 
unpredictable, and had as much, or more state than the message can 
still be cryptanalysed possibly, although it is unlikely...
