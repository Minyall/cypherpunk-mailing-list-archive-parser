     I don't think anyone believes Denning is an Idiot. Maybe that her
position is Idiotic, that she give the wrong weight to certain ideas and
beliefs when taking a position, but not an idiot.

     I also don't think that you _have_ to vilify your opponent when engaging
in political conflict. I have had many many arguments in my life over 
issues such as Socialism, Government (lack of) Rights, Peoples Rights etc. In
some cases I called my opponents idiots and worse. Usually because they were.
In other cases I was clearly dealing with an intelligent individual who either
was getting the wrong information, or started with different premises(sp?) 
than me. 

     Denning clearly believes that the government is a better judge of me and
my fellow man than I am. She is wrong, and history proves that. Does that
make her an idiot? No. Foolish? Perhaps. 

     As to facist, I don't really know her well enough to tell, but anytime 
someone believes that the government has the right to tell private enterprise
what they can and can't produce, that person is getting very very near to 
being facist. If the foo shits...
