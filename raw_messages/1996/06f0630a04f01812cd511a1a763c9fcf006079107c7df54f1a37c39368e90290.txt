    Much better, look at rfc822.  (I wouldn't consider *anything* that
has the word "sendmail" in it a good reference).

    Hostnames will match the regexp [-A-Za-z0-9.]; those are the only
legal characters in the hostname portion.  Usernames
("domain-dependent local string") are much harder to what is and isn't
legal.  Read rfc822.
