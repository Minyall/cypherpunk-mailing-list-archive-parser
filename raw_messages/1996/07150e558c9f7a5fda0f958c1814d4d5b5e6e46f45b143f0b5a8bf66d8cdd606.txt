Sneck.

The points I get out of this:

	1. Cypherpunks lives up to its name. Mainly, the second part.
	2. Whether an email spam is business related or not, it's
	   neither desirable or interesting. Two years ago having
	   a robot like that might have been amusing. Now it's just
	   another spam.
	3. Y'all really oughta read Stand on Zanzibar again. I think
	   you're missing the point.
