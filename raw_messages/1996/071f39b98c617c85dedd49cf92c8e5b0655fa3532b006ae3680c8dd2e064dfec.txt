   3-30-96 TWP reports on an Argentinian hacker who penetrated
   a slew of sensitive networks and how the FBI tracked him by
   getting a warrant to run a sniffer-filter at Harvard, the
   POE.

   The hacker's dad, a Lt. Col., barks, "The Yankees don't
   have the slightest idea about security. If a kid can enter,
   they should be ashamed to admit it."

   The Feds snort, "The case underscores the vulnerability of
   computer systems worldwide, a preview of a coming era of
   cyber-sleuthing, what computer crime-fighting will look
   like in the coming years." And that it shows they can catch
   tresspassers without violating other users' privacy.

   Banisar sniffs, "The case shows that there's a need for
   more encryption."
