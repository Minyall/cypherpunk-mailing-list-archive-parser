I've been discussing the Lotus notes escrowed key reduction with some 
knowledgeable people. The first time I heard it suggested was by Adi Shamir at a 
talk by the deputy director of the NSA at MIT.

The problem with this system is that it is quite likely to suceed. Unlike 
Clipper which made unfettered access to encrypted material possible the escrowed 
key strength reduction means that the FBI can tap a significant number of 
locations, just not all of them.

It will be very hard to argue effectively against this idea in Congress. Much 
harder than the Clipper chip which was dead on arrival.
