     The latest understanding from ACLU's legislative representatives is
     that the
     "Anti Terrorism" bill that is expected to be acted on today and
     tomorrow will include government controls on encryption -- a
     scheme for key escrow of private keys for encryption. It is also
     likely to include expanded use of wiretapping without a Court
     order.
