	If you are using procmail, then what you want is a recipes
	at the begining like this:


	LOG=penet$NL
	:1hW:
 	^From.*.penet.fi
	.mailbox/penet

	Respond to the penet.fi messages as you wish.
	Alternatively, you can just send the message to /dev/null

	That recipe hasn't been tested, so it may need some tweeking
	on it.
