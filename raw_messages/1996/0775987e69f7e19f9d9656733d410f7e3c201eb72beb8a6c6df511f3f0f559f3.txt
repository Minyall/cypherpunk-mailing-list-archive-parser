The U.S. Treasury Department and other agencies are quite interested in
these issues.  In September, at a 2-day conference in Washington, DC, on
electronic money and banking, Internal Revenue Commissioner Margaret
Richardson described the concerns of tax commissioners world-wide about
digital currency.  Treasury will be issuing a White Paper in the next
month or two that will request comments from the public on a range of tax
and policy legal issues relating to electronic commerce.  These issues
will include, among others, permanent establishment, U.S. trade or
business, and compliance and enforcement.  See the news story in _Tax
Notes_ magazine, Sept. 23, 1996, at 1588, by Ryan Donmoyer, "Tax
Principles Must Be Applied to Wired Economy, Richardson Says."  (A
version of this story is also available electronically in LEXIS, Fedtax
Library, TNT file (as a new search).)      EB
