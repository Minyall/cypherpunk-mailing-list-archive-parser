Just downloaded the most recent English Version 2.1 for Windows 3.1.
This does appear to do the same in terms of no encryption at all after
the server hello.

To be fair to Microsoft the number of cycles performed for the private key
echange is quite high.  Therefore, not having any key and not doing the
RSA calculations makes the access quite a bit faster.

The older versions (and some Win95 versions) that we have found around
seem to just crash our server.  I am not really feeling like debugging that.
