I would say that the street action which effectively eliminated legally
mandated racial segregation about 25 years ago qualifies as a revolution.
People certainly put their bodies, and occasionally their lives, on the
line for it.  It didn't happen because the political powers that be decided
to do it.  It happened because people mobbed in the streets and made it
happen.

The same argument applies to the actions which forced the withdrawal from
Vietnam.

With the end of the cold war, and the ensuing reduction in need for the
entrenched national security establishment, we may be ripe for another one.
I personally hope our government will continue to show that it is civilized
by keeping the blood shed to a minimum.
