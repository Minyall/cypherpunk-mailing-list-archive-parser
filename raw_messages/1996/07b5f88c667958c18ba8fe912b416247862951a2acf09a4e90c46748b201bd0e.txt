Certain conservative sects [Puritan, Amish (I think)] believe strongly in
the Old Testament command to "not make any image of anything in the air,
on the ground, or in the sea" (quote approximate).  This was done to
prevent image (idol) worship.

It's ironic, given that most conservative Christians who claim to believe
sincerely in the adage against idol worship will nonetheless have those
beautiful, high-tech studio portraits of their children somewhere in the
house, highly visible for all visitors and residents to gaze upon.

But sadly, most Christians, like most non-Christians, just can't resist
the temptation to worship idols, albeit in a more subtle way than bowing
down to the molten calf.
