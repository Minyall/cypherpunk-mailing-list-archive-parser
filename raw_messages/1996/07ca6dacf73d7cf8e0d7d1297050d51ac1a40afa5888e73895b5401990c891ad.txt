   "CIA to Retain Right to Use Journalistic Cover."

      DCI John M. Deutch told a forum yesterday that the
      agency maintained the right to use U.S. journalists or
      their organizations as cover for intelligence activities
      but only under restrictive regulations. The staff
      director of the Senate intelligence committee, said the
      panel considers questions about non-official cover to be
      "a great problem" and expects members will want to take
      "a hard look at what extraordinary circumstances led to
      the use of journalistic cover."
