It's an informational issue, not a logistical problem.  This much is true.

But think of it this way.  Joe Blow's house burns down, taking with it all
his documentation.  Even Joe Blow has to be able to replace it all even
with no credentials.  So what makes you and Joe Blow distinct when you're
standing in line to get those credentials?  That should give you some idea
of the (lack of) difficulty.

Precisely.

I applaud your efforts, but the 'one good administrator' can only do so
much.  In the end if people want privacy they have to work for it
themselves.  The goal in my view is to promote an atmosphere where that
kind of self-insurance is possible, not one that puts the responsibility
in the hands of government, or the system administrator.

The nice thing about paranoids, and other privacy invaders, is that when
they have an answer to a question they usually stop looking.  Provide them
with an answer.
