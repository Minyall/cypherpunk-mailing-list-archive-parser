   If UMass has yielded, the prominently mentioned CMU and Stanford sites may
   be prompted to exactly the same thing. This will "prove" to the Germans
   that they did the right thing, and be a blow in _favor_ of suppression of
   speech.

I just heard the latest version of this story on WBZ radio here in
Boston.  The report quoted the chairman of the CS dept. at UMass; his
claim is that Futplex's distribution of the material was clearly a
"political act" and thus not an appropriate uses of computing resources
funded by public tax dollars.  The report clearly stated that Futplex's
actions were taken to protest German censorship.

Immediately after this story WBZ reported that Germany is now
investigating AOL for possible distributions of banned material.
