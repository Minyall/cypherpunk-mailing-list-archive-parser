If foil or metal mesh would block it, then many recently built houses
would be already set.  Usually that 1/2 - 1 inch styrofoam used 
on almost all exterior walls has a reflective layer of foil to help
keep the heat/cold out.

Then again, this sounds like hype-ed up infra-red technology
to me, in which case seeing through walls is B.S.
