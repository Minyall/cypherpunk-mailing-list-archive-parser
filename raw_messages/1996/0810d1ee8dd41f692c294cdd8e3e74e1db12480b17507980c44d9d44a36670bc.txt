Actually the server verify message should be encrypted (to verify the
key negotiation).  Also the server and client finished should be encrypted.
I don't actually get the client finished record or client master key record.

However, I don't get those all I get is the cleartext data in packets of
SSL record format.   I have done a little more experimentation and it does
appear quite clear that this happens with a non standard (ie not
Verisign and a few others) X509 Certificate.

In the trace that I have posted it is clear that cypher 02 00 80 has
in theory been negotiated.
