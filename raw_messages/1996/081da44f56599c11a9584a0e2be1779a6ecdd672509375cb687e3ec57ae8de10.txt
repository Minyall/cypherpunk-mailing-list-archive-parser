Significantly, Bruce Bough and other EFF/John Gilmore supporters are against
total anonymity just like they're against free speech. They wants to be able
to track down and silence anyone who uses the anonymous remailers to say
something "homophobic" or otherwise politically incorrect - a kind of
"identify escrow".

I again remind you the lying shyster Jim Ray who tries to "guest" who
might be behind various anonymous postings and complains to the suspects'
postmasters just in case. What a lying piece of shit. Does anyone know the
snail address for Judge Kozinski? Jim Ray's been boasting so much about his
correspondense with the good judge, that we must warn him about Jim's lies
and hypocricy (notably, his *true* position on anonymity).
