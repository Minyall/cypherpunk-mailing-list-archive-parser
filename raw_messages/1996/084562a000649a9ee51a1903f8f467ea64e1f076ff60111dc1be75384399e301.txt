Doh!  So set up a business which certifies PGP signatures.  What you
do is take money from people in exchange for a sheet of paper which
contains the PGP fingerprint, and a notarized copy of the person's
driver's license, credit card, or whatever.  Once you get that piece
of paper, you sign the person's PGP key with your business's key.
You certify that you have the piece of paper on file, and will provide
it upon payment of some small fee.

There.  A signature registry.  And you can even do it through a
service like First Virtual, or Digicash or Cybercash.  The only reason
I haven't done it is because I have other business with a higher
margin, and there's only so much Russell to go around.
