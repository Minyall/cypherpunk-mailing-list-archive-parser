pppd doesn't necessarily run over a modem; you can "tunnel" it over another
IP connection.

I have in fact done this very thing.  Use ssh to (encrypted) log in to
the ppp server, and start pppd at each end.  It's been a while; I think I
had to tweak something to make it work over a pty instead of a serial port.
