It isn't spam if they're paying for the traffic.  Commercial
advertisement through electronic mail is only evil because it is
forced on someone against their wishes and on their dime.  The current
situation is much like a telemarketer calling long distance collect
with billing done automatically, and you can't hang up until they're
done with their spiel.

If it were standard practice for email recipients to charge the sender
an ecash fee (waived if they thought the mail worth their time), it
would make things much more interesting.
