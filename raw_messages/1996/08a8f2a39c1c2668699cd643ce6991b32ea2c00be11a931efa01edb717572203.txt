> I am not even shure I accept the legal premise of corporations.
 - Jim Choate


    This is NOT a drill. This is an actual pop quiz, in which Jim Choate 
is directed to tell us about the legal premise of incorporation. Jim, do 
you know anything about what you are talking about. Looking it up is not 
allowed.

P.S.  could you humor me on one tiny little thing?  Can we agree that 
that the word shall be spelled "sure", not "shure", on this list?  I 
don't want to trample on your artistic vision or anything like that, but 
could we just agree on this one tiny little thing
