Search Campus Where Jewell Worked;
 Check Internet Link

By Associated Press, 08/02/96

ATLANTA (AP) - Widening their investigation of Richard Jewell,
federal and state agents descended on a small Georgia college campus
Friday to hunt for evidence linking him to the Olympic park bombing.

Among other things, investigators were trying to determine whether the
former campus guard had tapped into the Piedmont College library, a
campus source reported. Bomb-making instructions available through the
national inter-library borrowing network have contributed to an increase
in bombings in the United States, authorities say.
