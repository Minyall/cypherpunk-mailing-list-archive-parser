Yeah, you'd mentioned it, but I hadn't read it until just now. I see he
mentions me on http://anarchy-online.dementia.org/book/section.2.html, but
my name is badly misspelled; it starts with "R," not "D." Donna's name is
badly misspelled, too, early on. 

I wholeheartedly support his conclusions, by the way. They're based on
a number of incorrect premises, but any fictions are convenient ones.
