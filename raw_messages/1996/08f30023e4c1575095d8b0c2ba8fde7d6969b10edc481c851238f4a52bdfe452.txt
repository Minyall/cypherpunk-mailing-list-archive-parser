Sorry to be following up to my own message Yet Again, but I see a hole
in my analysis that needs patching.

If you have a mixmaster host M, with certain characteristics (latency,
reordering, and traffic volume), that is NOT identical in security to
a mixmaster network M with identical characteristics, but in which
some hosts are not trustable.  The non-trustable host(s) keep track of
their latency, reordering, and traffic volume, so it's removed from
the characteristics of the network above.

Therefore, to keep the characteristics of the trusted host constant
when converting into a partially trusted network, each of the
individual hosts needs to increase their parameters by some amount
(which amount someone else will have to contribute, cuz I have no clue
and need sleep).
