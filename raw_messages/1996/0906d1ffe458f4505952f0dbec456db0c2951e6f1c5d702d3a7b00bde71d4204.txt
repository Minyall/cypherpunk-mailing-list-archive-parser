  I think that it would be more effective to get the US version
of netscape into the hands of as many US citizens as possible.
Taking away our permission to download in the near future after
a few tens of thousands of downloads won't mean near as much as telling
several million people running the US version that they can't
upgrade to the next release and maintain their strong crypto
capabilities.  Once a few million voters have it, it will be
very hard to take it away again.  What i'm hoping for is the
wide distribution of strong crypto in a user friendly package.
Isn't that the heart of cypherpunk ideals?

  I certainly have sympathy for those who want to make a point
by uploading our US software to hacktic and other foreign servers,
but I think that my company will probably have to ask hacktic
and others to remove these copies.

  I'm also curious why these anonymous crusaders did not act
sooner?  The US version has been available for sale in retail
outlets for about a year now.  Was it not worth $50 to make
your point?
