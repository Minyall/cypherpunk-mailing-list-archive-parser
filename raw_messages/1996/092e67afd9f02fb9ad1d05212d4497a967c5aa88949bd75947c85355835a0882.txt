 Note to cypherpunks:  This guy complains about the problem, but he *is*
 the problem.  *He* wants to tell us *he's* leaving.  Talk about ego-
 tistical ranting!  What a hypocrite.
 
 BTW, 5% is a pretty good percentage in my book.

Since I never said I dont contribute to the problem.. I think Ill point
out... that in a reverse notion...He isn't the problem.  What you replied
back is the problem. I DONT see this list (the other 95%) filled with people
saying that they dont like the list. So..since he isnt the other 95% (maybe
>0.5% complain) and you with a useless post... are (is) the porblem. I know
this post back doesn''t 'help' but I think it brings to light problems with a
list that exists for a purpose. Think of it as a democracy on a list. It
exists for a reason.. and the people support THAT existence.
