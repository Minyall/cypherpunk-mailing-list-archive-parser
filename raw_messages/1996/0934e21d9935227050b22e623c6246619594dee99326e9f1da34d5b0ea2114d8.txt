Not true.  While they may not be able to use offshore techniques
for their wage-slave jobs (though even that isn't always so), 
such techniques can be used to put money beyond the reach of 
their governments, to invest after-tax dollars and to engage in
economic activities which might run afoul of home country laws
and regulations.
