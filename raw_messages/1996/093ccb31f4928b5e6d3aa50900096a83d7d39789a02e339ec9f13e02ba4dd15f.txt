And it should go over even less well than American Clipper.  When that was 
proposed, in April of 1993, there was no standard encryption chip nor the 
immediate prospect of one.  Someone might, at least arguably, have been 
attracted to Clipper with the argument that it's better than no encryption 
at all.  However, now that the NTT chip has been revealed, nobody is going 
to be under the illusion that it's "Clipper or nothing."
