DEFINITIONS for budding phone phreaks:

NPA: Numbering Plan Area - known to us humans as area codes; instituted
circa 1947 for long distance dialing.

DTMF: dual-tone multi-frequency - known to humans as TouchTones(tm); 
used to dial telephones.

Advice:  Instead of getting your friend to build you a red box, get
a SoundBlaster Sound Card and get the sound file that is the
quarter tone.  Play this into a tape recorder or into a greeting card
that records sound and use at your own risk!

Also - find as many back-issues of 2600 (a print publication) and Phrack
(an on-line publication [text files]) as you possibly can.  Memorize
them and you will be on your way to becoming a phone phreak!
