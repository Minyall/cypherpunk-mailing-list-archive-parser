At the bottom of my SS card are these exact words:

"FOR SOCIAL SECURITY AND TAX PURPOSES--NOT FOR IDENTIFICATION"

When I had to renew my California Driver's License, I was asked for my SS
number...a new requirement. I pointed out that the SS number is not for
identification. The clerk gave me a blank look and said I would not get a
driver's license without an SS number. I gave in, preferring to fight other
battles.

(And I would surely lose this battle, probably even if I spend tons of
money on mounting a legal challenge.)

There have been several reports cited here recently about changes in the SS
laws to make the SS number more of an ID number. (It already is, of course,
for taxes, for employers, for credit, for driver's licenses, for student
ID, etc.)

And concerns about "identity theft" when such a simple thing as an SS
number is the key to so many records, rights, etc.
