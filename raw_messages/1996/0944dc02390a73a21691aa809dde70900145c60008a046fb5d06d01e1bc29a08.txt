	I have had a somewhat related idea to this on compression regarding
steaography and which bits are the best ones to use. How about those that a
lossy compression method that's reasonable loses first? These are the ones that
aren't going to be noticed by the viewer, and (if the compression method is
good) will have at least somewhat higher entropy than the rest.
