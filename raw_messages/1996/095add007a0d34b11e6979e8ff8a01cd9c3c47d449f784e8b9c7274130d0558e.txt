According to Mudge (who gave the talk), he *was* going to speak specifically
on SecurID, but they were harassing him or something, and was afraid of a
libel suit if he spoke on it.  Instead, he chose to speak on S/Key flaws,
many of which are the same as SecurID flaws.  All of the attacks were on
the stupidity of the implementations and protocols, not on the cryptographic
algorithms.   Some stuff can be found at http://www.l0pht.com/~mudge .
