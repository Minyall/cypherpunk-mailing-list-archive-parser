Well, that's how they busted the Amateur Action BBS from what I remember.  
Basically they mail you the porno, arrest you as soon as you pick up the box, 
and then that gives them probably cause to get a warrant to rip apart your
computer and charge you with other things.  The charges that were filed 
against Robert Thomas (sysop of the AA BBS) for picking up that box were
eventually cleared, but he was convicted of other charges apparently. 

So it's more used as a tool to find other charges.  Those charges are 
eventually dropped.
