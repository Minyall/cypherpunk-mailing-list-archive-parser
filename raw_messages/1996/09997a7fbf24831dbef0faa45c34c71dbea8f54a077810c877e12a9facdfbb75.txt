I think that's the most likely way to do it.  You'd write a little
applet that'd just chug away, and could perhaps periodically try to 
connect back and deliver results.

Note that you could do it by e-mail too, if your targets read e-mail
with Netscape (or maybe IE; I don't know if it runs applets in the
mail reader when it gets a text/html content mail message).
