    Huh? People are most certainly guilty before "proven" so, the government
just isn't allowed to _assume_ their guilt, or to _act_ like they are guilty.

     If you purchase LSD in America, you are guilty of a felony--Drug 
trafficing. Wether the court _finds_ you guilty or not is another story.
