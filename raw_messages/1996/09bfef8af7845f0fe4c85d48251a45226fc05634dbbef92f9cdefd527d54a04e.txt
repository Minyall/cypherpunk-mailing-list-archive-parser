In Minneapolis, USWest has Telecard phones everywhere, and vending
machines with bill accepters.  The calls are also flat rate at $0.25.
Beware using the Telecard for a long distance call.  I did one from
Seattle to Mpls and it was something like $3.65 for the initial charge.

Can Telecards be audited for usage?  If a TLA black-bags my $25 Telecard
from my wallet, can they reconstruct what calls I made with it?
