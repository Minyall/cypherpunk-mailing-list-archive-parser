This is certainly my position...

I don`t think so. The point is that cryptoanarchic ideals and strong 
cryptography will be too widely deployed to remove them from 
circulation. Also I believe that the sheer amount of traffic over the 
internet will make it virtually impossible to find encrypted messages 
even if strong encryption is outlawed. And last but not least the 
system of anonymous remailers and the ease with which return 
addresses can be forged means people using strong cryptography 
couldn`t be traced anyway.
