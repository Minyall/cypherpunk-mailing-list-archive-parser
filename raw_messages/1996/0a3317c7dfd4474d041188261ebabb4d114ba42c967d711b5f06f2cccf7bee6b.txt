True, but by that time I'll be able to use 2048 or bigger keys with the same
or better performance as 1024 bit keys now.  As long as factoring is
exponential, you can always make it impossible to factor your keys. 
And I think it will always be exponential.

   Ken Thompson has an automobile which he helped design.  Unlike most
   automobiles, it has neither speedometer, nor gas gage, nor any of the
   numerous idiot lights which plague the modern driver.  Rather, if the
   driver makes any mistake, a giant "?" lights up in the center of the
   dashboard.  "The experienced driver", he says, "will usually know
   what's wrong."
