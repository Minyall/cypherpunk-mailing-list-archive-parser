I doubt this will ever happen.  If strong cryptography is ever deployed
worldwide ubiquitously, which is a big if, passive ether sniffing becomes
much harder, but the SIGINT people will likely switch to active attacks. 
Defense against active attacks is much more difficult than against passive
attacks, and requires a host of technologies besides strong crypto (the
one we're lacking most, I think, is a good software engineering
methodology).  I bet the NSA is doing active research on sniffer viruses
and other automated tools for large scale active attacks.
