And I thought this was well worth mentioning on the list:

I am always amused (when I'm not absolutely hysterical) at how certain 
people can sit back and smirk at conspiracy "theories" like the 
"Bilderberg" agenda et al, then you look around and you see:

 1. No major daily newspaper in the U.S. takes any interest at all when
    these most powerful and influential people meet to discuss the fate
    of the world.  What a surprise, huh?

 2. The same people who get on TV a lot and smirk at conspiracies that
    might be believed in by the little people, don't have any trouble
    believing in the wildest, craziest, most unbelievable conspiracy
    of all, as long as it's politically correct, and brings in lots
    of cash.  Screw 'em.
