I agree that this project needed to be done to educate the public, but I
must say I'm glad my name isn't attached to it. 

To answer legitimate concerns about abuse, perhaps version 2 could make the
relevant http logs publicly available? So in addition to checking the
governor's son's driving record, you could check which other IP addresses
have been looking at the governor's son's driving record. Spider detection
and retaliation would also be nice.

(Of course this would have the side effect of increasing the visibility of
the anonymizer/canadianizer/exonizer services, which would not be a bad
thing.)
