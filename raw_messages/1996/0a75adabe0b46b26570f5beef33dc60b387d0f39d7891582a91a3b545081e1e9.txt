They aren't *really* porting Linux to powermac. They're throwing a
little bit of paint on OSF/1 and hiding some stuff in libc.

Looks to me like they are basicly trying to ca$h in on the Linux name
and reputation without contributing anything to the cause.

I personally think that Linux International (they still around?)
should put out a counter press-release informing the public that the
Apple/OSF Linux shares only the name.
