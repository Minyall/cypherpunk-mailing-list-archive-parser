     I think that the purpose of asking a question is to consume _more_ of their 
time. If they read it, they have to decide if and how to respond. Cousme more 
of their resources. It might even be interesting to write a script that automatically
inserts a silly question (like "does it work in france") and mails it back with the
single stroke of a key.
