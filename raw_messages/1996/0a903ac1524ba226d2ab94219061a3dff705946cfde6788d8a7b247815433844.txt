	I have noticed that they ask for one's URL on the page in question.
This information gathering brings to mind the question of if they plan on also
keeping some sort of database. While private rating efforst are not directly
wrongful, given the circumstances involved they may be attempting to mandate
some such (either directly or through lawsuits) via governmental pathways.

	Quite. (Incidentally, that the CyberAngels are associated with
SafeSurf, which has this distinction in their material also, gives the lie to
many of the CyberAngels' claims). I am currently in the process of writing a
response to this proposal, and will post the initial version to cypherpunks.

	They supposedly have the code in question copyrighted. I suspect that
such an attempt will not be valid without changes to copyright laws, but I
am not a lawyer. (It does not appear to me, at least, to have any degree of
true and original creativity involved).
