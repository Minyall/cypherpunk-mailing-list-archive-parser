  Jeff, 
 
 
  On 01 28 96 you say: 
 
    We [cypherpunks] are becoming the "Bad Guys" in a well 
    orchestrated Psy Ops campaign propagated naively by the 
    4th Estate. 
 
 
  A few days ago I bought Markoff and Shimomura's Takedown. I've 
  read the first three chapters. 
 
  In my opinion: 
 
    (1)  the book is an important part of that well orchestrated 
         Psy Ops campaign 

    (2)  the book's designed from the word go to play that part. 
 
 
  Cordially, 
 
  Jim
