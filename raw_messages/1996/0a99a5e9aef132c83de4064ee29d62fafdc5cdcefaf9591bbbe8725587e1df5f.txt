Since nobody mentioned it here, it should at least be mentioned:

There are a lot of children who would, given the opportunity, opt to get
the government involved in monitoring their home situation quite closely.

There are times when you're a child (for some of them) that you can't
feasibly contact the government to interfere, i.e., when the govt.
isn't listening, but, when you know they are listening, and you could
use their help (however intrusive), sometimes that's a whole lot better
than putting up with parents from hell.

It's noteworthy that not a single person on this list has looked at this
from the children's point of view, considering that there are *many* of
them who could use the extra help (albeit bad for parents).
