DHP is "The DataHaven Project", a local (Pittsburgh) ISP "dedicated to
providing anonymous and/or private accounts for users."  The egregious
Law Doctor *could* be running the remailer, but there's no particular
reason to think so.

>That will make a nice anonymous remailer... NOT! Thank you.

It might make a nice test case for the Pennsylvania anti-remailer law.
