Correction, an OTP means a One Time Pad. If it is used more than once, it
is not a One Time Pad. The likelihood of a duplicate random number series 
of any significant length of course is very remote. If it did occur and 
you were able to  to XOR the resultant ciphertexts together, partial or
complete compromise might be possible. An OTP means one time use period,
why call it a One Time Pad, why not call it a Random Number Series or some
other appellation.

This is just another example or more pendant pap. Obviously, you like
Paul, do not know what you are talking about. You have read some
textbooks and think that makes you are an expert. I suggest that you take
some time off and learn some IT and what an OTP is. It most certainly is
not two identical random number series.

Not nearly as irrelevant as your meaningless dribble.
