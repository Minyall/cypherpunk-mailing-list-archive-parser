True, but they aren't any better off either.  40-bits is not secure,
neither is 64-bits.

That just means that it will be classified Top Secret and only those
with a "need to know" will have access.  The government can set the
need to know at any level they want.  Even if they truly try to
restrict access to their key, this does not even imply that they will
not allow it to be freely used.  If I want a message read and am not
cleared for access to the key, I just send it to someone that does.  I
have seen nothing from the government saying that they agree to only
use it if they have a warrant or even any reason to believe that the
message contains data that is important to national interests.  They
are free to decode messages and give the information they obtain to a
competing company.  IBM made the deal to help provide an illusion of
greater security, at least before the insecurity of 40 bits was well
known.  They are actually doing a diservice to their customers by
trying to make them believe that their communitcations are actually
secure using just Notes.  Does the packaging indicate that the U.S.
government has access to more than a third of the key?
