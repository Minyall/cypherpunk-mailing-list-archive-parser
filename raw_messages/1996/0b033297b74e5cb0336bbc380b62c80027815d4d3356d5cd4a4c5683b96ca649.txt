	The different paths going through those different signatures will be
correlated/non-independent, yes.... but that isn't the problem unless you're
considering multiple paths (in a more complicated version).

	IIRC, there have been some sociological studies showing that _everyone_
is linked through 6 or so people. Now, there's the question of whether you
_need_ to be linked to _everyone_ - just everyone with whom you want to do
business (e.g., excluding authoritarian types doing a sting). It does come back
to the elite vs masses distinction; I see nothing wrong (and am in favor of)
separation of the elite from the masses.
