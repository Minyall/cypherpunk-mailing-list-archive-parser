Uh, excuse me, but doesn't SPYRUS in fact market a Fortezza card?  The
very same card being used by the Evil Empire to spread diseased and impure
so-called "cryptography" (with GAK permanently embedded into it) to the
uninformed minions?  And, in participating in this rape of society, are
you nor profiting from the very thing that many of us find so repulsive?
It seems that you've fully cooperated with the GAK ideology (see
http://www.spyrus.com/data/7.shtml) even though it is understood to be
contraindicated in a free and open society. 

Before you go spamming mailing lists again trolling for people with no
scruples who'll whore themselves out to help you fuck over the American
people, you might get enough of a clue to know where you're posting.

For whomever is undertaking the SPYRUS infiltration task, you know what to
do....
