    The problem is that a nobody wanting to join the mailing list to learn
the subject matter of the list probably will not know anyone to sponsor
him.The second problem is that some isps go down occasionally and the mail
bounces back to the list which results in a subscription stop. How than
would one know to whom to go and ask for a recommendation. These  are
certainly things to consider .
