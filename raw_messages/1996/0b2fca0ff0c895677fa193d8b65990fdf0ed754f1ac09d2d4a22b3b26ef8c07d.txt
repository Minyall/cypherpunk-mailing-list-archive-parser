WARNING NOTICE

        It has recently come to the attention of RSA Data
Security, Inc. that certain of its confidential and
proprietary source code has been misappropriated and
disclosed.  Despite such unauthorized use and disclosure,
RSA Data Security reserves all intellectual property rights
in such source code under applicable law, including without
limitation trade secret and copyright protection.  In
particular, RSA Data Security's RC2 (TM) symmetric block
cipher source code has been illegally misappropriated and
published.  Please be advised that these acts, as well as
any retransmission or use of this source code, is a
violation of trade secret, copyright and various other state
and federal laws.  Any person or entity that acquires,
discloses or uses this information without authorization or
license to do so from RSA Data Security, Inc. is in
violation of such laws and subject to applicable criminal
and civil penalties, which may include monetary and punitive
damages, payment of RSA's attorneys fees and other equitable
relief.

        RSA Data Security considers misappropriation of its
intellectual property to be most serious.  Not only is this
act a violation of law, but its publication is yet another
abuse of the Internet.  RSA has begun an investigation and
will proceed with appropriate action against anyone found to
have violated its intellectual property rights.

        Anyone having information about the misappropriation
identified above is encouraged to contact RSA directly.
