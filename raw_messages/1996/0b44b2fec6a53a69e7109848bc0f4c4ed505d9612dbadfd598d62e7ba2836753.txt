You pay no attention whatsoever to key distribution, the fact that 
this is just a form of permutation and no substitution is used, also 
how do you account for the fact that the user`s random number source 
may not be strong, even recognized rng`s like the keyboard latency 
routines in pgp grind to a halt when faced with a hardware 
perculiarity like a keyboard buffer etc...
