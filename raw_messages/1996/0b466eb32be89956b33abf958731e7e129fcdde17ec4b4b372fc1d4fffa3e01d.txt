TOTO Enterprises is proud to announce the release of their latest product, PLP/Pretty 
Lousy Privacy.

   PLP allows the user to send messages purporting to be encrypted but, in fact, 
containing no encryption, whatsoever.  This will allow God-and-everybody to read all of 
your 'secret' missives.
 
   Got something you promised not to tell anyone, but you just can't keep a secret?  Use 
PLP, and claim astonishment that someone 'broke the code'.
   Feeling like a loser, because nobody reads your eMail?  Use PLP and excite the 
imaginations of busybodies everywhere.
   Got competition for that job promotion?  Send a nasty chain-letter about the boss 
using your competitor's name and PLP, and you can start breaking out the champagne the 
minute you hit Send.
   Work at the White House?  No need to explain, just use PLP and those late-night 
meetings in underground parking garages will be a thing of the past.

   Impressed?
   Just listen to what Dr.Dimitri Vulis KOTM has to say about PLP:
   "Best encryption program going.  You can bet your sweet ass that that murdering 
Armenian bastard, Ray Arachelian, didn't write it."

   Yes, the secret is out -- PLP/Pretty Lousy Programming is nothing you'd expect, and 
less, in the latest encryption technology.
   And the best part is, you can export PLP without a license. (We checked with the 
janitor at the Federal Building, and he thought it would be OK.)

  So start using PLP today, and let 'everyone' know about the cypherpunks 
secret plot against Dr.Dimitri Vulis KOTM.
