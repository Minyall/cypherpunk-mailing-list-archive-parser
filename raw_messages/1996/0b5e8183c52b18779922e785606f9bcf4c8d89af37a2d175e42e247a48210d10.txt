Suggestion 1 on how to diminish the feeble S/N ratio on cypherpunks:

        make it a newsgroup

Suggestion 2:

        make it an unmoderated newsgroup


I can think of nothing that would cause the remaining clue to flee faster
than a CP newsgroup in wide distribution (if it were gatewayed to the list)
