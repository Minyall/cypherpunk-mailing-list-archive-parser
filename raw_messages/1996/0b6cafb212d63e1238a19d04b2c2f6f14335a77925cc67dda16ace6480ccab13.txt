The above is wrong from two standpoints: 

Locally: if my taste is sufficiently different from that of other people,
why should I follow their preferences?

Globally: Vladimir's recommendations lead to a vicious circle of
"tyranny" of popular sites because hte more people view a site, the more
will follow and the site's "attractiveness" rating will go even higher.

It is similar to a recommendation to buy stocks when they are rising.
If enough people follow it, stock crashes like in 1929 are imminent.
