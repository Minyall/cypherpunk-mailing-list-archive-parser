I was going to post on this topic, especially on a paraphrase of the
(ostensible) original. I still want to, but let me play either the
skeptical or responsible journalist (reader's choice of adjectives). 
 
Anonymous has *not* revealled the original source as he/it/she claimed.
They have asserted it came from Xinhua news agency. Will Anonymous post a
pointer to where we can access on the internet the original? News feed,
date, and time of posting, as well as message ID should suffice.
