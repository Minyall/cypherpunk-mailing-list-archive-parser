   3-12-96. TWP:

   "Making Connections With Dots To Decipher U.S. Spy
   Spending. Panel's Report Indirectly Discloses Details It
   Urged Keeping Secret."

      Buried in the commission's report is a chart that
      provides a striking account of previously secret spy
      spending and personnel levels for the CIA, NSA, DIA and
      NRO. The chart also confirms that the NSA, together with
      its various military service components employs the most
      people, a total of nearly 40,000 eavesdroppers and
      codebreakers. It appears to have an annual budget of
      around $3.7 billion.
