In taxhaven industry jargon, "clean" means they are avoiding taxes only. 
No drugs, no money laundering, no violent crime, no stolen money, no
fraud. 

Many fortune 500 companies have offshore corporations for "self
insurance".  Many many movies have corporations offshore just for that
movie.  These are type of "clean" corporations that taxhavens like.
