Then perhaps you need new search tools!

My own searches of one of the mysteries you mentioned, BlackNet, produce
lots of informative results. But, then, I use Alta Vista, the One True
Search Engine.

(Actually, all similar search engines, e.g. Excite, Yahoo, Inktomi, etc.,
produce comparable results.)

And since I have been seeing your messages--which I presume is roughly
coterminous with you subscription to this list--there have been several
mentions of my Cyphernomicon FAQ. I suggest you consult this for long
explanations of many Cypherpunks topics.
