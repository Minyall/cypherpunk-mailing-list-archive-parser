	Do they allow non-profit usage? If so, you could send out a new version
that supported ecash payments, with an agreement not to use it for profit. I'd
call building up a reserve against legal fees a justifiable action for a
non-profit organization (if the interest went back into the same account or
toward operating the remailer), but IANAL. Could someone who is comment,
preferably after looking over the RSA license?
