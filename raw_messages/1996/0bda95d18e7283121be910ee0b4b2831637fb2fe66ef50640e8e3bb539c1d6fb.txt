Oh yeah, very easily.  Can you say 'proxy server'?  Corporations [including
the one I work for] have been using them for quite some time to control
Internet access.  For example, everytime I try to hit anything in the
GeoCities domain I get a nice little message saying I've been caught and to
stop being naughty.  You can get around it by using services (like
Anonymizer) beyond the proxy server that get pages, files, etc for you.
Assuming, of course, that the ISPs don't block those as well.

Absolutely nothing.

I wouldn't.  It's not even a crypto issue.  That's like asking how you
would use your tea kettle to peel this orange: sure, you *could* do it, but
why?

I think your pegged 'bogometer' had it pegged.
