Why? UNIX passwords with password shadowing are as secure as any password
system is going to get.  If your security holes are with passwords, its
because your admin is to lazy to install needed security provissions, not
because the system of checking passwords is bad.

If you're worried about network sniffing and the like, get SSH.  Other
than that you're wasting your time.
