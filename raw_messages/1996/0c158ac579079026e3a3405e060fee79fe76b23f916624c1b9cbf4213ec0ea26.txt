Hi Folks,

There is an interesting article by Simon Garfinkle in this
morning's(Apr 2nd) electronic version of the San Jose Mercury news.
Its on the index page so I don't think you need an account to read
it.

The article deals with the new key management features and extensions
in Viacrypt and how PRZ is upset since it allows employers to read
their employees messages.
