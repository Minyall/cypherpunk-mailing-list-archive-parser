I'd assume that the magic word here is "banks".  It's usually no
problem to export strong crypto from US, if it's used only for banking
purposes.  IBM delivers SmartCards with full Triple-DES to
bank-customers in Germany: absolutely no problem.


My personal oppinion is, that banks
a) don't encrypt arbitrary data, but only specific accounting data
b) banks can be quite easily house-searched, if you really want to get
   a hold on their data


Have a nice day,
