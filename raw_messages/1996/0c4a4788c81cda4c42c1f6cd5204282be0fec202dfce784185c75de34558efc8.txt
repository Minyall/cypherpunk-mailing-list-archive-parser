Yeah, I don't particularly enjoy rants, but I engage in them myself
occasionally, so I'm willing to cut Rich some slack.

We've since mended fences and we're working in the same direction. I had
thought his initial actions were slightly irrational, but now I know him
a bit better, I think.

Both of us are working in good faith, and that's what's important here.
In particular, the NeoNazi slime are really starting to piss of both of
us. Can anyone say "defamation," on this fascist's darling little page
at Georgia State: [ http://www.gsu.edu/~hisjwbx/ZUNDEL ]

Now, this guy copied that file from my web site. Fine -- it was up for
FTP. But editing my comments to *support* Neo-Nazis and leaving my name
is just fucking too much. I've sent him polite mail requesting a change.
We'll see what happens.

Cypherpunk relevance? Authentication for web pages. There's no reason
for a reasonable person to believe, at first glance, that I was *not*
the author.

Perhaps someone has suggested this before, but should a web browser's
functionality be extended to support authentication via an automated
PGP-type mechanism? Using comments, possibly. I guess I'm just pissed
over this attribution of Zundelscheistenviews to me, but has anyone else
run into such a problem?

(Legal threats and complaints to sysadmins are of course another
alternative...)
