	Uh...  Wait a minute...  The only ones to blame for the dearth
of S/HTTP systems are Tereasa systems and EIT.  While the rest of us have
been working on and developing for SSL those guys have stonewalled and
sat on it.  I know.  You ever try browsing for S/HTTP information.  Most of
the links on their site with any useful information refuse access to anyone
other that EIT members.  We've had a freely available SSL reference
implentation available for ages.  AFAIK they STILL don't have a working
reference implementation.  When they do, you can bet it will be EIT only.
They're so hell bent on keeping total control over it that they now
strangled it to death.  We now have freeware SSLeay and nobody is even
interested in screwing S/HTTP.  Forget that it's a better idea.  The idea
was stillborn because the parents strangled it a birth.
