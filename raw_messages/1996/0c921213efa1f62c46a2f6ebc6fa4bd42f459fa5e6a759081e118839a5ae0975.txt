Matt, I don't know exactly what resources you've got at your disposal
these days, but we'd be interested in volunteering some time and
effort on this.  We can help out with things like interface design,
device simulation, board layout, fab, and assembly.  (Unless you want
to make the whole thing a one-man thesis project, of course ;-)
