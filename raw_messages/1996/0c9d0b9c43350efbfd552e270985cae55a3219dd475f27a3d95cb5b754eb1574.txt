[snip]

In the late 1970's (I think), Victor Marchetti (formerly of CIA) wrote
The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence (title approx.), and the CIA was
allowed by the courts to censor portions of the book.

As I remember, those portions were released later in a new edition,
primarily because the blacked-out parts were not in fact big-time
secrets, but simply embarrassments for the agency.

Is this a representative case?
