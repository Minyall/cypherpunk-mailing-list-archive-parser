Let's see what the study group recommends. There are a lot of things the
government can do, and plenty of historical precedent. To take one example,
in the merchant marine industry the government for years paid a subsidy for
shipbuilders to add certain "national defense features" to ships they were
building, to harden them in excess of normal civilian requirements so
they'd be robust in time of war. No shipbuilder could afford such features
unaided, and without them we either had a dramatically reduced shipping
capability in wartime or a very vulnerable one. Things have changed since
then, but the basic principles in the example are still valid.

There are no restrictions on using as good domestic crypto as you can get,
and this issue is about the robustness of our domestic information
infrastructure. Clearly if hardening were cost-justified to the civilian
companies it would have been done already.

One of the core problems is that the benefits from hardening cannot be
captured by the individual compnanies, so they cannot cost-justify doing
it. But the losses from failure to harden can cost the wider society much
treasure. That's a natural case for government intervention on behalf of
the wider society. It's exactly like the "lighthouse" argument. The
benefits from a lighthouse can't justify an individual shipbuilder building
one, but the losses to society from the random aggregation of shipwrecks
are far greater than the cost of lighthouses. Ergo, the government builds
the lighthouses.

Irrelevant to the central issue we're discussing, and by comparison, a gnat.

This isn't about preventing domestic deployment but assisting it. You are
raising an entirely unrelated issue--crypto export policy.

Again as irrelevant as the argument that we shouldn't jail criminals until
we've eliminated the economic inequities that allegedly produce crime.
