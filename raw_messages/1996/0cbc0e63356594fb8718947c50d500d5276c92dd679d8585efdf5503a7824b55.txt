Interesting. 

First, common law only applies if there is no specific law against it. In
some countries there are specific laws.  Is your lawyer sure there is no
specific law against this in the USA?

Second, maybe they are lending to you.  Or maybe you are laundering money.

This also depends on the bank forms.  If they ask you to list any other
aliases you use, or your social security number, etc, you probably need to
lie to fill out the form. 

Think your lawyer would be willing to give his name and a statement on
this?  If a cypherpunk ever got in trouble and could say, "I was told by
the lawyer XYZZY this was legal", it might help.  :-)
