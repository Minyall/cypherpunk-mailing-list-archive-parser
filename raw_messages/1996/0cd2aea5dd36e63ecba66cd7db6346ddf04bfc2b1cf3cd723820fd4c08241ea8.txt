Sorry to post this question here, but I know of no other group with
folks who would know. Have any of the "spiders" such as Alta Vista
been sent to see just how many US sites have been blackened in the
protest? The approximate number and percentage of US sites blackened
might be interesting. In my limited surfing, I have been gratified
to see the _widespread_ response -- but I am not the typical user.
