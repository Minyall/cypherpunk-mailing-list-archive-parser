This raises a question:  If you provide a place for a crypto chip but don't 
install it, shouldn't you be able to export it?  But the software analogy, 
crypto hooks, the government is trying to restrict them.  This is why I 
think the latter interpretation is flawed:  Historically, the mere fact that 
a system can interface to another one that can do crypto can't be used to 
restrict it.
