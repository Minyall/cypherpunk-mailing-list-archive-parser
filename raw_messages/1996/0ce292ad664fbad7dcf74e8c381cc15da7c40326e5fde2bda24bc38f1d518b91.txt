I think I would discuss this with the author before going public, to give
him the usual opportunity to clean up before all hell breaks loose. However,
that is what I'd call "work" rather than "fun", so I'd want paying for it.

No doubt I'll take it up with Eric at some point, when neither of us has
anything better to do.

My impression is that Eric is more interested in speed and functionality than
strict security (and considering the incredible vulnerability that is more or
less inherent in an SSL implementation, I feel the same). I could be wrong, of
course.

I will say that I'm not aware of any problems that a good firewall and physical
security don't take care of. That isn't to say there aren't any - I haven't
looked that hard.

Cheers,

Ben.
