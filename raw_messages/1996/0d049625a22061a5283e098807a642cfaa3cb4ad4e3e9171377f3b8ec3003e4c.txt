Tim O'Reilly's been talking publicly about starting a "Sierra Club"
which would "protect" the "environment of the Net".  What does he want
to do?

It might be a way to tell companies what kind of software they can
publish and at what price.  ORA has been having trouble competing with
Microsoft.  Naturally, they cast themselves as altruistic good guys.

Whatever O'Reilly is talking about, it sounds like more trouble from
the general vicinity of the EFF Board.
