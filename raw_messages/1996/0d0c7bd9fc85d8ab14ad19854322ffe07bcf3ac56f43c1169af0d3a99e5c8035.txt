Hi!

I am sure this was discussed already.
Is there meanwhile a http relay cgi script out there which could be
packaged with the common http daemons (like cern, apache or ncsa) ?
The use of that is obvious: every new web server could be used as
anonymizer and thus proxies would have a hard time to filter all those
sites in censorship countries.

Greetings
