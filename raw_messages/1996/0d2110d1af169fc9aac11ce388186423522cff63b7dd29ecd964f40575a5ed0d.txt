If people where more used to regularly violating laws, one more law
violation would mean much.  Practice makes perfect.

"Your Honor, I plead necessity.  The reason I violated this law was so that
I would have plenty of practice in case I ever find myself in a totalitarian
state.  Since the laws of the US and International Law permit (and in some
cases require) me to violate the laws of a totalitarian state, I need to
practice law violation under the less stressful circumstances of the current
US.  Without practice, I won't be able to violate totalitarian laws smoothly
and thus might have to obey them.  This could put me in jeopardy under
International Law.  Necessity defense."
