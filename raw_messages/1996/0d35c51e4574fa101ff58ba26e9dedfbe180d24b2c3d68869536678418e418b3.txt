The furor over the Oregon DMV database seems a bit misplaced: this type of 
information is considered to be in the public domain.  You can buy it on 
tape/whatever for business purposes direct from the state.  There are lots 
of people who I don't want to have any information about me who can get 
what's on file down at the Mass Registry of Motor Vehicles.  That's the way 
it works.

Now, there's lots of times when it would have been nice to have access to 
that information myself.  Use your imagination.  Why should the public be 
denied the right to access this information when businesses have had that 
privilege for some time?  I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for it to be 
taken away from businesses, either, though I suppose the states will now 
pass laws prohibiting the public dissemination of this data.

BTW, has anyone heard about the Post Office now requiring that all airmail 
packages over 1 lb must now be posted in person (no mail drop boxes)? 
 Someone told me this, and it sounds just stupid and pointless enough to be 
true.  I won't have a chance to go to the PO until Monday, so I'd 
appreciate any updates.
