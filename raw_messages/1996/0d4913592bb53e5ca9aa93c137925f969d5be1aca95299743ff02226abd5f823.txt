I'm wondering whether they properly handled the copyright status of some of 
those (silly) texts.  While it is somewhat nice of you (in regards to them) 
to say what you did, it is  possible that they lost their copyrights decades 
ago by printing them (even internally) without the (then) appropriate 
"circle-C" copyright notice.  Chances are good that none of this material 
could survive a genuine copyright test case today.
