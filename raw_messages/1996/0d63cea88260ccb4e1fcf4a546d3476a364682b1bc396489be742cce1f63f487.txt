Well, this is a potentially confusing hypothetical, and a short paragraph
description doesn't do it justice.

- did not the patient have backups? if not, why not?

- the doctor will have records of what _he_ did, and records of _what was
disclosed to him_ by the patient. This should be enough, as his "end" has
done exactly what was agreed to.

(Indeed, the unrevealed parts of the dossier are not known to him, but then
they were "unrevealed," which is the whole point. That the "unrevealed"
parts were lost or destroyed in a head crash, or whatever, is not germane
at all.)
