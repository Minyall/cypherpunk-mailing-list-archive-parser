Actually, I think those companies have been coerced. Microsoft will be next.

Remember that IBM and Microsoft have a very clear understanding of what
government coercion is, both at the hands of the DOJ's anti-trust section.

I agree with Lucky's earlier hypothesis that HP's doing this to curry favor
for government contracts in lieu of an actual marketing strategy, and I
leave TIS's motives up to the list as an exercise. ;-).

Cheers,
