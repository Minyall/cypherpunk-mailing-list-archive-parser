This is not good enough. Many people, feeling secure on their side of a
firewall, put proprietary information in their .plan files. Since the
the Navigator is running inside that firewall, we can't give access to
that data to sources coming from outside the firewall. Given the many
ways to construct a URL, the safest was to prevent any access to the
finger port (along with a number of others).
