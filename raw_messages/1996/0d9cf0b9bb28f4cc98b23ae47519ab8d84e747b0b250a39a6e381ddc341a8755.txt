This statement is very questionable. Various classes of shareholders
(such as pension funds and IRA account holders, among others) pay no 
taxes on dividends. Corporations pay taxes only from about 30% of
dividend income that they receive.

There is, in fact, a neat theorem that says that (*_under certain 
assumptions_*) the value of a firm does not depend on its capital
structure.
