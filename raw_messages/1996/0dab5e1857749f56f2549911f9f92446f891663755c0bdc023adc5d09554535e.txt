makerandom is broken anyway.  Security alert: don't use +makerandom in
pgp2.6.3/pgp2.6.2.  The random number generator isn't initialised
before use.  (Details courtesy of Jeff Schiller I haven't looked that
up in the source in detail yet).

I was under the impression that with the Legal_Kludge option for
pgp263i, that it already was compatible with old versions of pgp using
the version byte of 2.

What else does pgp263ui offer?  The GNU license?  What about pgp3?
Some people aren't going to be very happy if you do a GNU version of
that, as GNU doesn't preclude selling commercially provided that
source is provided.

PS Steve and friends: I've got some stealth code close to usable in
the form of a patch to pgp263 if you want it :-)
