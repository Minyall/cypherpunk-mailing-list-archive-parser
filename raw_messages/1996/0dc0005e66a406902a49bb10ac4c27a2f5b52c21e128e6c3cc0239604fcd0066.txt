Years ago I was participating in a moderated cryptography mailing list
hosted in Japan. I'm sorry I don't recall the name of our gracious
moderated from Tohoku U. Eventually he had no time for it and let it die.
Anyway I recall posting Gilmore's DES code to that list. How ironic.

Anyway, it looks like almost every packet these days goes via mae-west and/or
mae-east.
