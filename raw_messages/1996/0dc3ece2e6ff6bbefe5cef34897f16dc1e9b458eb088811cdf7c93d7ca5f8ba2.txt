A) Only accept files with valid PGP signatures from accepted keys - this
is one area where PGP's commandline interface is a plus - just write a
batch script. Demand that a separate file be sent first, signed by a
certain key. This file would contain valid filenames for the rest of the
session. If a non-listed file is sent, kill the session.  This could all
be automated with a simple program. You could probably even use SSLs and
similar to do it on a website if you could swill the PGP bit - maybe a
plugin?

B) bounce trash back.
