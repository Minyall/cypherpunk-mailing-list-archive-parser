It may be unpleasant, but it's a fact that there was a real security
hole here.  There is a well known buffer overrun bug in finger that a
lot of people inside firewalls haven't fixed.  Using gopher: URLs
in IMG tags it was possible to do nasty things.  We tried to err on
the side of permissivity, but finger was one port we just couldn't
allow.  Yes, it sucks.  So does someone reaching through your firewall
and running commands as root.
