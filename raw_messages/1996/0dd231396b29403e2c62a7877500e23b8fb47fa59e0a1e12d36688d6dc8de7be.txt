Well, I don't know about Sandy or Tim, but I found the rants between Jim & Uni somewhat amusing (although I myself only skimmed through them) because for every huff&puff which transpired between them, Uni was prompted to dig up more info from the depths of his knowledge, and this effect was quite interesting, psychologically, as well as in regard of the info which came out of it.   

I expect Jim & Uni could become great friends!  (giggle)
