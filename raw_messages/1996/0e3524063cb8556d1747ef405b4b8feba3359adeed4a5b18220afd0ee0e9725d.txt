Just in case someone else is interested, the archives are at
http://www.hks.net/cpunks/index.html.  The entire history of the list is 
there, and you can browse by date, subject, or author.  You can also read 
this list and many others via the hks.net nntp server.

There's a lot of good stuff there, even if you're not interested in 
Detweiller.
