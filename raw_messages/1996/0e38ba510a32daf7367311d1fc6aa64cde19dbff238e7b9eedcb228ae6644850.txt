Again, you may want to do a web search with Yahoo (www.yahoo.com) or
hotbot (www.hotbot.com) or whatever.  There is loads of good info out
there and pointers to ftp sites ... you just need to do a little bit of
legwork to find it all.  (Along with being creative when asked for
keywords by the search engines)
