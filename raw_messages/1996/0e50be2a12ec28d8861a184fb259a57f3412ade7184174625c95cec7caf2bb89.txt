I noted long ago that one disadvantage with having a single, standardized 
encryption chip (like Clipper, even with the key-escrow un-enabled) is that 
the NSA has plenty of money in its budget to build a fake chip that can be 
installed during a black-bag job.  True, if they could fake one chip they 
could fake 10, but it's harder to do and the demand for any single kind of 
chip might drop to one per year.   Unfortunately, a sufficiently-complex 
FPLD would probably sub for anything if it were in the right package...
