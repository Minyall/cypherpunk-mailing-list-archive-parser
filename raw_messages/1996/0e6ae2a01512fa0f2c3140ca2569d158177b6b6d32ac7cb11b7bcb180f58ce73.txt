	I've got someone (Phil Agre) who wants to forward the scientology
stuff (i.e., on their potential troubling of anonymous remailers et al)... _if_
he can avoid any legal problems by doing so. Any legal opinions on what that's
been posted on cypherpunks he _can_ forward without the likelihood of legal
hassles?
	Thanks,
	-Allen
