Why should that be a problem?   It's the customer's money, isn't it?  It's 
not like the bank is making a loan.  It's the customer who should be 
worried...about the bank's identity.

Remember "plausible denial."  Shouldn't we believe that if a bank cannot 
know its customer, likewise it isn't responsible for who that customer is?  
A bank's legitimate interests should  not include acting as enforcer for the 
government, so any system that prevents this from happening is helpful.  

And I don't think that a bank can ever be embarrassed (assuming bank 
accounts are anonymous) by it being revealed that some particular bad guy 
kept his money there, any more than other cash-based (anonymous) businesses 
are embarrassed if it is revealed that some bad guy used their services.
