It seems to me that every time I send a message to cypherpunks, I get a 10k
message entitled "RESPONSE FROM CYBERPROMO" from "abusebot@savetrees.com
(Mail AutoResponder)" .

It stands to reason that everyone who posts this list gets the same thing.
I've certainly seen enough people here complain about it.

So. The messages all say send complaints to wallace@cyberpromo.com . That's
what I'm going to do. With every message I get from cyberpromo from now on.

I would expect that if everyone on this list who gets one of these things
-- which I suspect is everyone who posts here lately -- turned right around
and sent it on to this wallace@cyberpromo.com address, those, er,
caprophageous cretins, (thanks, DCF; don't sue me for copyright violations
;-)) would get the hint in a hurry.

I'm starting with the one I have, and, of course, I'll also do it for the
message I get from sending *this* posting.

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
