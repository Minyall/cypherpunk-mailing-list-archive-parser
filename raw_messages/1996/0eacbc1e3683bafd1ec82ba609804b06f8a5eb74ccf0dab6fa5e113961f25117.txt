Simple.  Let us consider all religions:

Now, here are our possibilities:
1.  All are right
2.  One or more is right, the remaining are wrong
3.  None are right

One of these possibilities must be true, but we can not know which one.
(This is why "at most" is the very phrase that implictly admits there
must be some universal truth concerning the validity of religions)

Please see above. Not knowing something does not mean it does not exist.

You are too quick to argue.  The statement that there must be some
universal truth even if we can not know what it is seems quite accepting
of the limits of human perception.

Simple.  A man may perceive he can fly unassisted.  However, once he
steps off the building the universal truth of gravity takes hold of his
ass.
