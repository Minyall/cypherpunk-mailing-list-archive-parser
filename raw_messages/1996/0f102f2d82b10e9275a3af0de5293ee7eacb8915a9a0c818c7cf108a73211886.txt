I think (from memory) this is called "homoalphabetic".

Encyclopaedia Brittanica (Cryptology - article by Gus Simmons)
says that it is still vulnerable to frequencies of digraphs, trigraphs
etc.  But even Gauss was keen on it once.

I guess it might have value as a part of another system, making a known plaintext
into one of many.  Whether it's worth the increased cyphertext size in a system
you'd hope to be immune to known plaintext attacks anyway is another question.
