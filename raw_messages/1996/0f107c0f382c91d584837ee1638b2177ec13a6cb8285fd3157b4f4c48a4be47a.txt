      Dear Friends of Word [http://www.word.com]:
            
      Two things:
      
      1.  Word has been nominated for 3 (three) of the 1996 Cool Site of the 
      Year Awards (Cool Site of the Year, Cool Design of the Year, and Cool 
      Web Designer of the Year).  Please vote for us.  We're literally 
      begging you.  Does this seem desperate?  Cool Site of the Year is 
      located at http://cool.infi.net/vote.html
      
      2.  Please check out Word [http://www.word.com].  Right now you can 
      experience our special feature "Guyana," a super-deluxe documentary 
      about three NYC artists' (Bob Braine, Mark Dion, and Alexis Rockman) 
      six-week trek through the Amazon jungle.  It's got art, animation, 
      text, and an original score. Sort of like a movie. But not. Anyway, 
      it's real good. Mmmmm!
      
            Truly Yours,
            WORD
      
      
      
      3.  I know we said there would only be two things, but we just thought 
      we should mention that if you've requested to be removed from our 
      mailing list, it *will* happen very soon.  We've had a bit of trouble 
      keeping everything up to date.  Word swears to remove you from the 
      list.
