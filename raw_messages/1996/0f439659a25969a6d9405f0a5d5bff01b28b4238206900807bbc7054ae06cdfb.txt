It's a pretty sad statement of how poorly this list is functioning when
the RC2 source can be publically released but people would rather
sling mud over glorified keystroke trappers and rant about Nazi deathcamps.

Our friends at the NSA must be pleased with the slow death of this group.

Sadly,
Bofur.
