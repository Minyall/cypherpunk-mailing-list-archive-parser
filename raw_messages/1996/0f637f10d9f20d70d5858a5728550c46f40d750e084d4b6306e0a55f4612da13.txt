What will be the maximum keysize for a domestic encryption client? It it is
larger than 1024 bits, there will be interoperability problems with foreign
clients. If the domestic client is limited to 1024 bits, it would set a bad
precedence, since it would effectively require that the encryption key is
smaller than the largest signature key.
