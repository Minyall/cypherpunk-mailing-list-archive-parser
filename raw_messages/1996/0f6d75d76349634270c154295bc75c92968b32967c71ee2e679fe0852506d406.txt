But the people at the start of the line know that if they don't 
hang together, they will end up dead, and if that they act purely 
selfishly only the last two will benefit. Because they want to stay 
alive, a better solution for the first person to propose equal shares, 
which would be opposed by the last two players, but supported by the rest.
He could also split the money only amongst the first half of 
the gang, since he only needs half the votes.
