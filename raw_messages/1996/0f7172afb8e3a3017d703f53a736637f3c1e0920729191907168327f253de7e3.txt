    somewhere along the line, the body of your message was lost...

    the concept is interesting... diplomatic immunity is not automatic in 
that it implies diplomatic recognition.  does a rogue state enjoy the 
privilege of obviously bogus diplomatic passports?  the diplomatic 
passport is a "gentleman's agreement" to facilitate trading intelligence 
officers --sarcastic maybe, truthful?  been there, done that.

    if nothing else, the bearer of a diplomatic passport can be 
effectively forcing house arrest in the embassy/consulate while the
host government forces a recall --I hope the islands have a luxury 
hotel in every port of call.

    actually, I would be more interested in your comments on the wire
fraud charges used for an "insufficient" lab facility of a known 
microbiologist who happens to be a kook.  standard US procedural use
of conspiracy or wire fraud and/or conspiracy to force a plea bargain.
In return, we get more government bureaucracy, and probably government
review of credentials, or licensing.  academic freedom?
