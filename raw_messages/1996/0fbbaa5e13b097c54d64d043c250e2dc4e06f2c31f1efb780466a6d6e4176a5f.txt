That ``solution'' assumes that cypherpunks are rather stupid.  Since
everyone can do that calculation it is quite clear that at least 18
would refuse to vote (or fail to vote) in a way that produces such a
result.  On the other hand, a proposal by the first guy to split the
proceeds equally among the first ten should be satisfactory to the first
ten.  On that basis nobody dies and ten receive two million each, if we
assume that each is a simple profit maximizer.

I think that that result is stable, but am not going to try to prove
that it is.  (If the result is not stable, it should be relatively easy
to establish that fact.)
