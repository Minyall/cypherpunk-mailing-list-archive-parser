confiscation of his property.  Or did you think it would?

Okay, here are some questions you should be asking them:

1.  Why was this one highly negative section added to what is otherwise 
apparently a good bill?  Whose fingerprints are on it?

2.  "All" bills can be amended.  "Why not this section?!?"

3.  "Why is this section so ambiguous?"

4.  What crimes, EXACTLY, do you intend to prosecute using this section?

5.  Can you list any examples of REAL incidents that have already occurred 
that would be in violation of this section if it were already in law?  
(Surely they know of some, right?!?)  If they can think of no such examples, 
ask them why they are putting a "useless provision" into a law and why is it 
so important that it be there that we can't have it removed.

6.  And finally, "what are you guys afraid of?"

If that is all that I was planning to do to stop this bill, I would consider 
myself to be a slacker.
