So far, so good.

Pressurized conduit is a favorite paranoid technique - if the 
Bad Guy cuts open the conduit to get at the fiber, your alarm
system notices the pressure drop and goes off.
For slightly less paranoid scenarios, you can use heavy narrow
conduit with epoxied joints, and the extra alarm wire or two
to help detect cutting.  For substantially more paranoid types,
you can always fill your conduit with some sort of flammable
substance that reats with air...
