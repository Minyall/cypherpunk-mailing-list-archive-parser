FYI
In the January issue of InfoCanada, the front page has what amounts to a 
press release on Digital Equipment's Digital Internet Personal Tunnel for 
Windows 95. There is also info on a companian product for Unix. I am 
trying to get some information on this. Has anyone heard of this technology?

In the January 18th 96 issue of EDN, Pg 57 has an article about secure 
wireless designs. In this article they talk about securing devices such 
as garage-door openers, and keyless entry systems for cars and buildings. 
It is a little shy on cryptographic info, but they do talk about crypto 
applications for these products.
