Timmy May is an ignorant coward. He's got nothing better to do,
so he starts up flame wars on this mailing list. He can't contribute
anything crypto-relevant because he knows nothing about cryptography.

This is a lie. Anyone who's been subscribed to this mailing list for
a while knows that Timmy May posts to most personal attacks (inlcuiding
attacks on his many enemies' religion and ethnicity), lies, fabricated
quotes, flame bait, and overall noise.
