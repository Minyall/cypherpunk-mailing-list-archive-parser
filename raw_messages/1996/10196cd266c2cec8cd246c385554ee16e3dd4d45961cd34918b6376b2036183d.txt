The technical term is "homosexual panic".  It refers to people who have 
grown up being constantly told that they should hate homosexuals, yet
are constantly waking up at 3am from a dream in which they were taking
a nine inch cock up their ass and loving it.

It's related to the fact that most rapists are actually terrified of
women.

As always, consider the source.
