   We've filed at our Web site two May 24 Science articles on 
   the NIST team's research on quantum superposition, reported 
   by the NYT yesterday (keyed ONE_two): 
 
   A Research News article on the research by Gary Taubes, 
 
      "Schizophrenic Atom Doubles As Schrodinger's Cat -- or 
      Kitten." 
 
 
   And, the Research Article: 
 
      "A 'Schrodinger's Cat' Superposition State of an Atom." 
 
      C. Monroe, D. M. Meekhof, B. E. King, D. J. Wineland. 
 
 
   Due to the heavy use of equations and figures, the material 
   is imaged in JPEG (compressed) format -- 150 resolution and 
   enlarged a bit for readability, so the files are fairly 
   large:
