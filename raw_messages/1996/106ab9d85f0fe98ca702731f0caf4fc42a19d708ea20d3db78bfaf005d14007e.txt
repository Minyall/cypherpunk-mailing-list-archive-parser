	No, but you might want to take a look at some psychiatrists & clinical
psychologists who are doing some work over the Net, including anonymnity. It's
discussed in the most recent or next-most-recent US News & World Report; I'll
try to remember to bring my copy in to give the URLs mentioned. I did spot that
they could use some boosts on the anonymnity and privacy side - they weren't
using encryption, and the payments were via credit card. Someone from Mark
Twain or Digicash contacting them would appear to be a good idea, as well as
someone encouraging them to use Mixmaster-type anonymous remailers; I'd prefer
if someone with more experience than I sent them an email about it.
