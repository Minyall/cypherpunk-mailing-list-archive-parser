I know that this is off topic but..

How can I stop these idiot's sending me junk E-mail. I am posting 
this here because this group sounds like one of the only intelligent 
groups of people on the internet. Whatever mailing list I got on is 
sure working I am getting 2-3 junk e-mail's per day.

Thanks

Steve
