That would certainly be less of a stretch than some other commerce clause
cases. Crypto can be used interstate, and there's a compelling state
interest in form of The Four Horsemen. Heck, we should all thank our lucky
stars that our freedom-loving congresscritters let us use computers at all.
I believe it was Wickard who was told he couldn't grow food to feed his own
pigs because the government has a compelling state interest in keeping
interstate food prices high. Surely terrorism and kiddie porn, which is all
people ever use the net (let alone crypto) for, are even more important than
high food prices.
