Don't ask the question as though it is theoretical. Don't try
answering it as though your personal values have any bearing, because
there is indeed an objective answer here. Try doing some game theory
simulations and see how well unilateral disarmament works.

Oh, and don't give us stuff about how humans are above evolutionary
pressures or nonsense like that, because we aren't any more above such
pressures than we are above the laws of physics.
