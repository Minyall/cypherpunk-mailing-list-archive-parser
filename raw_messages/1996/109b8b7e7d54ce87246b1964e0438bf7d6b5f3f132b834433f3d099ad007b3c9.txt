howdy folks,

it's been pointed out to me that the attack i mentioned would be unfair 
to others who use this ISP.  i will not be doing any mass mailing and i 
suggest others refrain from doing so as well.

the document is good reading, although it does hurt your head if you've 
had any logic at all.  i guess those years of debate weren't for nothing 
after all...
