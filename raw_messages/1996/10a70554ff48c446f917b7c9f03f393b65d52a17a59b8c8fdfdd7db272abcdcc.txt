The principle is of interest to even those without schoolaged children!
Neither having schoolaged children nor living in the Oakland Public School
System district is a necessary condition for commenting on the foolishness
of "Ebonics" and other such scams. Only the most naive of commentators says
things like "If your children were not cannibalized by Jeffrey Dahmer, why
do you feel the need to comment on Dahmer?"

(Sorry, Matthew, but I'm losing any remaining respect for your rhetorical
skills. I used to think we just disagreed politically, now I see more is
involved.)

I was speaking of "Ebonics." That many "black leaders" support so
transparent a scam and backward step is a separate issue, though, I
confess, not an unexpected one.
