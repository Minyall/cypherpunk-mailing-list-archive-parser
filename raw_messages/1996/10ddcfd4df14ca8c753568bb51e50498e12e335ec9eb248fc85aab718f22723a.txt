Yea, but how keep the machine? How pays for power? etc...
By spliting up over this type of network we defente several things:
	Utilities/Facilities - power, heating/cooling.
	Taxes - We neither create an orginzation nor profit,
	Porfit - Thars' none, so no one complains.
	
And we [MIGHT] save the time to have such a thing built.
[ But if we do make the machine, I Wan't it when we're done]
