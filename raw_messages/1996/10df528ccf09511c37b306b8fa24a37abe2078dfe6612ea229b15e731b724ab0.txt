The fixes to the encrypted loopback filesystem support for Linux that
I'll be finishing shortly (hopehopehope) incorporate, among other things,
the following features:

o encrypted filesystems
o stego'ing a filesystem in a large (say audio) file

Now, what if you do this:

Record 1/2 an hour of music from your CD, say at 8k samples/sec, 8 bits/sample,
stereo.  In the _left_ channel, stego your real filesystem.  In the _right_
channel, stego your duress filesystem.  If the cops are suspicious that
you have a huge sound file on your hard drive and they don't believe that
it's just for audio purposes, you could (reluctantly) give up the duress key.

Does this have the properties you want?
