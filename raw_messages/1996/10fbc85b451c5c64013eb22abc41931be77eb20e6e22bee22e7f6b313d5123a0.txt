I'm wondering if I should bother re-writing my "Assassination Politics" 
essay into the form of a paper and submitting it to these people.  While it 
might nominally be considered right down their alley, from a subject 
standpoint, even a cursory look at the location (Washington, DC) and the 
invited people (large companies and military) suggest that my ideas would be 
just about as welcome as a yarmulke at a Nazi Party convention.

I'm not aware of the agenda (hidden or otherwise) of the sponsors, so I don't know whether I should even bother.  Many people aren't particularly appreciative of being "one-upped" (not to mention made obsolete) so it's not clear that they'd give me the time of day.  

Any ideas as to their receptiveness?
