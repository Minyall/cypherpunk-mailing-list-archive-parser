Well, I'm not particularly interested in how the Establishment is going to 
demonize those who would seek its eventual downfall.  While I probably 
wouldn't have any argument against complaints about "state and church
terrorism," I really 
doubt whether the so-called "private terrorism" you mention above qualifies.

Most traditional "terrorism" (as least "traditional," by the standards of 
the last 20 years) is thought to involve relatively unfocussed attacks 
against people and locations, but in situations where attacks against 
selected government officials would be far more selective and effective.  
Naturally, those same officials wouldn't approve of replacing a scattershot 
technique with one that targets them more directly. 

Since I propose exactly that kind of replacement, I am presumably not the 
most ingratiating figure to these people.
