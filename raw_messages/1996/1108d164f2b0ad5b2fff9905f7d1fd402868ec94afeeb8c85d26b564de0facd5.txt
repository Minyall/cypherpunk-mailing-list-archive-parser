I agree, but to the LEAs, the "value of crimes" includes asset forfeiture 
"profits," which change that accounting in favor of eavesdropping (in their 
minds, at least). Of course, cellular fraud is paid for by others who, if 
they're politically active at all, are likely to demand even more money for 
the LEAs. A win -- win situation (in their minds, at least).
