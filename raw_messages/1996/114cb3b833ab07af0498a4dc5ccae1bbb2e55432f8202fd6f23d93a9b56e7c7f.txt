Since the courts have said that humans under 18 are not "persons"
under the law, you have every right to not let your child read
anything, to not let him think for himself, and to not let him
out of the house until he reaches his 18th birthday.

Your child would presently have no recourse against you should
you choose to treat him in such a fashion, and believe it or not,
there are some of us who would like to change that.

Good for you, at least.

Works for me.  I needn't point out that if I were ever on a jury
charged with determining whether your child, treated in the
aforementioned fashion, was guilty of a crime for splattering
your brains all over the living room wall like tapioca pudding, I
would find it almost impossible to vote for conviction.

You know, when children whine "I don't care what anyone else
thinks - No one has a right to tell me what to do", alarm bells
go off all over the place.  When parents say the exact same
thing, they think they deserve some sort of medal.

The obvious fact is, neither do you.  Anyone with an IQ over 10
and genitals that are in working order can produce offspring. You
seem to think that the act of reproduction instantly transforms
the scum of the earth into child-rearing experts who must never
be contradicted by any outside agency as they lord their wishes
over their chattel.

I think you have your child confused with your car.

The sad fact is that you are probably at the top of any list one
would prepare of groups and persons who think they know what is
good for children and don't.

I think you've already done an excellent job of that yourself.

          strong encryption on their PCs.
