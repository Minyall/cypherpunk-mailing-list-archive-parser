I've done some experimentation in this area.  It is not possible to use a
VCR in a simplified manner anymore as all recent computer CRTs are no
longer use a 60 Hz half-frame, interlaced, format.  Reductions in radiated
emissions, per FCC Part 15, since the earlt 80's have significantly raised
the bar for remote monitoring (still possible though).
