Disagree strongly. The net is a LARGE number of SMALL communities. This 
is why spammers are so offensive: they trespass and violate boundries. 
This is why killfiles were invented. You ask about people who don't know 
about killfiles.  Teach them. This requires no formal organization.

Yes.  If there was state control of the Internet, there probably wouldn't 
be any anonymous remailers. And the Cyberangels would go away.

Very few things are inevitable; that's a very strong word. The Cypherpunk 
Agenda is to provide exactly those tools which make this "inevitable" 
thing absolutely impossible.

Disagree modestly.

Have you taken a good hard _honest_ look at the War on Drugs? I also 
believe that bad laws compromise freedom and good laws protect freedom. 
One of the problems is that good laws often breed bad laws to patch 
things up.

No. True security for the community rests in a shared social standard 
which discourages actions which are harmful to the community or 
individuals. Security which requires a class of Guardians to protect 
everyone else is not security. It's safety, but it's temporary safety.
