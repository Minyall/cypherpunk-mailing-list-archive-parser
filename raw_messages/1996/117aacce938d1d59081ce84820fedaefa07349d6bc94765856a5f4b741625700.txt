	Call it what you will, the odds of 25 consecutive contracts
	all showing a profit are miniscle, except under one set of
	circumstances.  <<  It is something like 1 chance in

	You expect us to seriously believe that somebody with
	virtually no knowledge of futures trading would not end up
	having to meet at least one margin call, in 25 trades?

	Futures trading on contracts generally show a profit?
	I guess you are talking about the person who sets up 
	the trades, and takes a commission on the trades, 
	regardless of who makes, or ( usually ) loses money.

	Statistical proof is only accepted in academia.  Depending
	upon your POV, this may or may not be a good thing, when
	one is facing civil, or criminal charges.  

	Finding proof for either civil or criminal charges is a 
	slightly different matter.

	The US Media is slightly less freindly towards politicians, 
	than other countries.

	US Politicians are freindlier to each other,
	than politicians in other countries are.
