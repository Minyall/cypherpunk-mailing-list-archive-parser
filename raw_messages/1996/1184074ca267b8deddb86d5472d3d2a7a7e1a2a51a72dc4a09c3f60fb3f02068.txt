For what it's worth, Webster's defines:

rac.ism \'ra--.siz-*m\ \-s*st\ n 1: a belief that race is 
  the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and
  that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of 
  a particular race 2: RACIALISM - rac.ist n 


"http://c.gp.cs.cmu.edu:5103/prog/webster"


Thus no two of "racists", "separatists" and "race-haters"
would be identical sets of people.


But with a high degree of overlap, I'd warrant.


This means that Abraham Lincoln was a racist, by the way.


(That definition isn't too good, though.  "_The_ primary 
determinant"?  I would have to classify as racist those who
believe that race is _a_ primary determinant of those
qualities.)


Sorry to be off-topic, but if a thing is going to be
discussed I might as well try to add signal.  (The "[NOISE]"
tag that I left in the subject line doesn't indicate noise,
but off-topicness.)  Perhaps we could just drop the 
"Cc: cypherpunks" part and continue this discussion?


Regards,

Bryce
