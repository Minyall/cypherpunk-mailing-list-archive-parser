Right. Couldn't you insert some kind of var into the kernel, rebuild and
upon each reboot have the remailer process (which would have to be root
owned) check for the value of this? I am of course assuming that the owner
of the remailer has admin control over the box, which is kind of unscalable.
If someone does gain entry to the machine, he'd need root to skim through
the kernel memory, and since he wouldn't have access to the remailer src
(you don't have it online, right?) he'd have a hard time looking for what he
needed...
