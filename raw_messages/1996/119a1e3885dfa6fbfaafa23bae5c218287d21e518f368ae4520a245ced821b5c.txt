Yes, that's exactly right.  See, many of us _have_ "kill-filed this sicko"
long ago -- but when you quote these rants in your post, with no subject
line, no "aga@" or "freedom-knights" or what have you in the header, we
get the dubious privilege of seeing them anyway, mail filters or no mail
filters.  If you must respond, perhaps next time you could snip out the
garbage first.

This is good advice.  Please, remember it the next time you're tempted to
respond to such garbage.

If you want help in ignoring him/her/it, and are on a Unix system, I'd be
happy to send you some tips on how to get procmail running.  If you're
on a PC or Mac, I'm sure some knowledgeable c'punk can post similar
information about Eudora filters and the like.

Thanks.  Sorry, all, for sending this to the list, but of course there
was no way to reply directly to the poster.
