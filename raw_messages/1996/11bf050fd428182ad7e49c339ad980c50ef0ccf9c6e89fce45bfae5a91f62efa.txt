	Why bother?  Denning's position is that we'll go away.  By
deploying remailers, PGP, and other pro-privacy technologies, we
change the terms of the debate, and we change the facts that they must
deal with.

	Write code, not rants.  I wrote a mixmaster installer script
recently to make installing a Mixmaster easy.  (You can get it by
sending me a message with a "Subject: get mixmaster".)  I'm working on
code to allow a Mixmaster to only send to other mixmasters, and local
users.  This would allow people to covertly run a Mixmaster, avoiding
the headache of having anonymized messages come from your site.

	Now and then, debating with Denning and the like is fun.  But
she's a statist, and I'm not.  We aren't going to see eye to eye on
this stuff, so rather than responding, with detailed arguments,
respond with code that does new & nifty stuff. A GUI version of
premail would be cool, as would a key management utility for handing
PGP keyrings and webs of trust.
