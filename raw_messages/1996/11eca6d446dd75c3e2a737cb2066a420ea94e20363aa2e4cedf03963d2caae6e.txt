Last year DCI Deutch said that as part of the new "openness" 
for
intelligence archives and as followup to the release of VENONA
documents, a conference was planned on Soviet
intelligence attempts to penetrate the USG in the 1940s and 
1950s.
(See excerpt below.)


Has anyone heard more on this conference?

DCI Speech 7/11/95

DCI John M. Deutch at VENONA Press Conference
  
[Snip]   
   
   Next year we will sponsor a conference on Soviet 
Intelligence attempts
   to penetrate the United States government during the 1940s 
and 1950s
   and our efforts to counter those efforts. We hope that all 
scholars
   will attend, including Russian scholars.
