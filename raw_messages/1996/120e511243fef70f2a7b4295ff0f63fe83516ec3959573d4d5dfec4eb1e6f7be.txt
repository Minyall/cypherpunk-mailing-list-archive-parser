Heh.  

www.dolekemp96.org is definitely the address Dole gave at the close of the
debate.  The fact that the billing contact and one of the domain servers
are at "getcaught.com" is perhaps just a fine bit of irony...

I tried to connect to www.getcaught.com with no success, so I'm not sure
what's there...
