Sure.  And it's also important to keep in mind that everyday some
dimwit falls prey to the pigeon drop or some other "meat-to-meat"
scam.  It'll take a few years for people to get used to security
concerns on the net, just like it took a few years for people to
figure out that you really would die if you drove your new Model T
like a maniac.

Me too.  There are so many "but can Java do that?" questions floating
around in all sorts of bizarre contexts that it's easy to lose sight
of all the nice things about a nifty interpreted language.
