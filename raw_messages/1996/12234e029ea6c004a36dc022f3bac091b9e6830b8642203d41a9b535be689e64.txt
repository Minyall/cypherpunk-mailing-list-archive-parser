This is starting to sound like Wired magazine.

I fail to see *any* (non educational) use for these DNA "computers", let
alone a cryptographic use - sure, they may be massively parallel, but
what's the big deal?  I can now perform a calculation a million times
faster than I could yesterday? (something I personally doubt, but will
agree to for sake of the argument).  I could get the same results
writing a cycle stealing Internet java app, so what's all the fuss
about?
