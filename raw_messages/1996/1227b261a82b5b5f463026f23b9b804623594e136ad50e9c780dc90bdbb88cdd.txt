IBM and TIS are definitely pro-GAK.  TIS is selling a firewall that uses
GAKked DES.  IBM has been working on developing the "key recovery" technology.
The article posted here a while ago that told of IBM's plans to support GAK
also said that they were planning to license the technology to Sun and
Netscape.  I don't know about the accuracy of that last statement.
