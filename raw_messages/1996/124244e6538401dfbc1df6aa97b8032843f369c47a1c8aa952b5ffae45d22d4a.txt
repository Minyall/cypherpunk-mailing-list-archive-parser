A certain New York Times columnist questions Markoff's ethics, and I believe
John that the toad.com logs showed no intrusion by Mitnick.  I managed to
peg a precise time on Kevin's multi-system intrusion on my home Sparc 20,
which helped peg him in NC off the 1(800) ANI he was gaining access through.
One of Mitnick's friends had the audacity to contact Stanton at EFF about
the possibility of defending him.  He was told there were no classical
civil liberties to argue in the case...  So I suppose it's best to let
sleeping dogs lie, eh?
