If the only goal is to allow international strong crypto using the
CryptoAPI, then I agree with the above. However, exploring the CryptoAPI
internals now, while there is still a possibility that they can be
changed, is a productive undertaking to the extent that it exposes holes. 

If the good guys can find a way to plug an unapproved international
strong-crypto module into the CryptoAPI, then the bad guys can find a way
plug in a no-crypto virus or trojan horse.
