  Does anyone know of real documentation of this "suggestion" from the NSA?
It quite telling, though no surprise to any of us I'm sure, that they would
think that strong crypto should be a tool of freedom in china, but not in
this country.

  Maybe they should get Microsoft to insert subliminal directions for
downloading PGP into a future episode of "My Computer Family".  :-)
