Yearbooks are literally a publication.  If you wish to be extreme about
privacy, it is hardly prudent to allow your children's name and face to be
linked in a widely diseminated publication.

Fingerprints are not mandatory, or even requested, on all driver's
licenses.  Many states do not keep copies of the photos.  The only records
available are name, DOB, etc.  (Illinois was one of these, but I haven't
checked lately).

Avoid getting a social security number.
You can list them as dependents for several years if you stall with the
IRS about their social security number.  The worst I have even seen the
IRS do is send (rather bland) letters complaining about the number being
in error.  They hardly have time to follow up on each one.  And if they
do, failing to apply for a number is hardly a crime.  Each parent could
easily say "I thought you did it."  "No, honey, you did."  "No, I didn't."
The auditer would kick you out of the office.
