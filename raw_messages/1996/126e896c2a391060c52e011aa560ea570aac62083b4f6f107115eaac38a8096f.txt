I am not one to lash out at anyone but now I feel it is appropite to tell
the group what our very own Senator Exon has said to myself. If you do not
care then delete this e-mail but if you would like to hear what a senator
said to a 13 year old then read on. 

I will not put on the whole letter just the parts that I deem inapropite.

I'm not flaming you. You might not even get flamed this time. But you will be.
This is just the kind of message which I hate. It is a waste of my time and
a waste of time for people who have a lot less time than I. Please wait for
a legitimate reason to post. I might patronize your age but I won't - I was a
13-year-old net kid once.

#1 If you really wanted to show just had balls (I hate to use the phrase but
I can't think of anything better) you wouldn't hide behide remailers.

#2 This is kinda an inside joke

I really hate to waste your people times with my messages but aren't we all
on this mailing list to learn? I'm 13 hell, I bet there are people on the
list that are 5 times as old as me. I want to say that I really wanted to
talk to Senator Exon on an IRC channel but I can't seem to mail him due to
his cowerdness. I want to apologize to everyone that I may have said some
things things that were wrong in the past but I'm learning and hope to have
a great job in the computer indusrty (if there really are any). 

i will close saying that it was wrong that someone would creatique a 13 year
old's signatrure. I feel that is wrong but hell, I guess I just to young to
be a cyberkid. Thank you for hearing me out. :-)

Ps if you want the full letter e-mail me and i'll sent it to you.
