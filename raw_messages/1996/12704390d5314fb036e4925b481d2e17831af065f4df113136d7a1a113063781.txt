While generally I agree with you, I believe Esper Sata, Gerald Bull and
Pablo Escobar might have more specific disagreements.

While strong cryptography is powerful, and secure communications
liberating, unplugging the phones would about cripple that 'weapon' for a
while.  Any group rebelling based only on high technology communication is
an extremely vulnerable group, both to widespread denial of service, and
more specific 'surgical' attacks.  (Motorola stock anyone?)

Firstly, uprising, even kicking people out of power might take only a
small investment in time and money, but consolidating a new system (even a
decentralized one) will be extensively expensive and time consuming.

To the extent that a successful uprising depends on organizing the new
power structure, I can't see how a successful popular uprising can be
cheap.

In addition I believe the assumption that a few, even several official
deaths will cause mass resignations ignores history.  See e.g., Columbia,
South Africa, and any number of other examples.

While I understand the point, I think that a slim efficient government is
much better able to resist "contraction."  The most effective covert
action/terrorist/political agitation groups have all been small and
closely held.  It's easier to control all aspects of operation and a
greater concentration can be put into internal security concerns as
government shrinks.  Obviously there is a critical mass, but I don't think
you will see the "runaway refrigerator" effect with government shrinkage.
