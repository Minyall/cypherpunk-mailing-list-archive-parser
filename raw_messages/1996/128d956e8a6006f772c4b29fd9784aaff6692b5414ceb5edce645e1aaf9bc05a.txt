In the first month the Arms Trafficker Training Page has helped 407 people to
become Arms Traffickers.  Here are the stats: 


     International Arms Traffickers           407
     Public List of Known Arms Traffickers    147
     Letters to the president                  83
     Number of times page was read           2498 


So about one arms trafficker for every 6 times the page is read (some people
read the page more than once so the real ratio is better).  Kind of fun that
a web page can turn 1 out of 6 people into criminals. 

Thanks for your support both as arms traffickers and for linking to this
page. It is off to a good start.  For anyone who had missed it, the URL is:
