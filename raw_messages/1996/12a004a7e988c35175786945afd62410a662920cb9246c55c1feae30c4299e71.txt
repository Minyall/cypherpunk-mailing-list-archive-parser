C'punks,

I posted the contents of a web site containing netspam stuff to cypherpunks. 
In the transaction a bot at anon.penet.fi caught my mail (thought it was a 
copy of the infamous Make Money Fast chain) and posted me a FAQ and bounced my
message. (Though it seems to have reached cypherpunks already)
