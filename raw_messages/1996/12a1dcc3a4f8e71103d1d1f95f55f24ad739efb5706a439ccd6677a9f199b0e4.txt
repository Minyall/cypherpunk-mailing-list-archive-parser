I'm delurking here ... just signed up on cypherpunks, though I've
known about it for a long time.

I don't watch TV, don't have cable, and thus can't watch this PBS show
everyon's a-buzz about.  I would like to see it, though.  I would be
most grateful if someone who has taped it could loan me the tape so I
could watch it.

I live in Santa Cruz, CA, and work in Mountain View; surely someone in
the south bay has been taping this?  I hope so.
