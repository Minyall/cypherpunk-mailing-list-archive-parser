      With either system proposed (market based contracts v.s. bounty) 
you are paid for code. Let's face it, with reputation capital, losses (i.e.
bad moves/actions/whatever) are far more costly than good moves pay. 

     To use a sports analogy: If you fumble the ball, and allow the runner
to score, more people are going to remember it than if you make a couple of
baskets.

     What was the thing that killed Bushes chances of re-election against 
a rather weak canidate? One lie "No new taxes".

     If Gauss had been called on it, what would have happened? If the caller
could _prove_ he was lying, what then? He still would have been the
greatist mathmatician of the time, but he would have been seen as a liar
and a crackpot. We know how that works don't we.
