She recognized it, alright.  Of course, it says "NORWEST Instant Cash
and Check" in brilliant yellow letters.

The exchange was like this:

Me:     offers debit card

Her:    "That's a check cashing card."

Me:     "No, it is _not_ a 'check cashing card'."

Her:    "Well, it's a debit card.  We don't accept those."

No sign, no warning.  If I hadn't been on a tight business schedule, I'd
have walked out.
