I absolutely don't agree.  The subordination of the individual to the tribe
is fundamental of their vision of the world.  Individualism is not about the
personnal opinions, it is about the vision of Man as an entity in itself, not
a type of cattle that owe his service to the collectivity of the tribe.

Crypto makes the tribe (and it's sorcerers) loose their grip... :)
