Hmm. Very interesting point. You would need to make the signature
technology at least tamper-evident by embedding it "somehow," and
recursing infinitely. Yup, sounds pretty impossible, so I'm sure
somebody's going to come up with an answer. Maybe the one-time signature,
or signatures authenticated by location.

Answered elsewhere. Trusted third party swears you're different. Also,
signatures from different nyms are useful even if the identity
relationship among nyms are known.  Compare the nym "Tom Weinstein,
Cypherpunk" with "Tom Weinstein, speaking for Netscape" and "Tom
Weinstein, can't talk during the IPO."

OK, you probably can't. This is a special case of #3.
