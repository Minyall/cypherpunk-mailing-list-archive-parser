As much as it shames me, I have recently discovered that by filtering
messages from only 2 participants and setting body filters on 3 keywords
have remarkably improved the usefulness of this listserve.

As much as I do enjoy some of the filtered subject matter, I really feel it
is very off subject and makes this listserver useless for the intended task.

I guess that makes me a censor and it has me reexamining some things.
