	A: How possible is it to insulate cars from these effects? B: If it
can't be insulated from with reasonable levels of effort, it would appear to be
perfectly usable against cop cars. If the emitter is in a transparent baloon
1000 feet up, I doubt they're going to be able to track back to the user.
