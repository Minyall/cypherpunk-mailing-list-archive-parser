My understanding is, Java applications (as opposed to applets) don't have
those limitations, and can do _almost_ anything a C program can. The
applications still have the full cross-platform compatability. IMO dumping
the security of applets in favour of the capability of applications is a
good idea. After all, the applet security features have a lot of flaws, 
so why limit your programs when it's not offering any real security?

Signing programs is a good idea. It will provide better security than we 
currently have, without having to limit the capabilities of the software.

JMHO.
