A literal reading of the ITAR's provisions relating to cryptography
leads to exactly that result.  And there have been strong suggestions
that that is the intended result in some of the statements made by
representatives of the State Department.  

If you are interested in this you might look into MIT's experiences
when they published the book with the PGP source code.
