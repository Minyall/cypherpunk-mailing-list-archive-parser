The official pastry of the 1996 Cypherpunks.

One might note that Zimmerman isn't, er, a common name for yer typical 
Neo-Nazi... This sort of accusation is sufficient grounds for libel in 
the UK (such accusations have been found to be defamatory, and would 
almost certainly be settled within a few days. 

Of course Phil (Hallam Baker) has more experience with this sort of
thing...
