Liberals?  What Liberals?  Clinton's certainly no liberal;
he's just a big-spending statist who likes to buy votes from
poor, middle-class, and yuppie voters rather than buying them
from defense contractors, not that he's above that.
The only thing about him that's more liberal than George Bush,
whose Clipper chips and miscellaneous wars Clinton inherited,
is that Clinton smiles when he's lying instead of sneering like Bush.

(If Clinton had said things like "Of course I tried to avoid the draft
and smoked dope, I'm no fool" and had dropped the draft and the Drug War
instead of supporting both after he was President, I might have
a better opinion of him....)

However, if Phyllis Schlafly understands that the tools she needs
to protect her speech are the same that people she disapproves of
can use to protect their speech, and is willing to make that trade,
she's starting to inhale, and good for her!
