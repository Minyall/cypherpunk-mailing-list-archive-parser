The problem is that microsoft has made the mistake of using their own
software, which doesn't understand the distinction between envelope
and header addresses. I've been on the phone with contacts there and
I'm going to start threatening going to the press soon.

Virtually every mailing list I use has this problem, by the way --
they are a big place.
