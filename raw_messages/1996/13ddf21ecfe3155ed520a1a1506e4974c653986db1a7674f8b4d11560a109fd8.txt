While a scheme like this will work, one of the needs in a design like
this is convincing yourself of how much entropy is available from the
noisy clock and where it comes from.  It's nontrivial to evaluate
the phase noise of a CMOS relaxation oscillator, for example.
Also, at what rate do you want random bits?

The references in Applied Cryptography are pretty useful; the only other
ones I know of are a tech report by Gifford at MIT/LCS and a thesis
by Sridhar Vembu (who also works here at Qualcomm) on optimal extraction
of entropy from biased sources.

I'd say thermal noise is your friend; the other systematics, as you
say, are a slight issue, but their effect on the entropy is very small
and they'll be taken out by the postprocessing (hash function, etc.).

I plan to make a simple board-level RNG design available to the net Real
Soon Now.  I'd be interested to see your CMOS design when it's finished.
(By the way, try searching the cypherpunks and sci.crypt archives on the
subject. There's lots of good discussion.)
