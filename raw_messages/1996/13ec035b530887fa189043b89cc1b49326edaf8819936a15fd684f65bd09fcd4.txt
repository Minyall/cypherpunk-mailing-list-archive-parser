Does anyone know whether there's a freely available web proxy available
anywhere? Even a "personal" one somewhere on my ISP's UNIX box would be a
simple way to beat superficial logging/resolution of my static IP.
Something like the Nutscapify or Canadianizer proxies, minus all the
blinking and "hoser, eh?" stuff.

Thanks.
