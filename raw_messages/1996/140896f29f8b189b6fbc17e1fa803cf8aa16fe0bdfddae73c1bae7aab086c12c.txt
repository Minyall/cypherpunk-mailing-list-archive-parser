I don't think the 9th and 10th Amendments are nits.

Read the 9th, David.  Our rights exist whether or not the current
regime recognizes them.  The reason Congress gets away with so
many violation is in part due to the current population being
willing to exchange a false sense of security for out and out
violations of the clear words of the Bill of Rights.  That may 
be democracy, but at the expense of Constitutionally guaranteed
freedoms.  Read the 9th and 10th, David.

No, you merely get to stop others from forcing their will on you.

No, David, it's free speech.  Read the 1st Amendmend, David.
