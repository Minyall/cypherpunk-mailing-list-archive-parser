True, but my point was stronger.

The program *will not work* if there have been even inadvertent changes
to the self-censorship files. This person emailed me because he couldn't
get it to work after an unrelated change.

This sort of contradicts Microsoft's claims that they don't require
ratings because they're turned off by default. If the file can't fix
itself, I'd say that's not "default."

This person wasn't trying to get around ratings. It was his personal
machine, which up and broke because of the censorship bits.

Sorry, I didn't get the context across. Read it again alongside this:
