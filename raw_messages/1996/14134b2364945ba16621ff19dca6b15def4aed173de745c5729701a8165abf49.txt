I'm a little rusty on physics, but it seems to me that you are forgetting the
fact that energy needs to be used in order to lower the temperature below the
temperature of background radiation.  A lot of energy.  I don't have any
numbers available, but I think that it would takes much more energy to invert
a bit where energy has to be used to keep the temperature below the temperature
of background radiation then to invert the bit at temperatures greater than or
equal to the temperature of background radiation.  Brute-force cracking will
take less energy when the universe has cooled off more (assuming it does
implode first).
