    Another "RPC" comes from the Open Software Foundation, who

This is a semi-common misconception, there is no relationship between DCE
and OSF/1.  OSF/1 was one of the reference platforms during the original
DCE development, but so was SVR4, AIX and HP/UX.

Except for parts of DFS (the distributed file system), all of DCE is
user-mode code and ports easily between un*x platforms.
