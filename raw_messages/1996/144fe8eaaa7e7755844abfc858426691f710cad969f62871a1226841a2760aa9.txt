Typical boneheaded government!  At it yet again, I see.  I'd feel inclined to 
say something like "I predict that they will fail" but that might be 
misinterpreted.

This most recent outrage wouldn't even be compatible with the Leahy bill, 
bad as it was.

Even so, I was pleased to see that we had already managed to educate a 
number of people in Congress who already know that this plan is DOA.  That's 
progress, I guess.
