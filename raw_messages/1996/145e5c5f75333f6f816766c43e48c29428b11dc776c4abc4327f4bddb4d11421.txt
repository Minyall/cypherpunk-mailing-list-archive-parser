 Okay, so this is a bit Gibsonish but after reading that piece on cybergangs
 and some of the ecash issues what I wanna know is this:

 There are no laws in cyberspace right? No one to enforce them as such
 shall we say? What happens if a group of hackers/crackers/cypherpunks
 set up shop and started offering their services to the highest bidder?

 Let's say that the US Government bans strong crypto and attempts to
 enforce is using the many, conventional, means at its disposal...
 what happens if the cypherpunks group raises the money to pay a group
 or individual to hack/destroy/grind to a halt milnet? Or some such
 government network? Or all of them? 

 How come this hasn't happened yet? Okay maybe not at such a grand scale,
 but ya know? 

 Hey it's just an idea,
