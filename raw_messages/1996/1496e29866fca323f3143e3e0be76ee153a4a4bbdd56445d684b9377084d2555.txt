Incorrect.  I do have a problem with that.

I'm trying to see what this has to do with a mandatory chip in my
TV...  SOmehow the link between that and a smoke alarm seems tenuous
at best.

The intent of making the V chip (what does "V" stand for anyway?
"Violence?" Eerily Orwellian if so...) mandatory seems to be that it's
necessary to "protect" the people who want to "protect" their children
but are too stupid to seek out and purchase a TV equipped with an
optional filtering device.   "Oh darn; I want to protect my children
from all this horrible damaging programming, but I bought the wrong
kind of TV!  If only the government had made it impossible for me to
do so!"

Could you please change your signature block?  My hypocrisy meter is
pegged.
