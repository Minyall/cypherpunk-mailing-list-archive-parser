Thanks, John, for forwarding. I spoke with the DSN folks today. They
developed NetFortress in the U.S. and have recently found a substantial
overseas market for it. "That's definitely a problem for us. We're actively
lobbying senators to pass procode, to get it out of committee." Since of
course multinationals would be unwilling to use DSN stuff under current
export-control regime.
