That's an excellent idea.

The only problem with using CU-SeeMe is that, due to the nature of the 
data being transferred, it is more important to keep up to date than to 
not lose data.  I believe it uses UDP to do this.  There would have to be 
some protection mechanism in the stego patches to tolerate high amounts 
of data loss - the obvious solution would be to loop the data, but that 
is easily detectable, and is not a guarantee that the data arrived 
safely.  Setting up a connection outside of Cu-SeeMe attracts attention, 
especially if there was a correlation between what occurred on that 
connection and what occurred in the LOBs of the Cu-SeeMe connection.
