Actually RSA is not a hard target for people like us to threaten.  The
Diffie-Hellman patent expires in 210 days.  Cylink is prevented from taking
legal action against anyone for violating this patent while the current
lawsuit is being decided.  When Diffie-Hellman expires ElGamal is available
for use for free.  So the best threat one can make against RSA is to directly
challenge their revenue stream: start working on making ElGamal an available
option in all systems which use RSA.
