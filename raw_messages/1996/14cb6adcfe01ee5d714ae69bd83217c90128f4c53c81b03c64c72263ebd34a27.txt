     So you are explaining your problems in advance. Good, it tells 
thoughtful readers to take you with a grain of salt.

    Ok, I will try to keep from using too long words so you can understand
me.

     You forget "shutting down" the source of input. Turning off the 
radio, TV etc, or turning off the person speaking.

    No problems with that.

     It still isn't censorship. Censorship, at least in my dictionary, 
refers to censor, which uses the word "Official" several times. Mr. 
Gilmore is not an "Official" in a government sense, he maybe in the EFF
sense, but this is not an "Official" EFF organ, so that doesn't count. 

     He is the OWNER of this list, and the machine it runs on. If he chooses
(which he didn't) to keep someone from using the list, it is his right.

     WRONG. the "net' wasn't compared to either a home or a private club,
THIS LIST WAS. No one has the right to kick anyone off public streets, the
police _do_, but I seriously doubt that they could arrest you for refusing.
Gilmore didn't "Ban" Vulis from "The Net" (in fact he didn't even ban him 
from the list, he just removed him from the distribution list), he didn't
even try.

     He also didn't prevent Vulis from posting, tho' he could have.

     Again I repeat myself:

    Vulis was not "removed" in any way, shape, or form from "the net", all
Gilmore did was "Turn his back" on Vulis, saying in effect "Your bullshit
isn't wanted here". 

    He didn't tell Vulis to keep his opnion to himself, no one on this list 
did. He, and others here were asking Vulis to stop his repeated personel 
attacks on other list members, some were asking him to stop his vitrolic 
rants on racial and ethnic groups as well, which were _way_ off topic.

     You know, from your position I'd say you have a very clear view of 
your colon. 

     "Editorial Control" means that someone decides who get's published and
who doesn't. From your opposition to it, I guess you think that a magazine
dedicated to poetry should print all poems submitted, or as many, selected
in some sort of non-judgemental order, as they can fit. Or that a magazine
should print any writings submitted to it. 

     I run 4 mailing lists, one is personal, one is in the process of coming
online, and 2 are up and running. One of these has a rule: No Politics allowed.
I guess I am a pathetic little censorous worm huh? Nope. That rule was put 
there for a very good reason, and I am that reason. I love to talk politics,
but that is the WRONG FORUM for it. 

    Just like this is the wrong forum for Vulis to spew his shit.

    Yes, and the cypherpunks list DOES THAT. Vulis wasn't kicked off for 
opposing Crypto, or the spread of Crypto, he was kicked off for littering,
and for refusing to stop littering. Actually he was kicked off for daring 
Gilmore to make him stop littering.

     Not really, he was simply refusing to let Vulis share his (Gilmore's)
podium.

     How would this happen? Setting up a press is fairly easy, at least 
a small hand operated press. Start your own magazine, start your own
mailing list. 

     That is what freedom is, the ability to _do it yourself_ not the 
requirement that others do it for you, or allow you to use what they 
have already built.
