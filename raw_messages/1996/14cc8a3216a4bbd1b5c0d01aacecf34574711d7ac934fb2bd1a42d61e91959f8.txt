I'm not so much concerned about who supports key eskrow, I just want to
learn about cryptography! I sent away for my copy of Applied Cryptography
many months ago and it has yet to show up.

Bruce, please ship out a book to me!

(I would also appreciate a list of these "easier" bookst hat you mention,
as well as any free on-line information on crypto)
