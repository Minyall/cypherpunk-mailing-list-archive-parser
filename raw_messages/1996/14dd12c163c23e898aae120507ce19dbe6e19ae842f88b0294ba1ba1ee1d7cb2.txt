	Legally, I don't know that they can export software that
handles keys longer than 512 bits.  Wait! I forgot! They are the brute
squad.

	More seriously, if they did export an API (even a private one)
that can handle keys longer than 512 bits, perhaps we could find that
out and publish information on using the NSA-strength crypto from
Notes applications.
