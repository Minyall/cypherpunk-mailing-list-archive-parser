GSM A5 security is supposed to have effective key length of 40 bits, 
although according to some sources 64-bit session key is used. The 
algorithms are not freely available, so you never know.

I would say GSM security is still better than nothing. The problem is of 
course that only tha radio link is encrypted, not the connection out into 
public telephone network.
