Totally untrue. The use of encryption for business purposes goes back
centuries, and there were commercial providers of blank telegraph code
books all through the 19th century. The use of crptography to protect
communications only declined with the end of telegrams and the
reduction in the perception that large numbers of strangers would be
handling your missives. See "The Codebreakers" for a history of this.
