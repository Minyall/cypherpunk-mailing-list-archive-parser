I'd use: Linux + ssh + dosemu

You can run your text-based messy-dos programs remotely; I do it all the
time.

If your work computer is not on a tcp/ip network already, then you'll need
to use slip/ppp over the modem, which isn't hard.  Just read the dip manual
and/or pppd man page, it tells you how to set up a slip/ppp account.  Ssh
takes care of all the encryption for your logins and file transfers (scp).
