This is an issue that is connected with the "Need PGP awareness" thread.  
If everyone is decrypting their messages by hand then nine seconds is a 
hinderance.  On the other hand, if everyone is using an off-line reader 
that checks signatures/decrypts as it receives messages then nine seconds 
(or less for a newer machine) is less significant.

I'll refrain from making any product plugs here, but I could barely notice 
the difference moving from a 1024 bit key to a 2047 bit key.
