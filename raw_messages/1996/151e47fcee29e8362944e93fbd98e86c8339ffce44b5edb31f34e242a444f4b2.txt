::Right On!  PDP 11's rule!!!

::My favorite one was an 11/34 with "Hardware Floating Point" that had a

        that's what I thought until my 11/44 rolled in!   

::You'd build a double

        you're showing your age, too!  

        remember the old, old Logo before the IBM PC --ran on an 11/34?  
    and the sandbox for the turtle. I still had an 11/34 when my 
    youngest son was 2-3; and he would spend hours driving the turtle 
    with its headlight in the sand, trailing its umbilical cord until 
    he would hopelessly entangle it 

        --and the old DEC Gigi keyboard which was only produced for 
    educational sales --I managed to acquire a salesman's demo.

        I still have the Gigi, the special color monitor, and the
    source code tape from U of Toronto via DEC --compiled it on V6
    UNIX if I remember, then Berkeley 3.9  for the 11/44 I had just
    acquired which was obsoleted by a pair of Vaxen in about a year.

        am I showing my age, yet?

        BTW, I think I can still read 9 track tapes.  The old Pertec
    800/1600 is still racked with a minivax with Ultrix V7. anyone
    still wish to play with that old dinosaur?
