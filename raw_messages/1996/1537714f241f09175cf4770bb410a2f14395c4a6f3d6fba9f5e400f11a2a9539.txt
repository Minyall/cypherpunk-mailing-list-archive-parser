	OK, how about `press charges`?  And please, don't try telling
me that private citizen's don't `press charges`, because one of the
well reported problems in fighting domestic violence has been the
battered spouse (almost always the wife) refusing to press charges.

TCM> 2. The "carrying of a Bible" is not covered by the CDA.

	You are the only one who has suggested that it is.  I have
suggested that portions of the Bible are 'indecent', and that
electronic transmissions of the same would fall under the CDA ban.

TCM> No prosecutor can be "forced" to prosecute, absent approval by a

	OK, how about this.  J Random Atheist, Jr, comes across the
Bible on the 'net.  J Random Atheist, Sr, finds out, and is appalled,
and swears out a complaint.  The AUSA refuses to investigate.  Could J
Random Atheist, Sr, file a lawsuit against the AUSA because he is
being denied equal treatment under the law?
