You cant be as dumb as you sound, but I've been wrong before and possibly 
way off the mark this time. Nothing like small minded liberal throwback 
philosophy to chew on like cud. It's painfully clear to me you've not 
hung around in enough financially secure circles long enough to realize 
that the socially and mentally degenerate which inhabit those realms are 
just as bad if not worse than the "common man" to whom you dispise.

Natural intellect is never discouraged nor prevented by economics. 
Book learning perpetuates existing dogma and in some cases stifles 
critical thinking when it is combined with depostic agendae. 

Never judge an idiot by the size of his wallet.
