This is amazing. Without defending the German stand on the Revisionist
crap, that part is at least understandable in a historical context
(their sense of guilt for the unfortunate developments in the 30's
and 40's etc). But a quick overview of the contents of Radikal gives the
impression of an ordinary leftist zine, defining the outlawing of it as
pure political censorship in a Western 'democracy'. I'm truly surprised.
