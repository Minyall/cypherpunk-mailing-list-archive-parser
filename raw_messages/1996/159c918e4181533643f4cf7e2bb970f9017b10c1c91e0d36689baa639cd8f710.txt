So, Ed Carp couldn't leave well enough alone. I killfiled him and
apparently he had the bad taste to send me some mail about it, and
when my robot replied to him informing him that I had no interest in
whatever he might have had to say, he seems to have a desperate need
to get in the last word by forwarding the message from my robot to the
mailing list.

Mr. Carp, you've got extremely bad taste. Luckily, I don't have to
ever see anything you have to say ever again.
