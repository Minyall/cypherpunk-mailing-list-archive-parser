	These days you can show a passport in leui of a social
security card. (I showed my"current employer" my SS card because I
kept forgetting to bring my poassport in to work. What an odd concept,
proving to my employer that I had a right to wrk in the
US... apparently the law is that you have a $10k fine if you *dont
have the paperwork* -- it doen't matter if all your employees are
legal.)
