On a serious note, I hereby predict that the term "kill file" will soon be
picked up by the clueless media and/or Congress as a sign that the Internet
is dangerous. (I'm sure it already has been used as a negative, but I'm
predicting a more visible focus on this term, however briefly. To the
average American, it conjures up images closely related to Jim Bell's
ideas!)

I had one of our "unsubscrive" newbies asking me what I meant by "putting
him in my kill file," and saying he was planning to let his site manager
know about "your threat."
