   "Electronic money threat to central banks"

      A report issued today by the BIS says that innovations
      such as "electronic purses" or "digital cash" used over
      the Internet could erode central banks' income.
      "However, if issuance of e-money is limited to banks,
      the regulatory framework already in place can be
      extended to cover the new products, but competition and
      innovation might be more limited."
