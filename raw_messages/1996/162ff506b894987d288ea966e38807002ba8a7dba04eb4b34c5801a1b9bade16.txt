then.

	As I understand it (which, given my previous error, is in
serious doubt), after a point the IDEA session keys become far easier to
use a brute force attack on than the RSA keypair.  Since I think that
increasing the RSA keysize is supposed to double the attack time, if a
RSA key size of N takes as much time to break as 1 IDEA key, making the
RSA key N+8 bits makes it better to break the IDEA keys of 200 messages
rather than the RSA key.

	Does anyone know if there are comparisons of estimates of the
time to break the IDEA session keys used in PGP vs time to break RSA
keys of various sizes?
