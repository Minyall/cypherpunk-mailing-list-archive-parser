I see it not as a business but more like a way of organizing what I'm
thinking about already in a way that might be interesting to others.

Once you create your web newsletter and see how many hits you get, you can better gauge the interest.   In any case, you will have your thoughts and references organized and can always use it in your communications to others on mailing lists or newsgroups, etc.

Since there's so much info on the net, one of the most valuable elements to introduce into it, besides search engines, is the organization of all that data in ways which make sense and speeds up the time involved in grasping the issues.

Plus, of course, if you give it a libertarian/anarchist slant, it would be an added "feature" for certain people.  Like Cpunks.
