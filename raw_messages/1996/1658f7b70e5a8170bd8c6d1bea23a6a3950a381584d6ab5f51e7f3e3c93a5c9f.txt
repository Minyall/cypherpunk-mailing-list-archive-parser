Vladimir,

Imagine you're an FBI agent or something like that.  You've been assigned 
to investigate some guy, to include sniffing out any data he may have 
stored in encrypted format to keep private.

You de-crypt the data from some elaborate stego scheme, and find - a 
recipe for chocolate cookies.

The federal agents I know, are clever enough to say to themselves: 
"what's wrong with this picture?"
