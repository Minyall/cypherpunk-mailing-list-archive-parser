This sounds like a good argument for the crypto "watermark" idea that was
discussed a few times earlier on the list. I think it goes something like
this: The document/avatar/code/whatever has a crypto identifier embedded in
it that can be extracted to verify ownership. Perhaps a good analogy might
be a steganographic application.

Yep. Even the "eyes only" setting in PGP is no good if the recipient is
savvy enough to cut and paste the plaintext to the clipboard.
