PowerPC News (free by mailing add@aptdata.co.uk) quotes Reuter as as saying
that Thomas Middelhoff, a board member of Bertelsmann AG, which has a
significant stake in America  Online, said that a decision on the merger
could be made within a month. He noted that new data showed that 40% of US
Internet traffic was flowing through America OnLine's network and that
together with Netscape the two companies would effectively  control the
technology now shaping the global network - "And then Microsoft would be
left without an Internet standard,".
