Hi there!

I'd appreciate some help from you experts in 
steganography.

1) If I hide some PGP encrypted data in a
gif, jpg or wav file will there be any tell tale 
signs to the naked eye of an expert? If yes,
what are they?

2) Would it better to hide the data in 
a jpg with black and white image rather
than a color one?

3) Are there any tools at the moment 
to expose (not crack) the hidden encrypted 
data? If none. are there tools in development?

If this appears twice please accept my apologies.
I didn't see the first posting and so I assumed it 
was lost in transit. Please email replies to me 
directly if this is off-topic. Thank you.

Makofi
