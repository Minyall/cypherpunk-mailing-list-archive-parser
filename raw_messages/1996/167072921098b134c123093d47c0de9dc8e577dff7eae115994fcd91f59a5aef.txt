Umm... how bout some details on your "proprietary" algorithms.  How exactly
is the public/private key pair generated? etc etc etc...

And WTF is "INTERNET-compatible"?  And what qualifies your product as
"INTERNET-compatible" and PGP as not "INTERNET-compatible"?

>From your "Confidence" web page, it seems that a password effectively
*IS* the private key, and on another page you state that the "public key"
is exactly 22 characters, generated "using a one way hash function", perhaps
some hash or variant of a hash of the password.  Pretty feeble.

   Ken Thompson has an automobile which he helped design.  Unlike most
   automobiles, it has neither speedometer, nor gas gage, nor any of the
   numerous idiot lights which plague the modern driver.  Rather, if the
   driver makes any mistake, a giant "?" lights up in the center of the
   dashboard.  "The experienced driver", he says, "will usually know
   what's wrong."
