Dole's cosponsorship of Pro-CODE was a way to land some California votes
and a way to differentiate himself from Clinton, nothing more.

A statement he released on May 2 bashed the White House: "The
administration apparently thinks very little of the right to privacy -- it
presumes the government is entitled to all the so-called 'keys'  or secret
passwords which protect computer generate [sic] information from prying
yes..."

I predict that if he were to win, we'd see the fastest policy turnaround
ever. The moment he was inaugurated, Dole would pick up where Clinton left
off. Clipper IV, here we come...

But the benefit of having a pro-privacy statement in the platform (which in
fact was watered down significantly from that originally proposed by
advocates on our side) is that the platform covers Republican Party
candidates for any office, not just the presidency.

I'm told that the a Dem convention speaker may talk about privacy issues,
however.
