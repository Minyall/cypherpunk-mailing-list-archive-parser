     I would agree that parents can do as good or better at _most_ subjects 
thru about the 3rd or 4th grade, and I do agree that most of todays schools 
are shit, however there is one area--social skills--that homeschooling 
simply can't compete. Children need to learn how to interact with one another
in groups larger than a family unit. I don't think that homeschooling can
accomplish this nearly as well as the public (or private) schools could. 

     I also don't think this is as important as, say Math, Science, or
English.
