   "Untangling the Spy Network's Webs." 
 
      Chairman Combest of the House intelligence committee 
      yesterday proposed making the CIA's DO into a separate 
      service and splitting the NRO into two giant technical 
      agencies to handle satellites. The CIA would control 
      most long-range intelligence work, some of which is now 
      handled by the CIO and some by the NSA. The biggest 
      change in terms of size would put the NSA, which has 
      more than 25,000 analysts, in a new Technical Collection 
      Agency that would also take in the managerial functions 
      of NRO and parts of imagery analysis from CIO. 
 
   3-5-96. NYT: 
 
   "Proposal Would Reorganize U.S. Intelligence Agencies." 
 
      The intelligence services are held in low regard by the 
      public and some leaders -- State complains about the 
      quality of analytical papers; Defense bad-mouths the 
      quantity of intelligence; and Congress gripes about too 
      many secrets and not enough accountability. Rep. Goss, 
      a former member of the CIA's DO, said the proposal aimed 
      to rebuild the credibility of the agency's spies: "The 
      whole exercise we're going through is meant to restore 
      that."
