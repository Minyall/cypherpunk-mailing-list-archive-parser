Hello,

    I plan to attend this years crypto '96, but I don't have a roommate
for the dorms.  It is much cheaper if you have a roommate so I was
wondering if anyone needed a roommate who was going?

    Please respond to me directly as I don't subscribe to cypherpunks
and I don't see any point in cluttering the list with this thread.  BTW,
the deadline for normal registration is July 12 and it would be nice to
register asap.

							Thanks,
							Chris Hall
