	You can find a list of reliable (sic) FTP and WWW sites in the
alt.2600 FAQ beta version 0.13. That in itself is available at my FTP site
ftp.cam.org /users/cyberia. The English language is 450,000 words in its
entirety, not including (I believe) proper names. So the file you're
looking for (if it exists) would be very large. Good luck.
