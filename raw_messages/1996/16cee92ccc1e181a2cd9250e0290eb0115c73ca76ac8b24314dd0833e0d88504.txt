That's a good idea, but I don't see any reason to sign the 
notice.  Just put a "PGP signed" logo at the bottom of the
page.  If the user clicks on it then it hrefs to a .asc
file (or is it better to have a .html file is the
signature in <pre>...) which contains the detached sig for
the original page.


This would also have the bonus effect of making PGP more
visible to the web-browsing public.  I'll work on this
during my.. err.. "spare time".
