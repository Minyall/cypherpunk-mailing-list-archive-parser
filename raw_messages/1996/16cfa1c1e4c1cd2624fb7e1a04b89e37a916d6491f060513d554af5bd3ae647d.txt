There are two servers that EUB.com uses.

1> That provides information and blurbs and pretty pictures.  This is near
D.C.

2> That provides secure connections to the bank for account information
and transactions.  This is in the islands.

Again, this was adopted to get around expensive bandwidth uses by idle and
casual browsers.

I believe, though I am not sure, that I mentioned this when EUB first
"went net."
