Interesting address that was used to reach me.

To: pmarc@nsb.fv.com
To: pmarc

Somehow, both reached me from within their system, but if they  
can't configure their e-mail to show the proper address than I don't  
have to much faith in their other abilities.  I don't imagine that  
anybody else would have much luck replying to either of those or CAN  
I now receive mail at nsb.fv.com?  Is this a new free service  
provided by FV?
