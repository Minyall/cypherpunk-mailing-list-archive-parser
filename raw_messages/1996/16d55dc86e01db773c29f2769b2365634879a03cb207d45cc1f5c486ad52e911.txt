	Why, precisely, do you think that remailers don't do much good where
the operator isn't root? The possibility of the sysop looking at the mail &
getting the private key, the increased susceptibility to cracking of non-root
accounts, possible sysop non-cooperation in an honest manner (as opposed to the
first one), or what?
	Thanks,
