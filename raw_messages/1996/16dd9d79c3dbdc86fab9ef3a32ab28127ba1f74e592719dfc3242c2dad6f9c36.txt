The other day I was poking around lists of open NNTP servers, and came across something odd at llyene.jpl.nasa.gov . It appears that nothing has ever been expired there. Some groups had hundreds of thousands of messages.

This might be interesting and useful for some purposes.

Anyone know if that's where Dave Hayes does his amazing administrative thing?
