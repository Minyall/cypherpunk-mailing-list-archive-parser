Hello Everyone!

       After a lot of testing, I've come to discover that the middleman
reliability problems are vastly due to the nymserver front-end. With this
in mind, I've decided to drop the nym for middleman and announce it's
actual presence.

       I am middleman and I wrote the patches to mixmaster to make it work
with premail. I want to see the middleman remailer work as a viable
remailer and I feel that having the nym front-end has caused a less than
acceptable remailer in terms of usability.

       With this, I'm announcing the new email address for the middleman
remailer. It is now middleman@jpunix.com. What does this affect? The
middleman remailer can be used as a front-end remailer and you don't have
to question who is running it. The middleman remailer will still NEVER be
the remailer on the end, hence the problems with discovery and persecution
by entities that wish to go after "the remailer on the end" hopefully will
not occur. Of course anyone wishing to run a middleman remailer can still
opt to use a nym, but at the price of a decrease in performance. 

       I will continue to work with Matt Ghio to get the nymserver code to
be more reliable. I admit, it needs a facelift.

       If you have any questions or comments please feel free to email me
at perry@alpha.jpunix.com. Flames go to /dev/null.
