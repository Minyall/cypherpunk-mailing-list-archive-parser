I know,

I class myself as quite an experience programmer (though I haven`t 
done a lot of code recently) but I spent several days weeding through 
the bugs and it still wouldn`t compile on Borland C++ V4.51 so I just 
read the core code and hoped the executable was really derived from 
that code. I`m normally more paranoid than that but I just don`t have 
the time to spend getting borland to compile it. It won`t even 
compile on my system with the borland makefile than comes with PGP.

Has anyone else on here managed to get it to compile under Borland 
and how long did it take them????
