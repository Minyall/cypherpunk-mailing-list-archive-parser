I read rants about the list noise on this list so much
that it seems quite comical. it seems that everything
else has been tried, I thought I would suggest something
radically different.

I propose that no one talk about the noise on the list,
on the list. pretend it doesn't exist. consider it
like the weather: something that complaining about can do
nothing about.

the long history of this list proves that virtually,
absolutely nothing can be done to improve the signal-to-noise ratio on
the list. therefore, talking about it is a waste of time
and only makes people excited and irritable.

the only solution to the noise on the list is to unsubscribe.
if you don't like the list as it stands, don't subscribe.
the list is as it is, and historical precedent proves that
it has its own personality and flow that can't be rerouted
despite everyone's best intentions.

the best solution to list noise is to post on subjects you
want to read about. write things that you would like to read
had you not written them. simply complaining about the list contents
is like showing up at a potluck with empty hands and griping
that there's nothing good to eat.
