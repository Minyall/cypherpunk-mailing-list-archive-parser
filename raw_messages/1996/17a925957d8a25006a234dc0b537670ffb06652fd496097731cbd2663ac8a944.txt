Wrong. Information longs to be FREE.

You don't need to pay money for right-wing paranoid rants anymore. You can
now get this title, and many other random wacko publications, for postal
and duplication costs only from the copyright terrorists of the Sub-Aryan
Corps, in loose cooperation with Not_By_Me_Not_My_Views Publishing. I
believe the referenced piece goes for $2.25. Send cleartext inquiries and
offers to The Hare <hare@alias.alias.net>. Please note that Hare cannot
accept messages larger than 32K.

For a partial listing of materials available from the SAC/NP, send $2 to
National Vanguard Books, PO Box 330, Hillsboro WV 24946. All materials in
the National Vanguard Catalog are immediately available from SAC/NP for
75% off the price quoted by National Vanguard Books. SAC/CP charges no
sales tax.

Discussion of possibly illegal activities should be sent PGP-encrypted to
Presidente Dante <alighieri@alpha.c2.org> ONLY. Dante's public key is
available on all the keyservers.

Coming attractions from the Sub-Aryan Corps:

* Audiocassettes from the latest private meetings of the Michigan Militia,
  National Alliance, and Knights of the KKK.
* Communication between Neo-Nazi leader Willis Carto and various front
  groups, such as the Institute for Historical Review and the Liberty
  Lobby.
* Detailed financial disclosure statements from Ernst Zundel, Willis
  Carto, William Pierce, Ingrid Rimland, the White Aryan Resistance,
  Milton Kleim, Don Black, "Reverend" Schoedel, and Samisdat Publishing.
