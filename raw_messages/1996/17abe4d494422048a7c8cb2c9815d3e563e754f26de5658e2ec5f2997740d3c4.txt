As Tim May noted a few messages ago, the French government censored a
book written by the physician to their late president, Francois
Mitterrand. An enterprising fellow in eastern France scanned it into 189
pages of GIF files and put it online.

Now the French police have arrested him, ostensibly on unrelated charges.

I'm putting the complete version of the banned book, _Le Grand Secret_,
online -- you can find it on the following identical sites:

Since the combined size of the files is 9 MB, Seth Finkelstein and I
stripped the images from 4 bpp to 1 bpp (greyscale to monochrome), and
reduced the combined size to 2 MB. The stripped GIF files are on:
