This censored forum has no credibility, irrespective of the number of
subscribers.

Timmy tacitly admits that he lied when he claimed that no one had kicked me
off the list.

If that's how John Gilmore described it, then he's lying again. He never said
anything to me about the size of my messages, only about their contents.

Moreover if John Gilmore had a problem with the size of articles being sent
to his private mailing list, he would have configured majordomo not to
broadcast submissions above a certain size, the way most majordomo mailing
lists are configured.

John Gilmore is clearly a liar.

Of course Timmy May and John Gilmore would rather lie and not be called liars.

This from the asshole who rants about "don't hire" lists, "crazy Russians",
and mormons...
