   Yes, we all know that. But which one will Netscape actually _do_?

   If there's one thing we've learned from PGP, it's that configuration 
and per-user key management are killers. The reason why I'm so excited 
about Netscape is that you guys have the _possibility_ to really get 
strong crypto to the masses. Whether you really do that or not is in 
your hands.

   I've made a proposal for solving the 40-bit protocol failure in 
S/MIME. There are other proposals out there too, with various strengths 
and weaknesses. The main advantage of mine is that it requires no 
additional infrastructure - i.e. VeriSign does not have to start 
including algorithm preferences in the DigitalID's they distribute.

   Will Netscape come through?
