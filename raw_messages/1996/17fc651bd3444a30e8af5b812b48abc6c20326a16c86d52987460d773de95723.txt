While a solution like that would be optimal, even just a version of  
Mixmaster that can use a secure RSA card would do wonders for security.  The  
secret key is protected in the card and can't be stolen, even by root,  
without physically stealing the card.  As long as the most of the remailers  
in your chain don't have compromised secret keys, it probably won't matter  
too much if the individual ops can examine the messages flowing through their  
remailer.

The cards are getting cheaper and can be bought off the shelf (for now).   
The hardest part of retrofitting existing remailer software would probably be  
extracting the data from the remailer packet and formatting it properly for  
the card to do encryption operations on it (and back).
