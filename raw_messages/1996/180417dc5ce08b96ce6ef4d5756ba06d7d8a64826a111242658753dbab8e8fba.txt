Correction:  That should have been "Society and Group Oriented
Cryptography: A new approach" by Yves Desmedt in Crypto '87  [It
was sitting next to my desk and I was too lazy to reach over and
check...sigh.]  This particular paper deals with groups recieving
messages and requiring a subset to decrypt, a later paper by Desmedt
(or maybe Desmedt and Yao) deals with the signature system I
described.
