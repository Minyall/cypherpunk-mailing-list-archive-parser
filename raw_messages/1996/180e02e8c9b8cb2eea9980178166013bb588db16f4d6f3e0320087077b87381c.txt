Agreed. I think I adapted to RPN so quickly (less than 30 minutes at the
university bookstore, which had H-P 35s on display) because of this.

The problem "((5 + 7) * 4) / 3)" is easily understood as:

5 enter 7 add 4 multiply 3 divide

Once one groks RPN, it clearly is a speed win over entering parentheses and
that stuff. For any of you who are doubters, RPN usually produces far fewer
errors in identical calculations than Algebraic produces (the user errors,
not the hardware).

I found RPN ideal for exploratory calculations, where the stack orientation
was just so "natural."

This is not RPNpunks, but it seems that many of the younger subscribers
here really have not been exposed to RPN calculators. It's really worth the
$40 or so to buy the cheapest H-P calculator that has RPN.

(Be careful--not all H-P calculators are RPN these days. They bowed to
market pressure several years ago and introduced algebraic entry on their
low-end models.)
