I have always assumed that people on the net in India, China, etc. can use
the same free net.resources as everyone else to access locally blocked
material. For newsgroups, use something like 
	http://dana.ucc.nau.edu/~jwa/open-sites.html 

If the Indian or Chinese govt. forces all ISPs in its country to block
all known open NNTP servers, then that's a more serious situation. But I
haven't read anything indicating that.

The CompuServe incident caused a big ruckus because it involved a conflict
between the German govt. and many U.S. users, and (like it or not) users 
in the U.S. seem to be the most vocal group on the net.
