The NIA....

Yes the National Internet Association.......

Patterned after you know who.....

I'm not kidding, I think it's time.

"Privacy Through Cryptography."

"Communicate Globally, Censor Locally."

I think an old Doonesbury cartoon that had Duke (representing
the NRA) testifying before a Senate subcommittee summed it up
nicely.....

Senator: "And we and the American people have had enough of you and
your fanatic organization!"

Duke: " I see Senator, shall I put you down for a million
postcards?"

Senator: " Don't you threaten me mister!"

Politicians only understand one thing.
