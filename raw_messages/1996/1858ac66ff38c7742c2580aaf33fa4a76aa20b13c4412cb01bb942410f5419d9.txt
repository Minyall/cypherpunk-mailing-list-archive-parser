My principle objection to the income tax is not the money, but the
bookkeeping.  When I am earning the money to pay my taxes, at least I am
working at jobs that maximize my enjoyment and earnings.  When I do the
bookkeeping, I am doing a job I hate.  (I'd rather be digging out septic
tanks.)  I have no choice but to do that job.

Fortunately, I have a wonderful wife who does the bookkeeping.  However,
come tax time, she spends far too many evenings and weekends glued to the
bookkeeping.
