    I agree with Mr. May, and I will go so far as you call you a coward and
a thoroughly lousy human being. 

    I don't LIKE the idea of AP being necessary, and I am hoping that things
get better before someone get's desperate enough to implement it.

    On the other hand, I like living in a cage of someone elses making. If
I choose to restrict my life, it is mine to restrict. I don't want you to 
have that ability. 

    You obviously come from a family that believes it is Ok to "Rule" people.

    I wrote some fairly hostile shit about you and your family, but that 
is pretty irrelevant to this list, so I disgarded it.

    I will, however, say that you are a bloody fascist peice of work.
