Well, if Leahy passes, DCE is exportable.  Anyone know if the
'SecureRPC' in  DCE is the one BAL broke years back?  I asked a few
DCE supporters this, and never got an answer, so I suspect they're
still shipping bogus crypto.

As I sit, somewhere not in North America, I can see a CD-Rom from
Hewlett-Packard, which I've had since last year. Recently I received the
following letter. I've attempted to retype its contents accurately.

Dear HP-UX Support Customer,

Hewlett-Packard has uncovered a bundling problem in the DCE-Core fileset
that is on the October HP-UX Application Release 10.0 s700/800
Application CDs. These products were bundled such that they are not
compliant with U.S. Government export regulations. The part numbers for
the affected CDs and products are listed below.
