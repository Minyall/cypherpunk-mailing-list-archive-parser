Not even that in fact, there are methods, and I can confirm they work 
because I can do it myself, that allow one to memorize the order of a 
pack of playing cards, some people can even do it with up to 8 packs, 
although this requires a more complicated method. So while encryption 
requires one to have the cards ready (about 8 good riffle shuffles 
will restore a high degree of randomness to a deck) you can keep the 
pad for short messages in your head. But one can do the same with one 
time pads that use other plaintexts as the pad.
