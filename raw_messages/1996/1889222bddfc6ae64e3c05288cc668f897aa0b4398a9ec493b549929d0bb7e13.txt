I'm not sure what you mean by the DEADBEED attack on fingerprint
spoofing.  There is a DEADBEEF attack on keyIDs, where you can
generate a key that matches the keyID, since the keyID is only the
lowest bits of the key's modulus.  Basically, you can choose p and q
such that ((P*Q) & 0xFFFFFFFF) is the keyID you want to mimick.

There have been a number of lengthy posts about it in the past.  I'd
suggest you look in the cypherpunks or other appropriate archive.
