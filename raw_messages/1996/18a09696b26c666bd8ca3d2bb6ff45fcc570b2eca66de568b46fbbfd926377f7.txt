Tim May is the author of "The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto" and the
"Cypherpunks FAQ". These seminal works do much to promote the
cypherpunk concept, whereby ordinary people can limit the power of
government to snoop on their communications, by using the power of
cryptography. By tirelessly promoting strong unescrowed cryptography, 
Tim May frightens those that would enslave us all. His opposition
to the oppressive ITAR regs puts Tim May among those who work to 
advance the development of culture and against those who would work 
to suppress it.

Much of the time devoted to these concerns could have been devoted
to purely personal goals. Tim May must be hailed as a truly noble
supporter of the advance of freedom and humanity.
