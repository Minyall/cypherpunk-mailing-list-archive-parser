I generally agree with this. But this would not be "the net as I know it"
by any stretch of my imagination. Most of the people who get high priority(*)
in my incoming mail wouldn't start doing UUCP. We could still do some
version of the cpunks list, but at some point I would lose some enthusiasm
for a "means to an end" that is just an end in itself.

(*) or rather, they will when I get my .procmailrc debugged
