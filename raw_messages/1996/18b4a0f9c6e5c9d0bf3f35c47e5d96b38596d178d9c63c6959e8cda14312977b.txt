According to Applied Cryptography V2, 

     Symmetric and Public-key Key Lengths 
with Similar Resistances to Brute-Force Attacks

      Symmetric                Public-key
      Key Length               Key Length
       56 bits                  348 bits
       64 bits                  512 bits
       80 bits                  768 bits
       112 bits                 1792 bits
       128 bits                 2304 bits
