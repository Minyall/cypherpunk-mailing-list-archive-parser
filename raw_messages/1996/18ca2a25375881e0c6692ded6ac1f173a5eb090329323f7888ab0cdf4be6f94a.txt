What exactly is the reason for Netscape asking for the name, address, 
e-mail address, and telephone number of anyone who wishes to download 
the US-browser? If I remember correctly MIT in distributing PGP only 
asks that you affirmatively assent to obeying export laws (and the 
terms of the rsa license).

I have not heard at any point that the MIT system does not meet the 
legal requirements of ITAR. Is there perhaps some other reason 
Netscape wishes to have this information?
