Sorry, Perry.  This time you are wrong.  Cylink is giving away their 
Passport Gold SDK (Security Development Kit).  Period.  I've just recieved 
the documentation on the SDK itself, and am expecting shipment of the SDK 
itself about the middle of May.

I was skeptical myself when I read the first post regarding this SDK being 
released to the public for free, so I called up Cylink.  They promptly 
connected me with Peter Bolton <mailto:pbolton@cylink.com>, who has been 
very helpful in getting this SDK into my hot little hands.  Included is, 
and I quote:

"We hold the world-renowned Diffie-Hellman patent used in public key 
encryption.  While developing our industry-leading encryption acceleration 
engines, we also developed a full suite of services for 
Diffie-Hellman-based key exchange, government-sanctioned Data Encryption 
Standard (DES) encryption algorithms, Digital Signature Standard (DSS) 
document signatures, and the complementary functions you need to 
incorporate data security into your product.  And it's available to you for 
free: a no-cost toolkit and royalty free license."

This is the second paragraph of the fax I received from Cylink after my 
following up on the free SDK offer.  From the rest of the fax, it seems 
that provisions are included in the SDK for DH, DES, DSS, and SHA.  X.509 
appears to be in the works.  The SDK is purported to interoperate with the 
Cylink products based on the Secure Enterprise Architecture Stack.

I'm pretty dad-blamed excited about this one, boys.  I was trying to wait 
till I was sure to say anything on the list.  I'm sure.
