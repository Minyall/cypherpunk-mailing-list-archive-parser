Good news, but lets not forget that winning the battle  isn't winning the war. 

The dropping of the case means that the legality of the ITAR restrictions goes 
untested. Had the case not been dropped it would have expired shortly under the 
statute of limitations. 

The real issue here is the abuse of the investigative powers of the FBI in 
support of their own political agenda.
