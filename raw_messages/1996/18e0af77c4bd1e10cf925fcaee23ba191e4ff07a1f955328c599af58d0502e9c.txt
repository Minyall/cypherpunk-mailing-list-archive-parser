My point is actually not so much one of claiming credit for something I've
been involved with since 1988, as being somewhat critical of the
all-too-common tendency I see of _renaming_ something without adding any
new content.

Jim Bell calls his set of ideas "cyber-anarchy," and certain journalists
have picked up on this (as with the Australian article).

But with the exception of the one variant of anonymous markets, namely,
"assassination politics," most or all of the other ideas of his
"cyber-anarchy" seem to be encompassed by the already-existing term.
