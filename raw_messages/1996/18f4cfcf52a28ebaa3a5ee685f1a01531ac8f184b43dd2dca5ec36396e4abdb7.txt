Yes, the KOH disk encryption system. It is a small little thing that 
encrypts the FAT (I believe) and nothing will work unless you know the 
password. I also have a thing from the Navy that they use on their 
computers which might encrypt the HD (I haven't checked it out yet). You 
can find KOH at just about any extensive file listing of crypto or 
hacking stuff. Try to find Silicone Toad's File Resources, as it has the 
program.
