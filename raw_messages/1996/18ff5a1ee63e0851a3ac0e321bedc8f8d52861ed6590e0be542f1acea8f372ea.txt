The alt.tasteless crowd is currently discussing the CDA, with
some predictable results, and some not so predictable...
If you wish to participate in mass civil disobedience, follow
these instructions: Send a message CC'd to your local media's net
address and to justice.usdoj.gov (Department of Justice) which
contains something to the effect of, "I wish to turn myself in
for the crime of distributing offensive material via the Internet
and as evidence, provide the following:"
Attach some sort of uuencoded data to your message as "evidence".
Make sure that every possible media outlet hears loud and clear
that you want every last case prosecuted.
