I certainly don't want to stand in the way of such a plugin - it
certainly sounds like an interesting idea. However, the problem that
Netscape does not export mail through the plugin API sounds quite
difficult - it seems likely that, barring changes to the plugin API, an
entirely new and parallel mailer would need to be developed.

In the meantime, it is possible to integrate Unix Netscape with PGP
today, using premail. This includes fully seamless and transparent
support for PGP/MIME. In addition, you get support for the anonymous
remailers thrown in for free.

The main problem with the current release (0.43) is the lack of adequate
documentation. The near-mythical "next release" should fix that, when I
finally get it done.
