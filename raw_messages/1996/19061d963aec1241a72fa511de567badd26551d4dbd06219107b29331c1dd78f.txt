Another question is this:  Would the point-to-point (USA to USA) 
transmission of PGP by radio (say, a satellite telephone bounce) that is 
"inadvertently" intercepted external to the US qualify as a violation of 
ITAR?  It would be hard for the NSA to criticize this, as this is their main 
operations area.  Besides, if anybody was prosecuted, they'd presumably be 
able to subpoena the NSA about their monitoring operations, to determine if 
the NSA was violating any OTHER country's anti-export laws, etc.
