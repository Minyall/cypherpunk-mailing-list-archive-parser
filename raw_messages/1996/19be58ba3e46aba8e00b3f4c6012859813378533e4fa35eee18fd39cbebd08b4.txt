   "Chasing Criminals at Cyberspeed." 
 
      Three recent developments in the money laundering trade 
      have governments especially worried: the proliferation 
      of offshore financial centers, the collapse of the 
      Soviet Union and the adaptation of emerging technologies 
      to criminal ends. Officials think newly developed "smart 
      cards" will be particularly appealing to criminals. 
      Smart cards could be used to download cash from bank 
      accounts, then used to make payments or deposits 
      anywhere in the world. All without anyone knowing who 
      holds the smart card, because encryption guarantees 
      anonymity. 
 
      Says Stanley Morris, director of FinCEN, "The only way 
      we can adequately assist our federal law enforcement 
      counterparts in following the trail of the multinational 
      money launderer is through our linkages with 
      multilateral arrangements such as ... [Clipper 3]."

      Their main source of official information will be 
      material gathered by six electronic listening posts 
      stationed across Japan.
