I need some help testing my rewrite of mixmaster.

It is four separate programs (keygen, user-agent, queue process, daemon
reception) writting in portable ANSI C (gcc -Wxxxx is silent).  It
does not include RSAREF, but has a sane makefile for it if you need.
It uses autoconf.  It has some bugs.

If you're in the US, drop me a line.

Is decrypt-only software okay to export?  If so, then I have an
export version, too.
