Tim is criticizing whom?
Tim, it's spelled "sentence", with an "e".
Tim, it's spelled "capitalized", with an "a".

Speaking of "classis sense", this is yet another bunch of drivel which
says nothing but implies that ownership of the machinery allows the
"owner" to exercise rights over the messages and the messagers.

Do you talk to yourself a lot, bud?  Why should anyone give a damn what
you think about whether they are on-topic or not, or what they choose to
