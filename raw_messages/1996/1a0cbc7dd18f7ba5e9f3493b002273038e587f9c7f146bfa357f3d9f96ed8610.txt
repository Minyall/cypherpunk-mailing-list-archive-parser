Who wants to use the MTV web site anyway, but I suppose this could
spread. I guess a very popular site could allow access only to domains
(....foo.bar) that have paid instead of blocking those who have not,
otherwise 'new' sites could circumvent it easily. On the other hand,
a proxy server inside of an allowed domain would circumvent the allowing
kind of scheme, at least for a while (until they found out about it).
Great opportunities for hacking wars.

Another payment scheme in use is to recieve passwords for closed
Web pages by voice phoning to an expensive number. Did the porno sites
invent this (they have long been in related business)?

MTV TURNS THE TABLES IN WEB VIEWING
Viacom's MTV Networks has come up with a new way to make its Web investment
pay off -- it's putting the squeeze on online service providers, demanding
that they pay multimillion dollar fees or risk having their subscribers
blocked from viewing MTV's Web site. <...>
