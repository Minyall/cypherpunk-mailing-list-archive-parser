You are clearly an angry young man. I am sorry you have such a poor
opinion of people, I am even more sorry if it is justified. You can
believe me or not, but what you describe is *not* the ordinary case in
this country. Of course, in this country we have a disgusting 10+%
unemployment rate. Even if people DO want to work, there are no jobs.

All that aside, I can tell you do not have a family if you thing that
$6.50/hr is a living! Even accounting for the difference in our dollar,
I would say that is barely subsistence income for a single person. Are
we *all* not worthy of more than that?

cheers, kinch
