If you make any of your work at all trade secrets your entire system
is totally unacceptable to any real client with real security
needs. No rational security person is willing to accept the words of
snake oil salesmen -- like yourselves -- on faith.

You are the ones that are going to get laughed out of places, except
for the offices of the ignorant and gullible, whom you might prey
on. You should be ashamed to even dare to put it on the market. You
are committing nothing less than fraud, in all likelyhood.

You system resolves no key management problems because at this point
-- sight unseen -- I'm almost sure it is a piece of junk. You are
putting out too many "this is crap" keywords for me to think
otherwise. However, let me point out that you guys also don't know
what you are talking about. There is no key management problem per
se. RSA based systems are quite easy to use.

Even private key systems are quite workable. I actually work with
these firms -- its what I do for a living. They have existing systems
based on KDCs (do you even know what a KDC is?) and they function just
fine. As for public key technologies, they are in many cases
implementing technologies based on public key system. The only people
that are going to be laughed out are you guys. You are obviously the
worst kind of snake oil salesmen.

Are you refering to rotors, by any chance? Rotors are World War II era
technology. Of course, who can even guess what you are talking
about. You make about as much sense as the people handing out xeroxed
pamphlets on the street corner informing all comers about the fact
that they are being controlled by aliens.

I didn't. I just said that impressive numbers are meaningless. A
simple repeating Vigenere cipher's key can easily have more than
10^1690 possible keys and yet be crackable with no trouble at
all. Sheer number of combinations is meaningless. Big numbers are
meaningless. If you understood cryptography, my point would have been
obvious. You don't understand technology.

The first part of your comment is meaningless. The second part implies
that you know how to break RSA public key cryptography. Please
enlighten us as to how.

You won't allow anyone to do any investigating on your methods since
you keep them secret.

You should be ashamed. Luckily, no one is going to buy your products,
especially not once the crypto community is finished with you.
