That reminds me of my father's little jiffy fly killer recipe:

Prepare a batch of ammonium tri-iodide and while it is still moist mix
it with granulated sugar and then spread that mixture on the surfaces
where you expect the flies to land.  The flies will be attracted to the
sugar and then POOF! . . . .

Trouble is I was always too impatient and in checking to see whether
the ammonium tri-iodide was ready I would blow the stuff up in my
face--which rather gave a new meaning to the phrase ``red-faced''.

: lost interest in building explosive devices and rocketry after 18.

I suspect that there is a lot of truth in that.
