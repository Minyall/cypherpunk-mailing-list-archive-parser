    I'll raise the ante on <bold>official prediction</bold> one more:

        within two years, Bubba and friends will successfully both:

        a)  destroy the Bill of Rights

        b)  either ban the use of strong crypto or require full real-time
            GAK access --and the law will make the use of non-approved
            crypto a federal felony.

    the first USSC justice who retires (Renquist?) or dies (..?) --the
    precariously rights balance on the Court goes to Bubba.

  Now, with a black jack mule you wish to harness, you walk up, 
  look him in the eye, and hit him with a 2X4 over the left eye.   
  If he blinks, hit him over the right eye! He'll cooperate.  
        --so will politicians.
