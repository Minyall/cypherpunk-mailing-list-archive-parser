:Are you sure? The coverage has been wall to wall out here (Bay area); 
:front page above the fold, business pages, computer columns, editorials 
:and editorial cartoons. Apparently it's the same level of coverage back 
:in the RTP.

:What part of the country are you in? I guess the coverage is different 
:in the major geek zones like the bay area and RTP

It really does depend where you are at, all of the Metropolitin cities such as 
NY, LA, Chicago, etc are debating it.

If you live in a more braindead part of the country, well, as has been stated 
before, most  people think the internet is AOL, what do you expect?
