Are you sure? The coverage has been wall to wall out here (Bay area); 
front page above the fold, business pages, computer columns, editorials 
and editorial cartoons. Apparently it's the same level of coverage back

What part of the country are you in? I guess the coverage is different 
in the major geek zones like the bay area and RTP
