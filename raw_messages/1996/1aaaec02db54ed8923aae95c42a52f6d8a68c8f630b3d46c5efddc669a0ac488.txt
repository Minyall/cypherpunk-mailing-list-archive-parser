It is neither elite nor secret. It is fairly high signal to noise. I
think only about one in every fifty or so cypherpunks messages has any
content at all worth mentioning.

You have no right to grumble about the situation here. It is exactly
what you wanted. Here you were, a person of some personal gravitas and
moral authority, and you put your stamp on the "post whatever you
like; don't let the grumbling censors stop you". Well, as you sow, so
shall you reap. Its your fault, more than anyone else's.

Unfortunately, most of the smart coders had been driven out of this
cesspit by the noise levels, so it was the only choice left.

Actually, it isn't easier. I've tried filtering cypherpunks and its
damn hard. Doing it right would require much more AI than we have
access to.

As I recall, Mr. May, you were arguing against my continued attempts
to keep some semblance of technical discussion continuing on
Cypherpunks. The occassional attempt by me to turn things in a
technical direction was met by posts from you to the effect of "this
isn't coderpunks, get that technical stuff out of here". In jest or
no, I got sick of dealing with it.

I didn't want to see the split, but at least now there is a place I
can have discussions with smart crypto software coders. None of them
could tolerate Cypherpunks any longer. If Cypherpunks has become a
cesspit, well, its YOUR cesspit, Tim. Its the list you always strove
to create, but it appears that you now don't like the smell of your
own wallow. Well, sorry. Deal with it.

No, most of them are highly political. They just don't see any reason
to blather on about the same stuff over and over and over and over
when there is work to be done. Those that never do work may not
understand this principle, of course.
