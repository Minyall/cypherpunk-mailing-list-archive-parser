Incidently, this is being "solved."

In D.C. and Chicago the solution is to rip up the payphones and not permit
new ones to be installed.

If anyone objects the officals responsible make a wide gesture and say "We
didn't take away your phones, CRIMINALS took away your phones."

for one's activation in cash up front without presenting any real identity
