Actually, I'm just starting such a project in TCL...

The first phase is as a shell for Matt Blaze's Crypto File System, so it 
can be run, and changes made, without opening up a shell or dealing with 
command-line options.

The next phase will be to write (what I beleive to be) the first graphical
PGP shell for X.

While this isn't a seriously cypherpunks-relevant app, as most people 
running X are capable of dealing with the command line (I am, too, but I 
don't want to open up a shell every time I load up my encrypted 
partition), but I'm using it as a jumping-off point.

I don't think TCL is suited to heavy-duty crypto applications, except as 
an interface. Mostly because it is interpreted, though I'm not sure how 
"everything is a string" would affect bignums. (And I wouldn't want to 
write a TCL bignum library...)

It might be possible to write a remailer front-end in TCL, and that might 
be a near-future project, if the frontend project proves successful. 
(Which it has, in a sense, because the first phase (though it isn't where 
I'd want to distribute it far and wide) is done to the point where I can 
load my CFS partition and disconnect it without opening a shell...

(early Alpha code is available upon request, and suggestions/help/co-writing
 is most certainly welcome...)
