I don't know why Stephan waited so many days to make his comment. It was my
noticing that I had "collided" with his name, Schmidt, when I made my
facetious post that caused me to almost immediately issue a clarification
that I was not thinking of him when I made my first post.

To be clear, again, I was not basing my "Reichskommander Schmidt" line on
Stephan Schmidt. That was just a coincidence.

As to the "Reichskommander," in our country, and on the Net, such jokes are
not illegal. I rather suspect they are in Germany, either the DDR or the
Western side.

As to "tasteless and insulting," a matter of personal perspective. I find
it helpful to call a spade a spade, and others apparently do as well.
