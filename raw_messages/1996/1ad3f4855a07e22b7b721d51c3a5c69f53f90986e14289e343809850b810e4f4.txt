I'm sure that all those Netscape stock option holders would be happy to
renounce their citizenship in the service of the company that made them
millionaires and if they do so before cashing in the options (and before
Willie and the Congress agree on a budget with its emigrants's tax
provisions), they can keep the proceeds tax free.  If not, I'll learn C++
and renounce in exchange for those options.
