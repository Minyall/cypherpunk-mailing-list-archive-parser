As far as I can tell, whether a pol is Republican or Democrat tells us
nothing about how s/he stands on issues such as free speech and free
crypto.  I am feeling friendly toward Lehey and Weld these days and hostile
toward Feinstein and Buchannan.

We need to treat them as individuals.  We need to learn and publicize their
positions on the issues that interest us.
