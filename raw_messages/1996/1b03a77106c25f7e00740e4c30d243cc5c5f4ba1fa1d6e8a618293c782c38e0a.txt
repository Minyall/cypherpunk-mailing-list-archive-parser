US SEcret Service was always on top of criminal counterfeiting. I make 
that "criminal" distinction becaue there is allegedly a phenomenon of  
low-intensity-warfare going on, with Iran sponsoring more-or-less perfect 
counterfeits of hundred dollar bills.

Criminal counterfeiting was a dangerous game. Secret Service pretty much
knew every individuial/company who was involved in bona fide use of the
relevant papers, inks, engraving/printing equipments, etc., and anyone
ordering any of this stuff from the very limited number of suppliers, was
placed under watch. It's a small world out there, kids.
