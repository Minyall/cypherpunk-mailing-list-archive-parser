RC4 is of course unpatented and faster than anything else.
Of course the name RC4 is trademarked, so you could simply 
call it "the well known algorithm" in your documentation 
and give the algorithm explicitly.

RSA's present legal gimmicks seem to me to be based on the "trade secret"
that RC4 really is the well known algorithm, so if you refrain from 
using the name "RC4", you should be OK.  (I am not a lawyer.)
