   I've read that FDR had a humint source warning of a Japanese strike on 
Pearl Harbor. I also recall reading that J Edgar Hoover received a report 
of a diplomatic conversation detailing the planned attack, but sat on it.

The first was in a monograph which was putting forth the proposition that 
FDR  ardently desired to become involved in the war.  By the way, FDR was 
the man who made wage income, subject to federal taxation for the first 
time.

I don't remember where I read the second.

To me, both stories are plausible.
