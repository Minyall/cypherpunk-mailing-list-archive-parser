So, download every message, all the time, and junk posts that don't interest
you offline.

You betray yourself as an Evil Anonymous Communicator, but somehow I think
they might already know. You give no information about which messages you're
actually interested in unless your local workstation is compromised.

This is true. You'd have to generate white noise, again betraying yourself,
but only in general. "They" would need to track every message. To make it
more interesting, encrypt a bunch of messages for bogus PGP keys created for
the purpose.
