I suspect they are trying to get a judgement against "John Doe", in the 
hopes of tracking him down later.

Actually, if I had a sizeable judgement against such a John Doe, I could 
probably find a private detective who would find the dude for a 
contingent fee. Wow, a whole new class of factoring (commerce definition) 
opens up. Get me a lawyer....
