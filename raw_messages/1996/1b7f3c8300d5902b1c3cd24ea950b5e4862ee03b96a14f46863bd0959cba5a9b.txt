Was the person in the basement eavesdroping or actuall performing a
man-in-the-middle attack?

Don't high speed modems transmit and receive on the same frequencies,
using echo cancelation to decode the receive signals?  Does that make
it impossible to eavesdrop on high-speed (i.e. V32bis) modems?
