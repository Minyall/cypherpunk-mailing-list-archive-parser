	Isn't this attacking, or at least opposing, them directly?

	This is known as the "[S]he asked for it" argument, a widely
discredited defense.  If their _behavior_ doesn't indicate criminal
behavior, and there isn't a report of a crime with suspects meeting
their descriptions, there is no more excuse for hassling them than there
is for hassling blacks, or hispanics, or....  Who knows, they could
actually be a bunch of Marines (depending on the area).

AS> Another approach might be to talk about the concept of identity, and

AS> Germany were tracked down via phone records, bank records,
AS> membership lists of organizations (a lesson probably noted by the

AS> supreme court case upholding the right of anonymous association.)

	And more recently used in Texas by the KKK, represented by a
black (given the organization defended, I think that the race of the
attorney is relevant) attorney from the ACLU.  The attorney was
subsequently removed as the counsel for the Texas chapter of the NAACP.
