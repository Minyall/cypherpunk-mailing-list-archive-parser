	Somehow, I can understand how sending it to a _supervisor_ would break
privacy protections...
	Crypto relevance? Anonymous remailers can be used for complaints &
whistle-blowing. The latter may be unfortunate, depending on the law being
enforced.

JUDGE RULES AGAINST EMPLOYEE IN E-MAIL SNOOPING CASE
A federal judge in Philadelphia has ruled against a former employee of the
Pillsbury Co. who filed a suit claiming invasion of privacy after his e-mail
messages threatening to "kill the backstabbing bastards" and referring to an
upcoming party as the "Jim Jones Koolaid affair" were deemed to be
inappropriate, unprofessional and offensive, leading to his firing in
October 1994.  The company had repeatedly assured its employees that all
e-mail communications would be kept confidential, but the court found that,
"Once plaintiff communicated the alleged unprofessional comments to a second
person (his supervisor) over an e-mail system which was apparently utilized
by the entire company, any reasonable expectation of privacy was lost." (BNA
Daily Labor Report 6 Feb 96 AA1)
