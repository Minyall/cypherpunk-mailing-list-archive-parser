When I was in high school (age 14-18), I was on the high school rifle team.
 That means I carried a rifle into school at the beginning of the season
and back home at the end of the season.  I should not be necessary to
mention it, but I never shot anyone then, before, or since.

I have two children, ages 20 and 24.  We never gave them toy guns.  (Guns
are serious things.  If you want toys, spend your own money.)  However, we
did give them the opportunity to learn about and shoot real guns when they
were quiet young.  I first shot a rifle at age 8 at summer camp.  I
recommend teaching children about proper use of guns at a similar age, with
tight supervision.
