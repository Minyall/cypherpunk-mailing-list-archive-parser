CodeSign on ListAdmin@lists.msn.com

CodeSign is a mailing list (discussion list) for discussions on
Microsoft's Windows Trust Verification Services, a set of API's which
determine whether a software component contains digital certificates
that identify it as being authentic software released by a publisher
trusted on the local user's system.  For more information about Code
Signing, see <http://www.microsoft.com/intdev/>.  

You can subscribe to the regular mailing list or a digest version. To
