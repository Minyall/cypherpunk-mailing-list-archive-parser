Good way to get the latest and greatest technology without paying for it, 
too.  I wonder how many of those Mercedes and BMWs are sitting around in 
impound lots ad how many of them are being driven around by DEA bigwigs?

Didn't they used to do this sort of thing 200+ years ago - convict 
someone of a minor crime, then seize all their assets?  Wasn't this one 
of the things that prompted the US breaking away from GB?

Seems like history is full of stuff like this.  Sad case of 'those who 
fail to learn from history are destined to repeat it.'
