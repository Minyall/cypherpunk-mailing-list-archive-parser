.WAV files are potentially a good place to store stego information.  With a
16-bit file, as many as 8 of the least significant bits in each sample can be
replaced with encrypted info without making the file sound too wierd
(depending on the natural background noise of the recording).  If you make
one of those "waves on the beach" relaxation things, you might be able to get
away with even more.

Another thing--just a wild idea--test the randomness of encrypted data by
storing it in an 8-bit mono .WAV (your choice of sample rates) file and
listening to it.  Any correlations or patterns in the data should show up in
the playback as hums, clicks, squeals, or something.  It may even be possible
to determine the algorithm by the sound patterns--a sort of "audio
cryptanalysis."  Has anyone tried this?  Are there any .WAV stego programs
out there?
