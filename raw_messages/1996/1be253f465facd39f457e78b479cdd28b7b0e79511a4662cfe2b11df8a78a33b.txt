     The towed 155's from the ANG unit I was in during college were 
pretty big, but it is awful hard to hit a single person at less than 300 
yards. 
     A 12 guage looks a lot bigger 3 inches from your nose than 3 feet 
away, but I'd rather have a hostile hold it 3 inches from my nose than 
3 feet away. 

     If you don't understand why, go talk to a _serious_ martial arts
type.
