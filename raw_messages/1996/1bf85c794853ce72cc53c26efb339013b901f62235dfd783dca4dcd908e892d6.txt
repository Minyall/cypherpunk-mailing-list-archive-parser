I keep hearing that it is only patented in the States by virtue of having
been presented in public before the application (which they did to avoid a 
gag order). I know that Schneier and others list it as only patented in 
the States. 

Are you wondering whether some odd provision of NAFTA would give it
protection in Canada? Otherwise it should be public domain. Anyone else
know for certain?
