[ Good critique of NRC crypto report ]

I completely agree.  The *best* that could be said of this report is
"56 bits instead of 40".  B.F.D.  And aside from that one concession,
it's a step backward.


BTW, does it seem to anyone else that recommendation 1 "no law should
bar the .... use of ... encryption within the United States" is
contradicted by recommendation 5.4: "Congress should seriously consider
legislation that would impose criminal penalties on the use of encrypted
communications in interstate commerce with the intent to commit a
federal crime"?  Maybe they meant to say "no law except those we
propose below" :-(.
