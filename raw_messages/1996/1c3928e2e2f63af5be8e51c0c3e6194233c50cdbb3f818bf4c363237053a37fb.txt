Anon.penet.fi is working just fine.  The problem is that someone
subscribed to the cypherpunks list as anXXXXXX@anon.penet.fi, so
any time you post to cypherpunks, anon.penet.fi receives a message
        From: you@yourplace.com
        To: anXXXXXX@anon.penet.fi
        Subject: My exciting post to cypherpunks
It then checks its userlist for you@yourplace.fi, doesn't find you,
allocates anYYYYYY@anon.penet.fi, notifies you, and sends out the message
        From: anYYYYYY@anon.penet.fi
        To: hisname@hisplace.com
        Subject: My exciting post to cypherpunks

In my case, if I post to cypherpunks, it checks its userlist for
stewarts@ix.netcom.com, finds anZZZZZZ@anon.penet.fi, sees that my
password is PASSWORD, sees that the posting doesn't include the password,
and sends me a reject message.  

The problem is that, the next time you post to cypherpunks, it'll leak
your identity in the message headers; I forget the details.

The way to prevent this whole mess is to educate majordomo to turn
subscription requests from anXXXXXX@anon.penet.fi into naXXXXXX@anon.penet.fi,
or at least to block subscription requests form anXXXXXX@anon.penet.fi.
