Peter Cassidy, an esteemed subscriber here, is the Wired author Tim notes,
who reports on the Bernstein case in the June issue. A well-written piece
with several thought-provokings in addition to those cited by Tim. 
 
 
Peter writes of Judge Marilyn Hall Patel on the Bernstein case: 
 
 
"Before the case is resolved, Patel's skepticism of the state's perogatives
will be tested to the limit when the government is called upon to defend
its policy. Patel is then likely to be given the *in camera* presentation
of The Deepest Darkest Secrets of Cryptography -- probably a modified
version of the classifed briefing the NSA has used with great success to
influence members of Congress. Legend has it that no one who ever got 'the
briefing' ever again opposed the agency." 
 
 
Peter, anyone, are these welcome-to-the-inner-circle briefings always by
NDA, or worse threat? 
 
 
Wonder if a public-spirited cryptographer is working on a book for a movie
about this heart of the deepest darkness?
