If the below is accurate, your company is in even more trouble.  I do hope
no one would think of RECORDING a conversation with a safemail
represenative.  I admit that it would be valuable to an attorney looking
to sue Safe Mail, but it's not a very nice thing to do.  Even if its
legal. (which it would be in most states).

Talked with Randy of Safe Mail Corporation on the phone.  

Among the stuff he claimed was that

        PGP has the secret key in its public key!

        Found out that not only does this algorithm use 22 characters.  
        The characters are the ones only found on the keyboard.

        SafeMail uses a proprietary Russian algorithm.

        
Not only is this company misquoting it's making up as it goes along. :)
