	roy is a microsofter --of course, is it written for microsquish and 
    their compiler/api fad of the month? 

	is source code available, or is the code non-portable outside the 
    limited interpreters and compilers of MS?

	32 bit is obsolete --64 bits is the standard.  after all there are 
    other systems except MS.

	I have a simple policy regarding MS --I just don't!
