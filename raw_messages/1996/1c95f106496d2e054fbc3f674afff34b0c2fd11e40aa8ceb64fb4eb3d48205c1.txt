Thaks to Tim for politely noting that I alfingered most admirable Gordon
Moore as mal intendu Intel-inside wheeler-dealer. That's actually Andy
Grove, el supremo maestro of Intel intel despicably untellable -- except to
those deep, deep inside black budgeteering. 
 
 
A crank SciFi fantasy, to be sure, long ago, and well into the intel
futures, disproven.  
 
 
Like NASDAQ never cheats consumers.
