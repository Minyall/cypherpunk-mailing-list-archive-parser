No, it does not come with source code. Site licenses and OEM
bundling packages will come with a source code option. Partners
who work with us in internationalizing the product may also
receive source code. However, it did not seem to be useful or
appropriate for a consumer-level product like this.

We are trying to find a happy medium between making sure that the
security is well-reviewed, and doing things that make business
sense and map onto standard industry practice for selling software
products. 

Note that SafePassage uses SSLeay for its encryption and SSL
protocol layer; SSLeay has publicly available source code, and has 
been extensively reviewed.
