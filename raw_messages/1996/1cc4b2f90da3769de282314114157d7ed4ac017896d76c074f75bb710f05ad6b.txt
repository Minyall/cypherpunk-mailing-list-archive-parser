JNPGP also has problems when you're encrypting to an address that isn't 
on the keyring.  It'll barf and send the plaintext message out.  A really 
bad flaw.

It'd be nice to see it or another utility incorporate support for 
anonymous remailers, etc.

IMO, all this will be made much easier when PGP 3.0 exists as a Windows 
or OS/2 DLL.  PGP will probably take off beautifully then.
