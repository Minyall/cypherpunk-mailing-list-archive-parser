Needless to say, I disagree.  If you define government as, "That entity 
which keeps me from doing bad things to people,"  then a S+W model 629 .44 
caliber revolver "quacks like a government to you."

If the reason you don't do bad things in public because people will sneer at 
you and criticize, then sneering and criticizing "quacks like a government 
to you."

What "Assassination Politics" does is to eliminate the ability of 51% of the 
population to control the remaining 49%.  If there is any residual 
pro-government bias left in this system, tell me and I will work strongly to 
root it out.
