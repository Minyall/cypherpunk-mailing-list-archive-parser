You guys OBVIOUSLY confuse reality with cyberspace.  Grafitti is actual
property damage.  A message in an EmailBox is long, long way from
being comparable.  Let's make use of that "education" that seems to

Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, 
nor do the children of men as a whole experience it.  Avoiding 
danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure.
