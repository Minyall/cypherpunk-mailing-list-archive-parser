i think a related point is one we all know well, that being if there is a
will, there is a way.. we've seen it with phoney physicians and
specialists, even, with certificates and physicians' licenses.. if someone
wants to intercept corespondence and impersonate another person, it is
easy enough if that person has the time and impetus..
