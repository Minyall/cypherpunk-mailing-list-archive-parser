           NEW RELEASE OF WINDOWS ENCRYPTION UTILITY

Hewitt, Texas - Kent Briggs, author of Puffer, has announced the
release of version 2.0 of the popular shareware encryption utility.
Puffer is a password-based data file and e-mail encryption program
for Windows.  Encryption software allows users to keep their
personal, business, and electronic transmitted data private.

New for version 2.0 is the addition of a very fast stream cipher,
PC1.  PC1 operates with a 40-bit encryption key and produces the
same stream output as RC4, the most secure encryption technology
allowed for export from the United States.  Puffer retains the
160-bit Blowfish block cipher in the registered version provided
to customers in the U.S. and Canada.

Puffer's revamped interface features a tabbed-notebook layout and
a new built-in text editor.  Users can now encrypt and decrypt data
and e-mail directly from disk files, the editor, or the Windows
clipboard.  An LZ77 data compression option is also available.  The
ability to produce ASCII, binary, and self-extracting archives is
also retained in version 2.0.

New data wiping features have been added to Puffer to prevent
sensitive data from being unerased on your disk drive.  In addition
to wiping data files, Puffer now has options to wipe file slack and
unused disk space.  The user can select from one to seven random
stream passes for each wipe operation.  A separate DOS utility is
provided to securely wipe the contents of the Windows permanent swap
file.

The shareware version (PUFF20.ZIP, 368K) can be downloaded directly
from the author's web site at http://execpc.com/~kbriggs
