I am looking for a job in the computer business doing basically anything computer related, except something like typing all day, where i could get some experience around different computer enviroments.  I have good knowledge of PC's and of some basic network situations.  If anyone is in the NY metro area or on Long Island and is looking for some summer help could you please e-mail me back.

Thanks
