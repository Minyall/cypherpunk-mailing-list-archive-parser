I've looked more closely at the "Royal Holloway" protocol, supposedly
under consideration by the EC for key escrow in Europe, though I must say that
anyone who deploys it will get what they deserve.

I have discovered some further weaknesses in the protocol, documented
at:

Comments are welcome.

Cheers,

Ben.
