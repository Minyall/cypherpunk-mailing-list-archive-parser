Mr. Babayco,

I did not request your mail to me, and I am annoyed at having received it.

I am not interested in the views you are advertising or selling, and I'd
prefer that you not mail me.

To make me whole, I demand that you send me $125 for this occurrence, and
$125 for each future occurrence.

Have a nice day.
