Alan,

I agree that I was looking at *Arabic* Islam, in which specific bad
features of Arabic culture have congealed with the religion.  It is as if
I were to judge Christianity solely by reference to the Spanish Inquisition.

However, this being said, it is presently true that Arab Islam is the 
most important single strand.  It may be that the softer oriental 
versions will gradually take over.  If so, this is to be desired.  
Indeed, so far as we can, we should even encourage this.  In the 
meantime, though, I think it wise to be aware of the nastiness of much 
actually existing Islam, and to challenge any claims that its devotees 
may make to moral superiority over our own civilisation.  I think I was 
too harsh in my postings of last week.  But I stand by my dislike of the 
Islam that I most often see.

Yours ever,

Sean.

PS	I seem to be breaking my self-denying ordinance about postings on 
Islam to the list.  But this I suppose only confirms Tallpaul's doubts 
regarding the honour and consistency of libertarians!
