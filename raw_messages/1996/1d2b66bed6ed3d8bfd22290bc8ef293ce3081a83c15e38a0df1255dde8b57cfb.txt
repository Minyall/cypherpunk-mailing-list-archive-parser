Excellent point Bill! Lets not forget that IBM owns Lotus Notes, be
sure to include that in your bashing. They caved in on Lucifer
after all. ;)

Four Bits:

On First Virtuals Sniffer program:

Stick a VISA,MASTERCARD,DISCOVER, or AMERICAN EXPRESS sticker on
the front of a SECURE_ID card   Attack>null
( Security Dynamics is SDTI on NASDAQ ;) )

Six Bits:

_TAKEDOWN_ by Tsutomu Shimomura confirms that Kevin Mitnick used
PGP extensively, and encrypted his drives, expect the TLA's to use
that in their arguments. (Head them off at the Pass!)

A Dollar:

For those who seem to have missed it.

"Vladimir Z. Nuri" <vznuri@netcom.com> = Larry Detweiler

Back to our regular Flamefest......
