The best way to convince others you are crazy is to actually be crazy.

More practically, if you organize your nuclear forces so that any 
serious war is likely to escalate uncontrollably into the battle of 
armageddon, regardless of your intentions and desires, which is how 
the American government organized its nuclear forces in Europe, 
then you can pretty much guarantee you will not have to face a 
serious war.
