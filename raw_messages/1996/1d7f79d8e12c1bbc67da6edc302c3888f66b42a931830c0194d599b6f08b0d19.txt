Just a small parenthesis at this point: traceability can be dangerous
even in non-repressive regimes; there is information about oneself
which, although far from illegal or "top secret", is not exactly for
the whole world to know; this sort of information includes, but is not
limited to, financial transactions, product preferences, habbits,
hobbies etc.

My feeling is that it's better to devise ways to prevent a digital
crime (for lack of better term) than try to find and punish the
culprit(s).

Of course, this applies to SOME services (i don't expect anonymous
contracts to become very popular), for which anonymity makes sense.
But the infrastructure has to be there, IMNSHO. 
Just my $0.02 (+tax).

PS. An interesting thing to consider is whether traceability in a
service should be inherent to it or enforced by policy.
