All of the I.D. checks I have received have been at the ticket counter, to
receive my boarding pass. The airport security guards have never asked me
for any form of I.D., picture or otherwise.

(As has been commented upon by many analysts, it's likely that the airline
companies are enforcing the picture I.D. rule so as to stop the practice of
people buying discount tickets and then selling them to others.
Specifically, many corporations buy tickets in advance of knowing who the
actual business traveller will be. The airlines are causing many who arrive
at the ticket counter to "upgrade" to a full-fare ticket under their real
name.)

The "security" implications are a joke. More pablum fed to the gullible.
