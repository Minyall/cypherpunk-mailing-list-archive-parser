Sometimes I wonder if I came from another planet, or is everyone 
experiencing the same thing, i.e., I have two relatives high up in 
Scientology (recruiting, placement, fundraising), several in LDS, even a 
Pagan or two, and I'm not even from California.

If the Mormon database is so innocuous, why are they so *desperate* to 
build it?  Genealogical?  If you ever rode on a train, a plane, or took 
a cruise, you're in it.  They have everything.  Or, in the vein of 
Hoover or Wackenhut, "you can never have enough".
