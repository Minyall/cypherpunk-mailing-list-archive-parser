Compromise on Encryption Exports Seems to Unravel

"We really feel that there has been a bait and switch situation 
and I'm not going to be silent about it," said Roel Pieper, 
chief executive and vice chairman of Tandem Computers. 

A Nov. 15 executive order that transferred export oversight 
to Commerce contained several new wrinkles that even previous 
industry supporters consider potential deal breakers. For one 
thing, the Justice Department would play a consulting role to the 
Commerce Department, which industry executives see as giving 
law-enforcement officials too big a role in the export process. 

And they contend that the order prescribes a system that might 
enable law-enforcement officials to unscramble messages 
while they are being transmitted, rather than after the 
fact, as the IBM compromise had seemed to specify.
