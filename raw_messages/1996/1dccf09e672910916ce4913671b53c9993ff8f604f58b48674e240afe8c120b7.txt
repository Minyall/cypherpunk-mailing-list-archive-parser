Dave Feustel <feustel@netcom.com> on talk.politics.crypto mentioned that
on Saturday morning CSPAN was broadcasting congressional hearings on
"currency creation, during which smartcards, Ecash, encryption, privacy and
government regulation of all of the above were discussed."  There's supposed
to be at least one rebroadcast.

A brief review of the highlights would be very interesting.
