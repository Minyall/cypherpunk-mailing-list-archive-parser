The original SSN was never intended to be used as a form of 
identification, or so the government claimed.  You may request
from the government a taxpayer ID number, which you may then use
in lieu of your SSN for identification purposes, if you desire
to hold the government to its original promise. 

Of course, using a Taxpayer ID everywhere provides you with no more
anonymity than using an SSN everywhere.  Such is life.
