         HAVANA (Reuter) - Cuban authorities have approved access to  
the Internet and other global information networks but will 
limit such access according to national interests, official 
media said Thursday. 
         The ruling Comunist Party newspaper Granma said regulations  
adopted earlier this month outlined the need for access to 
Internet and other world information networks, while observing 
interests such as ``defense and national security.'' 
         The policy of establishing who had access would be defined  
by Cuba's interests, giving priority to individuals and bodies 
with most relevance to the country's life and development, the 
newspaper said. 
         It did not specify who such people might be, but they are  
likely to come from approved state organizations and academic 
and research centres. 
         Information divulged from such global networks should be  
trustworthy and in line with Cuba's ``ethical principles'', 
Granma said. 
         A committee regulating the policy on global information  
networks would be drawn from ministries that will include the 
Interior Ministry, the Justice Ministry and the Armed Forces 
Ministry, Granma said.
