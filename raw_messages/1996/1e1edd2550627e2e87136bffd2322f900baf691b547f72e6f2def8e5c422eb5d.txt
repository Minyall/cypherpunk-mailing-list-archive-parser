Regarding the idea of setting up markets (or bounties) for software, I'd
like to direct your attention to the Idea Futures scheme.  This is
currently embodied as a web server at:
    http://www.ideosphere.com/ideosphere/fx/main.html

There is some background on the idea by Robin Hanson who talks
extensively about using it as a funding mechanism.  In addition there is
a whole suit of market claims denominated in fake money.
