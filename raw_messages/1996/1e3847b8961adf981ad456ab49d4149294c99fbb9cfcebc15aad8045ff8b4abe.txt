Ballpark estimate:  If the encryptor receives a complete packet before
encrypting and forwarding it then there would be an additional
packetSize/byteRate + encryptionTime seconds added to the packet's transit
time.

If the encryptor encrypts "on the fly", passing the bits of a packet as
their are received, then it would add almost no latency.  However, the
encryption algorithms would be limited to stream cyphers, which have
security and error recovery implications.  See "Applied Cryptography" for
details.
