I watched CIA Director John Deutch (or is it Deutsch?) explain today just
how the rules are being relaxed on having journalists as CIA operatives,
and I could practically hear a collective "Oh, Shit!" echo from the
journalistic capitals of the Second and Third Worlds.

Even when journalists were reporting to the intelligence agencies, they
like the convenient fiction that such practices were forbidden. Even so, a
couple of journalists were tagged by the governments they were spying on
and disposed of.

Expect this to increase. Except now it will likely be Russian Mafiosos
garrotting the "Washington Post" economics reporter in the back alleys off
the Arbat.
