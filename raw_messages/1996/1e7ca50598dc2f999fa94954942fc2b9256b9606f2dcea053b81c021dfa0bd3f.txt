At least in the Windows version, you can set the SMTP server you
want to use for your outgoing mail.  So you could do a proxy email server
that listens for SMTP and pops up confirmations for outgoing traffic.
For the moment, you'd probably have to write your own, but the new
Winsock Remailer probably has the code you need to do most of the work,
and you'd only have to add some GUI buttons and whistles.
