Hurricane Bertha hit Anguilla just perfectly to do the most damage. Just
north of the storm the counterclockwise spin and westward movements add
for maximum destructive power, and we were just north of it.  Don't know
of any people or houses that were hurt, but a bunch of power and phone
lines have been damaged. 

We lost power, ran for about 10 hours on battery, and then shut down. But
about 24 hours later we are back online to stay. 

We are temporarily located in the Cable and Wireless building in town.
Thanks Cable and Wireless!

And thanks to everyone for your patience,
