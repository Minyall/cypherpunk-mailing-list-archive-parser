: Oh dear!  So I am incorrect... but wait, what about people like
: sunsite northern europe (Imperial College London: ftp.doc.ic.ac.uk)
: who already have a license to be a Netscape mirror site.  Would this
: license allow them to distribute this latest 128 bit netscape beta
: (were it to leak)?
