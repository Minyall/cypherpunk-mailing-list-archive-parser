I saw Mission Impossible last night.  It deals with some cypherpunks issues,
as the plot centers on anonymous BlackNet style operations on the Internet.
Unfortunately, it does it badly.  Particularly silly is the reference that
a STU-III is a security penetration device.  The main hacker is called
Luthor, though he doesn't look a thing like Lex.  The Usenet is dealt
with in a laughable manner -- a grep of the entire 'net for "Job" doesn't
turn up a single hit.

Having said all of that, lots of things explode.  It's good in THX.
