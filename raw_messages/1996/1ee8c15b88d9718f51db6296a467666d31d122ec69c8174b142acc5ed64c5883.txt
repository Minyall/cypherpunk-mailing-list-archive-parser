So are there any arbiters out there who would deal in non-digital cash? Or
someone who would launder US$ to Ecash for a smalle fee? I'd like to
arbitrate a few minor disagreements with my 95% friend Declan. Clearly,
neither private email nor restrained public flames have worked for three
months.
