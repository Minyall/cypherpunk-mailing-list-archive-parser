This thread is near to the end as the "Nazi Card" has been played...

It looks like "White Supremacists" are destined to become the "fifth
horseman", thus preserving the "law of fives".  I expect to see more uses of
this horseman to attempt to reign in the internet under the yoke of
Government control.  There should be a story on one of the news tabloid
shows any day now...

OBNonSequiter:  I was going through old mail and came upon a rant claiming
that "the End of the Government was at hand!".  It reminded me of some
discussions here about a year ago where various on the anarchist side were
declaring the "imminent death of the state" (GIF at 11).  A quote came to
mind...

"The death of the state is not going to be like some old man dying in the
corner.  It will be like an old man in a crowded building having an
epileptic seizure with lots of guns!"
