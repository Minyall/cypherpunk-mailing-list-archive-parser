Igor, such advice to "why don't you relax" is unwanted. I did not post my
mail to Ross Wright, while he has posted not only my private mail to him,
but has also written half a dozen other of us his " Fuck You, Too, Timmy! "
messages (I'm now looking at this creep's stuff before emptying my trash,
to see what this twit is up to).

Your message is the equivalent of that brain-damaged ebonite's "Why can't
we all just get along?"

Just say "No" to "Big Brother Inside"
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
