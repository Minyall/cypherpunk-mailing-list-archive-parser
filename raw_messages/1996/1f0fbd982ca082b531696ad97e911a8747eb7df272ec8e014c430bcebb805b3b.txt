Since Vulis decided to drag in a disagreement from elsewhere, I have a brief
invitation.

He says I'm going to die in the next few months. My birthday is in October.
So on my birthday in 1997, I'm going to have a party. All present will be
invited to petition Vulis for more oracular pronouncements about the fate of
past and present posters to Cypherpunks.

In the meantime, I give thanks to the God of Killfiling, and fire mine up.
