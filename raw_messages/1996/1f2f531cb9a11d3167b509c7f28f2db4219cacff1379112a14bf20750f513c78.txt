   5-7-96. NYT and WSJ report on Inferno, Lucent's (Bell Labs)
   new all-platform network OS, and its Limbo programming
   language.

   Dennis Richie says, "Inferno is a unique network operating
   system that adapts to whatever you plug into it -- from a
   high-end work station to an inexpensive hand-held device.
   Imagine the ease and flexibility of a world in which you
   can get your E-mail virtually anywhere, from any machine --
   on your PC at the office, from a screen phone in an
   airport, on your TV at home, or on a hotel-room TV."

   Dan Stanzione adds, "With Inferno, any device can
   communicate and share information with any device over any
   network."

   It is designed to coexist with Java and DOS.
