Speaker-independent recognition of digits is a done deal.
For large-scale automated attacks, you obviously don't wiretap the customer;
you hire The Dread Pirate Mitnick* to wiretap the 800 number for the
Home Shopping Channel, and hoover down the CC numbers of a large
number of known frequent-shopping cardholders.  (Actually, hitting on them
might be a bit tough, since they've presumably got direct T1s or T3s from
one or more carriers, which are harder to tap than the average residence line.)

but Fred Bargle, who's got the current Dread Pirate Mitnick franchise.... :-)
