There is, however, a slightly different way of looking at this.  For 
centuries, there was a saying "Nature abhors a vacuum."  While not 
scientifically correct, from the standpoint of people living below an ocean 
of atmosphere it seemed to be true.  Likewise, the political system seems to 
abhor a situation where there is neither law, nor a proposed law.  The best 
tactic might be to insist on modifications to the Leahy bill, most of which 
are quite justified, but cumulatively will be seen by "the enemy" as being 
so extreme as to be unacceptable.  At that point, the enemy may actually 
agree with our assessment that no law is better than the corrected Leahy 
bill, and we'll both walk away satisified with the "no law" option.

Think of it like pouring sugar into a gas tank.

Hey, see, I'm useful!  I make you look more, uh, "reasonable", right?
