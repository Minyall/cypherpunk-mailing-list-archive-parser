True - and while the administration/FBI and their pawns at NIST (most of 
which are ex-NSA) recognize they can't force total key escrow right now, 
they are working on a FIPS to ensure that all government software 
purchases include government key escrow, to try to tilt the marketplace 
towards this idea.  

>From the various Key Escrow meetings I've gone to, the main people who 
said they want voluntary escrow was mainly banking concerns, and they 
certainly wanted it in safe hands, not in the hands of the government.  
Infact no one from industry was concerned about "immediate key escrow" 
for tapping phone lines (except for this crazy guy from IBM).  Key escrow 
was only seen as useful in terms of data recovery.
