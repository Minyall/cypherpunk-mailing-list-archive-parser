Hi,

This is primarily addressed to the person who supports cypherpunks
mail-to-news gateway. If you know who such person is, please send
his/her address to me.

Dear gateway maintainer, 

Please modify your reposting program so that it does not remove the

		X-No-Archive: yes 

header line from email messages. This particular header line is an
indication to USENET search engines that the author of the message would
not like it to be stored in these engines. It preserves the author's
privacy and enforces the copyright protection.

I am opposed to seeing my articles showing up in DejaNews and other
search engines. All my emails and usenet postings have this header
line. However, when cypherpunks-to-newsgroup gateway reposts all
articles, it strips this header line. I believe it to be a mistake
and hope that it will be corrected.

Thank you.

	- Igor.
