Libertarian philosophy is, however, sympathetic to vigilantism. True
libertarians might characterize AP-type schemes as allowing two forms of
action: just assassination (Hitler, Stalin) and unjust murder (most
everyone else). But reasonable libertarians will probably disagree where 
lines should be drawn.
