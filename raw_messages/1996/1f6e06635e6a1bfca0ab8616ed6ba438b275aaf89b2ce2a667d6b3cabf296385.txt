I think your point was that the net was not responsible for the
proliferation of Anthrax development data.  (Am I wrong?)

My point was that in the eyes of the "leaders" all that is required to
make the net responsible for the proliferation is for the process to be
describeable in a simple one or two page set of instructions (such as
Anthrax is).
