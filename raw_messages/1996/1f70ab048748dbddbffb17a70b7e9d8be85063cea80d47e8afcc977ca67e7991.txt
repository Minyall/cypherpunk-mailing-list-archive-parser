  PRETTY GOOD PHONE PRIVACY, TOO
 
  Now from the creator of PGP encryption software comes a new 
  product for making your phone calls more private.  Philip 
  Zimmermann's PGPfone software scrambles phone calls made 
  through a computer modem using a complex algorithm called 
  Blowfish, which rearranges the digital version of your voice 
  conversation and then decodes it at the other end.  The result 
  is an intelligible -- though not high-quality -- totally pri- 
  vate conversation.
