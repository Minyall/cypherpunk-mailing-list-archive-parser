One word...

Zimmermann.

Zimmermann supports my contention, as I wrote in the post. NOTHING
happened to him. it is conceivable this same result could have
been arrived at (government drops investigation) if he never even 
hired a lawyer.

Zimmermann is a perfect example of what may be counterproductive
hysteria on *our* side, toward advancing crypto. if Zimmermann
cannot be prosecuted, and is not prosecuted, where are the ITAR "teeth"???

sure, endless people can argue with me. "nasty things will befall you
if you violate crypto sections of the ITAR". they will back these
example up with the same baseless fear that schoolchildren reverently refer
to Cooties or the Bogeyman.
