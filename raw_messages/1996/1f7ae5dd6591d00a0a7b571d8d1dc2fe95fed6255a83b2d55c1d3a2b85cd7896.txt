Thanks to the Olympics, Georgia Tech now has 100% Ethernet availability
in its dormitories.  Currently the system utilizes a fiber-optic campus backbone
with network hardware in each building providing a 10BaseT port to each
student.  Work is underway to install ATM hardware and upgrade ports to
100Mb/s networking technology.
