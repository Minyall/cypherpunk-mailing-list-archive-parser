   It is true, so many government sites have been hacked!
The FBI home page was replaced with SATANIC stuff. A picture 
of the upside down cross as a background and various other
changes regarding SATAN.

i think it's funny, but hey it's our own goverment. I wonder 
how often they check their sites. BTW, my friends site -
http://pages.prodigy.com/VT/hackersguide has a link to the
FBI's MOST WANTED LIST. See if you are there!
