Thank you, Dr. Grubor. I fully agree with your assessment of John Gilmore.
Note that the claim that I write "SPAM" (in capital letters) is a lie, and
probably actionable.

Thank you, Dr. Grubor, for your monumental contributions.

Yes - the self-appointed censor can't even spell. What a maroon.

Of course it's John's right to censor his own mailing list. He does too.

The EFF can continue to exist as a reminder of how corporate interests
try to misappropriate the appearance of defending free speech while in
fact engaging in plug-pulling and censorship.

Most definitely.

I wouldn't be surprised the least bit. Many unhappy customers of Cygnus
Support have found out that the only requirement for being hired by Cugnus
is to be gay; it doesn't matter whether you know anything about the product
you're supposed to support. Thus, Cygnus rips off not only the software
writers (who put their software on the Internet for everyone to use, not
for John Gilmore to get rich(er) with), but also their gullible customers.
