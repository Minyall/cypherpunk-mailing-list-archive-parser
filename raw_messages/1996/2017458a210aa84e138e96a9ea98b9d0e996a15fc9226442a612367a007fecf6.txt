	Faking crypto chips for public algorithims is theoretically
more difficult, because its simple to create a DES_verify routine to make
sure your DES chip is working right.  Its more difficult to
near-impossible if the chip picks the key, as it must to avoid easy
rouge implementations.

	If the rouge implementation can choose a key, then it can
pre-calculate the appropriate checksum, and then simply tell the other
unit "We're going to use this key."  Thus, keys need to be chosen by
the chip, making it tough to see if the chip is functioning properly.
I suspect the NSA knew this.

	For more on rouges, see Matt Blaze's paper, on
ftp.research.att.com/dist/mab/keyescrow or somesuch.
