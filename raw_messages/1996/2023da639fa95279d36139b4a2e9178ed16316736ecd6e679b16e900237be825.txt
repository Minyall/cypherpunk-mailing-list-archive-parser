Correlation != causation. What are the figures on other crimes? I
presume they would have to have gone up, since the criminal element has
been deprived of it's "revenue" in this manner. Perhaps they simply
didn't have time for killing, raping and assulting; being too busy
lugging around their legally concealed handguns and pointing them at
shop-keepers.

 may be the most  oppressive.  It may be better to live under  robber barons  
 than  under  omnipotent  moral busybodies,  The robber baron's  cruelty may  
 sometimes sleep,  his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who  
 torment us for own good  will torment us  without end,  for they do so with 
 the approval of their own conscience."    -   C.S. Lewis, _God in the Dock_
