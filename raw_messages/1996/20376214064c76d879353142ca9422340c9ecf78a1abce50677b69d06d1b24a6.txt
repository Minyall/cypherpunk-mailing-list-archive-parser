Er, they have that. It's just that most people don't give a shit for their
kind of nonsense, so they don't listen, so the kooks turn to bombings as PR
stunts. Nobody would have read the UnaSpew if Uncle Ted hadn't bombed a few
people. Nobody is going to listen to Jim Bell until you claim credit for
killing some people.
