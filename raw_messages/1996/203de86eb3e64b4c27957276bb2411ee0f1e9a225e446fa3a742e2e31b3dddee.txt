OK, I _usually_ delete these "Attachment converted" messages, which
(fortunately) deletes the attachment in my "Attachments" folder, but for
some reason this time I fired up my word processor and opened the
attachment.

All I found was this crap:

"Hey, im ready to seriously f*ck-up MCI for no apparent
reason, and im also giving credit card (and calling
card) #'s away for no apparent reason, just reply to
skitzo@juno.com."

I urge people to NOT use attachments when ordinary plain text will
obviously work. There's a time and a place for richly formatted messages, a
la MIME, but not on a mailing list with heterogeneous platforms, mailers,
and varying graphics capabilities. Think of our mailing list as being like
Usenet, where graphics messages and oddball formats are frowned upon
(except in the binaries groups, and a few of the non-English language
groups).

And especially not clueless nonsense like this call for "fucking up MCI."
