Then I propose the following compression algorithm to compress your
"random" one-time pad of 2 million bits with value k.  The algorithm
will decompress the input bit "1" to k, and decompress the input bit
"0" to the bit-string "10101010".  Therefore your "random" pad is
compressible to exactly one bit, and is not "random" as you supposed.

"Smaller representation" indeed.  The decompression *algorithm* must be
accounted for in the "representation" of the compressed text, otherwise
an arbitrary amount of information may be stored in the algorithm
itself.

Hamming codes offer a way to compress any bit stream.  They move
whatever patterns they can find in independent 8-bit segments into the
coding alphabet, and replace them with shorter strings.  If you don't
save the alphabet, you can't decompress the stream, and have lost
information that was originally in the stream.

If an OTP generator accidentally chooses "Hamlet", big deal.  As long
as your opponent believes that you have a good OTP generator he has no
reason to try "Hamlet" before any other pad, so Hamlet's
compressibility as english text is irrelevant.
