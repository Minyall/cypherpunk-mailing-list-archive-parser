I have a suggestion for "Aga" and others who believe this sort of
nonsense.  Please do us all a favor and try to sue John.  I'm sure 
that among all jack-leg and wannabe lawyers on this list that they
can come up with a viable cause of action.  And John has deep 
pockets; you could (literally) make out like bandits AND rescue 
"freedom of speech" on privately maintained mailing lists.  You 
could be heroes (or look ten times as foolish as you already do).
