Forgive me if this is a stupid question, but could this lead to
"engineering" the market at particularly times of the year to decrease the
"official" value of an entity's value and complicating the pricing of
equities? Would this become a viable means for those with less wealth to
capitalize on the momentary "dip" in prices?
