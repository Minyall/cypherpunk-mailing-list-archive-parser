Josh Quitter recounts the sorry tale of a small-town city councilman whose 
phone number got attached to one of those phone-sex ads in alt.binaries.*. 
See

/web.html> for full details.

So, what does the councilman do? From the article:
>On Feb. 6, at Suponcic's urging, the Willowick city council passed a 
resolution asking the state
>and federal governments to close the "loopholes" that allowed anonymous 
remailers to operate
>outside the authority of U.S. law-enforcement officials. "Once you've 
achieved one of these
>anonymous identities, you're dangerous, and there's no way law enforcement 
can track it,"
>Suponcic says. "The animal's out of control." 

Just like with "communications decency", watch out at the local level.
