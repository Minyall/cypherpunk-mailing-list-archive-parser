My lawyer says that at common law you can use any name to open an account as
long as there is no intent to defraud.  Since I am giving the bank money and
not vice-versa, it can't be common law fraud.  I'm lending to them.  They
aren't lending to me.  It *is* illegal in the US for the bank to open an
account for me without some ID checks, but it is not *my* problem and it is
not fraud.
