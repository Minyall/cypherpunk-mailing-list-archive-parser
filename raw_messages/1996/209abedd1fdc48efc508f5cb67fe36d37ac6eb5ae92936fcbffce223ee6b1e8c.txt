Suppose that a computer consultant Mr. X knows cryptography so well 
that his clients are willing to pay him $100/hr. Mr. X could conspire
with his client that he receives only $40/hr in taxable income, and the
rest he gets in form of digital cash.

If X lives sufficiently modestly, the IRS will be having hard times
getting him convicted. And really, what's the point in spending all this
money anyway? The more money one spends after a certain level, the more 
time one wastes.
