Which it does...  FWIW, I tend to agree with your general point, but I
moved from downtown Manhattan to Harlem recently, and was surprised to see
how many foodstuffs cost _more_ up here, as well as the obvious fact that
many are harder to get...  Junk food and cheap liquor are everywhere,
though...

Which doesn't say that a centralized food distribution system would be a 
win, but don't bet on privatization being a win either.  Many of the local
stores won't even hire in the neighborhood...

Of course, with big supermarket chains finally breaking into this island,
that is becoming less of an issue, so maybe things will balance.  Looking 
around me, I'm not inclined to bet on it, tho.
