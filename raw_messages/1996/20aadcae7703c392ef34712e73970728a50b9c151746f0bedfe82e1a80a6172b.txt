An import restriction would be even less effective than the current export 
restrictions.  With an import restriction, a person need merely receive a 
given piece of software in the mail from an "unknown" benefactor, software 
that (surprise!) would have been illegal to import.  (the software doesn't 
even have to be mailed from outside the US, merely trucked in by a wetback 
and anonymously mailed by tossing it into the ubiquitous USnail PO Box.)   
Redistribution of this software would have to be legal, if for no other 
reason than nobody could prove it was imported illegally.  Nobody outside 
the US would have any standing to sue for copyright violation, because they 
couldn't import it and sell it without restrictions.
