Yes - I mistyped "thread". My apologies.

Once again: I already replied to this _thread_, and then I received a
_threat_ of a libel lawsuit in connection with this _threat_. Sorry
for the typoes and the resulting confusion.

At any rate, if people are really willing to pay this sort of money
to hear me speak, perhaps I should make a videotape of me giving a
presentation about my Usenet cancelbot and send it to Sandy?

Thanks to Bryce for the correction.
