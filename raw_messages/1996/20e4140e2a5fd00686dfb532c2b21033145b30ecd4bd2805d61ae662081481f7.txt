As a Certified Information Systems Security Professional I am sworn to
uphold a professional code of ethics. I have pledged to help my clients
protect the privacy of their information. I do not consider the free
exchange of ideas as inconsistent with that plegde or those ethics.

Please feel free to email me directly with a statement of your specific
fears and concerns and I am sure I can allay them. Otherwise I suggest you
spend some time studying the US constitution and contemplating the personal
sacrifices made those who are dedicated to defending it.

Respectfully...Stephen
