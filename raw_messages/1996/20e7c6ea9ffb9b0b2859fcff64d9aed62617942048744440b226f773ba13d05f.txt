My SS card, issued in 1969 (and which I still have, surprisingly enough),
says this. Someone said recently here on the list that this line was
dropped in more recent years.

I've never once, in 29 years, been asked to show my little ragged card, and
I only have it because I kept it stored with my passport. (No employer ever
asked to see it; I haven't been employed for more than 10 years, so I can't
say anything about recent policies in the wake of the "immigration crisis.")

The current hysteria about "identification" probably does nothing to stop
real terrorists...if there's one thing they can easily afford, it's
realistic-looking ID cards, in any flavor and in any number.

What I think this means is a move toward a national ID card, replacing the
confusing (to airlines, to government agents, etc.) mishmash of state
driver's licenses, student ID cards, etc. After all, if someone doesn't
drive, and has no passport, just what _is_ there "government issued"
picture ID supposed to be, if not a national ID card? Or, as we like to
say, an "internal passport."

Or as the Christian Right likes to say, "the mark of the Beast." Big
Brother's SS number: 666-42-0000.
