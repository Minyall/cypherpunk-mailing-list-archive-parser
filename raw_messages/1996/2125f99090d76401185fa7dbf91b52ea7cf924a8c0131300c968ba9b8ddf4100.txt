A nice theory, but he uses the misspelling in the thread title
("unsubscrive") and in his body message of "unsubscrive cypherpunks." If he
mistyped, it happened twice in the same way.

(And I try to always check my spelling carefully when I am sending commands
to a majordomo-type automatic processor!)
