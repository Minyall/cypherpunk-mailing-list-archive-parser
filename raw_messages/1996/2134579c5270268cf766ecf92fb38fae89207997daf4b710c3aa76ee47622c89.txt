I'm suprised no one has pointed out that this could mean all
confidential communication with the government, such as paying your
taxes, will require a $95 Fortezza card.

Of course, you could then use that card to encrypt your credit card
numbers and email, as well.

Label this Clipper IV.

| Federal agencies' efforts to link up with the citizenry over 
| the World Wide Web take a step forward today. Officials plan 
| to announce a pilot program in which 1,000 to 2,000 people 
| will try their hands at secure Web transactions with federal 
| agencies. It's set to start later this month. 
|  
| The vision for the "Paperless Transactions for the Public 
| Project": a taxpayer files a return to the Internal Revenue 
| Service over Web links that use advanced cryptography to 
| confirm to the agency that the return's really coming from the 
| right party. Or, a retiree goes into a Social Security 
| Administration computer to check benefit information. 
|  
| VIPs, civil servants and ordinary folks are to be issued 
| special "key cards" to take part in the test, which will use 
| cryptography from Frontier Technologies Corp., a Wisconsin 
| networking company. Officials promise the vision is not that 
| far away.
