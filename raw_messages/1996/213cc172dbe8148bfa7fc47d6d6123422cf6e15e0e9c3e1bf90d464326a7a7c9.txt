	This is true, the codes were designed to minimize telegraph
charges.  However, many of them also contained systems (of varying
quality) for protecting the privacy of communications.

	For example, one might buy a book without page numbers, and be
encouraged to arbitrarily number the pages.  A code entry would then be page
indicator and position on the page.  Not diplomatic quality, but
considering the poor state of commercial cryptanalysis at the time,
fairly effective at protecting business secrets.

	My copy of Kahn is on loan, so I might be misremembering
things.

	Speaking of old crypto, I haven't heard anything on where to
find a Jefferson wheel cipher.  Does no one know?
