a. huh?
b. I was assuming something similar to the Sun /dev/des, which is
basically invoked as 
int cbc_crypt(key, data, datalen, mode, ivec)
              ^^^

If your chip is doing key generation for you, then testing is tougher.

| a) chips do not need makeup
| b) t'were me, I would just fix the chip so that instead of 2^56 (DES) keys
