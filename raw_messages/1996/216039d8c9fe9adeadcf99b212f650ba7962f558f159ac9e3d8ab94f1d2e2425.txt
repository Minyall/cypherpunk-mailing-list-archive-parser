Schneier mentioned last year in one of his conference reports that SHA
was being revised, yet I couldn't find it in Applied Crypto 2 (I admit
that I don't yet own the new one, and I haven't taken a good enough look 
while browsing it in the bookstores), anyone have any pointers to the new 
spec?

Please correct me if I am wrong.
TIA
