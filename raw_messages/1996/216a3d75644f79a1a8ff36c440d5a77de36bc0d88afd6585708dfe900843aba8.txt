Just as there are differences in physical attributes between races,
so to are there are differences in the brain between races, and even
for genetic enclaves within races (and sexes which genetically,
contain greater differences than between races).  However, it has
been my experience that individual differences exceed racial
differences making the whole race vs. anything discussion a waste of time.
i.e people should be judged as individuals not as members of one
race or another, because that is where the most useful discrimination
lays.

The only time as-a-race attributes matter is when you are setting
public policy for an-entire-race, which in my opinion should never
be done. Set the rudder of your public policy by the correlation
between the statistical attributes that you are trying to address,
rather than what may or may not be a real correlation between those
attributes and race.
