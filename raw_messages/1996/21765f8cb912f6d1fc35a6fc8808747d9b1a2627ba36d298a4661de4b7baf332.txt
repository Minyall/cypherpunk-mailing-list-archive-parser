People have argued for genetic disposition to certain things, and I 
think they are sometimes (most times?) confused between genetics per se 
(genes et al) and the way environment creates much of the being 
indirectly.  For example, you are born with a chemical factory inside of 
you.  The amount and timing of hormonal secretions from myriad sources 
inside the body has a dramatic effect on the development of the being, 
and environment has a dramatic effect on the amount and timing of said 
hormonal secretions.  You can bias the formula all you want, but it can 
go in unpredictable directions, due to the great variety of influences.
