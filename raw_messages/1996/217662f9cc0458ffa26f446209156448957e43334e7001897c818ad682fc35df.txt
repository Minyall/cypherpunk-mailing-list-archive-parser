Agreed.

Not quite.  The API comes with a program SIGN.EXE that will create a
"debugging signature" for your CSP, and a new ADVAPI32.DLL, described as
a "Modified advapi32.dll to load providers that are signed with
sign.exe."  So the patch point is a bit more accessable than inside the
kernel.  Maybe the "Modified advapi32.dll" should find its way offshore?

Interestingly enough, CSP signatures are held in the registry instead of
the binary, necessitating some install procedure for a given CSP.  Not
to start rumors, but NT 4.0 does use threads to watch some registry
entries that control the version (workstation/server).  Not much of a
stretch to imagine a thread that tracks (reports?) changes to
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
