As part of helping you get a clue about how the net works, I offer you the
following information:

You have been subscribed to a long-standing Internet mailing list.  Mailing
lists are also called a mail exploders because any mail sent to them is
resent to all the subscribers.  You should have gotten instructions on
unsubscribing when you were subscribed.  If you have lost them, Tim May has
kindly given you and others in your situation some useful hints:

>(Hint: majordomo@toad.com, with message body of "unsubscribe cypherpunks"
>(no quotes))

Note that this is not a mail bomb attack.  Each message is different and
there are only about 100 of them of a normal day.
