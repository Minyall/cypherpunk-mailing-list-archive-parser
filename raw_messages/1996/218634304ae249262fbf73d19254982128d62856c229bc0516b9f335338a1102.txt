Brief article on last summer's Minnesota outage is available
at http://www.info-nation.com/burnin.html . There's a link
in there (I think it still works) to a local IRC log of
U of M people trading info during the blackout.

A few months back, some winos took most of Minnesota off the net
for a couple days. Upset with being kicked out from under a bridge,
they started a fire that took out the main fiber cable from 
downtown to MRNet + the U of M. Backup? Due to a mistake at a CO,
the backup link was routed thru the same area, and was also burned.
Interesting scrambling as nameservers puked and died.
