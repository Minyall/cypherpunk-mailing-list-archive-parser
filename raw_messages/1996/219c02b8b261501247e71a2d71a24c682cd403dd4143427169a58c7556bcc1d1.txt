I'd say that you're right, and I'd also guess myself that ADC stands for
Analog-to-Digital Converter, so that an "ADC LOB system" is a hardware
random number generator that looks at the lowest order (and therefore
presumed noisy) bit of an analog-to-digital converter.

ObCrypto:  Would four years experience interpreting cryptic vanity
plates while commuting on the Nimitz Freeway be a good qualification for
an NSA cryptanalyst?  Would that experience also qualify me as a traffic
analyst?
