I don't know from discussion here whether anyone wants to take this in 
front of one of those C-Span Congress hearings or not; it's not that 
hard to do if you weasel your way in with the right folks....

Timing is important, and the element of surprise.  From what I hear, 
Sen. Specter was hoping to gild his bid for the pres. race with his 
hearings on militias et al, then he got sideswiped by some smarter 
people who had documents in hand.

If "the box" is ready at the right time, and you can catch the politicos 
at a moment when they're increasing their ambition, it could make a 
heckuva bang.

The fundamental laws of logic (via Joey the Hit Man):
Never steal from the boss,
never, ever rat on the boss,
and above all, don't get too ambitious.
