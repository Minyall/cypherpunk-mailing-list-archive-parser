Specialized DES-cracker chips have of course been considered. Diffie and
Hellman's nearly 20-year-old paper on cracking DES considered this.
Wiener's calculation of a few years ago did more that this: he also
architected a basic system. And the "how many bits is enough?" (sorry I
don't have the official name on the tip of my tongue) panel considered such
designs last year.

But actually building a DES cracker entails a level of commitment very
difficult to achieve in an informal, volunteer effort. Not exactly
something that 10 or 20 people can work on usefully.

The advantage of the cracks done last year, the French and Australian
cracks, and the MIT cracks, were that the "entry costs" for joining the
project were low.
