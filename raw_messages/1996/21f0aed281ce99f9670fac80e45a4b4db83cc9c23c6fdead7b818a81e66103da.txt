No deal, then. I suggest that for your next meeting you book Timmy May to
perform live sex acts on stage with his two cats, as Ray and Zach do the
Macarena circle-jerk.

Zach, I don't think you've been on this list long enough to realize that
Timmy started flaming me for no apparent reason, and lying about me, and
attributing to me various shit I never said. I'm just pointing out that
he's a liar and a generally despicable net.scum.
