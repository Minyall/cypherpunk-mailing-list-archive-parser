People do make decisions that affect other people. If you feel safer in the good
hands of Allstate than at the government trough, good for you.

Some things are seen as investments in the future of a society. I view both
Education and Health through this lens.

There it is again. Blame the sick for their lack of moral fibre.

Not every victim of lung cancer smokes. Besides, people are notoriously poor at
evaluating the probability of unlikely events (see reference below). A
"punishment" that happens 30 years after the "crime" is no deterrent. Prevention
is usually cheaper than treatment.
