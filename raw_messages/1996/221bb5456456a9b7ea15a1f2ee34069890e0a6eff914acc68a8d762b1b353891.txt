Criminal defense attorneys are welcome to use the new message board located
at the web site maintained by the Association of  Federal Defense Attorneys
(AFDA), located at

http://www.afda.org

The message board was installed on Friday, July 19, and it's there to serve
the interests of the defense community.  The board should be used strictly
for professional purposes, to exchange ideas on the law, ask colleagues for
input on strategies, share views or inquire about government agents and
witnesses, and so forth.  No personal or social conversation, please.

You are also welcome to join AFDA online by clicking the "Join AFDA" bar on
the home page of the web site.
