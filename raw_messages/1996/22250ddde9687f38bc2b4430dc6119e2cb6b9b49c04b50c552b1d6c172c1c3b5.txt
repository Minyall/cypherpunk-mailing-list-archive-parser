While it was a slick one-liner, it was also wrong. The truth can indeed harm 
innocents.  For example, "The truth is that Anne Frank lived in an Amsterdam 
attic."  is an excellent example of a truth that can, indeed, be used to 
harm people should it become known.  The reason we use encryption is to 
disguise truths that we don't want others to know, and if those truths 
become known there may indeed be harm to innocents..
