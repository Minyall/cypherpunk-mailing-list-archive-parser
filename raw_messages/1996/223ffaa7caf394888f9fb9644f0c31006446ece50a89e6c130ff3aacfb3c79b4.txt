Hrm... that should foster communication. So lemme see if I understand your
point... everyone in the U.S needs to devise their own cryptosystem,
and then use it to communicate securely. To who? Since I can't publish
my system for fear the government will find it out and then restrict it,
noone else will know about it. I can have a good old time encrypting stuff
to myself, but that's about it. And the likelihood that I'm an expert
cryptographer in order to design a good system is pretty remote.

   Ken Thompson has an automobile which he helped design.  Unlike most
   automobiles, it has neither speedometer, nor gas gage, nor any of the
   numerous idiot lights which plague the modern driver.  Rather, if the
   driver makes any mistake, a giant "?" lights up in the center of the
   dashboard.  "The experienced driver", he says, "will usually know
   what's wrong."
