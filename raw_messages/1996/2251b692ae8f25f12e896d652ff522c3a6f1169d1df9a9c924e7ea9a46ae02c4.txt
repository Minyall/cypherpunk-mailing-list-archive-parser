First off, I applaud Netscape for making the US version available for
download.  All of my comments here should be taken as questioning the
why's, not suggesting that the implementation is so onerous Netscape
shouldn't have done it.  Although, you might want to add a link to a
page decrying the kafka-esque experience; perhaps Matt's 'My life as
an arms smuggler?'

My question is, under what lawful authority would you release the
data?  The ITARs don't seem to contain anything special, so would you
hand out lists on a subpeona?  Individual names on a subpeona?  Lists
on a warrant?

Incidentally, they seem to be doing a credit check sort of
verification; I gave a decade old address, and it worked fine.  I feel
free to do this because I'm legally entitled to download strong crypto
software, and see no need to hand out my unlisted phone number in
doing so.
