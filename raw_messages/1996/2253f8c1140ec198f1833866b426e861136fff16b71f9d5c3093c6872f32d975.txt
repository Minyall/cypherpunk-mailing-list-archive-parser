The above was stripped from a reply made by Dr Dimitri Vulis.

I have just one question, was the copy that you purchased hardcopy or paperback?
I found the paperback in a school library and found that it said that the
technical portion had been abridged to save space, (and money).
I cannot say that I read the whole text, only the first half chapter and
then some skipping around trying to find the RSA algorthim.  I later found
it in a periodical to which I am subscribed.
