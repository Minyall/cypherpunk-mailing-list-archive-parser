Some mass advertizers are pretty bright and have good brains working for
them. Others will be destroyed by the market forces.

Most mass e-mailers are in touch with one another via DEMMA, who's been
promoting the idea of "do not e-mail" list. If such a list and the scrubbing
software are made available for free on an FTP server, they'll know about it.

If they can get away with e-mailing their stuff to hundreds of thousands of
addresses and not having theur plugs pulled by merely scrubbing their lists
from people who object, they'll salivate over this prospect and kick the asses
of whoever jeopardizes their business by mailing to "unscrubbed" lists.

I rather doubt it. Business people tend to be much smarter than the geeks
you see at academic computing centers and ISP's.
