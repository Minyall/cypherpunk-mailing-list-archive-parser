Rather than resorting to such extreme measures as attacking the interior 
of the existing barrel with a file or nitric acid, simply replace the 
barrel with a new one (normally not prohibitively expensive), then put a 
few hundred rounds through the new barrel at the range so that it appears
used when/if examined.

Naturally this does not address the possibility of unique marks made on 
the primer by the firing pin, on the cartridge by the ejector, etc.

"In the end, more than they wanted freedom, they wanted
security.  When the Athenians finally wanted not to give to
society but for society to give to them, when the freedom
they wished for was freedom from responsibility, then Athens
ceased to be free."  - Edward Gibbon
