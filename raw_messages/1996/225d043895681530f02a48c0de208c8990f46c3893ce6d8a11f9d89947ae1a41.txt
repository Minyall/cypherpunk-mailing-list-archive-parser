The Leahy crypto bill introduced early this year made (paraphrasing) "the 
use of encryption to thwart a law-enforcement investigation illegal."  I 
immediately pointed out that while this wouldn't make _encrypted_ remailers 
illegal, per se,  effectively it would because the moment an investigation 
(even a phony or trumped-up one) is started and is "thwarted" by the 
encryption used, the remailer operator became guilty of a crime.  

True, the USG isn't quite a "global entity" (even though it has a nasty 
habit of behaving like it!), but along with Europe (which would presumably 
treaty with USG any such restrictions) it's the next closest thing.
