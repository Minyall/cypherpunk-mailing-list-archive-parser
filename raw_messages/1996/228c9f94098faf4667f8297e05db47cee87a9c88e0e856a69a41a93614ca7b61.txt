I already got some shit from DS.  I saw right away that he's an asshole,
so I won't be responding to anything {he|she|it} says.  What a maroon.

I think Lance Deitweller is much smarter and more coherent. I exchanged
some e-mails with and and he sounds like a very reasonable and nice guy.

Thanks for the warning,
