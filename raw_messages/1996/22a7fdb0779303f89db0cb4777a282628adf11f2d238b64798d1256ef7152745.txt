	It has been brought to my attention that the name "middleman" is
too long for the DOS-based remailer programs. In lieu of this I'm changing
the listed name middleman@jpunix.com to middle@jpunix.com. The change will
be effective for both the type-I and type-II remailers. I will also make
this change to the type2.list/pubring.mix files shortly. The remailers
will continue to also answer to middleman@jpunix.com.
