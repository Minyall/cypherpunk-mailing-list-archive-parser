Actually, the database isn't encrypted -- its plaintext -- and the
wizard isn't surreptitious and tells you everything its doing and lets
you stop it if you like. In short, the topic has no cryptography
or security relevance *AT ALL*.

The posts on Microsoft's bad encryption for Windows passwords are
perfectly relevant, and I hope people don't confuse these issues.
