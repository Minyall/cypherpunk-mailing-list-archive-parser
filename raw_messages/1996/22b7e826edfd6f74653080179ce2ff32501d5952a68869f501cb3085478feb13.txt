I think an insight your analysis may benefit by is that certain
institutions/societal norms create incetives for "corrupt politicians".
Hayek argues against the "benevolent dictator" concept because he says no
gentle person would ever aspire to be a dictator.  The system itself calls
for people who are ruthless to take the reins.  A similar argument can be
made for the various functions of a modenr democracy (like the US).  It is
rarely that we hear of a considerate IRS auditor, or a principled
politician.  The structures themselves call for and promote those who (in
that an individual is more successful if they) are corrupt, power-hungry,
unprincipled and ruthless.

As for Assasination Politics, I can understand such proposals in jest.  I
too say things to appear controversial.  As a serious political structure,
however, it is reprehensible.  Murder cannot be condoned (as a pacifist,
the argument that politicians create wars and must be killed for that
reason does not hold much water for me) and the proponents of such systems
would do well to look more closely at the systemic ills rather than
individuals.  The argument that AP is an institutional dis-incentive for
"bad" representatives that offsets other incentives is problematic since I
do not believe the methods are just.

	Oh, dear, where can the matter be
	When it's converted to energy?
	There is a slight loss of parity.
	Johnny's so long at the fair.
