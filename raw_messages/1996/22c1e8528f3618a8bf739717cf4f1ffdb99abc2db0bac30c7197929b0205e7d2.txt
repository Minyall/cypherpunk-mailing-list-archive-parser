Just FYI:

Time has a different twist on the entire story than the 'trusted
compatriot hands over rigged phone' story that has been the basis
for comment around here. Their take on it was that Israeli intelligence
was gradually triangulating the frequency of his phone over time, and
was eventually able to setup some interference on his frequency such
that he thought the phone was going bad (dropped calls and such I suppose).
 So, he sent the phone back to the factory. The Intelligence service, with
the cooperation of the factory, intercepted the phone, placed the bomb,
and then sent it back. Sometime later, they (somehow) get him on the phone,
confirm it is him, and send the detonate code/tone/beep. Instant
lobotomy.
