The traffic analysis on this fixed mapping system needs no access to
packets and is childishly simple.

Let's call the first site "Alice" and the emanation site "Bob."

That is, all messages sent to the persistent site Alice appear to come from
the site Bob.

The Church of Clams can simply send messages addressed to themselves
through the Alice remailer and see immediately that they appear to come
from Bob.

Q.E.D.

Boycott "Big Brother Inside" software!
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, we know that that ain't allowed.
