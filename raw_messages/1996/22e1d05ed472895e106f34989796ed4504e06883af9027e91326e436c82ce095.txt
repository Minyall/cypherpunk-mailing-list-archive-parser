The Colorado state legislature has nothing to do with federal wiretapping 
laws and with federal laws relating to encryption.

Rather than the "government is inconsistent and bad" spin, why not 
"Colorado legislators and the Colorado governor agree that privacy is 
paramount in electronic communications.  In opposing a request for 
blanket access to their private electronic mail, they necessarily oppose 
federal attempts to have access to all electronic mail, once again 
showing that Washington is out of touch with the rest of the country.  

Parts of the federal government are catching on, however.  The U.S. Commerce 
Department recently agreed that federal attempts to 
eavesdrop on electronic transmissions counterproductive in that they are 
causing problems for U.S. companies which create computer programs 
designed to allow secure use of the Internet to engage in private 
discussions and secure commerce.  Estimates the dollar value of exports 
lost range up to $xxx, and continued chilling of U.S. programmers will 
give foreign programmers the chance to catch up in a field where U.S. 
expertise presently leads the world. ...."

Needs to be re-written and juiced up, but you get the idea.

Have at it, Sameer.
