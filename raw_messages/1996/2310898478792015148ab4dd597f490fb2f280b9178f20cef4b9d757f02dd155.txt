The NSA is a branch of the DOD.

Up until recently (18-30 months ago) NSA employees were only allowed
to identify themselves as employees of DoD.  It was common knowledge,
that unspecific references to Fort Meade meant NSA; and if you saw
a P.O. from Procurement Office, Fort Meade, it meant the NSA was buying
it.
