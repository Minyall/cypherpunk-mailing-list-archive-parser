A couple of minor corrections.  Diffie-Hellman doesn't expire until
Sept. 6, 1997.  Cylink can sue anyone at any time, for infringement
up to 6 years in the past.  It is not likely to do so while its case
against RSADSI is pending, because most of the infringers are RSADSI
customers who have been indemnified by RSADSI.  ElGamal won't be free
of patent claims until Hellman-Merkle expires, a month after Diffie-
Hellman.

ElGamal/DSA is an attractive alternative to RSA, and ought to be more
widely used.

There are some hearings scheduled, but nothing of great significance
has been decided so far.
