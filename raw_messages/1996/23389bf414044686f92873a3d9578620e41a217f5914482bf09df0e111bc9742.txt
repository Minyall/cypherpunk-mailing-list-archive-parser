I've been off the list for quite awhile, so if this has been beat to 
death already, I apologize.

Is there any kind of consensus of opinion on the linux-ipsec project?  
What do people outside of the project think about it?

It seems like a very good thing to me, but I don't know much about s/wan, 
so my opinion isn't worth much.

I'm a little curious as to how this project fits in with other secure IP 
efforts.  Will the linux-ipsec software interoperate with other 
packages?  How does it relate to IPv6?  Policymaker?

Basically, I'm not very clear about the significance of this project.  Is 
it going to be a good package that I could use to encrypt traffic 
between offices in NY and LA, or is it going to be a package that will 
let me communicate securely with the net at large, using a well accepted 
standard?

Finally, what do you all think about the basic way this is set up?  I 
mean, does it make sense to use a linux box with two net cards to protect 
a lan?  Or should secip software be built into individual devices, like 
it is in IPv6?  Is this a standard that might get picked up by someone 
like cisco?  Etc.

Thanks...
