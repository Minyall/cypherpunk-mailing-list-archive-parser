I don't know if anyone else has seen this, but I was mailing letters
in the "out front" boxes the other day when I noticed a sign.  The sign
said that all packages 16 ounces or over had to be taken inside for
disposal into the mail slot. The obvious explanation being that even
though you can abstain from marking a return address, the postal
inspectors would like a nice photo of you with your mail.
