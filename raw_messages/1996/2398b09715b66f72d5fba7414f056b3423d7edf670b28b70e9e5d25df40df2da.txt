As businesses and others point out, if there's a need, let private industry
fill the need. Let the users decide on who, if anyone, holds the spare
keys. The USG proposal takes this choice away and allows access to others.

So, because some countries will not allow import into _their_ countries of
non-GAK software, this means GAK must be mandated on U.S. _exports_? Since
when it is our responsibilty to enforce other nation's import laws?
(Because Iran will not allow the import of blasphemous literature, should
the USG ban all export of such material from the U.S.?)

This conveniently ignores the substantial bludgeon the USG holds over the
heads of all high-tech companies. Their "willingness to work with the
Administration" is comparable to the willingness of a kidnap victim to
"work with" his kidnapper.

The real goal is obviously domestic GAK and domestic limits on encryption,
else all this is mostly worthless.
