This is getting silly. I made a comment about brute force search, explained
what I meant, and now some want to pick nits about semantics. My meaning
was clear. Things called "one time pads" have been broken when they were
reused. Breaking them is a matter of brute force search and checking both
decrypt streams for plaintext. If they are used correctly and not reused,
that approach isn't available. End of story.
