I am not pushing the anonymous accounts until my laywer finishes the user 
agreement for them. It is a bit of a tricky document (Sameer, want a copy 
when it is done?). The whole site is days away from a complete redesign, 
so I am not putting much effort into the current interface. Thanks for 
the suggestions though.

The >= 18 condition is to cover my butt. Since minors can not be parties 
to contracts, I have no protection with them as clients. I am only a 
provider for adults, and they take full responsibility for any children 
allowed to use the connection. Fuck the CDA, but keep an eye on its claws.
