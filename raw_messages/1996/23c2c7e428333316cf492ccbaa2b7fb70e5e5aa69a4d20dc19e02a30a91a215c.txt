I doubt if it weakens the Creationists' stand, though.  After all, if
God created life on Earth, she could have created it anywhere else she
wanted, without having to ask permission of the inhabitants of the
"third rock from the sun".  [As you're no doubt aware, this has been,
in part, the premise of several moderately-successful SF novels.]
