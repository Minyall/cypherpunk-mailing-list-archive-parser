There isn't a good answer to this, but it's probably a bad idea
for any US-based school or ISP that permits foreigners to
access its files to provide crypto capability, unless it limits
it to Yankees (e.g. though Unix group permissions.)
It's certainly a bad idea for any _small_ organization,
or organization with a small legal budget, to do so.

No - this one there _is_ a good answer to :-)  US Law doesn't
restrict use of encryption by foreigners located within its borders
(except maybe special circumstances like agents of foreign
governments; I'll pass on answering that) - only on whether
US persons can give them munitions, and of course patents.
The clean approach is for the foreigner to bring a copy of the
US version of PGP into the US, either on magnetic media
or by downloading from ftp.ox.ac.uk or other free-world site.

The foreigner isn't a US person, so he doesn't violate the
law by reading the code himself.  If the Uni or ISP knows
that it's providing encryption software to the foreigner,
it may be liable, but without scienter it's tough to have guilt.
Probably the foreigner should not keep encryption software on
University or ISP machines - floppy disks should do just fine :-)

Encryption material used only for authentication, of course,
is just fine, at least unless the foreigner is from a country
the US State Department considers to be an enemy, like Cuba.
