Actually there is a fundemental difference:  what Tim demands is the
right to be left alone and to be free from exernal influence as long
as what he is doing does not directly hurt another, what "they" demand
is to be taken care of by others because they either cannot or choose not
to take care of themselves.  The latter requires that someone productive
(like Tim) be forced to take care of them through taxation or otherwise
at gunpoint.

In most societies this is considered the difference between a child and
an adult...
