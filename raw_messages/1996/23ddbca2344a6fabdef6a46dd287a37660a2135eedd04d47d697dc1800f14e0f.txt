Packet filters can do this.  This could be thwarted by using a proxy
located on a trusted host.  There are more complicated ways (source routing,
IP spoofing, etc.) but these would require the cooperation of the target host.
Very improbable.

Crypto would probably only be used for authentication.  A simple password
system would work, but wouldn't be as secure, of course.  The ISP could
pass the packets through the appropriate filter rules depending on the user.
I don't know how much overhead would be associated with this technique, but
it seems to be the most secure way to do this.
