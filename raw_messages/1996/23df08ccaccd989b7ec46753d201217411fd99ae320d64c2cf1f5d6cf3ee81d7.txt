A positive excerpt from UK's House of Lords's July 23 lengthy, thoughtful
report on the information society: 
 
 
http://www.hmsoinfo.gov.uk/hmso/document/inforsoc/ch5.htm#5.92 
 
 
 
5.92 The US Government's restrictions on exporting software from the USA
which includes high levels of encryption is threatening to become a major
barrier to the development of the information Superhighways, which is in
no-one's interests. The Government must join with other EU Member States in
putting pressure on the USA to relax its restrictions on the export of
encryption technology.
