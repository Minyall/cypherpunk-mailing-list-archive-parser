This is not strictly true.

The Chinese are widely reputed to have penetrated both Japanese and 
Russian services quite completely.  Their industrial espionage has been far 
reaching (United States, U.K., Germany) and their political disruptive and 
fund raising activites have included fully funding arms dealers in 
California and all over the western United States.

In the mid 80s several "former" Chinese intelligence officers appeared 
in California and opened gun shops.  Their prices on Chinese made weapons 
were so low that compeditors couldn't figure out how it was done.  
Finally someone did some poking around and found that the Chinese 
government was literally giving the weapons to the agents, allowing them 
to keep something like 80% of the profits.  Really quite a clever (and 
typically communist) scheme.

"The capitalist pigs will destroy themselves with our guns and pay us 
for the favor.  Muahahah!"

20/20 and Frontline both did pieces on the operation.

Bottom line:  The Chinese have often extended their intelligence 
operations beyond their borders, even boldly.
