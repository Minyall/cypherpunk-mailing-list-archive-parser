That is not so clear.  The ITAR are regulations, not a law passed by
Congress.  The ITAR regulations relating to the export of cryptography
are probably not authorized by any law (as well as being
unconstitutional).  The reason for all the silly twists and turns
under the ITAR is that the censors never succeeded in getting any law
forbidding the use of cryptography, and it is not at all certain that
they could get such a law passed.

There is very little that can be done under the ITAR to keep
Netscape-Zurich from spreading and it is Congress, not the Office of
Defense Trade Controls or the NSA that passes laws.
