Adam, 
 
 
Thanks for forwarding that delightful report from Ross Anderson on the IEE
TTP romp. 
 
 
His grimly comical description of the hauty evasiveness of governmental
infosec turkeys fits the U.S. sessions on GAK. These power-drunk birds just
aren't used to answering to an aroused, sober, informed public on the
cluckers' no longer secretly enjoyed private stocks of
if-you-gnu-what-we-brew inebriants. 
 
 
Pray British rabble-rousers continue to grieve the red-nosed authorities as
have the colonials theirs. 
 
 
Is there more info on when the OECD report is due?
