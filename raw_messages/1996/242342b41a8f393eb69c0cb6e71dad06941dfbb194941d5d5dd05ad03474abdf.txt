Several have asked me about this by e-mail. The title of the book is
"Fighting Terrorism--How democracies can defeat domestic and international
terrorism."

The first chapter of the book may be read free at:
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/fighting.htm

Netanyahu's recommendations are in the final chapter of the book.
