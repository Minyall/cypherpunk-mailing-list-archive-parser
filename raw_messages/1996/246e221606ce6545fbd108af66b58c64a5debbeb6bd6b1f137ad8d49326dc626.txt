    WOW!   Dimitri as the featured roast, Dean Martin style, would be
    enough for me to seriously consider leaving my high desert Utah
    safe house!  

  "Circus?  Why would I want to go to the circus?. 
      Dimitri is the featured speaker at SF CP Mtg!"

        (apologies to Will Rogers)
