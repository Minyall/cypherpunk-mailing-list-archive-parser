That misses the point. There is no shortage of potential sponsors.
What these people are asking me is "how much business will Web
advertising create for me".

The Tobacco companies are just as keen as others to know how much
value they get from Web advertising as other companies. 

No one sector of the ecconomy is going to be able to sustain the
whole range of Web content. The amounts involved will be of the order 
of billions. A few tens of millions from BAT etc will not go very
far. Pathfinder alone costs $4 million a year to run.
