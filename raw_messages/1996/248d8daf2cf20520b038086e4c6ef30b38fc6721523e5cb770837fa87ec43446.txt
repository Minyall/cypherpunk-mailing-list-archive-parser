     From my conversations with Mr. Tan, he seems to be a high school 
bent of mischeif. He is the one who asked about penetating firewalls, 
and now wants to know how to hack a unix passwd file. 

     Now, I am not philosophically opposed to hacking, unless you are doing
it to a machine that I am responsible for, (in which case you'd better hope
the FBI finds you before I do) but I don't think that it would be a good 
idea to just give him the information. He would wind up getting caught all 
too easily, and might point to this list as a source of information on 
cracking techniques. 

     I don't know if this should go to the whole list, so you can 
bounce it there if you think it proper.
