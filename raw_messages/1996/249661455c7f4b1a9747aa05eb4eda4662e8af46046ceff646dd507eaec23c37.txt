   NYTimes has a piece today on buggy and clogged e-mail and
   mentions MSN as an example, along with overloaded IPs,
   badly designed security wraps and other clunkers. "Right
   now, building market share is the name of the game. Service
   will get worse for a while, reputations for quality will
   start to be formed, at which points firms will compete on
   quality, which will start to improve," says a brain.
