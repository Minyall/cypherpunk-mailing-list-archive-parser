So does anyone have any sort of "official" list as to what constitutes
"government-issued photo-id"?  I'll be flying within California soon
(see you at Crypto...), as as a "furriner", I have no US ID.  I do have
photo-id issued by _another_ government, though (a health card; I wonder
if they'll have heard of that...).
