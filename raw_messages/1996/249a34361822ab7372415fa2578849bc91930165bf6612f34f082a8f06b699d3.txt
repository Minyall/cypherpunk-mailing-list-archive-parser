But that's exactly the point: they can ban whatever they like, because
they refuse to tell you the rules.  You show them the code, and they say
"yes" or "no" without sharing with you their reasoning.  And their
reasoning can change at any time, and can be based on any number of
factors which you might consider unfair.

Logic and fairness have no place in this, because "National Security" is
the root password to the Constitution.
