I don't think it's updated enough things recently (or else it only indexes
the contents of a page and not the header details in the <BODY> statement.)
For instance, BGCOLOR="#000000" had 197 hits, but most of them were old,
and on topics like "How to set the background colors on your web page",
and NO documents matched both BGCOLOR="#000000" and vtw.
