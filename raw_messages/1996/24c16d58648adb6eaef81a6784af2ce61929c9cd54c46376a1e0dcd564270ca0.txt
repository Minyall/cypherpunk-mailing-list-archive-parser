   I think many are assuming that the cypherpunk making the suggestion
   gets a vote.  My reading of the puzzle is that he does not.

I hadn't thought of that.  If the proposer gets no vote, and assuming
he still gets counted to make up 50%, for N > 3, he should suggest
giving some money to the penultimate ceil(N/2) robbers.  In the case
of N <= 3, the last robber gets everything.
