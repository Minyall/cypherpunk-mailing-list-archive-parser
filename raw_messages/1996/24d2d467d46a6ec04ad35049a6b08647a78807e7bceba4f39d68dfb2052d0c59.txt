Belgian TV (the dutch language channel) has a page on teletext (Ceefax)
[I don't think US tv has that feature] stating that the French backbone
is thinking about blocking sites that provide information that they deem
ethicly unacceptable, like sites that promote the denial of Konzentrations
Lagers, the extreme right, pornografic and pedophile sites.
