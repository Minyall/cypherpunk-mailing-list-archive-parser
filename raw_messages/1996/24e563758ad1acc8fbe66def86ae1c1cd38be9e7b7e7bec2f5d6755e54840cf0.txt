Having read the admittedly vague and badly worded statute, I bet you that
an competent court (query whether this includes the first state prosecutor
and trial court that actually are faced with a case) would interpret the
act to apply only to cases where someone infringes on the intellectual
property of another.  If only to avoid constitutional problems. 

Although as a formal matter EFF are right that the bill's language *could* be
read to apply to all anonymous communication, I don't think EFF has done
us a favor by whipping up panic, because it seems to me relatively unlikely 
that it *should* or *would* be read that way.  

Oh well.
