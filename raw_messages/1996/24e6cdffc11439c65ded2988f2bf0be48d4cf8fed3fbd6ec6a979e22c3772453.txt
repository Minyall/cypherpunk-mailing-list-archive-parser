For what it's worth, Motorola can do neither. US companies can't produce
anything prohibited for export unless its in the US, for the US market. And
"crypto with a hole," or hooks for crypto generally, can't be exported,
either, unless for 40-bit stuff only. Thus, Microsoft's proposals to
produce "crypto with a hole" depend on "holes" tailored to the requirements
of specific countries.
