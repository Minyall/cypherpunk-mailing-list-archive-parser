	Hype about Java and a move to a policy based security
mechanism are not incompatible.  Perry's security model will probably
be NO Java, NO Livescript.  Mine might be only Java signed by McAffee
can get more than 3 seconds of CPU time, or access remote network
ports on the server it came from, no other code can run.
