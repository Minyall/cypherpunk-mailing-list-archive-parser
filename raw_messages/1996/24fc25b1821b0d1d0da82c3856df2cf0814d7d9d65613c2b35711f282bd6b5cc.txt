Reverse engineering is the process of taking a piece of executable code,
be it a Win95 program or firmware for a cellular phone eeprom, and
running it through a disassembler.  The disassembler converts the
machine code into assembly instructions.  From there, a person with
a lot of spare time, a good understanding of compiler design, and a lot
of caffeine can translate the assembly instructions into a higher level
language (ie. C, C++, VisualBasic).  The first part is easy (and writing
a disassembler is a good project for upper-level Comp Sci courses), but
the second part is a real bear and people with the knowledge and 
drive to do it have my respect.
