Me too...

Some ideas:

 - ask Phil Z. if he ever devised a PGP logo.
 - a PGP logo design contest (the prize would be eternal glory
      and gratitude from all CPunks)
     In this latter case, the winner might be decided by:
          - a jury (presided by Phil Z. ?)
          - a vote of CPunks

I think it would not do any good if everybody used their own logo.
