I think the big bait-and-switch is her description of the various 
companies falling over themselves to get to _VOLUNTARY_ key escrow to 
avoid losing data and protecting themselves against employee problems 
versus _MANDATORY_GOVERNMENT_ key escrow to ensure that individuals 
cannot hide information from the government.

Key escrow is good.  Key escrow against your will is bad.
