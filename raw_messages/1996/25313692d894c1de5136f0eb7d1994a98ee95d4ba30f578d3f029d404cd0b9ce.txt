A Windows 95 extension for encrypting files is now available from 
SoundCode, Inc.  Just right-mouse click on any file, provide a passphrase, 
and it's done.  Point 'n Crypt visually indicates that a file is encrypted, 
and optionally provides the encryptor's name for easy passphrase lookup. 
 Point 'n Crypt is FREE during the beta period (through 12/31/1996) and 
will list for $19.95.

Point 'n Crypt uses 40-bit DES-CBC (exportable), salted SHA passphrases, 
and conforms to PKCS #5 and PKCS #7.
