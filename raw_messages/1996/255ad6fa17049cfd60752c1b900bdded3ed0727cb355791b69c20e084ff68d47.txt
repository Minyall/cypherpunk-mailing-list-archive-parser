Part of the reason for the question is because faxes can be sent and
received with no commitment to paper.  I sort-of understand the focus
on "books" and other hard copy re: freedom of speech, but it seemed to
me the fax issue could be one point in a congressperson's mind in favor
of the notion that the line between paper and electronic/media has been
forever blurred (or erased).  Just a thought.
