	Can't remember the exact details (and I can't remember where
my copy is :), but basically they used the ACK/NAK times in the kermit
protocol to guess his distance.  After tracing him back to some firm
in Va, they worked out to Germany and then the Bundespost ran a phone
trace to find him.  (So all y'all malicious crackers that have the
TLAs trembling in their jackboots remember to tweak your kermit (or
rz) progs to randomize response times. :)

	I'd reccommend reading the book.  It's pretty interesting.  Or
Nova did an episode ~2 years back (whenever the book came out) that
was a quick 1hr version of the whole story.
