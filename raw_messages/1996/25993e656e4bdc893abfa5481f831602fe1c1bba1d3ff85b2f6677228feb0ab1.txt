Tim May had it exactly right in his post entitled "Silver Linings and
Monkey Wrenches" (thanks Tim).  The only thing I can add is that forcing
them to attack a 40 bit key is better than giving them the whole key thru
some LEAF scheme ala Clipper.

As long as you can cut and paste, PGP (at least the Mac version) is hard to
lock out and minimally usable.
