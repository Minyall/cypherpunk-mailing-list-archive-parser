pretty grim reading in the LA Times article if that is really the EFF 
position on remailers.

could someone straighten this out, or at least give us the EFF's view of 
why remailers are a bad thing? 

with friends like that, who needs enemies?

So long, Julf - Thank you for a valuable public service!
Best of luck to you!
