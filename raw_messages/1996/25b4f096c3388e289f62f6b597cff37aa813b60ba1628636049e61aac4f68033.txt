It is not possible to clear-sign binaries with PGP.  The point of clear-signing
is to have signed text that is readable to people who don't have the software
necessary to process the text.  It would make sense to clearsign a file that
is base64'ed or uuencoded, which wouldn't alter the contents of the file.  I
can't see how such an option would be harmful, except that it might lose some
characters that are important to the context of the message.
