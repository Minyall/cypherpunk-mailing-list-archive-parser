Probably the same reason that most routers let packets claiming to be from the
local net through.  Even those that do filter packets claiming to be from the
local net don't have any real reason to block packets claiming to be from
foreign addresses -- the administrators don't have anything to gain.  It'll
probably take some time before this is considered standard netiquette.
