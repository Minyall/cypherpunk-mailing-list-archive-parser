But IPv6 also brings link-level encryption and makes subliminal
communications channels trivial; Big Brother (now does anyone know
what that that translates to in Chinese?) won't stand for that...

The enhancements of IPv6 make a lot more possiblities for
secure channels and untracable packet-level communications
available.  Instead of needing to jump through many hoops
you just have to subvert one of the new goodies IPv6 gives
you for free :)
