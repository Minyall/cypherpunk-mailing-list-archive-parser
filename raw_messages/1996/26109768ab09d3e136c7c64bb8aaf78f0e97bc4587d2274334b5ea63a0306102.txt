Yeah but if NSA went Cypherpunks, what would be the new PC dogma - the 
current San Fransisco trendlines?   If you aren't a Sensitive Guy who'd  
rather re-read Hillary's speech at the Beijing Women's Conference, than 
watch the jittering cheerleaders on Monday Night Football - there goes 
your promotion!

Not to shatter your illusions boys, but there's a school of thought back
here East of the Rockies that the whole shebang south of Redding should be
written off after the next Big One - no taxpayer dollars spent _at all_. 
Commit American Imperialist Aggression against Mexico - use gunboat
diplomacy to make them take California back.  Only hold onto a few 
selected spots as Possessions. I mean, Vandenberg's on a very convenient 
spot for launching birds to listen in on the Beijing apparatchiks on the 
cellphone, running their mistresses in and out of the secret entrances of 
the Forbidden City faster than the JFK-era Secret Service could have kept up 
with.

Visit the hospitality room at the next annual convention of the Old 
Crows Association, if you want to see proof that the electronic-warfare 
community, like worker-bee military types in general nowadays, comprises 
LOTS of folks with a rather Libertarian outlook.
