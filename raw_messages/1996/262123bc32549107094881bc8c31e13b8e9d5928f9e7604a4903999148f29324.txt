So much for free speech.  Do you think people distributing bomb-making material
should be held responsible for any terrorist incidents.  Quite a few people
on this list who posted bomb-making material would be arrested.  Same with
chemistry book publishers and news magazines that had some pretty detailed
information about pipe bombs.  I fail to see any difference between the
two.

Do you really consider speech to be "dangerous."  The law requiring
investigation of threats against the president is a stupid one.  The maintainer
of the exploding head page was investigated by the USSS after putting up
computer-generated pictures of Bob Dole's head exploding (Presidential
candidates are also covered under this law).  There's too much potential for
abuse.

Then all prosecuters pushing for the death penalty, death penalty advocates,
and anyone who advocates going to war with another country should all be
thrown in jail.  I might as well ask the common question again: "What part of
'Congress shall make no law' don't you understand?"
