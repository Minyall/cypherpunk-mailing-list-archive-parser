It's not that powerful a rebuttal, since it would require files of e-mail
(or their session keys) to be encrypted twice--once with the escrowed
storage key and again with the transmission (recipient's) key. And if the
message were public key, it would require a re-encryption at the receiving
end with the recipient's escrowed storage key to make the recipient's files
available to HIS management. Further, it would require everyone to keep two
keys since I infer from your position you wouldn't want your public key to
be the escrowed one (for transmission security).

As you know I do not support mandatory key escrow in the US, but arguments
against it need to be robust. Your argument, while not without merit, is
weaker than one would like (in that it is susceptible to the mental
rebuttal by policymakers that I've outlined above). In my view it isn't the
kind of decisive argument that would justify your use of "curiously" silent.
