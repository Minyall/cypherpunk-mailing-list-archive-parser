I've got a new draft available of my critique of US cryptography
policy and its impact on the future of the "information economy".
It summarizes comments I made to a recent meeting of the Computer
and Communications Industry Association, and is an updated version
of testimony I gave to the Senate commerce committee earlier this
year.
