Isn't this the same argument used by the state whenever they want to differentiate
between your "rights" and your "privileges"?  Can they reject one of your privileges
whenever they want to, at their discretion?  No.

So if c-punks is really "private", how does it decide (arbitrarily?) who to include
and who to reject?

Note that I'm not saying that it's absolutely wrong to reject anyone, at any time
necessarily, I just don't think your last sentence about a *private* list was well
thought out.
