This just gets ridiculous. It adds a lot of overhead without necessarily 
giving you good information.

On the Net, there is no longer any real difference between underground 
and mainstream data. It's all just as easy to get. You can't block it.

You're thinking like engineers. This isn't an engineering problem; it's a 
social and artistic problem.

Actually, it's two problems: how to censor people, and how to find stuff 
you're interested in.

Censorship only works if it's dictated and enforced. Ratings don't cut it.

Arbitrary scales can't judge stuff you're interested in. Art cannot be 
reduced to numberical criteria. 

A while ago, and maybe it's still going on, the MIT media lab had an 
interesting music rating service. The way it worked was, you submitted 
stuff you liked, lots of other people submitted stuff they liked, and the 
computer generated a list of stuff that you might like based on apparent 
matches among different people's tastes.

The model to emulate is a computer dating service, not a library.
