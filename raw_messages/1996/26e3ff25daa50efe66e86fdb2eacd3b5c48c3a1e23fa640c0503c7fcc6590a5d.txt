In case Alan's post didn't make it clear, _average_ lifespan values are
averages from birth.  Maximum lifespans haven't changed.  However, between
the effects of vaccination and municipal sewage treatment, any infant born
in a developed country has a good chance of living a long time.  A society
with very high birth rates and high infant mortality will have a low
average lifespan even if every child who makes it to the age of ten lives
to be a hundred.
