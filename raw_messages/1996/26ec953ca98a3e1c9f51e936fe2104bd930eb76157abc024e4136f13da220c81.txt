As I have argued many times, that is correct.  OTP, with real random
numbers, and no-reusage, etc, etc, is the only "perfect" cryptosystem, and
even it has its problems (like key exchange, for instance).

Hrmmm... I seem to see a problem (namely Moore's first law) in assigning
anything a "minimal running time".  Perhaps "minimal instruction count"
would be more suited to your example.  Because if you're talking about
time, it essentially boils down to "the longer something takes the less
time it takes".

Never happen.  It just won't.  As a rule, there's _always_ a faster way.

Ok, now I have to pose a question: If cryptographers actually beleive
this, why continue to search for a faster one.

Again I say, there's _always_ a faster way.

Again I say, it just won't happen.  It can't, and I can't prove that for
the same reasons that it can't happen.

Yes, I must commend you on your amazing tact in asking this incredebly
irrevelant question.
