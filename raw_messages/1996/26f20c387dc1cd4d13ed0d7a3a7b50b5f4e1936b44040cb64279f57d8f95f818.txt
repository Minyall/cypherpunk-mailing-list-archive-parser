I urge people to think carefully about issues of morality, ethics, free
will, and the type of society we wish to have. People make choices every
day. To use or not to use drugs is just another choice.

True.  I agree that the war on drugs is useless, and that prohibiting
prostitution is even more mindless.  Still, the libertarian ideal seems even
worse.  Think about Thailand, where sex is bought and sold openly.  The AIDs
infection rate has gone from near zero to 2.5% in a couple of years, and
promises to devastate the whole country. Burmese kids are sold into sex
slavery.   Is this the future?  People make choices every day, but few
people make INFORMED choices, and a lot of people, believe it or not, have
very little choice.  They are caught between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea.
