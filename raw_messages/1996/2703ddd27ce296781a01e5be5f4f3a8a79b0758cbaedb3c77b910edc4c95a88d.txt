If the legal issue was presented for decision below, and forms a part of
the notice of appeal, then it is properly preented to the court of appeal,
regardless of what the court below actually did.  Any other rule would
allow a trial court to prevent issues from being reviewed.  The Supreme
Court has been known, however, to decide issues that went beyond the
strict confines of these limits. Even things that weren't argued by the 
parties....  

If the appellate decision requires more facts in order to apply the 
legal principle decided by the higher court, it has the option of 
remanding the case to the trial court for more fact-finding in light of 
the legal rules explicated by the higher court.
