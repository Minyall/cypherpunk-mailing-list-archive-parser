	Would it make remailers more reliable to use a netescrow
system, so that if a remailer goes offline, the others can request its
keys, and continue moving its messages?

	To me, reliability is as large a problem as UI.  If the next
Mixmaster is going to do direct IP transport, reliability could
increase as a problem.
