No, I fear you are _confusing_ people with this comment.

Yes, there was a 1983 paperbound edition, with a few new items added to the
1982 orginal. Ho hum. (I have both, and have for many years. It was finding
the '92 edition that sparked much of my interest in the NSA, back in 1982.)

What we are waiting for is the _real_ Second Edition, the long-awaited
revising of "The Puzzle Palace." It is expected later this year or next.
