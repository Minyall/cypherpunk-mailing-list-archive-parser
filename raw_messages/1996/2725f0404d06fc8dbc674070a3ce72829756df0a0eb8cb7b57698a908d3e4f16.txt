Gee, genocide everywhere. If you say the word often enough, it loses some of its sting, 
doesn't it?  How does it make you feel to know that you're here because your ancestors 
survived, probably because they were ruthless enough to trample on those less able to 
defend themselves.  Now I'm gonna catch hell for posting more noise, so all together 
now, let's stick our heads back in the sand.  It's not our responsibility, 'cause after 
all, we're just crypto people.

BTW, that Vulis post was a *lot* larger than necessary.
