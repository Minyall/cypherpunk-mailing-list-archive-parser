	As a US entity, Community ConneXion is marketing an
SSL-encrypting webserver based on the Apache-SSL developed by the
Apache Group (worldwide) and Ben Laurie (in the UK).
	As both Ben and I would like to maintain a similar product
both for domestic and international use, such that international
corporations may deploy the application worldwide within their
organization without compatibility problems, Ben has to write all the
code, because I can't send him anything. (I've written code to
incorporate new features, but once Ben writes code to incorporate
those features, I will end up using his code, in order to maintain a
stable codebase. -- duplicating effort.)
	As most OS vendors are located within the United States, it
requires a significant effort for an OS vendor to include the product
worldwide, because they need to contract out an outside US cd-pressing
and product build facility in order to build the international version
of their OS (or other application.. right now I'm concentrating on
getting OS vendors to bunlde the prodcut) which bundles our product.

	It's doable. It's not trivial though.

	ITAR does help, in that if Ben decides to commercialize his
product, we have a very convenient line which stops us from competing
with each other. He can't sell inside the US because of RSA patents. I
can't sell outside the US because of ITAR. ;-)

	Not if some applications don't apply to personal use.
