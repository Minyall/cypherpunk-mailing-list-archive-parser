Sure he does - I've been saying all along that John Gilmore has the right to
act dishonorably, which he exercises. Yet the censorship supporters keep
attributing to me the diametrically opposite view - that the state can force
John to carry even the opinions he disagrees with. This is not what I've been
saying, of course. John Gilmore lied when he attributed this opinion to me (as
quoted by Declan McCulough). Only his honor could force him to do that, but he
has no honor and no credibility. John had the right to exercise censorship on
his private mailing list, which is precisely what he did.

Same here - I used to have respect for John Gilmore, but now I don't.
