Contrary to all the old stories, quicklime (calcium hydroxide) actually 
PRESERVES bodies, it doesn't assist their decomposition. (It probably 
inhibits bacteria growth by raising pH, yet its alkalinity doesn't attack the organic 
material.)   What you want is a few gallons of concentrated sulfuric acid, 
which will hydrolyze the fats, the proteins, dissolve the calcium in the 
bones, as well as erase any traces of DNA left in the mixture.
