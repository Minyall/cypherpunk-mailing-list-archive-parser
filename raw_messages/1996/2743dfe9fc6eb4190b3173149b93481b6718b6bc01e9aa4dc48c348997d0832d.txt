SECURITY DYNAMICS TECHNOLOGIES (SDTI) 60 +4 1/4. Maker of security products
used to protect and manage access to computer-based information is seeing its
stock get a lift from news that company's RSA unit has reached licensing
agreement with Microsoft (MSFT 122 1/4 -1 1/8). In return for technical
cooperation and additional licensing rights for integration of RSA's
technology with Microsoft's cryptoapi, Microsoft will license cryptoapi to
RSA, including rights to incorporate cryptoapi into RSA's toolkit products.
According to company, RSA will receive an ongoing stream of revenue from
MSFT based on the use of patented RSA technology. Also, company will license

tokens and ace/server authentication products in future versions of Windows
