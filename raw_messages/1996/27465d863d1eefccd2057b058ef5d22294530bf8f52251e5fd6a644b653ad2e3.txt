There was an e-mail sent to the list that had attached to it a virus.  Well
lucky me I got.  It was a .com file that apparently turns your files into
directories.  I can't boot into Win95 since it turned my HIMEM.SYS into a
directory.  So, I seem to have fixed that, but now it says "access denied"
and then prompts me with C:\>.  Did anyone else get it?  Has anyone heard
or fixed this virus?

Thanks
