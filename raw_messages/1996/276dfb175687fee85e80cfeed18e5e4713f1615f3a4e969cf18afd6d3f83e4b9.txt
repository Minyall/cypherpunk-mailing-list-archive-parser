A new electronic commerce paper:

  "Internet Markets: Emerging Business Models"

  By Dan Yurman

  December 11, 1996

  Abstract

  What are business models for profiting on the net?

  Perhaps the best metaphor to describe Internet business 
  is that it is like the California gold rush of 1849. A 
  wave of entrepreneurial start-ups have entered the field, 
  but all are struggling to find the gold. The miners are 
  going broke while the saloon and general store owners, 
  and the brothels, are prospering. Anyone who wants to 
  make real money in mass markets is going to have to 
  break the mold of "business as usual" and offer real 
  value which is not available offline. Meanwhile, 
  business-to-business commerce is growing using the 
  time-based value of data exchange as a pricing mechanism.

  This brief paper considers the business models and 
  related success factors which favor profitability for 
  doing business on the Internet. It addresses four areas:

  + Mass Markets
  + Business-to-Business Markets
  + Online Banking
  + Advertising
