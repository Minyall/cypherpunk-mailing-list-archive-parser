(Sorry about quoting so much, but I liked Steve Shear's succinct problem
statement.)

I don't see how authorization certificates solve this problem.  How
would you determine if someone was qualified to receive an authorization
certificate?  And what would you do to make them stop using the service
if they abuse it, and to stop them from getting new authorization
certificates?

Thanks,
Hal
