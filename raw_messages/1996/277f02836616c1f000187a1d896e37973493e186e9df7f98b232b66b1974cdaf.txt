	Point taken. Well, as it is now, it is good enough for my
current needs. And it's a great work you've done.

	What I was referring to instead was actually what I don't
want or expect in a "good" library: simple, extraneous, old, maybe
breakable algorithms, things no longer useful... they make a great
material for studying and learning, and sometimes to demonstrate
some colleagues how simple some approaches are. These materials,
that I wouldn't use in a decent application are still usefull for
me from time to time, and are nice to have at hand.

	Personally, I would prefer some algorithms not to be in
Crypto++ less someone use them confident that if they are there,
they must necessarily be good, although they might be useful for
learning purposes.

	Nevertheless, as soon as I find something I think interesting
to add, I'll let you know, or even contribute it myself.

	And thanks again for this fine piece of code!
