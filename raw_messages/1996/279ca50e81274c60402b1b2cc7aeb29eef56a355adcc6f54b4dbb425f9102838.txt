I used to hack a CDC Cyber box designed by Seymour Cray before he started his
oen company. It had the following curious features:

1 word = 10 _bytes_ = 60 bits
1 _byte_ = 6 bits

Out of respect for Jim, I dug up the dox, which say: "On the 6600, the basic bit
groupings are 6, 12, 15 and 30 bits". The dox consistently refer to the 6-bit
chunks as "characters", never bytes. However I've heard people refer to 6 bits
as bytes and to 3 bits (an octal digit) as nybbles.

Naturally, the character set had only 64 symbols - no lowercase letters.

Both integers and reals were 60 bits.

Addresses in the instructions were 15 bits, but that was an address of a
60-bit word.

Negative numbers were represented with one's compliment (i.e. -X = NOT X).
Hence there were two zeroes: positive and negative.


I believe BESM-6 also had 6-bit bytes. I have the dox for it someplace
(in Russian) but can't find them offhand.

Moral: it's not necessarily redundant to say '8-bit byte'.
