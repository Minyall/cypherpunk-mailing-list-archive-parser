If Firefly is an example of what PICS is or could become, the hell with
PICS.  Firefly encourages and rewards group behavior and suppresses
individuality.  Firefly would reward the discussion of the latest album
by a Columbia or Capitol artist, and discourage discussion of material
from independent (real independent) labels.  I know because I've been
there and spent quite a bit of time trying to get a rating.
