Not really crypto, but related to the DOJ hack in a way.

Moscow Channel is a pretty slick, Russian news/commentary page.  Their Web
site was hacked and altered by someone who didn't seem to like Russians all
that well.  See:

http://www.moscowchannel.com/

While not as elaborate as the DOJ hack, it's interesting that Web page
vandalism is starting to turn into a unique form of protest and social
commentary.

As Web sites with security holes increase, my guess is vandalism will
increase incrementally.  Both in terms of random graffiti, and targeted attacks.

Just a matter of time before some builds a dedicated Satan type tool that
scans for  HTTP server holes or messed up file permissions to make locating
potential victims easy.
