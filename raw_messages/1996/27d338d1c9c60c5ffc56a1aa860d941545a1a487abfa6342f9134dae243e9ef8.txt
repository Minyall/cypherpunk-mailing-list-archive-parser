Many modern processors keep separate L1 caches for code and data.  Sparc
architecture requires a special instruction to say, "I have just used data
operations to change this part of the program."  I assume that program
fetchers and linkers must use this instruction.

Keeping separate main memory makes program loading and in-memory dynamic
linking hard.  The linker's data is the processor's program.
