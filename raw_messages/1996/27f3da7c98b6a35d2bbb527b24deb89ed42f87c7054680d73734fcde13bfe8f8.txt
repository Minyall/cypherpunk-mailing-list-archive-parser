The above comments, and the snipped comments about "a few more Wacos will
wake the people up etc.", assume that the govt. hasn't learned anything
about the politics of mass surveillance over the past few decades.

In fact, they've learned a lot.  The surveillance can be kept completely
quiet, and when they need to take someone out, they can do that very
quietly as well.  And not a whole lot of people will be angry, because
they'll crank up the reputation destructo-machine/P.R. press to preclude
any problems there.

Waco was an aberration, because key people were hiding behind a quantity
of other non-key people, and the FBI blundered in and grandstanded to the
point of creating a Kent State kind of scene.  To suggest that future
Waco's are necessary to take out troublemakers is shortsighted.
