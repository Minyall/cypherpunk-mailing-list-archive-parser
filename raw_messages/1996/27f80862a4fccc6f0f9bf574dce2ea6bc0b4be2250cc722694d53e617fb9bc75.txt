On the below "conspiracy theory" comment:
Aren't "conspiracy theory" and "conspiracy theorist" now used as 
catch-all (and derogatory) terms by mainstream afictionados to identify 
persons and orgs they consider to be enemies of the statist point of 
view? Remember the last election when Mr. Paraniod (Perot) was running, 
and newspeople were using the term "conspiracy buff", then, when 
reminded that the mainstream folks have their own sacred conspiracies 
which they milk much money from, they (the newspeople) switched to 
"conspiracy theorist" instead.

I have to laugh when Bugliosi gets on TV ranting about how "there 
couldn't possibly be a conspiracy in the OJ murders", but how easy one 
forgets, Bugliosi gained his lasting fame from a ridiculous (seemingly) 
theory about "Helter Skelter", etc.
