Hey, I went into the local New York State Police station and asked if
they had email.  The answer is basically "No."  They've got something
like a telex system.  I doubt that they're any encryption on their
data services.  You'd think that police department RADIOS would at
least be encrypted!  Thanks, TLAs, for your crime encouraging efforts.
[ TLA lurkers should have the grace to wince at that. ]
