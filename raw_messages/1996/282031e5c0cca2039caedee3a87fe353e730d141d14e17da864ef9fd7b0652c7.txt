	Much as I absolutely detest NT, lets reitterate what everyone else
on this list has already heard too TOO many times...  If you have physical
access to the machine, it ain't secure.  It doesn't matter what operating
system or what that operating system offers in the way of security.  If
you can boot it off a floppy, you got it by da balls.  Period.  NT is no
better and no worse than any variation of UNIX out there.  I help a friend
break into a SCO C2 secure Unix box that way.  Booted DOS off the floppy,
hunted down the password entry (it ain't in /etc/passwd in this mother),
and changed it to something we knew.  Was owned by a friend whose EX boy
friend had locked her out of her own system!  Took just a few minutes,
including the programing time.

	Let's beat up on NT about the real things, not phantoms...
