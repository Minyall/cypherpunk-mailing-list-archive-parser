Poor me has to run a mailing list where the *majority* of 
subscribers are using MS Mail or Exchange.

For a partial list of MS Mail/Excahnge bugs relevant to list 
administrators, fetch my list info file. Send "info 
win95netbugs" to majordomo@lists.stanford.edu.

Fortunately, there's been no need to killfile msn.com 
recently. Microsoft incompetence took care of that at the 
source. See the January 2nd news article on 
http://www.zdnet.com/~pcweek/
