This message is _clearly_ an effort to spread *pornography* on the net. I know this to be true through the use of a 3-letter code that I have cleverly deleted . If you continue to spread this vile and disgusting trash, I shall have no choice but to complain to my government representatives and have all imports from your country banned, and to pressure companies not to do business in/with your nation.
