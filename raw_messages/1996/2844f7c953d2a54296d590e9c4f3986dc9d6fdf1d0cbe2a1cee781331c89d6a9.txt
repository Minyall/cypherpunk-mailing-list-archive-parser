Yes, very simply.

The remailer could calculate a hash for the body of each encrypted
message received (the same portion which will be decrypted by PGP),
tabulate the last few thousand hashes, and simply discard any messages
with a duplicate hash.  The target of the attack would receive only
the first copy of the message.
