Hi. 

I would like to toy around with a e-cash program.  I got Magic Money but 
it is only sources and I have no compiler.  Is there a location I where
I can get the executables for DOS?

I want to do nothing serious with it, so the security aspect of pre-compiled
code does not bother me too much.

Thanks
