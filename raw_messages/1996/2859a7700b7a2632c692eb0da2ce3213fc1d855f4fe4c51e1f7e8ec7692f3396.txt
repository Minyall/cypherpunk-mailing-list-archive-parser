Unfortunately, one-way remailers have much fewer uses than two-way remailers,
any many of these uses are abusive.

Julf's anon.penet.fi used to add a signature with a disclaimer.

Yes.

A single centralized point of failure is bad. Maybe 4 or 5 redundant ones.
A blocking request sent to one will be replicated in the other automatically.

That's the protocol Eric Thomas's listserver uses to make sure mailing list
subscription requests aren't spoofed. I think I mentioned it recently on
this list in the context of creating a similar blocking list for addresses
that don't want to receive unsolicited commercial e-mail. Indeed, if such
a system is put up, it could maintain several blocking lists:

addresses who don't want any remailer mail
addresses who don't want 1-way remailer mail, but are willing to get
 2-way remailer mail
addresses who don't want unsolicited commercial e-mail (probably a biggie :-)
addresses who will only accept PGP-signed e-mail
etc.

We can't quite ignore... In the scheme you've just described, someone can
enter a blocking request via a Web page and give a submission request for
some mailing list, and the cookie will be e-mailed to the mailing list.

I don't think it's a good idea to suport blocking receivers in an entire
domain, like *@aol.com. Just say it's not supported.

I don't think it's a good idea to support sender blocking at all.

Would the receiver blocking list be available to everyone to view? That
sounds like a violation of privacy. Someone suggested on this list that
(assuming that the entires are addresses that match exactly, not regular
expressions), one can store hashes of addresses. Then when a remailer
wants to know if a particular address is on the list, it computes the
hash and searches for it (binary search is fast).

A curious person can check whether a particular address is no the list,
but can't obtain the list of all blocked receivers.
