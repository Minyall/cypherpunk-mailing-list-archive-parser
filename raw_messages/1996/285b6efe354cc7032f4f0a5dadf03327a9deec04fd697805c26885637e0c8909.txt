Some news from Turkey. Up to now all connections to Internet were 
established and managed by TR-NET the collaboration of a university 
(METU) and the the national scientific research center (Tubitak). 
Recently the phone company opened a tender for this task and I think the 
same group or some company or foundation they were part of won it. Today 
I read that they are trying to pass some law for the net to be controlled 
by a monopoly and the reason is to be able to control things. So it's 
spreading.
