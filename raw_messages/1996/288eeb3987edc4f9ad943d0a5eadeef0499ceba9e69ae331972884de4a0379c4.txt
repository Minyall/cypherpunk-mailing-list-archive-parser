For the paranoid, it would be an added assurance that they are reading the
original file at the original location. Otherwise, anybody could copy the
Web page, modify it, and give it someone else's PGP signature. 

But yeah, it would look awfully silly, especially to the non-PGP-aware
public. An unobstrusive PGP logo (below) would be great, and might become
a status symbol, like those cheesy HTML validation service and Internet
Audit Bureau logos (which I have used on a few pages).

Yeah, I like the idea of a standardized logo. A lot.
