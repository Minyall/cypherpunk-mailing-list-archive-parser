! Harry Brone is a fucking statist.  If he weren't, he wouldn't be running
! for president.  Anyone who doesn't advocate killing all kings, presidents,
! and prime ministers is a fucking statist and should be beaten to a pulp
! with a rattan stick.

That's the problem with the Libertarians, they've got some sort of
hang up about beatings.  Must be some childhood difficulties.
