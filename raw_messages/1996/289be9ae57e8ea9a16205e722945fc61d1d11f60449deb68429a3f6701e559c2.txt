Actually, seven of the children who came before his court on this charge
are still in prison. He sentenced them to between 4 and 7 years.

(By the way, some communities have made it illegal for adults to be out by
themselves when children are "trick-or-treating." Typically, the laws are
vague and are used for harassment, not actual prosecution. And I rather
doubt that the costume I plan to wear to Sandy Sandfort's party--"Jeffrey
Dahmer," with a bag over my shoulder and what appear to be severed limbs
sticking out of the bag--would be "acceptable" to local cops.)
