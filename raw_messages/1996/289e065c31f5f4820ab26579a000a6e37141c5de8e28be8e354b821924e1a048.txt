When I asked this a year or so ago, somebody recommended Levecque (sp?).
Thin book published by Dover that I bought for about $4 new,
very readable and clear, and the elementary stuff has probably not
changed significantly since ~1960.  You may want something fancier
and more detailed after you finish it, but it was a good start.
Now it's time to finish that book on Group Theory :-)
