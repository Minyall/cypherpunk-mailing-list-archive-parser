It's kind of funny to me to see Jefferson being discussed like this,
speaking as a student of it. :)

Actually, it's not all that big a school, thanks to the magic of
controlled admissions, with 1600 students for 4 grades.  This may be a
larger number than many private schools, but it is half the size of
many of the other public schools.  Jefferson probably has one of the
highest percentages in the country, if only because you have to pass a
rigorous standardized test just to get accepted to it.
