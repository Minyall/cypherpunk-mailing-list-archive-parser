I did an AltaVista search for "luzskru" and found it on a list of known 
open NNTP sites. They're almost certainly blameless.

The list, btw, is http://dana.ucc.nau.edu/~jwa/open-sites.html

Cc'd to the guy who generates that list. In case he doesn't know, 
cypherpunks is browseable at news://nntp.hks.net/hks.lists.cypherpunks
