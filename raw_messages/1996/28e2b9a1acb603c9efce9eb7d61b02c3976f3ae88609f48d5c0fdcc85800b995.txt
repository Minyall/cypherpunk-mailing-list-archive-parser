   An informative post for the most part, but the above is a crock of shit.
The best that this dweeb can do is to write 'my' postmaster, accusing me
of 'spamming' him because I 'return' his own mail to him.
  He has a psycho roaming behind the scenes in his system, and he has
enough time to email people whining about people hitting the 'reply'
button when they get his spam.
  His time would be better served fixing his system so that ten-year old
kids can't hack it.
