You don't believe in Mill's formulation, Phill. If you did, you
couldn't possibly support 90% of the garbage you talk about. Mill was
a libertarian in the modern sense -- he opposed virtually everything
government did. Yes, his opposition was utilitarian, but so what? You
use utilitarianism to justify the indefensible.

You say I think that my idea of freedom is license. Perhaps. However,
I think my notion is closer to the common conception than yours, which
owes more to Orwellian redefinition than to the normal use of the
term.

Again, that is ad hominem. You say that ad hominem's are fine when one
is questioning a speaker's credentials, but the point is that
Jefferson's credentials are immaterial. You call him a slave owner as
in order to try to taint his ideas. However, ideas cannot be
tainted. If Adolf Hitler felt that high speed autobahns were a good
idea, that doesn't make highways a bad idea simply because of the
person who conceived of them.

Jefferson could have been a mass murderer for all I care. His words
may be evaluated fully independently of his actions. They are not
interdependent.
