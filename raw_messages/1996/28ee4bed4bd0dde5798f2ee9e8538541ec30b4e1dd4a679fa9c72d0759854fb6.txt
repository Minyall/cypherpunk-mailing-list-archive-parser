Hear, hear.  If I own a computer and some contractor is writing something
on it for me, I should have the right to tell the contractor that I don't
want, e.g., any unlicences software and any data encrypted so that I can't
read it.

Likewise the gubmint or a corporation bigger than mine is free to say that
there should be no data on its computers or its contractors computers that
they can't read.
