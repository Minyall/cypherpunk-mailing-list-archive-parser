Hrmm.. perhaps there's a better way...
such as having the user and the mail server negoiae a key (i don't really
know the details of diffie-hellman or he like, so tell me if this isn't
feasable), and have the encryption/decypion routines strip addresses,
so that the person is only identifiable by their key...

anybody see what i'm saying?
