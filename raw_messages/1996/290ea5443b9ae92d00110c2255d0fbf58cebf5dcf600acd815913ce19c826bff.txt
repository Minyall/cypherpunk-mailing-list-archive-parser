Even worse is an outfit called Telecheck.  All they do is see if you have a
listed telephone number.  Since I do not give out my telephone number, and
it is unlisted, an autobody shop refused to accept my check, and I ended up
having to use a credit card.  The idiot teller refused to call the bank to
check my balance.  What does a listed telephone number have to do with
ability to pay?
