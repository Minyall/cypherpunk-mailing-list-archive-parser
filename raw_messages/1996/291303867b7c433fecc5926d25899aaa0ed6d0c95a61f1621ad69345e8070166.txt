But you certainly would not want the Java machines to be behind the
same firewall as the non-Java ones, since then the firewall would be
useless (see http://www.cs.princeton.edu/sip/pub/secure96.html). And
you would probably want to have a second firewall anyway, since the
machine running Netscape can contain confidential information
downloaded from the net. Also, if Netscape is used to access password
protected (or SSL encrypted) documents/forms, an attacker with access
to the non-secure machine can get many kinds of secret information,
including passwords and credit card numbers.
