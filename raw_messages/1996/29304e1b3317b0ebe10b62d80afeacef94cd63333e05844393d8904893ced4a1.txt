Hi.

Pardon my ignorance, but I had a few questions haunting me since a 
while.

Is there a way to have a remailer de-localize itself and relocalize 
itself over the internet?

For example, could there be several machines around the worlds that,
when you send an e-mail to it, is routed to differents physical
places of the world depending on where the actual remailer process is
actually running?  Could there be such a thing as a virtual machine
runing a remailer that gets to hop from physical machine to physical
machine around the world?

Just an idea to avoid jurisdiction problems.

Just asking, probably quite futilely...

Thanks
