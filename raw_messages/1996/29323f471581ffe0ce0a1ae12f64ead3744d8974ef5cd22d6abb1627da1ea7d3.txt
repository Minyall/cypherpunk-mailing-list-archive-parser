Excellent point. In point of fact, even if John Gilmore explained
his ideology to me, I would *still* only have an ideology that was
what I thought it was. There is no chance that I can get John
Gilmore's exact ideology in my mind since our minds work differently.

Yes, that is the case. Of course, my conception of "free speech" is
unique. I see no difference between a government, a group of network
administrators, or a panel of judges when it comes to censorship.

The King decided to force his subjects to tell the truth. Nasrudin was 
first in line.  They asked him, "Where are you going?  Tell the truth
or be hanged"  "I am going," said Nasrudin, "to be hanged on that gallows."  
"I don't believe you."  "Very well, if I have told a lie, then hang me!" 
"But that would make it the truth!" "Exactly," said Nasrudin, "your truth."
