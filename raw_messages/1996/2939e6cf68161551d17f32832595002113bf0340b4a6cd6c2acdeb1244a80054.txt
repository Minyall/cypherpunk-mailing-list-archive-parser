Shortly after the Gulf War elements in the Iraqi military tried to
overthrow Hussein; they apparently tried to co-ordinate with the U.S., who
tried to co-ordinate with Saudi Arabia, who warned Saddam that there was
going to be a coup attempt; gotta stop that Ol' power vaccuum...

The fact that the people who performed the Bay of Pigs were enticed into
it by promised but withdrawn U.S. military support is a matter of public
record; would Castro still be in power had the United States not 
(intentionally? I don't know) destroyed the core resistance against him
in that fashion?
