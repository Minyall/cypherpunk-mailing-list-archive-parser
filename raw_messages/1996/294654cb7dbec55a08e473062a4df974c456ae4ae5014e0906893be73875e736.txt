        Isn't "You break it, you buy it" the kind of sign that merchants
put up near _fragile_ things? Must be some new security strategy: threaten
would-be attackers with hanging the albatross of a hemorrhaging corporation
around their neck...
        Who knows? Maybe it'll work. Not sure how much pleasure I'd take in
a "Hack IPG" mug if I had to face years of litigation.
