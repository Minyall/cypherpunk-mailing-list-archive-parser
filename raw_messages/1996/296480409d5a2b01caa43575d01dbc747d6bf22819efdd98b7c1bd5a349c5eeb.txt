No. I'll have to look for it.

In the F-Prot does they explicitly endorse using PGP (esp. for 
sending infected files to them for analysis, as well as for checking 
signatures of binaries in the F-Prot package).

They also do the same academic hedging about effectiveness of their 
anti-virus package that a good crypto package would use, so I suspect 
they're likely to produce a good crypto package.

BTW, they're located in Iceland, at the complex.is domain.  AFAIK, no 
export restrictions there.

Rob.
