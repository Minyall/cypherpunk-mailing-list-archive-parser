   "Offshore financial centres agree to greater scrutiny."

      The Offshore Group comprises most of the biggest
      offshore financial centres including the Bahamas,
      Bermuda, the Caymans, Gibraltar, the Channel Islands,
      Hong Kong, Lebanon, Panama and Singapore. The agreement
      says home supervisors should be able to inspect the
      books of shell branches wherever they are kept. "In no
      case should access to these books be protected by
      secrecy requirements in the country that licenses the
      shell branch," it says.

   WaJo: "Cold War Spying: Mystery Gives Way to History."

      The release of the Venona documents tells us more about
      the state of intelligence agencies today in both Russia
      and the U.S. than it does about Stalin's spy rings.
      These and counterpart activities in Moscow dramatize the
      ongoing campaign American and Russian intelligence
      agencies are waging in the 1990s -- not against each
      other but at home, to preserve their budgets and public
      respect. And with "Venona: The Book" launched at last
      week's conference, can a CIA/NSA CDROM be far behind?

Anybody got a copy of the Offshore Group's agreement? Whither EUB?

Or seen "Venona: The Book"? If so, does David Kahn have a part?
