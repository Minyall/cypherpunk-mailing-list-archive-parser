This isn't quite analogous to the original problem of a software company making
good-faith efforts to prevent a program from being exported.  AFAIK, MIT did
not try to prevent the book from being exported (of course, the State
Department never did approve or deny their request to export the book).  Sandia
could claim that MIT came very close to violating ITAR, but the same claim
could not be made if the issue was a software program which was
export-controlled.
