Are anon remailers the only way to send anon email without giving up the source eventhough an organization has a wealth of dough/technology and several class B addresses?  Couldn't they just trick their mail servers or would a nslookup/whois defeat that?

And are nym accounts the only way to receive email without giving up who the intended recipient of tha mail/news post actually is?
