C-Punks,

Just as an interesting side note.....

I got lucky this weekend and found a First Edition copy of David 
Kahn's "The Code Breakers" at a little bookstore in Port Townsend, 
Washington.  WHAT A SHOCK!!!  Anyway, I snagged it for $25.00. 
 The cover has been laminated (library style, 
not card style) and it is in excellent condition.

For those wondering what the significance of Port Townsend is...well, 
there is none.  It is, however, the location of Fort Worden which is 
where "An Officer and a Gentleman" was filmed.  (Major piece of 
military history, isn't it?)

Anyway, if any one is looking for a copy, mine is not for sale, but 
the owner of the store said that she has seen copies come through every 
now and again.  (Not necessarily First Ed's)  If you are interested 
in getting in touch with the store, let me know.
