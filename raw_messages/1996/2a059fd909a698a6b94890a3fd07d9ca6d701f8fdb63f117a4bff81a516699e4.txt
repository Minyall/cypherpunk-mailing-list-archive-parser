John -- 

Just got back after vacation...

It is my understanding that cpunks list has been attacked by 
several clever tricks. I have a couple of suggestions on how to 
improve protection of this list:

# Use the following recipe in .procmailrc for cypherpunks (or majordomo)
# account: 

:0
* ^TOcypherpunks
* !^X-Loop:
* !^FROM_MAILER
* !^FROM_DAEMON
* !^X-Mailing-List:
{
  # get rid of duplicates
  :0 Wh: msgid.lock
  | formail -D 65524 msgid.cache

  # add X-Loop:, etc
  :0 fhw
  | formail -I "X-Loop: cypherpunks@toad.com" 		\
	    -I "X-Mailing-List: cypherpunks@toad.com"	\
	    -I "Precedence: list"			\
	    -I "Errors-To: cypherpunks-errors@toad.com"

  # this recipe finally passes the submission to majordomo
  :0
  | majordomo ....
}

The rest is not really anything for cypherpunks, and should go to /dev/null.

	- Igor.
