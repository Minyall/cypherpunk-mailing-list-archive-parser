There is a FAQ about anonymous remailers by
<A HREF="http://www.well.com/user/abacard/remail.html>Andre Bacard</A>.

Personally, I found it assumed knowledge I didn't have, and it didn't
help me find it either. Read it first and I'll be happy to answer
questions if you still can't get started.
