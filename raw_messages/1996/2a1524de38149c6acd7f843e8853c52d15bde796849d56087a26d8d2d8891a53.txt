Yes. On the Internet it may not be immediately evident that the other side
of the debate is represented by clueless juveniles with whom you simply
wouldn't talk in a physical encounter. Trying to explain the need for key
escrow to a 15-year-old self-professed "Libertarian" (or indeed trying to
explain anything about cryptography to a group that collectively claims that
discussions of elliptic curves are "off-topic") is literally throwing pearls
before the swine.

I've seen other people abused on this mailing list - usually, whoever
knows more about cryptography then the regular "lynch mob".

I had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Denning in person and I asked her
about her views on GAK. Her responses made a lot of sense to me. Most
businesses, if they thought about it, would prohibit their employers
from having information on company computers encrypted so the owner
of the computer can't read them. This is just good business sense.

This mailing list suffers from the presence of several mentally disturbed
juveniles who a) are clearly ignorant of cryptography (e.g. rant about
brute force attacks on OTP); b) are cognizant of their utter ignorance and
stupidity; c) are envious of anyone who does know what s/he's talking
about.

So, they feel compelled to harrass anyone who's smarter / more
knowledgeable than they are (sometimes using the anonymous remailers) in
an effort to drive all intelligent discussion off their "private mailing
list", so ignoramuses like Bradley can sound like "local experts".

The continuing verbal abuse of Dr. Denning is no different from the abuse
previously heaped on Fred Cohen or David Sternlight or yours truly.
