What if there was a flag on each message which the author could leave
"UNSPECIFIED" or indicate "NOT INTENDED FOR KIDS." You could attack by
marking a bunch of bland stuff "NIFK" or you could leave some porn
"UNSPECIFIED".  Either way, I think the situation is better for kids. I hope
that the majority of Internet users are not actively trying to get porn to
kids.

I see labels as helpful rather than restrictive. A label provides additional
information to help people find the information that they want. That
information can also be used to help you cut out the information you don't
want. If parents want to use this flag because they think it might help their
kids, great.

Maybe nobody would use the flag, but I don't see how it could hurt. If I had
kids, I would appreciate having the option of sorting out all the stuff that
is "NIFK" by the author.
