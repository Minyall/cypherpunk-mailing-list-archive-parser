Florida now recognizes electronic signatures as legal and binding. In
other words - its okay to sign it by modem.

The electronic Signature Act of 1996 passed the Legislature unanimously
and became law Friday. The law does not specify how an electronic document
must be signed, but it probably will mean coding the text and typed
signature so they cannot be changed by anyone other than the writer. 

California and Utah are the only other states that have laws recognizing
electronic signatures.
