Aggregious plug time.

The above comment is *not* so tenuously connected to my e$ lists. I've been
sending juicer bits of this particular discussion on to e$pam, my
e$-filter-list of other news and mail groups, where the above comment in
particular is germaine.  If you want to continue your discussions on
e$pam's discussion list, e$, you will be welcome.

I've been sending other money related stuff to e$pam, from places like the
AustrianEcon (Hyek, Mises, et.al) list, so people on e$ are at least
*interested* in intellegent comments about money of all kinds, in
particular the kind made of 1s and 0s.

e$'s unmoderated, and has, as they say in the money business, "endogenous"
traffic. ;-). Most of it originates on the list itself.

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
