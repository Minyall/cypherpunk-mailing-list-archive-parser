It would be hard to prove the case that this was the only thing 
preventing earlier manumission, but then the whole issue is one of the 
hardest things to understand about Jefferson; many of his closest friends 
were leaders in the abolitionist movement of the time, and it's almost 
impossible to believe that he didn't know slavery to be morally 
indefensible relatively early on in his political development. Guess it 
was just part of his programming he couldn't throw off.

Still leaves him just ahead of FDR as best american president, but does
drop him a way behind Paine for best  political theorist of the revolution
