The default behaviour of Eudora seems to work reasonably well
for replying to these.  Reply pops up a message with
        To:     John Doe #2 <jdoe-2@alpha.c2.org>
        From:   My Name <me@here.com>

Your mailer may vary, but it's probably got a similar capability.
The main problem I have is the "you wrote" as opposed to
"John Doe <jdoe-2@alpha.c2.org> wrote", which is more like
what you want for mailing lists, but that can be copy&pasted or ignored.

The person you're replying to usually gets two copies, but that's minor.
