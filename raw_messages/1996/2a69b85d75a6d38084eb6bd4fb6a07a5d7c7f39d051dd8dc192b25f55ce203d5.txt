I think that they would try to press charges under the precedent that
a guys modem auto-dialing Jerry Falwell's number was forced to make
restitution.   (Forget the reference, sorry.)

The important difference is that they probably are not being billed on
a per transaction basis, whereas 800 numbers are billed per call.
Would they sue?  Can you sell a jury on the essential difference being
that they were not billed per copy mailed?  I'd expect that they'd
react with a 'cut it out' message first.
