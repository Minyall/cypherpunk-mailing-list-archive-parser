At HoHoCon a few years ago, someone did a tempest demo and mentioned that  
signals could be recovered from water pipes!  Fire sprinkler systems were  
specifically mentioned...

Theres a lot of different avenues for your eminations to be recovered, some  
you may not of have thought of.  Like crypto, tempest is economics.
