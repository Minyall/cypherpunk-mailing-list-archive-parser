     My original had that, the replacement doesn't. 

     If you, or anyone else would like to see a scan of it, I can have it up
in about 30 seconds. Number obscured of course (not that it is hard to find
it other places).

     In Illinois, you merely have to request they not put it on the card,
supposedly in Missouri you don't have to have in put on the card if you
have a "religious objection", but I'd bet if you bitch loud enough at the 
DMV office, you can get out of it.
