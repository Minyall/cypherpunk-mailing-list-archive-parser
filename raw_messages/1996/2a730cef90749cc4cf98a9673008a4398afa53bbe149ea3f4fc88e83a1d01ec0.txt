	The only information we have is the information you give
us. If you don't give us your name, we don't have your name. If you
don't give us the site you're coming from, we don't have the sit eyour
coming from. They can't get information out of us that we don't
have. That's our guiding principle, in terms of the privacy against
government-level attack.
