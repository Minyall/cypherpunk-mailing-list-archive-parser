There is now a more or less complete copy in:

	http://www.umich.edu/~umich/fm-34-40-2/

If I can find a copy of the acrobat viewer that works (I
downloaded an AIX version, only to discover that it doesn't
work under AIX 3.2.5.  Grrr.), I'll put a postscript version
up as well.

Unfortunately, as Joel notes, the original site is definitely both
slow and flakey - so I had to guess as to the order of all the
files...
