			       ARTICLE IV. 
 
	The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, 
papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall 
not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, 
supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place 
to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. 
 

I must agree with the above sentiment by Lucky. When Steve Jackson got
busted (I was peripheraly involved through Mentor and Bloodaxe) and the
warrant was not only sealed (ie Mentor and Bloodaxe didn't get to see it)
but it was unsigned as well when it was executed.
