      Hi,
          Didn't I read that with the new Applied Cryptography there was a 
diskette or cd included that had all the programs on it? I noticed a copy 
at the B Dalton and when I looked at it it contained no cd or diskette. 
Was the aforementioned new edition with disk/cd a limited edition 
available through the mail only?
                       TIA,
                           moroni
