That's what they thought in 1945, too. I'd really hate to have to nuke
them from orbit. I maintain (I hope a little more coherently now) that
widely publicized subversion is far more effective than a frontal assault.
Who holds up the nuking of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as great victories
against tyranny?

I think this sense is wrong.

Yesterday's "Modem Driver" column in the San Jose Mercury News was poorly 
researched, but had the right spin. It mentions that the operator of 
webcom.com is the grandson of a Holocaust victim, so he gets the Mom & 
Apple Pie vote.

Front page of the Stanford Daily, which generated calls from the San Jose 
Merc and the Chronicle of Higher Edication, which are likely to get the 
story right:

I think it is, if (and only if) you agree with it.

I certainly would.

I've shut off access and challenged Zundel to get his many friends to run
their own damn mirrors. They could, you know -- at least one of them has a
T1. But I will put the files back (on c2.org and/or netcom and/or AOL
accounts, because it's just not ethical for me to involve Stanford in
this) if Deutsche Telekom continues to block access to webcom.com after,
say, next Wednesday. 

If they're not back up by, say Monday, I'll post an ultimatum to the 
above effect.

Netcom has hosted several notorious hate groups for years. There's no way 
in hell they'd buckle, and they're big enough to matter. Probably bigger 
than Stanford and CMU combined, though without quite the same symbolic 
power.
