So what's the current moderated/unmoderated newsgroup ratio?  (And
what's the ratio weighted by newsgroup traffic or popularity?)

Enforce?  Enforce?  Exsqueeze me?

And of course, it doesn't work.  There's an unlimited amount of
mindless dreck floating around every unmoderated nesgroup; I've been
reading news long enough (and NN makes it easy enough) that I avoid it
without a second thought.  I assure you, however, that no attempts at 
"nettiquette enforcement" are effective in a general sense.

How many people are there willing to moderate newsgroups?  How many
people are willing to set up alternatives to moderated newsgroups once
the moderator becomes unpopular (see the history of the .telecom
groups for an illustration)?
