THere is no truth in the report that Algorithm choosers were added to
BSAFE so it would be easier to leave RC2 out :-) Assuming this is RC2, 
that is...

When someone reverse engineered Prince (the algorithm formerly known as 
RC4), that was significant as the code was in widespread use, and was a 
nice fast stream cypher, which was pretty much an empty niche. RC2 is 
fighting for an already populated area, battling IDEA, 3DES, etc, etc. 

Oh yeah, and RC4 is really pretty, whereas RC2, is as ugly as DES and friends
