Yes:  

Widespread politically motivated disobedience forces
the state to either demonize the disobedient, (as with drug users)
or give up enforcement.  This is a standard and effective method
of forcing the repeal of laws, a method which has had a long record
of success for several hundred years.

The states cohesion derives from its legitimacy, and threats to
legitimacy and cohesion are treated very seriously by government
officials.

Threatening the states legitimacy is arguably more effective in 
influencing government behavior than blowing up federal office
buildings.
