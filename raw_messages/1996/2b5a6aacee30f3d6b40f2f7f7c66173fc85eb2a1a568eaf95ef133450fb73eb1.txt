Goofy guy agrees with Morris about X, therefore Morris' well-documented 
claims about X and Y are false?

Maybe I should have cited R. Emmett Tyrell's _Boy Clinton_?  ;-)

It also rained cocaine in Tennessee in the '80s, 
but the authorities never seemed to notice.  Ask the Knoxville 
_News-Sentinel_ how many stories it can find in its archives relating 
to planes loaded with cocaine crash-landing on remote airstrips, 
airdrops being found in citizens' yards, etc.  Then ask the DEA what it did 
about those events.
