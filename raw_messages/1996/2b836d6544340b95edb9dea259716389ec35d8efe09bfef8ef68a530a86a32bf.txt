I happen to know that an influential Congresspern will be meeting with
some Cato folks tomorrow morning, so I'm assuming this isn't an idle 
request.

If you folks were to pick one policy paper or book or magazine article that
did the best job of explaining why export controls on crypto were bad,
and/or why key escrow is not a good idea, which one would you pick?  I'm
looking for something that would be helpful to a Congressperson.

Please feel free to e-mail suggestions to me privately so as not to clutter
up the list.
