 It is interesting to note that while both groups have opposite
 objectives (Hackers want all information free, where cypherpunks want
 everbody to be able to have privacy), and yet in there own ways, they
 are both right.

 I think what we need to define is the diffrence between hackers and
 crackers. A hacker breaks into a computer like a cracker (but the 
 similarities end there).  The hacker just want to look and learn, 
 possably "map out" the system just to see how everything works with
 everything else.  Crackers break into computers for the sake of 
 destroying or stealing information or the system itself.

 Both cypherpunks and hackers think that the government is wrong
 in many things that they do.
