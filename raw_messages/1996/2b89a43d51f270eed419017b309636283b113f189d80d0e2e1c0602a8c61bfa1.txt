Which explains why in the  U.S. the tax authorities take the money first
and then require the citizen to be the "accuser" in Tax Court, pleading to
get his seized assets back.

(To outsiders, the U.S. tax authorities have broad powers to seize
properties without any court process, to attach wages, to deputize
employers and banks as unpaid tax collectors, and to harass citizens.
Citizen-units may sue, of course, but the burden of proof is on them to
prove that they are owed a refund. A man who saves money and puts it in his
mattress can have it seized and taken from him. He must produce proof that
it is his money, never mind that he already paid taxes on it and never mind
that there is no way someone who saves currency can have a proper paper
trail. So much for "burdens of proof.")

HOW TO MAKE A PIPE BOMB:
"Buy a section of metal water pipe 1/2 by 6 inches long, threaded on both
ends.  Buy two metal caps to fit.  These are standard items in hardware
stores.  Drill a 1/16th hole in the center of the pipe. This is easy with a
good drill bit. Hanson is a good brand to use.  Screw a metal cap tightly
on one end. Fill the pipe to within 1/2 inch of the top with black powder.
Do not pack the powder. Don't even tap the bottom of the pipe to make it
settle.  You want the powder loose.  For maximum explosive effect, you need
dry, fine powder sitting loose in a very rigid container." (more
information at http://sdcc13.ucsd.edu/~m1lopez/pipe.html, or by using
search engines)
