IDEA is patented in Europe.  It takes a lot of time to test out and
"break in" new encryption algorithms.  If you invent one, surely the
first thing you would want to do is to patent it, right?  Well, that
is exactly what everyone's been doing so far.  Few, if any, actually
let their stuff go to the public domain.

Kudos to Bruce S for Blowfish ...
