Subject: I won't tell if you won't...

I just found this browsing through a router manufacturer's "Frequently
Asked Questions" file:

   Q3       I have a bridge/router, and I have forgotten my password.  I am
   no longer able to log in and configure the device(s).  What do I do
   now?

   Do not panic! Enter the following password at the password
   prompt:XYZZYHIMOM.  This should get you into the unit.  Notice!! This is
   a back door to the units, and should not be made available to people
   who do not need to know about it!

And I don't even own one of these routers -- I found this in a reseller's
online catalog.  Back doors in devices that are often hooked directly to
external networks are a Bad Idea, if you ask me.  At least the manufacturer
documented it...

(password above changed to protect the guilty)
