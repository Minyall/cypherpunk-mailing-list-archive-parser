There is a tax event that occurs when one converts from one currency 
to another (be it capital or current).  In your example the purchase 
of Yen and later sale may result in a gain if the Yen appreciates, or 
a loss if it drops.  This is a taxable event.

You actually refer to the method that was used in the 14th - 16th 
century in europo to pay interest when it was against church (really 
"Church") law.  Early banks would do currency or metals-to-currency 
trades with people and imply a rent or interest rate.  It was also 
the begining of the discount trade bill (I'll give you 90 cents 
today  and get your dollar in a year from the person you sold those 
chairs to).

I'll still cling to my Ecash is curency not a currency agument as 
well BTW.
