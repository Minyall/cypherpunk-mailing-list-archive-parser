I don't necessarily want to support "socialism" nor "capitalism". Both
are extremes of a situation which does no one any good to exist. 

However, I would question the implication that "socialists" are
responsible for the higher tax rates you currently experience.  

For example, I could make a strong case that you really have some
clever "capitalists" who have learned how to express their
"capitalism" quite effectively across the space of all people in a
"country".
