One of the things you folks are missing is that this list is 
crypto-anarchy friendly.  Anarchy isn't chaos, it's self rule.  One of 
the things that us anarchists do is to deal with problems like Vulis.  
The usual methods are to flame back, to ignore, etc.

If the problem doesn't go away, then we'll make it go away.  Those who 
have the ability to make it go away will.  i.e. the folks that have 
control over the list server.  And that's the beauty of it.
