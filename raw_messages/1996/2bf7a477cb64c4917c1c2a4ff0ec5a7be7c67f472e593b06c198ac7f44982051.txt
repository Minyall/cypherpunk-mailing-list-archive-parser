Since others have mentioned Macs in this thread, and since I have a Mac, I
should point out that booting from a locked startup disk is possible, even
common. Namely, a CD-ROM.

What an OS would _like_ to write is not the same thing as what it _must_ write.

Also, for Unix systems there are similar approaches. Hugh Daniel has been
working on a "read-only" startup disk for Unix.

I don't know anything about DOS or Windows, except that every Intel chip
sale helps me financially.
