I have just set up a new 'nym server on nym.alias.net.  Options
include public-key encrypted replies, multiple and probabilistically
weighted reply-blocks, and fixed size response messages.

Right now the software should be considered in alpha test, so I can't
guarantee it won't crash or do bad things.  However, please feel free
to test it out and send me bug reports.

Send mail to help@nym.alias.net for more information.
