Non-anonymous mail can already be sent through penet by sending the message
to na[anon id] instead of an[anon id].  The problem you describe with your
mail filter also exists for mailing lists and other instances where a person
obliviously sends e-mail to an anonymous id.  Unfortunately, other
double-blind, pseudonymous remailers have the same problem.  The only way to
solve the problem is to not have remailers enable a double-blind by default
(or conversely, have all mail programs rearrange the address so the reply is
sent non-anonymously).
