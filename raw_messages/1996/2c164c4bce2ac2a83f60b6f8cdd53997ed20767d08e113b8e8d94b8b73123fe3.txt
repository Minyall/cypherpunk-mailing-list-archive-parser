Ian and Snow,

I think it would be extremely valuable to have the ability to "offer" 
and to "bid".  If Joe Student has much spare time and wants to 
develop a tool for themselves they should also have the option to 
"offer" it to the bounty server.  If any one is interested, offers 
could be made.

Good luck to you both.  This sounds like it is coming along.
