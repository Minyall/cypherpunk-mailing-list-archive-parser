Well, the fact that it's a "bad signature" does a lot to assuage concerns
about forgery. 

Now we'll probably see another message attempting to validate this one,
which attempted to validate an earlier message about a forgery that no
one (with the possible exception of the author) cared about in the first 
place. 

David (or whoever is forging this stuff for you), you should have quit 
while you were ahead. It's been all downhill for you since the first
message.

Will the real David Sternlight (and DS wanna-bees) please sit down?
