Yes, all very dangerous, but, come on, how hard is it to call sun
to get a copy of the patch? (answer, it's not). This is not that big
of a deal.

It's easy to patch yourself too. I had a patch for this three days after
it was announced, distributed via anon FTP and bugtraq. Basically, replacing
syslog.c with one that Perry had written and adding an snprintf.c function.
I've discontinued offering this since Sun's patch is now available.

Who cares as long as they distribute the patch? The international libc
patch is still freely available to anyone who wants it.
