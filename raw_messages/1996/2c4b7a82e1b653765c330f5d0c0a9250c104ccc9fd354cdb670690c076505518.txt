<sigh> socialism has EVERTHING to do with force. Socialism is based on the
TAKING from one to give to another. Without FORCE or the threat of FORCE
most people will not allow their hard earned property to be taken away
from them.

You look at any socialist program in the "democracies". Every one is a)
Manditory b) Backed by FORCE.



No socialist program has ever been implemented on a large scale without
the use of FORCE. It just can't work without it. I do not wish to be part
of the socialist programs in the U.S. Medicare, Medicaide, Welfaire, SS,
WIC, FoodStamps, ...ect. It is only because of the threat of the use of
FORCE against me that I continue to pay for such programs AGAINST MY WILL.

This is the same everywhere. If these were programs that the majority were
willing to participate volentary then why are they Manditory?? Why use the
FORCE of government to implement them?? 

Because socialism is THEIFT and people naturally resist the theift of
their property.
