I said a few months ago that I thought Java would be ready for prime time
in a couple of years.  I think we are in complete agreement here.

I think it is a bit worse since an applet doesn't get access to a lot of
stuff a C program, or even better an OS gets.  A C program has a lot of
environmental queries that might produce some entropy, although they would
also be available to an attacker on the same system.  The OS has access to
interrupt times, mouse movements, and keyboard timings for ALL the
applications that have run since boot.

I know.  I have an (old) version on my disk.  AFAIK, Hal is the most active
person developing crypto and crypto related Java code.  He deserves thanks
from all of us.
