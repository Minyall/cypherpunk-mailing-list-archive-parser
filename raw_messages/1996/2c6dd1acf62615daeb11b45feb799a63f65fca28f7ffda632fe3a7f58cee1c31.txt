You must understand that the USG faces a VERY big hurtle in
attempting to ban the book. Books have a history; one as old as the
Founding Fathers, older than the country and the Constitution, of
being protected.

In fact, this extends to other printed material; i.e newspapers.
They tried and failed to get "prior restraint" in the Pentagon
Papers case.

But in their quest to sandbag an already submerged dike, they hope
they can draw a line at magnetic media. It's untested, IMHO likely
to fail, but it's a hell of a lot better than trying to ban books.
They'd get laughed out of court.
