   Dole, who returned to Washington for Labor Day
   weekend, also pledged to use the White House as a
   bully pulpit to promote the "moral message"
   against drugs and to criticize what he called the
   entertainment industry's glamorization of drug use.

   On Sunday, he is to address the convention of the
   National Guard Association of the United States
   during which he's expected to propose that the
   military be enlisted to assist in a renewed war on
   drugs.
