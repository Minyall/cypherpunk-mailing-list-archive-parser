Mark,

Of course you can use pgp to sign binaries.  How else did the pgp binary
itself get signed?  You can either sign it in a separate file, or in the
same file.  PGP sorts it out for you.  

What do you use it for?  Same reasons you sign text.  "I signed this file"
means that you vouch for it in some undefined way (maybe I wrote and
compiled it, or somesuch).
