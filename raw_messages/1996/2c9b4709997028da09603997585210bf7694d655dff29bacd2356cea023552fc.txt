When you get right down to it, this calls for a mini-encyclopedia of 
crypto products (or even sub-products such as pre-processors or 
"encryption engines").

The basic outline for any products included (and don't forget, just 
getting included is some sort of endorsement, if you know what I mean) 
could be a feature/bug listing, using common crypto terminology, and 
could be followed by side-by-side argument paragraphs from the author 
and from a reputable review panel.

The usefulness of the list would probably depend on:
1. The participation of all those names people like to name-drop on this
   forum.
2. And/or the quality of the list itself if done without (1.) above.
   In this latter case, it could still be useful, but the variances in
   evaluation owing to personal bias would be difficult to overcome.
