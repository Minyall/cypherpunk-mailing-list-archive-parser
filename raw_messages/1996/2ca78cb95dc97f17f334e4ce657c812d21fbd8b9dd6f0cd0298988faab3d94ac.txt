The one advantage to Netscape 3.0 is that you can turn Javascript off.  (You
may be able to do that in 2.01 as well...)

3.0 has some pretty nasty bugs.  There appears to be a memory leak dealing
with forms, as well as a number of nasty little gotchas.  (I have been
getting crashes that seem to be assocaited with one of the plug-ins.)

Hopefully the next beta is out for 3.0.  (I have not checked in the last
couple of days, so it may be...  Sunday night seems to be the favored time
of posting.)
