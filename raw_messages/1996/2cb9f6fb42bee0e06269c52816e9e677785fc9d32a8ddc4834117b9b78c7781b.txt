Did the library include other encryption functions, other than one-way
functions? If so, I could see it being restricted. Linux, which is freely
available anywhere, includes a DES-using crypt() one-way hash. But since
a one-way hash function (implemented as a one way function) can't really
be used for encrypted communication, I don't think it is subject to
export restriction.
