   Sounds like you're a little weak on your history, Attila. Not that I
agree with the SWC's policies one bit, but some basic dates and facts -
when SW was born, when he founded his C, when WW2 was, what the Nazis did
during it and what the SWC has done since, when and how the anti-Nazi and
hate speech laws were passed in Germany, whether "any" speech or revision
against the SWC's agenda (or do you just mean "JEWS"?), etc - would make
pretty short work of your nonsense.
