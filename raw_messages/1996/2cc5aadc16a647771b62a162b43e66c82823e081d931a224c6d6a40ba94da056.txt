You need to read a wider variety of articles, and gain an understanding of
irony used to make a point. I sometimes despair when I get these comments.
(The ones I get in private mail often reveal incurable cluelessness, even
if the correspondents are just high school students who somehow found the
CP list.)

To make it clear to those readers out there who take all posts as literal
(and who didn't read my note at the bottom!), I was not doubting that Jews
were exterminated.

Also, John, you need not quote my entire article at the end of your own
comments. Use your editor to quote only the parts you wish to discuss.
