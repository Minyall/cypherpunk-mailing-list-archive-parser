Sounds like the usual fixed point hack used for manipulating and
storing money. Most systems I've seen use things like this.

Floats have all sorts of defects, like not conveniently indicating to
you the point at which they start dropping precision. A float doesn't
care that it just started dropping vast amounts of the precision in
some calculation where you are unfortunate enough to have done the
order of operations wrong. At that point, a hack will have kept its
precision or will indicate overflow, but floats blythely keep on
going. This leads to very unpleasant problems down the road.
