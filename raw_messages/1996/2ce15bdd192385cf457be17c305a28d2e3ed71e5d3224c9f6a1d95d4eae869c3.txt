 "A hardware device may offer a solution to software virus
 problems" 

 Calluna, a Scottish disc drive company, has developed a 
 hardware product which it believes offers computers complete 
 protection against viruses. It consists of a microprocessor 
 on a small circuit board which is placed between the PC's 
 hard disc drive and its system board, and which functions 
 independently of the PC's own CPU as a second CPU. The 
 microprocessor can be programmed to monitor all traffic being 
 routed to the PC's hard disc drive. If it detects virus-like 
 activity or any other illegal activity it alerts the user and 
 allows the option of blocking access to the hard disc drive.

 The second CPU could also be allocated partitioned sections
 of the computer's hard drive to store all material
 downloaded from the Internet. Or the device could be used 
 as a firewall to prevent unauthorised access to the PC's 
 hard drive.

 [Might this have crypto use?]
