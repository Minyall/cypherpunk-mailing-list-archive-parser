As I see it, there are also "serious First Amendment problems" with "full
disclosure." Or with the closely-related campaign spending limits.

If we support anonymous leafletting, anonymous speech, and just about
anonymous _anything_, why should we accept that the State can compell who
spent money in support of a candidate?

Our political system is already in thrall to various special interests;
this is the nature of our overly-democratic system. So be it. Let the
highest bidder buy the government he can.
