Cool stuff, Matthew.  You've gotta think about replay and delay
attacks though.  A good start is to include a time-stamp in the
authenticated message (I'm not sure if PGP's built-in timestamp
is authenticated.  Anyone?), save the latest timestamp which you
have authenticated, and reject messages unless they have an 
authenticated time-stamp later than that one.


What fun!  Keep me informed.


Regards,

Bryce
