C'punks,

Just got a private pledge for another $50.  With Ray's $50 and
my $100, we are making a big dent in the cost of getting Dimitri
out here.  Still haven't heard from Dimitri, though.  (I guess 
it's hard to type one-handed.)  :-)

In the likely circumstance that we get more money pledged than is 
required to fete Dimitri, I'll return the excess to donors on a
pro rata basis.  For now, though, I need more pledges.  Thanks.
