According to Schneier's book (which should be authoritative,
since it's his algorithm), the algorithm is unpatented
and the C code in the back of the book is public domain.

>2. SHA can be used without royalty.
Yup.  Use SHA-1 rather than the original SHA, though; the NSA
"updated" it in ways that do appear to strengthen it.

Yeah.  I think there's even an RFC that comments on it.
