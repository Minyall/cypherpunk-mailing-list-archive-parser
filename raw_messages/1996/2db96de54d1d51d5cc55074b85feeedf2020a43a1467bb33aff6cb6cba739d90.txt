This is so deliciously and diabolically clever it approaches genuine
Satanism. I salute you, Sir.

And here, all I was imagining was a pro-rated (to the number of parsable

with full instructions at every step of the way how to avoid each and every
land-mine... I grovel in humbleness at your screen. ;)
