I haven't tried to download it myself, yet (I'm on the wrong side of a
slow link <plug>(though it's faster since I got my new ZyXEL
yesterday)</plug>), so maybe this is explained for me, but does netscape
publish checksums for their US binaries?

This isn't just an issue of making sure your copy wasn't munged in transit;
without checksums, what's stopping netscape from embedding the info you
provide in the binary before shipping it to you, so that if it shows
up on hacktic, they know who did it?

Could various people with various architectures post MD5 or SHA1 hashes
of the files they downloaded?
