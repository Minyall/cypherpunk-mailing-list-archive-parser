You mean, like SSH's product?

For those that don't follow this, people who don't want to have their
communications listened in on are free to buy high quality
communications security products from SSH Communications Security, Ltd.
Their stuff is distributed internationally by Datafellows, and
includes 3DES, 128 bit IDEA, and plenty of other high quality crypto
products -- you configure it for the cipher of your choice. Key
management is handled with arbitrary key length RSA -- you, the user,
tune the length of the key, not the NSA.

The software is available free for noncommercial use and can be
downloaded on the net. Commercial users must pay a license fee.

This is only one such company. Most such companies are doing fine, and
aren't playing along with stupidity propagaged inside the beltway.
