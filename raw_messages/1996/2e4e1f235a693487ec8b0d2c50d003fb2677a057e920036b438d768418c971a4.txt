	Leonard Lewin wrote it, evidently with some inspiration and help from
Victor Navasky, how head ed of _The Nation_. Any credulous right-wing kooks
looking for a "deeper understanding" of the _Iron Mountain Report_ might
want to check out a session on it being held by the Learning Alliance:
Lewin, Navasky, and a couple of others'll be yakking about it (in New York,
I assume).
