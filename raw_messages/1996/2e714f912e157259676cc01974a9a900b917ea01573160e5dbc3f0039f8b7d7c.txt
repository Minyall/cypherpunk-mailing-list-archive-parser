The Austin Cypherpunks will have a monthly general meeting
on Saturday June 1 at 6:00PM at the Central Market Cafe
on North Lamar.  Look for the stack of crypto-related books.

This is an informal meeting for discussion of assorted
projects including the remailer, the video, recent crypto
events, etc.
