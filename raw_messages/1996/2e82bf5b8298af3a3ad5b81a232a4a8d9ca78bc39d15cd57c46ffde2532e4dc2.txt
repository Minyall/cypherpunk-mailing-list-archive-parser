    MANNHEIM, Germany (Feb 2, 1996 3:29 p.m. EST) 
 
                     reports: 
 
 
   Prosecutors hoping to ban neo-Nazi material from reaching 
   Internet users in Germany have notified America Online Inc. 
   that it may be charged with inciting racial hatred. 
 
  and of course... 
 
   America On-Line spokesman Ingo Reese in Hamburg said his 
   company also was happy to work with the prosecutors. 
 
 
  Cordially, 
 
  Jim
