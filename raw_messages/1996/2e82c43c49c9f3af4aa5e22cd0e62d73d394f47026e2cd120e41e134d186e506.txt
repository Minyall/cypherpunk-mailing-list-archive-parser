Exploring Rivest, Shamir, Adelman algorithm, but hoping someone out there is
interested in very large number manipulations.

RSA suggests choosing two prime 100 digit numbers p and q for beginning of
key generation.

These numbers are obviously beyond the long type of a C program.

Other than using Mathematica or Maple, I would like to use C or perferrably
C++.

Just some basics such as multiplication, addition, subtraction, division,
mod, etc over the Z set.
