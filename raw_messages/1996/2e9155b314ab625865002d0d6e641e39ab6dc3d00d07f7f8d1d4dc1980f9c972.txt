Well, not only is "Ralph" detweiling more intensely than anyone
since the original, hitting as many hot buttons as possible,
but he does an impressive job of trying to sound erudite by
quoting various literary figures while misspellling their names
(and misspeling other words far be-yond his obvious typ1ng defishncies.)

And, of course, if he _isn't_ a hoax, he's probably representative
of the rest of his company's quality process.

Either way, he's quite impressive!
