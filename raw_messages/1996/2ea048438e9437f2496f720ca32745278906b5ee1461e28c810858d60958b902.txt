While chatting with a friend recently over brown rice in Boulder CO, he
said something that I found raw-ther amusin'. Thought I'd share it. We'd
been discussing bit-sizes of keys vs fifth-generation NSA cryptanalytical
systems, etc and he said:

 "Wow, it's amazing how much [NSA] computing power is placed in
  service of [such a] '1-bit' consciousness."

Heh...
