Sixteenth Amnendment, ratified 1913.  I believe it was introduced
as the Simmons Tarriff?   1% on incomes over a few k, incremental
to 7% for something like 500k.  One big check.  And income meant 
the same thing it does now, you know, the numbers without the 
minus signs:

Funk & Wagnalls, 1913  (sorry, no URL)

1. The amount of money coming to a person or corporation within a 
specified time or regularly (when unqualified, annually), whether
as payment for services, interest, or profit from investment;
revenue.

Webster's 2nd International, 1954 (still no URL, not for the 2nd...)
4. That gain or recurrent benefit (usually measured in money) which
proceeds from labor, business, or property; commercial revenue or
receipts of any kind....

Now, granted, Funk & Wagnalls went to press before there was such
a thing as an income tax...so it's possible that for thirty two
years income meant something different, and reverted....

Actually, no, they could print fiat money whenever they damn well
pleased, same as ever.  Reserve notes were originally 60/40 third 
party (paper) loans to federal gold.  True, all of a sudden it 
was Uncle Sam's name on the notes, but it wasn't just ink.

!!!??  Aren't they?  Maybe a little bit of squares-rectangles business,
but, if so, all excises are taxes....

Websters:
ex'cise
2. An inland duty or impost levied upon the manufacture, sale, or 
consumption of commodities within the country. [...] In the United
States the usual <i>excise</i> is a tax on the inland manufacture, sale,
or consumption of commodities or for licenses to follow certain
occupations, and these taxes are usually called <i>internal
revenue taxes</i>
