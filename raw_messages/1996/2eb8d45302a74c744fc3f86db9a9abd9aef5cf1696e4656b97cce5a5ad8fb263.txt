That about sums it up.  

It's one thing to  endlessly insult Tim May.  I can just ignore those.

It's another thing to send huge files full of irrevelent bable about
genocide in some third world country that I have to wait till it
downloads before I can make the determination that it's pure garbage.
(No, I don't killfile people on this list, maybe I should start)

Sandy made you a fair offer, if you are out to prove that Tim May is
an <insert insult here> and you are the divine being of cryptology,
then show up to one of the meetings and prove yourself in person,
or atleast insult Tim to his face.
