There is nothing to defend.  Anyone, including Dr. Sternlight, may
join this list at any time by mailing a "Suscrive" message to 
toad.com, and may leave it at any subsequent time by sending another 
message that says "unSuscrive."  

It's totally user-operated.  No intervention by anyone else required. :)
