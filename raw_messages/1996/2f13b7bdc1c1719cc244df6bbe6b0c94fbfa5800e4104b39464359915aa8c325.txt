Does anyone know this guy?  Does anyone have any questions that they would
like me to ask?  I could take notes and let you know what he says (if
anything).  

I imagine this guy is going to say things like "Don't leave your computer
logged on while you go to lunch" Duuuhhhh...

I'd like to ask very poignant questions since this will be my second to
the last day working for Uncle Sam. (I'm going Private Industry, yeeaa!!)

And I really don't care what my boss thinks of my questions. ;)

Paul.

Oh, I unsubscribed to the list, 500 emails over a long weekend is too
much.  So please CC: questions to george@justice.usdoj.gov and I will
forward all answers to the list. Thanks a bunch....
