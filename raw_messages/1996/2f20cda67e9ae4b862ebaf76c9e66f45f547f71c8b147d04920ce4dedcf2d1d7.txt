Sorry, I was actually thinking of two-pass Snerfu that can be collided in
a matter of minutes... I'm fairly certain that MD4 is collidable, but I
don't remember where I read that, and I'm not sure how much time it would
take.

I'm quite certain that MD4 will not collide by accident, so it would 
probably be okay for you.
