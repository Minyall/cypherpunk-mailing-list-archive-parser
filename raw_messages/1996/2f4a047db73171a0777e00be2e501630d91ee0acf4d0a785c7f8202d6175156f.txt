What you're missing is that the IPG guy is a troll.
The reason there are contradictions is that he's making the stuff
up as he goes along.  Maybe he's having a good time.  Maybe he's a
tentacle of the spammer pretending to be D..V.. 

On the other hand, the POTP folks are serious.  Wrong, but serious,
actually selling a product and trying to convince other people to
include it in their email systems.

  Imagine if three million people voted for somebody they _knew_,
