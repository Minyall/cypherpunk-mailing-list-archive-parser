First of all, it wasn't Vulis who wrote that, it was Lucky Green.  Try
to keep your attributions straight.

   Somebody tell this stupid motherfucker that there are NO "basic
   Internet rules of conduct."

Wasn't it you who claimed that cypherpunks was "public domain" because
of just some such "InterNet" rule?

   He who tries to make or enforce any rules DIES!

Is that a rule? :-)

And you're a hypocritical fascist asshole.  So what?
