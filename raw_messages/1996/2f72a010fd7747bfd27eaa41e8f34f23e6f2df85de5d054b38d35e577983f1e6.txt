I fail to see how the Executive can simply avoid the authority and
oversight of the Judicial. Are there other circumstances of this? From
my constitutional reading the Judiciary has the right to review any law
passed by Congress.  The Executive only has the power to enforce, not to
unilaterally pass rules unrelated to enforcement.
