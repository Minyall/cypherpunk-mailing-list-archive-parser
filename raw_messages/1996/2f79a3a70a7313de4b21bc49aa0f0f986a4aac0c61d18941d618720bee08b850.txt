Depends on the space of ideas that are leading to your passwords.
If the reason you're adding spaces is to separate an n-character word
from the dictionary from a 7-n character word from the dictionary,
this reduces the search space for a cracker considerably.
At least pick random punctuation instead.

On the other hand, if your password is a bunch of randomly chosen
characters, having another character in the space doesn't hurt.
