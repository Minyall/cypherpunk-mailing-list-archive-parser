In about a year, ElGamal will be free from any patent burden. I have 
talked with leading users of RSA who believe that the savings by 
switching from RSA to ElGamal may be a powerful incentive for doing so.

However, the general feeling is that somebody, not said corporations, 
would have to first set up an infrastructure that uses ElGamal.

A chicken and egg problem? Or another Cypherpunks project?

--Lucky, who'd really would like to see ElGamal in wider use.
