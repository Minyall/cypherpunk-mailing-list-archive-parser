It's a matter of perspective and a weighing of consequences.  Are you 
trying to so that all evils are inherently equal?

I often see arguments on this list where people happily build 
irrelevant straw men and pound them into a pulp.  What's more amazing 
is that they're not doing it deliberately; they simply miss the 
point.

You see whatever you expect to see.

Careful vladdy, your detweiler is showing.

I thought the message was a pretty clear statement of opinion.  ie. 
the deconstruction of democracy is a good thing and cryptoanarchy 
will a enable a more just society.  (Some would argue more brutal as 
well, but I think that the level of brutatlity in society would 
change little from it's current levels.)

So cut the crap and go ahead and argue for or against that thesis.

(by the way.  Conveniently enough Tim May has put his ideas on the 
web in quite a bit of detail.  Just put "cyphernomicon" in your 
favorite web search engine)
