So, I just finished watching the debate and at the very end, Bob Dole
suggested that people check out www.dole-kemp.org.  I was already on
playing decision96.digital.com so I went for it.

The first page says ``Oops!  You've tried to access the old
way.  Please choose the new way instead.''  Clicking on `new' gives a
black background page with two yellow arrows, one left and one right.
The left one gives you ``Nope, you can't go back now''.  The Right one
gives you www.cg96.org, the Clinton-Gore home page.
