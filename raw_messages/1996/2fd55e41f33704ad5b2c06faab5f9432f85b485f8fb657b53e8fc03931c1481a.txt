Thanks for being so forthcoming!

There are methods for using 40 bit keys that are a lot better than
this. My contention stands: 50 200MHz Pentiums *WILL* crack this
overnight. A single 100 MHz Pentium will do it in a month. (This
assumes a known plaintext attack in EBC or CBC mode).

Not utterly trivial, but well within the means of a motivated
individual.
