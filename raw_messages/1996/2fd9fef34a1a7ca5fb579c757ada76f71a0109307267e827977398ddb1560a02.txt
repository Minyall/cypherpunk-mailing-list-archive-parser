Without wishing to respond in detail to Hayes's drivel I'll just
point out that Shell's involvement with Nigeria is hardly beyond
question. It doesn't take a genius to realise that sanctions 
against Nigeria would hurt Shell's interest. Perhaps its just
me but I don't consider it altruism when a company acts in its
own interests.
