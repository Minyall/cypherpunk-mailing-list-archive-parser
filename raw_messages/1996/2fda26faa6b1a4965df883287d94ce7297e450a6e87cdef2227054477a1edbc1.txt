I believe that with the breakdown of the traditional sense of sovereignty,
mercenary activity, whether military or commercial in nature, will increase.
Engineering seems to be quite mercenary already, and very international.
Marketing and advertising, to a novice (me), seem to be going the same way. 

Hence my interest in cryptography. Data security is essential in
international engineering projects.
