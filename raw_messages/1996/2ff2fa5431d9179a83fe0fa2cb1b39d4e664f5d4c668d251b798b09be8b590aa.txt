I now have a WhoWhere Robot hitting one of my web servers from
orion.parsecweb.com and it is most assuredly not honoring the
robots.txt file regarding directories to exclude. I also just looked in
the bot registry again and the WhoWhere Robot remains unlisted.

Needless to say, I'm denying accesses from parsecweb.com from here onward.
