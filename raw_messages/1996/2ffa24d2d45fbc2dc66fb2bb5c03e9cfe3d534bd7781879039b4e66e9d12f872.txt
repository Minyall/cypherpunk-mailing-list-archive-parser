Verisign's put their Certification Practice Statement up at
<http://www.verisign.com/repository/CPSNEW>. This document appears to set
forth the policies Verisign's implementing when it acts as a CA.

I haven't fully reviewed it yet, but my hat's off to Verisign for coming
clean and clearly stating their policies.
