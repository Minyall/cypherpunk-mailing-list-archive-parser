In my opinion (it's not "the truth") using a pseudonym except in force
majeure circumstances such as a rape counseling group is cowardly. I think
people should stand behind what they say, and the notion of Detweiler's
having arguments with himself pseudonymously would be hilarious if it were
not pathetic.

In any case it wouldn't work for me since I suspect my literary style is
sufficiently distinctive (at least for this sort of group) that I'd be
spotted in a short time and then be the victim of a bunch of nasty "what
have you got to hide" posts.

And I'm not going to twist myself into a pretzel, stylistically speaking,
just so some thug's nastiness can be avoided. I trust the good sense of
wiser readers, and as Harry Truman said...
