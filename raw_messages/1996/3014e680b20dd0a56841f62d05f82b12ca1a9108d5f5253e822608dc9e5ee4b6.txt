Carol,

I see no attribution for this. Did you write it?

It looks very familiar, like something that was posted to the Cypherpunks
list a couple of years ago. (I seem to recall Perry Metzger writing a
similar, or even identical, piece.)

If you wrote it, great. But if someone else wrote it, you should definitely
mention this, and give a name if you have it. If you know someone besides
yourself wrote it, but the name was unattached to the copy you got, this
should also be mentioned.

Again, if you wrote it, great. And I apologize for even hinting that you
did not. But it sure looks familiar.
