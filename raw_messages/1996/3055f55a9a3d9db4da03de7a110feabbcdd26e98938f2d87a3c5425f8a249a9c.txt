   May BYTE reports on topics seen here:


   Peter Wayner's deft assay of "Entrust," Nortel's E-mail
   encryption program. "An easy tool for securing E-mail
   unlocks the door to managing public and private keys."

   Michael Shoffner on "Java's Busting Out All Over."

   Andrew Davis on "A Digital Signal Processor Sampler."

   Rex Baldazo on the Be Operating System -- multiprocessing,
   multi-threaded and object-oriented -- "buzzword-compliant."

   Doug Anderson on the high-speed Fibre Channel network
   system.

   Among several other fine pieces.
