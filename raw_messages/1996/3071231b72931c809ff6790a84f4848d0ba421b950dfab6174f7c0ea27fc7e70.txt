I don't care if conference does contain the weirdest bunch of bozos
it has ever been my misfortune to encounter.
   Thank you, each and every one, for not posting 58,287,489 messages
saying "Merry Xmas", "Happy Holidays", and "Season's Greetings".
   All I want for 'Xmas' is for just 'one' of these 58,287,489 people
to give me a 500 Gigabyte hard drive to store all these Xmas greeting
messages on.
