Nice concept, but it isn't that hard to slightly alter each message; now 
you've also got to determine which are "the same" messages,and which are 
not. Why would the headers be easier to vary than the body? Tack a few 
extra one-liner pieces of add copy on the end in pseudo-random order, and 
you've got "different" messages.

How do you view this specially designed newsgroup as working? Will you 
need to fetch all notices on a regular basis, and use the "warnings" to 
sort your mail? Seems like it would take longer to alter your trust level 
of third parties than it would take for your "opponent" to crank up 
another aol trial disk ...

Looks like a lot of work ahead. :)
