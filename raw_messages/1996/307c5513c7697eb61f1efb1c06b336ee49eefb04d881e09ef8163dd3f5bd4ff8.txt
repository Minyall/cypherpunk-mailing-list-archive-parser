"The Business Software Alliance, a powerful Washington trade
organization, warned the White House that its encryption policy will
fail if the government does not turn to the industry for guidance."

blah blah blah ...

Interesting how these polite requests from the SBA, et al, are going
for such ridiculously low goals. Being able to export 56-bit symmetric
cipher products... Why in the world go for such a low number when that
is the absolute *best* that you can possibly get? And with such a
small difference between 56 and 40 bits, there isn't really any room
to haggle.

Duh.
