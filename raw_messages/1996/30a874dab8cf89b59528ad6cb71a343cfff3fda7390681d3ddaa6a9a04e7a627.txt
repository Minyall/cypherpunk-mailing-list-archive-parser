At this point, I think the Washington Times has far more credibility than 
the Washington Post.  While I'm, likewise, not particularly happy with the 
Times' ownership, I doubt whether stories like this ever appear in the Post. 
 (You tell me:  Did this story ever appear in the Post?)

The Net public is getting less and less tolerant of obvious bias on the part 
of those who report the news.  The Times has some potential (undisplayed) 
bias that we need to be on the lookout for, but the Post is actively 
engaging in bias in its news stories, NOW.
