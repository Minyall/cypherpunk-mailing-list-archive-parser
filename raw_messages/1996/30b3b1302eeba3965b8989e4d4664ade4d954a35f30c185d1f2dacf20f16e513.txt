INTERNET SUPPRESSION IN BURMA
In an attack on the country's political dissidents, the military regime in
Burma has outlawed the unauthorized possession of a computer with networking
capability, and prison terms of 7 to 15 years in prison may be imposed on
those who evade the law or who are found guilty of using a computer to send
or receive information on such topics as state security, the economy and
national culture.  (Financial Times 5 Oct 96)
