C'mon, both of you... 'First Contact' falls _way_ short of Doc Smithean
proportions.  Although Data's charade did kinda remind me of the fourth
Skylark book, in terms of plot-device rescue of a failing direction.
(IMHO, Doc Smith is the master of the over-the-top school of sci-fi
plotting)

B5 is my current favorite TV sci-fi, when I even turn the damned thing
