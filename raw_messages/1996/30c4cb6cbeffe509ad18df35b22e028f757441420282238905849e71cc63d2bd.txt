Excerpts from internet.cypherpunks: 9-Jun-96 Gore opposes unwarranted''

Heh. It's rhetoric, but it's also a sign of the shift in political tides
in DC. Now it's possible for politicos to claim the CDA went a bit too
far -- but they waited for a broad, corporate, mainstream challenge to
the CDA and a negative reaction to the DoJ's arguments from the judges
before they felt comfy taking this position.

Jack Fields, chair of House telecom subcom, made similar mouthings last
month in a speech I reported on in this month's (or was it last month's)
Internet World.

Also check out my f-c dispatch #13 for background on Gore's stand.
