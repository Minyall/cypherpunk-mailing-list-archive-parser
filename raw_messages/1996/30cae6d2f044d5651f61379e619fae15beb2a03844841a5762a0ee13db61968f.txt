Igor, you begin to sound like an American - i.e., even more stupid than the
50%sovok that you are.

I never said anything about the taxes paid by the dividend _recepients.

Igor, you begin to sound just like Timmy May - talking about things you know
nothing about. Yes, there's a famous theorem by Franco Modigliani and Merton
Miller, the Nobel prize winners which says that ABSENT TAXES, the value of the
firm doesn't depend on its debt-to-equity ratio. M&M also show that under U.S.
tax laws the best capital structure is 100% debt (again, ignoring other
available deductions, such as depreciation, and increased risk and cost of
borrowing as the debt increases).

"The value of the levered firm is the value of the levered firm plus the
interest tax shield (the amount of debt times the tax rate)."

Companies would borrow less (and people would take out mortgages on their
residences less) if the interest payments weren't tax-deductible.
