The leatest version is ready to be examined.  Much rewriting.

Send a message with the subject "send noise033" and an automated
responder should eventually send you a uu-encoded Info-Zip file with a
compiled version of the driver, assembler source-code, and pgp-sig.

Again, comments & criticism would be appreciated. Help is especially
needed trying to find IRQs to sample for sources of randomness.
Finding a good way to sample mouse or video scan lines would also be a
help.... etc.
