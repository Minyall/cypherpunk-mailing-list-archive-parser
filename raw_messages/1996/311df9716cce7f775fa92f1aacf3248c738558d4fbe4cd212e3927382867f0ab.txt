   Not this again...


Afraid so.  But they do challenge hackers to break it (the old `here's
some ciphertext, doesn't this look secure?' thing).  They also offer a
`free demo version', but due to federal law they can't make it
available over the net so they do this:

[from the order form on their web site:]
|                      copy    "EndUser"     2+    S/H       SubTotal
| DOS DEMO - version  ______ x   _FREE_   _FREE_   __$40_   =__________
                                                     ^^^

How nice of them to offer this free trial.  And if you crack the
sample message, you *get a free copy of the weak software*. Neat, huh?
