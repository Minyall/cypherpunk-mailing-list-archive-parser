I had yet another strange dream recently:

Clinton wearing black and white shiny vinyl high
heel shoes, and nothing else but a transparent
plastic raincoat. 

Embroided on the back of the clear plastic raincoat
is the bar code for the RSA algorithm. 

He is walking around the RSA Data Security Conference
with the outfit on, trying to hug and kiss the attendees,
but they all ignore and make fun of him!
