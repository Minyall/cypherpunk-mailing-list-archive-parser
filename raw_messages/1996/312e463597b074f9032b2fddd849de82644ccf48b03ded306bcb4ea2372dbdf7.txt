A good way of putting things. I wann't thinking in terms of a strict
tanonomy of "storage" vs. "communications,: but this is certainly so. The
government wants access to our _commuinications_,, while it is our
_storage_ that we as users are interested in protected.

(Not that I grant them access to "storage," but it's important to point out
that their claims about helping to protect ciitizen-units are bogus, too.)

We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
