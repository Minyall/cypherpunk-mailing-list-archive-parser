  Except it's not very effective, is it, since he's still
posting flames?  In any case, it's an admission on John
Gilmore's part that libertarianism can't work without some
measure of authoritarianism; the only argument is over _just how
much_ authoritarianism we need.
  
  I'm quite upset about this.  Up to now I was able to tell
people that "there is at least one mailing list on the net that
functions in a completely open manner".  No more.
