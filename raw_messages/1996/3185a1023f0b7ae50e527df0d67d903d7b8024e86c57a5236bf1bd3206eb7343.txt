So? I guess it's plagiarism, but there's nothing you can do about it
anyway. If someone wants to claim your words, let them sign.

One other thing - what about inline images?

I guess you could put an MD5 hash of the image into the IMG tag,
as a new attribute (you don't necessarily want to sign each of the
images separately).

I'm not sure how to do links, but I guess for the time being you'd
leave them unsigned, with a disclaimer or something on the signature file.

Have a look at http://www.cs.monash.edu.au/~jirib (my home page).
Is that more-or-less what you have in mind?

(Sorry about the cruddy logo - anybody a better artist than I am?)


Hope that makes sense...

Jiri
