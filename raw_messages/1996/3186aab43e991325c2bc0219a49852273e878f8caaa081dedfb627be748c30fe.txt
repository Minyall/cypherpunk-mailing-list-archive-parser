The Aegis ship in the Gulf wzs not in an exercise. It was in a war zone.

If my memory serves, the Iranian jetliner had its squawker turned off, or 
broken. The officer in charge in the CIC had about ten seconds to decide 
if he was about to be locked-on by a missle. And no real information to 
make the decision with.
