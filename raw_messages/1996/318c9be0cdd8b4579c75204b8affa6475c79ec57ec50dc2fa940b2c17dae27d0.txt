Someone wrote me a while back asking about using oblivious key escrow
("netescrow") to build a remailer.  I was a bit skeptical of using
exactly the mechanism that I outlined in my paper on the subject,
but I think the idea raises some intersting avenues to look at.

I'll try to dig up the message I sent on the subject.
