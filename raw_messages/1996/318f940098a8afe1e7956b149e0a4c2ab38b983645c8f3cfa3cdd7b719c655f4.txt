We *are* talking about the cypherpunks list, yes?  Then, in terms of the
list, John Gilmore *is* the official, hence a censor, plying his skills.

Why all the denial and repeated (redundant) blathering about John's
*right* to something he allegedly owns?  Simple.  The folks who put this
stuff out want desperately to believe that this list they spend so much
time on is "really OK", and not a censored medium.  Denial is the key.
