The problem with the "I am" portion of the above is it's not a whole lot
more defining than "I am" a federal agent, or "I am" a religious zealot,
or "I am" a cryptologist.

If you're a "man" or a "woman", chances are most people will know that
for sure, in person that is.  But when a person says "I'm gay", how do
you know it's true?  Maybe they just wanna play gay, to get better
acceptance on the c-punks list.

Used to be, "gay" was something different, i.e., "The child who's born
on the sabbath day, is bonnie and blithe, and good and gay". What have
they done to my language....
