Sorry, but you are ASSUMING that which I 
dispute.

The point I am making is that keys in the real world
are not uniformly distributed.

Some results forthcoming.


Suppose we have a function f() that randomly chooses an integer between 1 and
100 such that each integer in the range is equally likely to be selected on each
call. 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


If we call f() 6 times, each time noting whether the result is even or
odd, which of the following sequences is more likely?
