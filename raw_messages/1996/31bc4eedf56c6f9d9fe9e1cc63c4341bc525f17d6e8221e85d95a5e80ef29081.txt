     Yes, those guns are evil things. Evil I tell you, constantly shooting
people for no reason, going off half-cocked and whooping it up all by 
their polished oiled ol selves.

     Isn't it funny how otherwise rational people can ascribe intentions
and moral alignement (ie. good/evil) to an inert chunk of steel?

     I was driving tractors(small ones) and motorcycles long before I 
turned 16. My father started teaching me to drive a car (thru asking 
questions &etc.) when I was about 12, and put me behind the wheel of 
a van when I was 15 (in a controled situation away from traffic). 

     He also taught me the basics of gun saftey, and made sure that
I took those classes that were available to me in the areas of gun 
saftey and marksmanship. 

   Then again for all his faults my father is a relatively rational 
human being about most things.
