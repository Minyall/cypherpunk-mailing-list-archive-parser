Been addressed.  See e.g., Winn Schwartau, "Defense in Depth for 
Information Systems Survival"  8 International Journal of Intelligence and 
Counterintelligence 2, 229.

Mr. Schwartau is the Exec. director of Inter.Pact, Inc., a Florida 
information security firm and has written what is considered, in some 
circles, the seminal work on the subject "Informational Warfare: Chaos 
on the Electronic Superhighway.
