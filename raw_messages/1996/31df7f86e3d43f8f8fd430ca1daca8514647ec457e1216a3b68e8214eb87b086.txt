Let's see if I understood what you said. Is "a" the operative word--that
is, are you telling us that a book is in the public domain if it is widely
sold in bookstores or held in libraries, but that you can't put it in the
public domain by selling it in one bookstore or depositing it in one
library?

If so how many are enough? If not, please clarify further.

Thanks;
David
