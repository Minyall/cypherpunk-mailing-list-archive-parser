A good question. It is based on the theory that every person has a
"utility" function in their mind. This function determines the "worth"
of money and worthiness of risk. 

If that function as a function of income is strictly concave

then the utility of your gamble would be

U(gamble) == 1/2 * U(0) + 1/2 * U(100).

By definition of concavity, it is less than utility of $50.

Whether it would be more or less than the utility of $49, depends
on a consumer, but it may well be that some people will not like
this gamble.

There is much evidence that indeed most (if not all) consumers have
concave utility function.

I know that I would refuse a gamble where I could win $20,000
or get nothing, with equal probability, and prefer to get $9,999
for sure instead.

There is much theory about financial asset pricing that relies on the
assumption that utility functions are concave.
