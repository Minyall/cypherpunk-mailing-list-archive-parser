Your comment is historically inaccurate. When "the Americans" came around
to Europe selling Clipper, most told them to go peddle their papers. Then
independent European escrow developments arose in a number of countries.
This is a European line if it is anything, since there is no mandatory
escrow requirement for domestic crypto in the US, nor has one reached the
advanced state of play it has in the UK, Netherlands, European parliament
(or is it the Council?), etc.

There is no "toeing the American line" in this matter except in the minds
of America-bashers.
