Really? Who reviewed the security of SafePassage?

I've never seen a security review of SSLeay, and if anyone gave it a clean bill
of health, they didn't have their eye on the ball. Note, I'm not knocking
SSLeay here, it is a wonderful lump of code, but it hasn't been written with
security in mind (IMHO).
