Regulation issued?  Sure.  Regulation _enforced_?  Far more difficult!  
Maybe even impossible, when considered over the entire population.  I've 
been considering this for a long time, and I came to the conclusion that you 
really can't enforce regulations dictated by a small fraction of the 
population onto the large majority.  

Enforcing a regulation costs effort.  (money?  time? people?)  People are 
not going to put in this kind of effort unless they feel strongly about an 
issue.  It would be possible for a large majority to enforce a standard of 
behavior on a tiny minority ("rules" against theft and other common crime) 
but this will work only if the average individual is willing to donate money 
to see those general rules enforced.  Over time, few people will donate 
money to see victimless crimes (drugs, gambling, prostituion) enforced, for instance.
