I think you're misinterpreting what's going on.  Participants in the 
Coderpunks list are not generally abandoning Cypherpunks.  Some people
who have long been absent from the Cypherpunks list have joined it, but
I've seen posts from most of the Cypherpunk participants of Coderpunks 
on Cypherpunks since it was formed.

My concern is that the two lists will become more disjoint than they
already are.  I believe that the content of Cypherpunks is enhanced by having
the programmers present, just as the coders benefit from the guidance of seeing
the possibilities opened by their endeavors.

The remailers network is the most obvious example of the benefits of this synergy.
I'd hate to see us lose later rewards that could otherwise be reaped.

I don't believe that it'll be sociopolitical content that'll chase
the coders away: if the constant fighting over indisputable metaphysics
doesn't do it, the fighting over who was killfiled by whom first
and who's a total loon will.
