Scuttlebut is, CoS rolled over on some pesky ultra-right-wingers as a 
favor to Morris Dees and various scumbag associates. For this, CoS got 
their long-awaited (40-plus years!) federal tax-free status.

This status is big cash, so naturally, interested parties wanted to know 
under what rules did CoS get their tax-free gift, since long-standing 
high court decisions laid out the profit-making business plan of CoS in 
no uncertain terms, explicit and detailed.

Problem is, nobody was able to get the details of the policy change - 
did CoS change their business plan, or did the fed change their rules?
