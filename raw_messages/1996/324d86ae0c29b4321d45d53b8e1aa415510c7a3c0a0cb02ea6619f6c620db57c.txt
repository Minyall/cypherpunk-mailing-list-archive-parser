	IMFO you opened your mouth before you clutched in your brain. 

	tim's point is presented not as an opinion, but as a supposition
    for a counter-argument. I do not read the article as "revisionist."
    IMHO, Tim's point that suppressing the truth generally places
    the "accepted" view of history into question is valid.

	of course, who the hell am I?  and I suppose I have 3 strikes
    starting out being a Schweicheriech---

	my only comment on the atrocity is that is was no larger than
    that visited upon the Armenians by the Turks, and less than 10%
    of Stalin's toll.  The fact is: they are still wrong!  Man's 
    inhumanity to man is well documented (other that what generations
    of revisionists have altered) through history.  And, he who fails
    to read history, is doomed to repeat it....
