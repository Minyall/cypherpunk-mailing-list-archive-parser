However, I think it very unlikely that an organization like the NSA would 
bother with an FPGA to do a cracking engine.  FPGA's have substantial 
limitations, as you alluded to above, due to the need to make them "general 
purpose."  A non-field programmable Gate Array, a hard-wired chip, would 
tend to optimize the interconnections on chip including minimizing the 
delays, but not incur the full-custom costs such as the penalty for low volume.
