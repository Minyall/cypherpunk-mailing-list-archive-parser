	You were lucky. had the YCO understood the implications of 
    crypto, he probably would not have been so genial.

	San Fransisco is a good entry port for that reason --it does not 
    seem to be a major drug entry point via commercial airlines.  
    Secondly, the four or five times I have gone through there have been 
    hi-bye even though I am flagged --however, carrying a foreign service 
    passport (which has no relation to immunity) requires them to manually 
    enter the number...  end of story in loose ports.

	For the most part that is very true.  The only places I ever get 
    hassled is at obscure German-Swiss borders at night (driving). 
    Usually an older officer stuck with nights to encourage resignation
    --breeds a foul temper and absolute lack of humour --not that the
    Swiss ever had one <g) --I can say that with impunity: I am Swiss. 

	Other than bombs, the Europeans are just not cynically paranoid.

	yup, there's always high bandwidth spread spectrum in a truck.
