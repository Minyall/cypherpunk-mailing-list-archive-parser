This is peculiar. Nobody seems to mind ads in Newspapers, printed magazines, TV, and for that matter
web sites. That is unwanted stuff too, but now someone is paying for it. Though one can argue it out, on
many grounds :

1. If the guy has to pay for it, he'll do it in limits.
2. He must have selected the context carefully, so the ad is most prolly of 
   some use to its audience
3. He'll tend to talk sense.
