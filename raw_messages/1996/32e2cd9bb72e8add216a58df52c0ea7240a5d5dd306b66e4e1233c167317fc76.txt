According to one offshore magazine European Union Bank is a very bad
choice for Internet banking. What they did was they assigned they named
Lord Mancroft who sits in the UK's House of Lords as chairman of the bank.
Only thing Lord Mancroft himself did not know a thing about it, although
the bank marketing materials had a letter of welcome supposedly from that
prominent person. So he is thinking of taking legal action against the
bank.

Also their correspondent bank in UK wants to terminate their relationship
with EUB because of these problems.
