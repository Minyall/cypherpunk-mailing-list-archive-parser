Could you please learn how to spell?

You cannot possible send your keys to the recipients encrypted in a
one time pad, because a one time pad can be used only once. Every bit
of keying material you would send your clients would use up one bit of
the material they had. That would mean that you could never send your
clients new keying material this way.

The phrase one time pad is a fraud, plain and simple. I mean that in
the most technical, legal sense. Advertise using that term and the FTC
can and will throw you in jail.

What you have here is some sort of conventional stream cipher conked
up from a PRNG. You've solved no key management problems. What you've
done is simply generate lots of hype. When I see the PRNG I suspect
that I'll discover that the thing is nothing more than some sort of
multi-pass linear congruential generator that cracks open like an egg.
