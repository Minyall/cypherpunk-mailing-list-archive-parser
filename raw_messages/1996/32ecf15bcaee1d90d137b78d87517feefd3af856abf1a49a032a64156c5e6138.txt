The only time I've ever heard the term was in conjunction with the email 
sent out by the Clinton campaign during the last election.  

I probably misunderstood what was going on, but at the time I assumed that
it was a little different than a mail list.  My impression was that it
was for broadcasting rather than disucssing (ie., only the campaign could
use it), and that it was hierarchical in nature (mail goes to a dozen or a
hundred "exploders" who then send it out to a couple of hundred thousand
individuals).
