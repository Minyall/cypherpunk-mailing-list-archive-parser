Lucaciewicz, as I recall. His notation was originally that one would add
two numbers, a and b, as "+ a b." A modified form, adapted for stack
machines, was to add two numbers with "a b +." Hence, _reverse_ Polish
notation, but equally sound.

This involves entering a, then pushing it onto the stack with an ENTER,
then entering b, then hitting the "+" key to pop the stack and place the
sum in the main (X) register.

For people who claim that (6 + 7) * 5 is the "natural" way to do things, I
point out to them that the way one does it one's head is to take 6 and 7
and add them then to multiply by 5. Or I show them

   6
+  7
-----
   13
*   5
-----
   65

Then they see that RPN is actually the way we do things in our head. Or on
paper.

Computers do things with parentheses, we don't.

By the way, Polish notation is how LISP evaluates expressions. E.g.

(+ 6 7)

or, for the full problem above,

(* 5 (+ 6 7))

And for those of you are not LISP or Scheme fans, the language FORTH also
uses Polish notation. RPN, in fact.

We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
