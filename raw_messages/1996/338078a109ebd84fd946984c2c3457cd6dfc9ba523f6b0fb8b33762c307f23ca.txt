Actually I think its thier lack of foreseeing how a produbt can and will be
used.  Problems throughout thier line of products show this off.
Most of thier products are a creation of Microsoft anyway, they've stolen,
borrowed, purchased or purchased the company to obtain their products, then
added features upon features so they can market the hell out of it
to become #1 in market share. Many cases they've taken a reliable product
and made it less than reliable.
  I don't understand why people continue to support Microsoft they way 
they do!
  
   Ponder the thought of Microsoft buying up every web server/broswer
  company in the first year or two of the WEB?  Would it have made it where
  it is today?  
  Ponder the thought of Micorosft having ultimate control over the
  IETF

BTW: When is this list/listserver going to convert the reply-to fields to
