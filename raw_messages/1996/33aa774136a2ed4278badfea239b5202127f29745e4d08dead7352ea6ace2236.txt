Over the last couple of weeks, I've noticed a lot
of subscribers who PGP clearsign their messages,
but who haven't uploaded their keys to any of
the public keyservers.

Those keys are most useful when they're
available to people who might want to use them,
so I'm asking those of you who haven't sent
them to a keyserver to do so.

(The quick version: paste your key in cleartext
into a letter, sent to pgp-public-keys@pgp.mit.edu
with the subject: ADD.  If you don't have it
in cleartext, do pgp -kxa and follow the prompts.)

TIA,
dave
