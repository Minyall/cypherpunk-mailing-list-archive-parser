Though it is well known that I am in favor of gun control regulations, I
have to support Brad Dolan here. There is a huge and traditional gun
culture in rural American, particularly in the midwest. The way most Jewish
kids get Bar Mitzvahed at 13 as a rite of passage into adulthood, or the
way most kids get their learner's permit to drive as such a symbol is the
way many midwestern kids get their first gun.
