Of course that doesn't overcome the "technical problem" of getting the IETF
to adopt that change in the protocols and getting a significant number of
sites to adopt the new protocol.  Even if you impose a substitutte on the
IETF, it doesn't stop them from wandering off and creating their independent
protocols and seeing whether the "official" or the "unofficial" get adopted.
