There is somebody by this name in the field: the City University of New
York granted a PhD to one Dimitri Vulis in 1995.  The dissertation title
was "Collective encryption: Cryptosystems based on the commutator

of any participant in cypherpunks, well, this list has discussed that
general topic before...
