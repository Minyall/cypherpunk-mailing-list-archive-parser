These points would not affect a devout Iranian Muslem.  To him the death
warent has already been issued by legitimate authority.  It is not even
clear that money would be his princple motivator.

I must respectifully disagree with Jim in this case.  I believe that
Rushdie has not been hit because the protection he enjoys is sufficent to
repel the potential assassins.  Note that he has an advantage over the US
president (who probably has as many potential assassins) in that he does
not need to make public appearences.

Adding money to the pot will attract rational (and amoral) people who will
then make a determination based on (1) profit, and (2) risk, which includes
getting caught or killed.  It seems to me that Secret Service levels of
protection can protect a public figure against even Assassination Politics.
