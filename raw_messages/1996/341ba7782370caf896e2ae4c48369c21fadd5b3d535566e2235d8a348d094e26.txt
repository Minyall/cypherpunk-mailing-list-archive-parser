You should know better than to believe everything you read in
alt.folklore.urban, even the debunking. 

There was a brief Libyan-backed coup in Trinidad & Tobago in July 1990.
Here are a few Reuters headlines in reverse chronological order, courtesy

I believe that the Symantec story has at least some truth to it. 

I don't read alt.folklore.urban, so I won't post there, but someone should.
