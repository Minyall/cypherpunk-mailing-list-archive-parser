Are there any banks besides SFNB then that use weak 40-bit encryption for
anything more than balance queries or transaction history, and allow to
make real transactions on-line?

I know Merita in Finland allows bank transactions using 40-bit RC4, but
they also use one-time passwords (every user gets a printed list with 40
or so password pairs, each of which you can use just once).
