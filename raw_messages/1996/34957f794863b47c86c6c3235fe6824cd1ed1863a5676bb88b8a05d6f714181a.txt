Now that is a more useful and accurate statement than that substantive
parts of the Preamble are "meaningless". As you must know from your Con Law
classes, legislative intent is an important element of many Supreme Court
decisions, and the Preamble is certainly as crisp and classical a statement
of legislative intent as one can find.

The specific point, of course, wasn't GAK but the silly dispute by one of
our beloved nit-pickers of the assertion that the President took an oath to
protect national security. By inclusion in his oath to defend the
Constitution, given the bits I cited, he effectively did.

Best;
David
