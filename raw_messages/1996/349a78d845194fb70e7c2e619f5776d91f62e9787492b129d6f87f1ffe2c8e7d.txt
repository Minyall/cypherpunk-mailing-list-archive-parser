Would that be "Public Opinion?"


If so, that's an interesting progression: Bernays to Lippman to 
Chomsky: PR begets PO begets ...  How would the 
politico-linguist's advocacy be characterized, PR, PO or 
whatever is evolving parasitically from hegemonic, ever 
manipulative media?


All the variations of MCI-MS-News-Oracles, global combos and 
recombos burgeoning and emerging.


All the promising, braying, dreaming, lying, manipulating 
markets and investors reminds of Lippman's and Bernay's and 
Chomsky's warnings about evil-doers causing the sky to fall.
