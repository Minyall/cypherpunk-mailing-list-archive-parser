I was hoping a hardware type would answer this question, and give
references to manufacture's spec sheets, but not having seen such an
answer, here is a software person's answer.

Gate arrays are a common part of complex electronics.  If you are viewing
this answer on a screen, it is quite probable that there is one right
before your nose.  They come in two basic forms, mask programmed and field
programmed.  Mask programmed gate arrays are an array of logic gates, which
are "programmed" to an application by a final metalization layer.  They are
quite inexpensive when ordered in quantity.  Field Programmed Gate Arrays
(FPGAs) are designed for prototyping designs, and can programmed
electrically.
