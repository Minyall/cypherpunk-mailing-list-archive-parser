In general the whole Commerce team is pretty good on this; their goal in 
life is to help US companies sell stuff; it's State and defense that are 
interested in controlling exports. Ron Brown has a top-notch team, and 
he's one of the best politicans (in the good sense) in the country today, 
and is willing to really fight for the interests of Commence. Of course, 
the downside shows in the ethics questions (sigh)

 Of course, State tends to treat arms sales the way other departments
treat logoes boxes of chocolates, to be given away as parting gifts make
guests feel welcome. F-15Es to the Saudi's? Kind of like giving F-4s to 
the Shah.
