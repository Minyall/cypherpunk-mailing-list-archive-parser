Flew down to LA recently with a firearm (checked, of course).

Looking over the ticket later, I was mildly surprised to find "GUN" in
a string of otherwise unintelligible text.

Anyone know if this is they way it's been, or if this is YA "Anti-terrorism
security measure"? Goes without saying that this data would most likely
wind up as part of the "travel profiles" the gov't wants to compile. Could
they be starting early?

The carrier was Alaska Airlines, if it matters.

As far as the photo-id went, they didn't copy any data off it or try to
authenticate, just made sure it was my picture.
