You could avoid alot of encryption by setting up a key for the list and
giving both keys (secret and public) to all the list members. To write to
the list, you encrypt with the lists public key. Everybody reading the list
can decrypt with the secret key.

Pros: No hacking of majordomo. You can use any mailing list software. The
key and clear text message is never available to a robot, making it harder
to compromise security.

Cons: When somebody is removed from the list you have to change the key,
encrypt the new secret key with everybodys public keys and distribute it.
For a big dynamic list where people unsubscribe daily this could be a major
headache. But for small or static lists it shouldn't be much of a problem.
