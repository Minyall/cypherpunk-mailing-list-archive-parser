Considering the fact that exactly this sort of advice has been offerred and
has been wrong for over a decade, why should this oracular statement be any
more accurate? Note that there is excellent crypto software available for
the Mac (CryptDisk, PGPFone, and MacPGP for example). Vinnie's effort is a
welcome attempt to arrange the "plumbing" so that crypto software is even
more accessible on the most accessible OS. Sniping from the cheap seats is
the last thing he should have to endure.
