The mail server still has to send packets to the user.  A packet sniffer might
not be able to find out the actual contents of the transmission, but it would
be able to find out the host that has made the connection.  If this is combined
with the knowledge of the times that certain user's mailboxes get cleared out,
it would be possible to find out which nyms belong to which people.  The
current nym servers that automatically forward mail do not have this problem.
