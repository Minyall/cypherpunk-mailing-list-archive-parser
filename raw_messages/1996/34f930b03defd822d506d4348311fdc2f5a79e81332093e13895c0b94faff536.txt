There are many ways to spread it besides a virus.  Zillions of 'em.  And
there are totally anonymous ways to redistribute it, some of which I've
never seen described publicly, which is why they were left unspecified.

Do you have my key in your key ring?  I rather  doubt it.  So what good
would it have done?  

Have you downloaded my key from the net?  Assume that you have.  How do
you know it's mine?

I use PGP about 20 times per day.  I use it in a manner that is
*meaningful*.  Unless we have in some way or another verified each
others' keys, it is meaningless for me to sign a message to you. 
Putting a PGP signature on a message to someone who has no way of
verifying your keys is a nice political statement, but is utterly
meaningless in terms of adding any proof of the sender's identity.  --

PS -- On the off chance that anyone really doubts this is me, I will
shortly send cypherpunks a message that has my own voice AND a PGP
signature thereupon.  That way, you can check my identity if you either
recognize my voice OR have verified my fingerprint.  Sheesh.  -- NB
