The SPA isn't going to go after pirate sites because they're operated by
kids in basements who've got no money.  C2 has money.  The SPA likes
money.  SPA sues C2.  (I'm sure there's some formal sentential logic that
someone can post that will state this in even more succinct terms.)

The SPA doesn't care about what's right or what's wrong, or what's legal
or what isn't.  It wants money and it must not be getting enough from its
member organizations, so it's time for a few law suits.
