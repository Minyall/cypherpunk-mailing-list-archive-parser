I think a more accurate assessment of what the Princeton people think is
that the state of Java security is much like the state of Unix (pick your
flavor) security when people first started attacking Unix.  Since then it
has been fix the holes as they are found.  Neither has a coherent security
model.

Now the Princeton people can tell us all how I miss-interpreted their position.
