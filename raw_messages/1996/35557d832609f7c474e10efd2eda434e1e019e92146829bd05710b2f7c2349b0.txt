The official result, including the votetaker's explanation for the
extraordinary delay (which makes interesting reading), is in
news.announce.newgroups, Message-ID <833851386.24895@uunet.uu.net>. Or for
people who only use Netscape:

While I think I was one of the people presenting legitimate reasons for
voting no (as opposed to all the "VOTE NO ON NAZIS!" -- see news.groups
archives), I'm actually disappointed that there were only 592 yes votes. I'd
have expected more than the estimated 400 anti-censorship and spam-annoyance
reactions. 

I would urge people NOT to download the 3MB list of votes, as I haven't,
because the vast majority of voters had no clue what they were voting on. 
The majority probably thought it was a secret ballot. 

The poor votetaker definitely deserves a medal, but PLEASE don't send him
appreciative mail;  he's getting far too much already. 

Sent separately to fight-censorship and cypherpunks. Followup discussion, if
any, belongs in news.groups ONLY.
