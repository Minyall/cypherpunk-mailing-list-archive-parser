So you've found one specific instance where you don't think it's appropriate 
to send email.  Big deal!  Try again.

Want people to read books?  Okay, first put the hurdle in front of them that 
they must go to the library. (This is particularly a hurdle for children, 
when not in school, because they can't drive.)    Then, if the book(s) they 
want to read is already checked out, make them wait 1+ months until it 
returns.  Make them come back to the library to get it, and make them return 
it the same way.

See why some people DON'T read books?

You're misrepresenting form over substance.  Information is no more valuable 
or trustworthy on paper than on electrons.
