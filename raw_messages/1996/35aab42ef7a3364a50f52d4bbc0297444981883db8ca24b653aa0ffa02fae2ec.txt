    Let's also not confuse "capricious plug-pulling" with _daring_ the OWNER
of the machine the list is running on, and THE GUY WHO RUNS THE LIST to kick
your sorry racist ass off the list. He called your bluff, and any day now,
I expect him to prevent you from even posting in your own name. Not that that
will stop you.

    Like an parasite, you will infest any host you can find through any
possible vector.
