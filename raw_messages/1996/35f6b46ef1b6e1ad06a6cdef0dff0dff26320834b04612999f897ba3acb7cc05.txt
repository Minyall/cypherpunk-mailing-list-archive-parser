If this were a board for a commercial monopoly such as the AMA, I could 
understand (albeit not necessarily agree with) the dire warnings about 
the people pushing "Snake-Oil" products, if indeed what's being promoted 
are actual products.

The large FAQ sheets are pretty good, actually, like a mini-review of 
crypto issues, but what is the purpose of the dire warnings in relation 
to this forum, other than certain parties marking their territory?
