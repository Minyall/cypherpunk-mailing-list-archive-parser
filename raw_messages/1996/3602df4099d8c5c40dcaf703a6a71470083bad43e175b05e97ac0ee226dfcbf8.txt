I think you took my comment in a smaller scope than it was intended.

Use a nym.  If you want absolute privacy, work and study under a nym.
It's hardly difficult, you just have to start early.

The bottom line is if you want privacy you have to work for it.  You are
screwed the moment you give your information to anyone.  The first
transfer you have puts information into the system regardless of the legal
'protections' that say otherwise.

Treat your personal information as you would a trade secret.  Once it's
out, it's out.

Depending on someone else (university, employer, government,
phonecompany etc.) to protect data for you is, in my view, foolish.

Do it yourself.

It may seem extreme, but it is the only way to be certain.
