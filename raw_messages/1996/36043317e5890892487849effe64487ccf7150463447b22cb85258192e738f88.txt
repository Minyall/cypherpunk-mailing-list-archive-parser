Don't think I didn't consider it.  The conference was not attended by the
type on whom FUD would make much difference.  i.e., it was mostly law
enforcement and intelligence.  These were either quite sincere snickerings
among professionals, or EXCEEDINGLY well laid misinformation put into the
wrong circles to be of any effect.

Again, nothing specific, but implementation seemed to be the key.  I would
also note that I don't typically pay such ramblings much mind.  When
Stewart Baker tells someone IDEA and 3DES are indeed strong but
implementation weaknesses can cripple them, and this in the context of a
law enforcement ban, I tend to listen carefully.

I'm not saying panic, I'm saying perhaps another careful review is in
order.

Then the absolute wrong thing to do would be to suggest something that
might spur on review.  (Such as to draw attention to potential
implementation problems)

When both Stewart Baker and R. James Woolsey make similar comments, one
can't help but think that they were not pre-arranged.

Again, don't panic, just review.

Couldn't hurt, not one bit.
