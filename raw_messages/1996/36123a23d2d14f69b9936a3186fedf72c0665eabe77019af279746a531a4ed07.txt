               IBM will roll out several security initiatives next month
               that include a new way to build encryption into software
               and technology that could enable U.S. companies to
               export products with strong encryption algorithms.

and uhhh...

               IBM also will introduce several "key-recovery"
               technologies that could enable businesses to export
               encrypted data or software beyond the current 40-bit
               limit--without breaking U.S. government restrictions

and whoa...

               The sources also added that the technology may satisfy
               the requirement imposed by the U.S. government that it
               be able to access encrypted data on demand.
