   "Compuserve Halts Restriction on Sex Material. To Offer
   Blocking Software."

      Citing a desire to leave Internet censorship to
      individual tastes rather than government decree,
      Compuserve said yesterday that it would restore
      worldwide access to most of the 200 sex-related computer
      data bases it had recently blocked under pressure from
      German prosecutors.

      "By this action, Compuserve is intentionally providing
      obscene material to its subscribers, and they do so at
      their peril," said the Family Research Council. "We will
      encourage the Justice Department to prosecute Compuserve
      for violating CDA."

      The Justice Department has agreed not to prosecute
      anyone under the new law at least until tomorrow.
