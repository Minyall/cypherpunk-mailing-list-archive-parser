True, but we are not sure what is going to be covered by patents, 
obviously you must know that wemay have to treat some of the information, 
maybe all of the really iomportant stuff as trad secret material and try 
our best to protect it inm that manner - we cannot depend upon the 
paatents until we know what is going to be covered, if anything - so bull
back to you.

In time they will, because keymanagem,ent makes RSA systems unmanageable 
for large organizations - offer such a suystem to Merrill Lynch and be 
laughed out of the office - only a syustem such as ours resolve that 
problem!

Please refer to Dorthy Dennings excellent work on mathematical 
crytanalysis of wheeeled cryptosystems, and then imagine that every 
Nvelope, or suych wheeled system, was based on randomly selecting the 
prime number wheels, they do not have to be, but ours are - imagine that 
every message ever sent was sent using such an unique wheel system.

Are you sure that none of you are familiar with it? I have received many 
replies indicating that a large number of you are familiar with it, 
I refer you again to Denning's. Maybe you are not, but many are, 
apparently most from the replies that I am getting. Such systems are 
used at the highest level of government because they are the most secure 
systems available, excepting OTP's of course.

Who in the world said it was monalpabetic substitution -  we are talking 
about the random sequences for a single message - A random prime number 
wheel system, provides a far more secure system that RSA based systesms, 
- check it out, and do some investigating instead of talking. >

Not until we know what patent coverage is going to do and not to do.
