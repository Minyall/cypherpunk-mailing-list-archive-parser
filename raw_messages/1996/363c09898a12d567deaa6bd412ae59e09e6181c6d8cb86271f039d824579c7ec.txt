WaJo reports today on IBM's tiny pocket computer that
transmits data through the body -- to another body or to
a device such as a telephone. Invented by Tom Zimmerman,
formerly of the Media Lab, it can tell "anything you touch
who you are." Being shown at Comdex.

The body as a token. How to crack a human? Grab and 
squeeze out a pass phrase.
