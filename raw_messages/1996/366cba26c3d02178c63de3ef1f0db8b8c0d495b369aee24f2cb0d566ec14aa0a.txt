Uni,
SSH is used, as most security software is, by security aware individuals. I 
would love to say that means "widely", but unfortunately that isn't the 
case. For what is worth, SSH has my personal seal of approval. Use it. 

The UNIX version is freeware. The Windows version is commercially 
available at http://www.datafellows.com/
