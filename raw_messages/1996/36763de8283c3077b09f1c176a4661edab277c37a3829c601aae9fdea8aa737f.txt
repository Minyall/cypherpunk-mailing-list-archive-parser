The text of the message is from Vince Cate's arms-trafficker page.

	http://online.offshore.com.ai/arms-trafficker/

The page offers to send the message cc the president.  I presume
someone decided to forge a from line "cypherpunks@toad.com", and cc'd
to Herr Klinton.  (Unless the page would acheive this by entering this
as a from address of cypherpunks@toad.com in the box?)
