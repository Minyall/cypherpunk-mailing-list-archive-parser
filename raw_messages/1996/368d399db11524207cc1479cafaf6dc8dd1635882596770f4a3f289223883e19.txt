That's right. Because no reasonable person thinks they can convince Congress
or the Supremes otherwise. It isn't impossible, but energies are best spent 
elsewhere, like getting the Burns bill passed. 

Now none of us think wiretaps are a right and I presume Shabbir isn't 
much of a fan either or he wouldn't take the trouble of supporting 
something that makes wiretapping pointless (crypto). But we and he are 
not Washington and there lies all the difference.

Do remember, Jim, that just 'cause most of this list is libertarian 
doesn't mean that the rest of the world is. I'm thankful that they can 
occasionally agree with us horsepeople, despite the hysteria. Be polite.
