I seem to recall an announcement recently that Senator Burns is going to 
have a hearing "soon" on his crypto bill.  If that's true, I think it would 
make a good publicity scene if somebody (if possible someone giving 
testimony) were to show up with one of these NTT encryption chips, wave it 
around a bit, and say "I can bring this chip into the country, why can't I 
take it out again?"

Even if you can't get ahold of the real chip, any multi-pin bug will 
probably do for the sound/video-bite.
