Yes.  It's an obsolete cipher with a woefully small key.  Only
a catastrophic failure will cause the ABA to undergo religious
enlightenment.

I'm a firm believer in "work smart, not hard."  It might be interesting
to run a wiring diagram of DES through a superoptimizer and see how many
algebraic identities fall out.

An analytical crack that could be published on the Net would be far
more impressive than harnassing gigacycles on every available machine,
which might very well awe the gullible into thinking DES was difficult
to break.

I can see the headlines now.  "Cypherpunks show DES can withstand up 
to 9,000 Pentium-years of torture and keep on ticking."

Remember the Law of Unintended Consequences.
