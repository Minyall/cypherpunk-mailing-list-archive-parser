This not a hypothesis. A policy person from HP told me that

1. HP as well as TIS and other companies sell single DES products that 
they would like to be able to export.
2. He was directed by HP's marketing department to find a way to make 
that happen.
3. He therefore supports a GAK for export "compromise".
