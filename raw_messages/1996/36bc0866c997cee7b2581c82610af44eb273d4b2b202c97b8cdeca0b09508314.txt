I was thinking of something much simpler,
eg.:

	% remailer
	Enter passphrase: xxx
	Remailer started ...
	%

This of course assumes that the remailer runs as a process - if it doesn't
then there is no reason a 'remailer helper' cannot.

The only disadvantage of this is that the remailer cannot be rebooted
without a passphrase being entered, but then there are ways around this
(entering the passphrase remotely over a secure link etc., or more
sophisticated 'remote authorisation' systems).

The advantage of this is that the password is never on the disk,
only in memory (which will take serious (read "expensive") to extract).

I am amazed at all of the talk of smart cards etc., when all that is
really needed is a password entered at boot time.
