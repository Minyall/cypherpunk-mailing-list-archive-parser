THere are several schemes being put about that work along those lines,
with message formats being standardised, but not the actual values - you
should then pick your favourite rating agency, and they determine what is
rated and how.  This system creates a new market for rating agencies, and
it also helps parents to determine more precisely what *they* think is fit
for their children. 

There are pros and cons for both the single set of standard codes, and 
the niche model - a single set is likely to be just a little above the 
lowest common denominator; with niches kids whose parents who pick the CC 
rating agency aren't going to be getting talk.origins in their newsrc 
anytime soon.
