Guys, I think you are missing the point.  Even the people who approved
this know the bilingual education stuff is a crock.  It's just a way
of getting more money for Oakland's impoverished public schools, so
that they can do a better job of actually teaching these students
proper English.  No one is proposing teaching literature classes on
Ebonic texts or anything like that.

Now, you might argue that districts with low property tax revenues
don't deserve public schools, or that those public schools should be
openbly funded without playing strange games with bilingual education.
However, there's no point in arguing they shouldn't teach Ebonic as no
one intends to teach it.
