        aw... come on, guy.  in 25 years of the net, I've seen more 
    than a few go down and these are generally not so blatant.  

        up until 15 years ago when some 'strike panic in their 
    hearts' bleeding pansy Wall Street Journal liberal journalist 
    confused hacking with cracking, "hacker" had been a *badge of 
    honor*  

        hacking was a term used among profesionals to define someone
    much more than a programmer, or as one of the definitions put it:

            programmers program code,    hackers tweak code.

        so, take your trolling hooks back to your government leash; 
    go out and have some legitimate fun at your tender young age.

        cypherpunks are *not* crackers; this is a crytographic 
    and political issues relating to cryptography mailing list. 

        join one of the usenet groups such as alt.hacker or 2600 if 
    you want that kind of action.

        have a good day!
