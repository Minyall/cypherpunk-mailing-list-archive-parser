It's true that C++ is large and has many features, some obscure.  But the
fact is most of those features are actually very useful.  I suspect many
experienced C++ programmers do not like Java even though Java looks a lot
like C++ because they are so used to having those features in C++.  Take a
look at Victor's earlier post on this subject.

Portability is certainly one of the big problems of C++.  But it can be
done and should become easier in the future as the compilers standarize. 
If anyone has trouble compiling Crypto++, please send me a report so I can
help you figure out workarounds.  Also, send bug reports to the compiler
company if you think there are bugs in the compiler.
