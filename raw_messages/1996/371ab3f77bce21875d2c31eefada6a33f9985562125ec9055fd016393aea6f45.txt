I am sorry, but your message with the Subject:

was rejected by Perry Metzger's mail filter and will not be read by
him. This is likely because Perry decided to place you on his reject
list. Perry tends to clean out his filter lists every six months, so
you may be able to send him electronic mail again sometime in the
future.

If you absolutely need to contact Perry, please use means other than
electronic mail, or ask a third party to contact him on your behalf.

You will not receive further copies of this notice.
