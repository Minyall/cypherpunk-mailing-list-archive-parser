As a supplement to Joel McNamara's exemplary new 
TEMPEST page, and thanks to Steve Schear, we've put 
Van Eck's 1985 paper on TEMPEST at:

   http://jya.com/emr.pdf  (702 kb)

It's a finely detailed paper on EMR snooping with copious 
graphics. As Joel and Seline note, it may be purposely 
misleading on TEMPEST, (as appropriate to TEMPEST 
legends; Seline's may be bent as well, but who knows 
what the disinfoes know).

Read Joel's page for the bright light facts.
