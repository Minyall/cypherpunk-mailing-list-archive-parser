I fully agree with all of your comments, but, encrypted proxying issues
aside, what is wrong with SSL?  Is it because the encryption is for
the whole server, not individual users?

I gave the encrypted proxy idea some thought, and intend to do
it one day.  If someone is willing to run it, then I will certainly
do it.  Offers?

With regard to the local decryption idea, then I don't see this as
much of a problem.  How much interest is there in this?  We already
have something similar running, but it would still need a bit of work
to make more general.
