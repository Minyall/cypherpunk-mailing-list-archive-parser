Assuming the info is encrypted with one GAK key, yes.  There might be 
a series of keys, perhaps for each escrow agency, or an id-number 
that identifies the key.

Note that such methods will not allow much anonymitiy, since each 
communication must be escrowed.  The method used to id. the key can 
be used to trace a sender or receiver's id.
