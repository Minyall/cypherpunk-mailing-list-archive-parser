Has someone here managed to extract PostScript hardcopy of the CAPI from this
Web page? I tried earlier this evening and wound up with a miniature 
ecological disaster on my hands. The page says:

"For ease of online reading and printing, we've provided copies of this
lengthy document in Microsoft Word and Postscript formats."

I grabbed the ZIPped PostScript version and unZIPped it, which resulted in a
single file called "capiapp.ps". Making the wild assumption that this was
indeed a PostScript file, I sent it to the printer and forgot about it for a
while. 

An hour later I discovered a chaotic scene in the printer room, as the
printer had spewed about 1.5 reams of raw PostScript printouts. The output bin
had overflowed for a while, spraying paper in several directions. <heavy sigh>

As it turns out, the file unhelpfully begins with 
	%-12345X@JPL ENTER LANGUAGE=POSTSCRIPT
preceding the usual "%!PS-Adobe-3.0" line. Worse still, it appears that the
capiapp.ps file is actually a catenation of many PostScript files (one per
chapter?), each beginning with a version of this ensnarling line.

I could do some global search-and-replacing, etc., but I think I'll wait for
Microsoft to distribute a decent PS version of this document. Perhaps they
should consider not generating it with MS Word....

Grr!
