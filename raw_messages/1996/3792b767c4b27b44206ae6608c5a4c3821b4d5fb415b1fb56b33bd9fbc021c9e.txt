Deeyenda is not a virus, it's a hoax (like "Good Times" and "Irina")

A warning about a virus called Deeyenda is being distributed around the
internet. However, the virus does not exist and this is yet another example
of a growing trend: hoax virus alerts being mistakenly sent all around the
internet.

If you receive the warning about Deeyenda (which has many similarities to
another hoax, "Good Times") be sure to tell the person who sent the warning
to you that it is in fact a hoax, and they should take care not to pass the
hoax warning on to anyone else.

Please quit propogating this bullshit.
