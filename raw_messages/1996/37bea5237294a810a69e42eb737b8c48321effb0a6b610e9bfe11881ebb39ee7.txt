Yes, at first reading it also seems to forbid things like
``warez.diamond-lane.net''.

I hate being threatened, even if the suggested course of action is one
I do anyway.  I also see the piracy ``problem'' as one of economics.
If their software was really worth what they were trying to charge,
there wouldn't be so much theft of it.

Both sides are scum and it's sad to see people like Sameer caught in
the middle.
