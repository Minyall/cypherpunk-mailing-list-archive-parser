I don't mean to sound rude or insult you personally, but this is utterly  
absurd.  If everyone is paying for the software then the company would be  
making even MORE money.  Only a fool would want to make less money!!  If money  
wasn't important to these people they wouldn't be in the business of selling  
software in the first place!

Aside from putting a gun to people's heads, the only thing that lowers prices  
is competition.

That would render the entire scheme pointless.  It only takes _____ONE_____  
copy of the software to get out for the whole world to pirate it.
