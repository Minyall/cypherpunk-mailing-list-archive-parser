once again, I am confused why this micropayment thing is
considered so controversial and questionable to some. it
seems at the forefront of sensibility to me. clearly we
are struggling with different conceptions/preconceptions
of something that doesn't yet exist.

>As far as I'm concerned Micropayments as appealing to me as Data Mining. 

an interesting way to start off the essay, considering how much data
mining is starting to catch on and the positive, quantifiable
returns it is generating.

 I

can people "automagically" take money from your ATM card? nope. in the
same way, your microwallet will be secure. it will be even more secure,
because less money is involved.

there is no "convincing someone". people are using the idea of 
handing over money, of bills, etc-- all this makes no sense. it is
all handled at the transaction level. there is no subjectivity. the
vendor either received the cash or not. the cryptographic protocols
can ensure that the money is transferred. the data is not delivered
unless the payment is received. scam artists can be caught with
"better business bureau" type rating services.

the poster clearly suggested payment PER TIME as a limit.  a pretty
obvious concept, and easy to implement, don't you think? why does it
figure as one of your major objections?

it won't happen with micropayments either, because it will be *your*wallet*
that tells you when it is has an opportunity to pay. no one is dipping
into your wallet, metaphorically. the actions are always initiated by you.

somewhat. mainframes aren't totally the mark of the devil. don't you pay
your internet provider per hour? how many people do? isn't a Sun pretty
much equivalent/similar in processing power & capability to old mainframes?
you raise all kinds of objections that make no sense to me.

 I see plenty of ways in which this benefits the

the user is always free to go where a better vendor gives him what he
wants. because the user can now pay in tiny increments, he has enormous
increase freedom. he can move between different services far more readily.
no body is FORCING anyone to spend money. 

  Especially the power user.  I'm certainly not going to rent time

uh huh. what if over your lifetime it cost far less than you pay for
a shinkwrapped package? what if you only needed a quick compilation on
a system you don't normally use? I think you will begin to figure out
some advantages if you use your imagination to find them (instead of the
drawbacks)

you have this concept of "automated billing" that simply doesn't fit. people
know how much they are being charged. the payment is UNDER THE COMPLETE
CONTROL OF THE PAYER, NOT THE BILLER. this simple misconception seems to
underly a lot of the micropayment objections I've been seeing.

or, it may be that entire new industries spring up because the software
companies are better able to be compensated for their work from skittish
consumers. people may be more free about spending micropayments than 
buying shrinkwrapped software. psychologically I think micropayments
are far more appealing in some ways.

admittedly some things have to be in place: a high speed network, and
other infrastructure ideas. it isn't totally feasible today in cyberspace,
but large parts of it are and are already being implemented (chaum's
digicash)

false, imho. imagine that I can buy only the shows I want to watch, and it comes
out to less than my $20 monthly cable bill. economically this is perfectly
sensible. people want to pay for what they watch. you seem to think that
micropayments means "everything costs more". a strange assumption. what if
I assume, "everything costs less" because billing costs, which other
posters have pointed out are so enormous, are vaporized?

it is true that some industries will change and meld into other forms
with this new revolutionary form of payment.  welcome to the concept of
 an economy in which anything that is stagnant tends to die.

   No matter how stupid you may

right. shows that are not watched are going to go extinct. why should
advertisers fund them? you think that advertisers have to be fooled
to pay money to a show?

 The

that's correct. why do you suggest it would be an infeasible apocalypse?
it might be an apocalypse of old concepts, but it isn't infeasible.

false, imho. again the consumer maintains complete control. in a sense
they have far greater control. if they don't like a company they
can go somewhere else after only spending a micropayment instead of
a macropayment. you may find that companies increase their level of
service and customer satisfaction. but there will probably bogus uses
that apparently you will gravitate towards, based on your seeming
preference for them.

imagine shareware authors getting cash for their programs based on their
actual use. imagine artists and writers bypassing corporate monoliths
and marketing their work to the public directly, bypassing the enormous
scrape-off that these self-perpetuating bureacracies snarf.

you seem to start from the assumption, "businesses are out to shaft the
little guy". well, that can be true whether you have micropayments
or not. I doubt micropayments would make it any worse. it won't solve
the problem (I agree there is a great greed in places) but it may actually
make it far more difficult for companies to shaft people, once you think
about it. remember, the consumer has total control. how can you get
shafted when you have total control?
