Note that Mickey Kantor is doing _exactly_ what has been predicted on 
this very list: he is using the (very limited) response the US received 
from other countries by strongarming said countries into supporting a 
pro-GAK position to manipulate the American public into accepting GAK by 
pretending the US must respond to the requests of the world market.

--Lucky, who hopes everybody on this list will vote for Harry Browne.
