The problem is not with PGP but with the PGP message formatsa.  With
the current message formats you need to know the size of data before
you can output the header that precedes it.  As a result, whole
messages must somehow be buffered before PGP can output them.

The fix is to create new, one-pass packets, which will allow PGP to
generate messages in a single pass.  These new packet formats are
still in the design stage and will probably not be supported in PGP
3.0.
