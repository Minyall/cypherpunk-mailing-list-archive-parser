The reason for the quiet may be twofold. First, I and many others delete
unread list messages with out subjects. Second, remailer-in-a-box does not
really exist. Mixmaster, and most of the other remailers are fairly easy to
set up for anyone with UNIX experience. I run Mixmaster + Ghio + reorder
scripts.
