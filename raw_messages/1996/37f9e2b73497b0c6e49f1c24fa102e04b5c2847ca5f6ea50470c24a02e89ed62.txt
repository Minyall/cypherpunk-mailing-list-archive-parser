Do we just ignore the fact that these lists are outdated within
seconds of release?  Even if they can be automatically distributed
via the net (maybe by forcing your Web browser to use their page
as your home page and automagically downloading to you a new update),
the list will still be outdated by days or weeks.  This is one of
the big problems with all of these types of filters.

Gee, is this real or simulated violence?  I don't suppose I can
go surfing over to the Mortal Kombat website now...

What about Co$?  They might be a cult, depending upon who you ask.
And, what about us harmless, life-affirming Witches?  The name
alone will probably trigger a lot of filters.


I think the point of all this is that unless/until a "smart" filter can
be devised, there can't / won't be a good filtering package that will
please everyone, or even a majority of someones.  Good luck.
