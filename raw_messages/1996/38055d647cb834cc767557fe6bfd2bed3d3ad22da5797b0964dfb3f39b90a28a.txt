Hi.

There is a known problem in the PGP 2.6.2 distribution.  In order to
compile it for Linux/ELF, you will need to make a change to the
sources.  The quick change is to add "ASMDEF=-DSYSV" to the Linux make
rule in the makefile.  However this will not allow it to compile under
Linux/a.out anymore.

The proper fix, which is detailed on the PGP FAQ, Buglist, Fixes, and
Improvements Page is to modify 80386.S and zmatch.S to look for the
symbol __ELF__ in addition to SYSV.  This page, by the way, is
available at this URL:

Enjoy!
