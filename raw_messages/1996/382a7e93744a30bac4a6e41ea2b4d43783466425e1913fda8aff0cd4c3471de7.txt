Hi again.

Is there anybody that have any idea about a color setting that would 
make it more difficult to detect by a Tempest attack?
(I assume that Tempest cannot discriminate between various color guns 
and signals in the monitor...  Maybe I am completely wrong...)


Like, for example : 

background: G255 B0   R0
      text: G0   B255 R0

Theses colors are not that bad to look at.  I realize that Tempest is 
sensitive to actual electrical values rather than logical values.

Anybody has any idea about settings that could fool Tempest?

Crypto Relevancy:
I was writing a passphrase file to later be secsplitted and I suddenly got 
all sweaty and nervous ...  :-)

Ciao all
