I agree with John's decision.

As others have already pointed out, this list (T.A.Z.) exists
because of the generous nature of our host. It quite literally
exists in his home as I recall. (Toad Hall)

John made numerous requests for Dimitri to be polite to his other
guests and was scorned for his attempt. John then removed him from
his residence.

Dimitri is now standing on the virtual sidewalk outside where he
can continue to shout his insults, since as John knows well, his
actions are no more than a "speedbump". Dimitri can get a list feed
from a number of other sources, and can in fact continue to post.

But John has made his point, and his actions hardly constitute
censorship.
