A couple of days ago there were reports that the NSA was considering 
easing up a bit on export restrictions.  Is the Lotus Notes approach what 
they were talking about?

I suppose it's a good thing that they're starting to see the value of at
least paying lip service to relaxing the rules, but that's all this is,
lip service.  It's the worst of both worlds, the security of a 40 bit key
with the spectre of gak thrown in to boot.
