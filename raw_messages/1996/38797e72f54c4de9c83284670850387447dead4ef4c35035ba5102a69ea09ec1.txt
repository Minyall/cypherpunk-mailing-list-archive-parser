I guess this sort of thing does involve extradition rules. For example,
Sweden has a Nazi party, which would offend Germans, who can, I'm
sure, see them on TV leave alone on the Net. Sweden's Information
(or something) Ministry has said that by law anyone can start
a party, but if the Nazis due something illegal (such as killing
people, or threatening them) the courts will handle it.

And Norway is not even _in_ the EU.
