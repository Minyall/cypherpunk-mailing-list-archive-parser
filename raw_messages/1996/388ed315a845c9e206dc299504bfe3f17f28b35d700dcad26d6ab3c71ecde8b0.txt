I often have the same difficulty when speaking with
Objectivists.  They define "censorship" as "silencing the
speaker by force", which is a fine and useful definition, but
suppose we want to talk about a similar phenomenon which does
not involve force?  For example, the magnate who owns all the
newspapers, television stations, bookstores and movie theatres
in a small town decides that never again will homosexuality be
publically mentioned in any of these venues.  Force?  No.
"Censorship"?  Not by _that_ definition, but what _is_ it?


We need a new word, or else we have to continue using
"censorship" to mean both of those things.  I sometimes use
"violent-censorship" and "non-violent-censorship" in
conversation.


As long as we continue to try to overload "censorship" we will
waste much of our dialogue energy on semantic quibbling or pure
misunderstanding.
