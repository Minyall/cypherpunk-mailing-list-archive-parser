It's a big difference.  Can you set up your own mailing list? Yes.  Can you
go elsewhere? Yes.  Can Mr. Vulis send email directly to list-members anyway?
Yes.

Can you do the same if the government runs it? No.   Can you set up your own
list/printing press* if the state won't publish your ideas? No.

One could apply a similar rationale to socialism - after all, it may seem
like an extension of "love your neighbor" to take care of their needs, which
is certainly a laudable goal.  That's not the problem.  The problem is when
it becomes mandated *with no alternatives*.
