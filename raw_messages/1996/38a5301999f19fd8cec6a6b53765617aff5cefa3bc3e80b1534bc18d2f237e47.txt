	In other words, majordomo is broken. I should have suspected as much,
given the weird way headers turn up compared to all other mailing list
programs. Can that be reconfigured by the list owner? I may be starting up a
list (on c2.org) sometime (after I finish 3 papers, an oral presentation, and
some finals), and what I've got available is majordomo. Curing this problem
would be good.
