"9th Amendment

The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to
deny or disparage others retained by the people."

Nothing in here about ITAR.

"10th Amendment

The powers not delegated to the United States shall not be construed to extend
           ^^^
to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United
States by citizens of another State or by citizens or subjects of any foreign
state."

Nothing in here about ITAR.

On the other hand:

"We the People of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union,
establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common
defence,"

...

"The Congress shall have power

...

To regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states,
and with the Indian tribes;

...

To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into
execution
the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by the Constitution in the
government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof."

Looks like ITAR is covered there.

So don't (as the Russians say) try to teach your Grandmother how to suck eggs.
