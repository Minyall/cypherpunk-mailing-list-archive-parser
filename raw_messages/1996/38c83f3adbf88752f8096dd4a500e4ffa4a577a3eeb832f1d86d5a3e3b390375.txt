Horrifying eh? Hmm I found this just a bit to priceless to resist.
I guess it falls under the old 'but I'll defend your right...' way
of looking at things...

In any case, here you go, this is the latest contribution of software
from Dimitri to the values of freedom of expression and non-censoring
& all that blather.

And what follows, is Dr. Dimitri, defender of freedom of expression,
champion of the anti-censors on the net, posting code to the world to
engage in exactly those activities that everyone has been ranting about
as being so utterly "horrifying (forged cancellations etc)" as it were.

Amusing to say the least.
