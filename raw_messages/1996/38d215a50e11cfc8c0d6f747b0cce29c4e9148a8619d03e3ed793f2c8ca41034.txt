Thanks.

I know the author rather well, and he assures me he dashed off this
satirical piece in about as much time as he takes to write his normal
articles. He tells me that once he had "grokked" the inimitable (not) style
of Don Wood, it was easy to write a screed that echoed Wood's wackiness.

Of course, for people who read satire on this list, the initials at the end
are a clue. But don't publish who you think it is, as KVFP doesn't want a
lawsuit from Wood for hurting Wood's feelings.
