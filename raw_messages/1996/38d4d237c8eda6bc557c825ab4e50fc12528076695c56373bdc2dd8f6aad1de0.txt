But, Dale, that's the whole point of censorship: people like Alan Olsen
and John Gilmore and Jim Ray aren't satisfied when they've killfiles a
source of noise they consider annoying so it doesn't bother them anymore.
They feel compelled to silence it altogether. They claim altruistically
that they don't want the noise to bother anyone else, such as the clueless
newbies who keep subscribing to this mailing list and don't know how to
use mail filters. (Sandy Sanford's concern for them was soooo touching...)
