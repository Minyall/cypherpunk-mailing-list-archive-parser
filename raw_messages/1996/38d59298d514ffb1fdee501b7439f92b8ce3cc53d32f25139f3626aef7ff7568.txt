That one makes more sense.  If the salt is completely random, then an attacker
will not be able to use a replay attack.  Since the password is hashed, there
is no way to find it out given the output.  This does require the server to
maintain a list of cleartext passwords, but that's not any worse then Kerberos
which requires a KDC store everyone's DES key.
