Course in 1951 they tried the same thing against Commies with the Smith Act.
Even authorized concentration camps for 'em and everything.  But it didn't
work.  We were still up to our asses in Commies even with the Act.  They
even captured the White House eventually.  I don't think the anit-terroism
act will be any more effective.
