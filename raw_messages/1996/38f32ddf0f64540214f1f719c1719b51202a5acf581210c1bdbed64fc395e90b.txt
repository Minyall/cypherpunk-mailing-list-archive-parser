Federal Register: December 26, 1996 [Pages 68044-68045]:

The Federal Reserve Board solicits comment concerning the public 
availability and use of social security numbers and other sensitive 
identifying information about consumers.

The FRB, and the FTC, is to conduct a study to determine the 
availability to the public of sensitive identifying information about 
consumers, the possibility that such  information could be used for 
financial fraud, and the potential for fraud or risk of loss, if any, 
to insured depository institutions.

Testimony at a recent FTC hearing highlighted how easy it is to obtain
identifying information about a consumer and to use that information to
fraudulently receive credit in the consumer's name, a practice often 
referred to as "identity theft."
