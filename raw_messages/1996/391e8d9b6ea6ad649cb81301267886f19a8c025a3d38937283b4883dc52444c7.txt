If you have some guess about the algorithm being used, you can try it,
and if they've chosen a weak algorithm, you may be successful.

For instance, if they use a simple Linear Congruential Multiplicative PRNG,
        X[n+1] = ( a * X[n] + c ) mod m 
and if you've got a list of 600 one-time passwords, you can get a good
approximation to m by taking the largest password and looking for
prime numbers slightly higher than it.  You can then try solving
for a and c.

On the other hand, if the account number is large, and each X[n+1] is
the low-order 6 digits of Y'[n+1] = MD5(Y[n]) and Y[0] = account number,
then it'll be much harder to reverse-engineer.
