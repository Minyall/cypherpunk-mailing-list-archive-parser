I'm hearing even more strategy, it would seem.  I don't see the 
relevance of how govt. behaves (i.e., like a bad uncle who hangs around 
too long and molests the kids, etc.) to who's responsible.  If you live 
in the U.S., that govt. is your agent, carrying out your 
representatives' instructions, and paid with your tax dollars.  Unless 
and until this becomes a literal dictatorship (and there is a valid 
argument that it applies even then), you are responsible for whatever 
your paid agents do, from the street cop to the top politico.

It's too bad your fellow citizens shirk their duty and watch TV instead, 
but issuing the above kinds of denial doesn't take the blood off of your 
hands or mine.  Now maybe it would take God (for example) to judge 
whether you, I, or Joe Blow is more guilty, for lack of participation or 
some other citizen crime, but you can't put all the blame on your hired 
agents for their crimes, when you know very well what kinds of things 
they do, and you continue to fund them.  You have to be considered an 
accessory, at least.
