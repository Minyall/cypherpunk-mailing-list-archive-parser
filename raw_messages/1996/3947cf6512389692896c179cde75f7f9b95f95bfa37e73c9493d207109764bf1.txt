Ern - This is a serious question.  When does your child have the right to
say that what you think is good for her/him is crap and then proceed to
ignore you?  IMHO, this question is the major question for the parental
rights at all costs people.

It is best if your children and you can reach broad enough mutual respect
so you can work this issue out informally.  However, I personally know a
lot of cases where the best didn't happen.  The teen-parent wars were quite
spectacular.
