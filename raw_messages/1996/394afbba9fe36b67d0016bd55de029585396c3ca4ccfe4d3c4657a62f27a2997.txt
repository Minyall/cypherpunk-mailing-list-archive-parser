    BZZT!!! wrong answer since 1981 on december 4  when president reagan
signed it into Executive Order #12333  TLA's(those intelligence
agencies having strictly offshore charters CIA,NSA others) have been permitted
to operate domestically in cases of National Security(or involvement with 
persons suspected of being agents for foreign entities) and Drug War issues.
Formerly it was simply illegal but since the intel community had taken
such a hard hit during the church subcommittee hearings of the 1970's
the new tactic was to acquire legitimacy for black ops on domestic fronts
thus the above EO was shoved under reagans nose quickly...

The reference to the above EO may be found in the "CIA off Campus" booklet
by the Bill of Rights Foundation on page 134-135
ISBN 0-89608-404-3 (c) 1991 by Amy Chen Mills and the Bill of Rights
foundation.
Get it its a fascinating read!!..

   cheers
