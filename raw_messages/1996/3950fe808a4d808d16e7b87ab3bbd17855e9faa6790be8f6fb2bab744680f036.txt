    This is nothing new.  800, 900 and some other similiar numbers have 
been able to subscribe to a service called Automatic Number 
Identification (ANI) for many years now.  While it is related to Caller 
ID, it doesn't operate with necessarily the same restrictions/options.  
Many companies use ANI in addition with special software to actually look 
at where you are calling from and either pull up your records, transfer 
you to a region specific extension, etc.

    I've heard rumors that some carriers pull their ANI information from 
CID thereby enabling you to block it just like you would the normal 
signal.  Other methods of remaining anonymous can be achieved by going 
through long distance companies that don't pass on ANI information or 
paying companies who offer you ANI blocking dial-throughs.
