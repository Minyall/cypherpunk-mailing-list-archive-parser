Further, the more interesting aspects were what Freeh said under
interactive questioning by the Senators. He artfully avoided
many of their direct questions, but found himself on the rocks
on others.

He seemed rather surprised at the tenor & thrust of the questioning;
He could not have thought this would be a cake-walk but he sure
acted that way.

The transcript will be interesting reading.
