I've set up a distribution list for NOISE.SYS. If you want to receive
periodic announcements about new versions, bugs, related utilities, etc.,
reply to <wlkngowl@unix.asb.com> with the subject "add noise.sys-list"

(NOISE.SYS is a crypto-quality RNG device for MS-DOS, similar to the
random.c implementation for Linux. The latest version is 0.5.6-Beta.)
