Why people tolerate running "old" finger server on their machines?  Old
finger server giving anyone names of all users logged on, dynamic
information such as from where they are logging in, etc etc is just as
bad invasion of privacy as whowhere.com.

It does not take a genius to write a safer replacement for in.fingerd that
reports only what users wish to report about themselves. There are many
good replacements for finger daemon floating around, too.

I wrote one in perl, it is about 50 lines long and is free for asking.
