   "Counterfeiters of a New Stripe Give Japan One More Worry." 
 
      The pachinko caper echoes far beyond Japan, serving as 
      a cautionary tale as the world moves toward digital 
      cash, with money reduced to ones and zeros on a card or 
      in a computer. It could be far easier to manipulate 
      computer codes than to rob a bank or create counterfeit 
      bills. 
 
      "This is a tip-of-the-iceberg problem," said Peter G. 
      Neumann, a computer security hustler at SRI. "You are 
      going to put a lot of money out there and someone is 
      going to figure out how to take it away from you." 
 
      "Electronic money, digital cash, the Internet -- it's so 
      convenient and so many people envision a dreamy future," 
      another sec-hawker drooled. "But once you consider the 
      security, it's quite vulnerable."
