I have seen this before in a number of companies...  I think it is becuase
alot of management is trained to think of things in the positive.  To try
and put the best spin on any situation...  On the other hand, people of a
technical bent tend to think of things as problems to be solved.  Such an
outlook is seen as negative.  The two outlooks seem to conflict on many
levels. Such outlooks from management tend to delay resolution of problems
until it is too late...
