It is legal to export full DES, in binary form, to banks outside the
US.  In other words, a company in the US can create a financial
package that uses DES, even for encryption, and sell it to a bank
outside the US.  THe caveat is that DES can only be used to encrypt
the financial transactions, not arbitrary data.

I hope this helps.
