There seems to be a point being missed in this thread. :(

This was not a 'personal' interview. The paper was not interested in Ms. Dyson's views on anonymity on the internet because she seemed like a nice person. The only reason she was interviewed is because of her position with the EFF as chairwoman.

Ms. Dyson knows this, the reporter knows this, the paper knows this, and so should everyone else.

Under such circumstances this interview should be seen as an 'official' statement from the chairwoman of the EFF. Trying to call this a 'personal' interview and not reflecting 'official' EFF policy is just plain old spin-doctoring. Ms. Dyson should have had more common sense than this.

These statements made by her are akin to the chairman of Philip Morris saying that he believe that cigarette smoke cause cancer but that's just his opinion and not the 'official' company position on it. Who would believe it? How long would he still have his job after making such a statement?

The EFF should make an official statement of their position on this issue and if it is not the same as Ms. Dyson's she should be removed from the board. IMHO this is to important of an issue for the EFF to try to ignore.
