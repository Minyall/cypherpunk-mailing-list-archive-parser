There's a bug in the API in NOISE.SYS v0.5.5. I've uploaded a fix as
noise056.zip to ftp.funet.fi, so keep an eye out for it.

The fix is easy. In the file "multiplex.inc" you'll see the  @ReturnOk LABEL
where it restores the ds, si and bp registers... at the @ReturnErr hook it
only fixes the ds and si registers. Add a "pop bp" appropriately and remake
the file.

Sorry for the inconvenience.
