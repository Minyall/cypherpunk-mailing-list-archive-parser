Frankly, newspapers sound like too much work. Just post them here. That
should get their attention. It worked for Ian. :-).

Sort of like the old Alaskan bumper sticker: "Eat caribou. 10,000 wolves
can't be wrong."

Well, maybe it's a non-sequitur. But, I did think "1,000 Cypherpunks"
before remembering said bumpersticker from my childhood. Which is close
