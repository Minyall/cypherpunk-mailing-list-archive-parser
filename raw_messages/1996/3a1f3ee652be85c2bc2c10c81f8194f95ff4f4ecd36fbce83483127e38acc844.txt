IPsec will not change the role of firewalls.  It will change some
technical details about them.

Firewalls do a couple of things:

	Enforce a policy boundary between us & them.  Reduce the
number of systems to be 'well secured' (This is because really
securing a machine is tough, and often involves sacrifices of
useability.) Provide job security/ass covering (see also, satisfy
auditors.)

	The fact that some traffic passing through is encrypted will
not change any of this.  Only allowing traffic to people who provide a
signature is only useful for some things.  Besides, there will always
be shitty protocols, like NFS, yp, SMTP, etc that need a firewall to
protect them.  Legacy systems are with us forever.  (I was in a
meeting last Thursday where we discussed how to handle a Sun3 that
needs to be a router in a CIDR environment.  No option to upgrade this
box for complex reasons.  I bring it up to illustrate the persistance
of legacy systems.)
