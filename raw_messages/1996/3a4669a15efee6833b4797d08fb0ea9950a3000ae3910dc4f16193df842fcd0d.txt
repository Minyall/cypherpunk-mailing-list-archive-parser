Take a look in the Forbes 400 listings of th of the most wealthy 
Americans. I'm sure you can find a copy at your local library. If not, 
there's a copy somewhere under my sofa, next to an old tennis ball 
covered with dog spit.

The tennis ball, that is. Although one of the Hunts has a few teeth
