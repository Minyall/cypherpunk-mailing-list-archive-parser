The current nymservers offer pretty good security.  The only problem is they
are vulnerable to traffic analysis.  If an attacker wants to find out whether
a particular person is using a pseudonym, he could send a lot of messages to
the nym and if the suspected user receives that same amount of messages in
anonymously remailed traffic.  This would confirm the attacker's suspicion.
There are a few ways to protect against this.  One way is for a person to
request that email stored on the nym server be delivered.  The email could be
delivered as one large encrypted message.  The user could also request each
email individually, but this does have some drawbacks.  Delivering each message
as it is received is a Bad Thing.
