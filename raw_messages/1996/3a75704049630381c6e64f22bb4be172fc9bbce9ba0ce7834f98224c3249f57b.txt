I was in L.A. County Court in 1986, and I noticed a TV reporter in the 
bleachers.  The judge gave an injunction to some neighbors that their 
neighbors could not sell drugs, sleep on the lawn, etc., and it became 
big news then, since nobody had ever thought of that before.

So it looks like the law is evolving....
