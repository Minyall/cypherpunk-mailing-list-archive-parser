	Want to bet how fast they'll be mail-bombed? Cops on the net are _not_
popular, no matter what they're doing. This fact is especially true when
there's no actual harm taking place (unlike, say, spamming) - the harm has
_already_ taken place by the time the material is on the Internet. Should we
ban films with violence because they _might_ be snuff films?
