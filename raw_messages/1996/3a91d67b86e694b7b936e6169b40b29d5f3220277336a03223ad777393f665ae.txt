        There is a new and VERY dangerous virus called the HAZ-MAT virus!
it fucks up the sectors on your hd, and really messes up the partition
tables.  It does this once a week, picking a random time to do it.  99.9% of
virus scanners and other antivirus programs will not recognize it, for it is
a totally new strain, using a never before seen code.... Be warned!  The
HAZ-MAT virus usually resides in JPG, and GIF files... once the files are
viewed, the virus takes effect.
scan all images upon download!
