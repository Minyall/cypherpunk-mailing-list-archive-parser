I'm very grateful to Jim Choate for all his traffic in support of my freedom
of speech, but the above isn't quite right. So far I've been able to submit
posts and have them broadcast to the list. That doesn't mean that I'm welcome
to do that (I think John Gilmore made it perfectly clear that I'm not by
censoring me) but he hasn't technically prevented me from doing that.

John Gilmore has the right and the technical ability, but probably not the
balls to censor me further. He has no credibility to lose.
