Syndicated shows are scheduled by the local broadcasters. They decide 
when and if to run them. It only makes sense that if you have control 
over your material but are at the mercy of the broadcaster, that is not a 
sound business position to remain in.

Maybe in your book, but your above statement demonstrates that: a) you know 
very little about how the TV broadcast market works, b) you are confusing 
the issue of business with political stance, c) that you assume to 
understand what makes a person financially successful, when infact you have 
said nothing here to demonstrate such knowledge, and d) your bank account 
is much smaller than his, otherwise you wouldn't piss and moan about 
Limbaugh's financial status in the first place.

Maybe in the UK, but in the US there is the little thing called motive. 
It either helps or hurts one's final outcome in the court system.

Well, that's your take on politcs, and a very narrow view that it is.

Obviously there is more to American Politics than Pat Buchanan, and 
frankly I would doubt very seriously he had anything to do with Fascism 
and the US Government. In a former life, he was a reporter and columnist 
in the press (one of the self-anonted guardians of free speech). He never 
set policy, just did his journalistic spin on it.

If anything, Buchanan is reminicient of the protectionist days of the 
1930's prior to US entry into WWII. Back then Hitler was a European 
problem that got out of hand quickly. And, if it wasn't for the fact that 
France and Great Brittain tried to beggar Germany after Kaiser Willhelm 
surrendered, Hitler and the NAZI's may not have come to power. 

I would suggest you study your American history more carefully and 
without the grandstanding and speeches of the revisionists who pass 
themselves off as educators and political analysts.
