Chris Owen has written an essay about Hubbard's support of the racist South
African govt.  

http://www.demon.co.uk/castle/audit/aprtheid.html

He quotes Hubbard as writing:

"Just as individuals can be seen by observing nations, so we see the African
tribesman, with his complete contempt for truth and his emphasis on
brutality and savagery for others but not himself, is a no-civilization."
