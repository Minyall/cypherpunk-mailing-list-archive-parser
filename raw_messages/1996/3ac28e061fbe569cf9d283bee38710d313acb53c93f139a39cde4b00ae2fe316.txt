Subject says it.

Idle talk can wait until legislation doesn't matter... and it won't 
when there's freely available source and binaries for a secure 
telnet, a private/anonymizing web browser/server/proxy, terminal and 
bbs programs, file transfers, etc.  I think these are at the moment a 
bit more important than digital cash (when these exist, e-cash will 
follow).

There's lots of work to be done.

Whatever happened to "cypherpunks write code"? it seems that various 
governments are writing laws a lot faster...
