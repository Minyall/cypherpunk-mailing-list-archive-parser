I was invited to the digicash API design meeting precisely to make sure it
could be used in remailers. It will not be using the current API. The
problem is that Mixmaster requires exact knowledge of the size of every
object in the message, to maintain constant message size. I could set aside
room for one, two, three coins, but there is no guarantee that the payment
will be made with only that many coins. The current API is going to be high
level. It will does not allow the program to know anything about the
internals of the payment. I need to be able to specify payment of amount X
using no more than N coins. As soon as I have that level of control, you
will see postage in Mixmaster.
