Greetings all,
  Does anyone know if the 1.4a version works correctly with Win95?  If not,
is there an updated version?  If not, will there be one anytime soon?  If
not, will PGPLIB (aka PGP3.0) provide a similar function?  If not... heck!
 
                                                     G.C.G.
