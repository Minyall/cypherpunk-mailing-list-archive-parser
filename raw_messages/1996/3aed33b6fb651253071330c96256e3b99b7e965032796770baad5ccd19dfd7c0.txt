	An unpublished algorithm mean that it's worthless snakeoil that
depends on obfuscation until it is successfully reverse engineered (which
you just set yourself up as a prime target) and then all of your chumps
(ahh..  clients) get raped.  I wouldn't even look at it and would advise
all of my clients to avoid it like the plague...
