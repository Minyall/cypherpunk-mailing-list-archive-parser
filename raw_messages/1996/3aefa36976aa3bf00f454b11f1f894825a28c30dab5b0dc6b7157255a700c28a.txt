If the system is *voluntary* and I do not *agree* to participate, then I
*cannot* be breaking any "rules".

Which they will, and presumably already do.  Therefore, your proposal
does not and cannot hamper criminals.  Therefore, your proposal only
hampers law abiding citizen-units' access to uncompromised crypto.

No institution can expect compliance from a sector of society that,
by definition, does not agree to or follow the social contract.
Therefore, any and all such attempts to do so must be for the purpose of
controlling those citizen-units that do abide the social contract.  To
claim otherwise is absurd.

Registration plates do not "stop criminals".  Locks do not "stop
criminals" (although they might slow a criminal down).  Neither will
compromised crypto "stop criminals".  But all the above impinge on my
liberty.  Am I to give up yet another freedom?
