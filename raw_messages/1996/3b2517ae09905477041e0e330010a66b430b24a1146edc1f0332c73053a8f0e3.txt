This "pre-encryption" program is not a virus. It attaches to the
keyboard driver and captures keystrokes from the keyboard as they are
typed -- BEFORE they can be encrypted by the application encryption
software. First Virtual scientists note that credit a check-digit. A
greater danger is that passwords are also as easily captured.
