Given that the free market rule is "he who has the money makes the
rules", please explain how anything less than "subsidized speech" (as
you put it) is anything close to free speech?

[For those who's assumptions rule their perception: I am *not* arguing
that all speech should be subsidized. I am merely pointing out that
the organization that is spending the money to broadcast is
controlling the speech, hence it is *not* free speech in terms of
freedom or cost.]
