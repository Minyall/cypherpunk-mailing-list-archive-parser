Have you heard any reports of anyone successfully downloading it
period?  Netscape always times out in the middle of a download.  I
think the server is so overloaded that it's actually impossible to
download the software.

I sure wish there were an ftp site overseas somewhere, then I could
actually get the damned thing.
