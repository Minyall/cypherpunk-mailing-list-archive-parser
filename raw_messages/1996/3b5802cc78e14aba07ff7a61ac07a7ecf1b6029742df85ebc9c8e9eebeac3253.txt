It's been a while since this went 'round, and my memories are hazy of
the details.

Isn't it the case that there are loopholes or explicit exceptions in
crypto export regulations that allow American businesses to supply
their overseas operatives with tools for secure communication back
home?  We were discussing today some stuff about our web server, and
there's some desire to provide secure access for our sales people to
internal junk.  Nobody was sure whether it'd be OK for our people in
the Evil Empire (Europe) to have the 128-bit-RC4 Netscape for that
purpose.

(If so, I wonder if the exceptions apply to other munitions too?
Like, maybe it's OK to take a medium-range missile overseas if you're
just going to use it to blow up your manager's office :-)

(No, I don't hate my manager.)
