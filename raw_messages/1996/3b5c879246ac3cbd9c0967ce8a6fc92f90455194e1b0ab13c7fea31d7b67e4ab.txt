The web of trust just certifies that the key belongs to someone.  If
you'd read to the end of the message, you would have seen that I was
not complaining about the key certification process in PGP.  At issue is
NOT whether a key can be trusted to belong to someone, but whether or
not random people should be able to tag others' PGP keys with crap.

What I want to prevent is some person I dislike uploading his
signature on my key (particularly if he adds another ID to my key and
signs that).

How would you like it if I added a new ID to your key containing sort
of insult, certified that ID, and uploaded the new signature to the
key servers.  Alternatively, what if I uploaded 5 "vanity" keys in
your name to the PGP key servers.  Most software would download one
key, fail to certify the signature, and therefore not allow someone to
communicate with you even if that person could have verified your real
key.

I don't understand what the purpose of a centralized key server is,
when the owner of a public key should be the one to control what
certificates and tags are given out with his/her PGP key.
