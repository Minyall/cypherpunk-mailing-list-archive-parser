Just remember that it would be far better to make the crack look easy, than 
to make it look hard.  quantity 9000+, $1,000 Pentiums for a year (plus 
maybe $500,000 in electricity) looks "hard."   1000 dedicated chips (whether 
they be FPGA or custom or...) for 1.5 months or so looks "easy."

The latter crack looks far more likely to be repeated.  The former is 
OBVIOUSLY a stunt.
