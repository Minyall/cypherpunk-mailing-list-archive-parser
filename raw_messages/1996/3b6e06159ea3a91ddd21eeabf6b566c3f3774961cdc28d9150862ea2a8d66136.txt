July 11th, a San Francisco television reporter called me. He wants to
broadcast a story about "crackers". He'd like someone who can describe,
on-the-air, examples of what crackers can do. In particular, he'd like
someone who can provide a demonstration.
 
Do you want to be on Bay Area TV? If not, whom in the Bay Area do you
recommend? This could be a chance for you to publicize your favorite
security flaws in voice box systems, or whatever.
 
The reporter wants to run this story during the week of July 15th. If
interested, please contact me as soon as possible. The reporter uses
telephones, not e-mail, so I'll need your phone number. Thanks.
 
See you in the future,
Andre Bacard
