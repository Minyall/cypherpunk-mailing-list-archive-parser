Shell is now marketing a stored-value card in $25, $50, and $100 face
denominations.  The $100 card retails for $94 right now.  I'm not sure if
that discount will be a long-term thing or if it's just to get people
hooked.  Anyway, the card can be purchased anonymously for cash and can be
used to buy anything at Shell.  I like to use the automated
pay-at-the-pump gizmos to save time but I don't like to leave a digital
footprint behind on my credit card statement for Louis' Legions to peruse,
so I think the stored-value card is a step forward for privacy.

Anybody know if these cards are useable overseas?
