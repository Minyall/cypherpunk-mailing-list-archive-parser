If you eliminate all repeating byte sequences, such as 00 00 or 7F 7F, you
will reduce your possible entropy by .07058% (7.99435 bits per byte), and
eliminate the (astronomically remote) possibility of Hamlet or some other
English text popping out of your RNG/PRNG.  As long as your key is long
enough to withstand this slight entropy reduction, you are still OK.
