Yeah, we fucked up here and are getting rightfully flamed.

A more accurate way to say this would be something like:

1024-bit RSA is as hard to crack as three nested iterations of 56-bit DES.
The key length for symmetric-key cryptosystems isn't comparable to the key
length for public key cryptosystems. 

And now that I'm at it, I'm now told that it was a Captain Marvel decoder 
ring.

Apologies, all.
