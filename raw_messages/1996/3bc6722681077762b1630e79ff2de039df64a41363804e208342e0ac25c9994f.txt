Why would you want to avoid #, @, etc. ?

I have a hard enough time getting lusers to choose non-dictionary 
passwords that they can *remember* - one technique is to teach sub-100 
i.q. types to use two words, seperated by a #,@, etc., with a number 
tossed in: kill#pig1et, which isn't a dictionary word, but has a chance of 
being remembered without writing it on a sticky note and pasting it to 
the @#%&ing monitor.

- r.w.
