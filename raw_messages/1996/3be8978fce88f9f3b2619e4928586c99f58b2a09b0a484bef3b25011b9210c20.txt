Almost, but not quite: you forgot a trailing "l".

           http://www.dsnt.com/whitepaper.html

Anyway, 512 bit for a permanent public key doesn't sound that safe. And
this phrase:

  Encrypting the Diffie-Hellman exchange and changing the dynamic common
  key every 24 hours foils "man-in-the-middle" attacks because each
  renegotiation authenticates the two boxes to each other.

sounds especially obscure to me. If the initial exchange of the "permanent
common private key" through a non-authenticated D-H key exchange was
compromised (as it is entirely possible) by a man-in-the-middle attack,
also the subsequent D-H key exchanges encrypted with that supposedly
common key will be subject to the same attack: actually there will be TWO
non-common private keys, and the man in the middle will know both of them.
