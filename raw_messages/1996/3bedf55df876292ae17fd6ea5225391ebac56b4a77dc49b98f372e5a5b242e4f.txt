That is a modest misreading of the statement -- what it says is a sort of 
"generally available" requirement that the committee did a _BIG_ job of 
trying to soft-pedal at the conference.  Especially when PGP was 
mentioned, they said "well, it's not _really_ a 'generally available' 
recommendation."  But it _is_.  One Cypherpunk at the meeting suggested 
to me that they knew if PGP was mentioned, heads would roll, and this 
might be a quiet way of sneaking that in.

Yep, but OTOH, how much can they fit into a decent blurb anyways, which 
is all the actual recommendation text is?

Which is as good as we could hope for from a government-sponsored report, 
whose team was required to include members of the intelligence community, 
and which those members know will be looked at seriously by congress.

While on the one hand I'm disappointed, OTOH it was much better than I 
expected it to be.  While it is essentially a "status quo" sort of 
report, it still allows us to deploy strong crypto now.

What I was most disappointed with was that (as far as I've found so far 
-- I've not slogged my way through the entire 500+ page report quite yet) 
CAPIs are totally ignored (although described in an appendix, I haven't 
yet been able to find any reference with regards to exporting them) 
thus leaving the "crypto in the hole" issue up in the air...
