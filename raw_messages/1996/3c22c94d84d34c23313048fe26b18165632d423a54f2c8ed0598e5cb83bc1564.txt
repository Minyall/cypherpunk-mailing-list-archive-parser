One obvious problem with this is that since sendmail runs
at all times of day or night and since sendmail must have
the decryption keys, this means that the decryption keys may
be in the memory of a computer that may be unattended.

This scheme may be useful for its convenience, but many
users will only be willing to turst the computer with their keys
while there messages are actually being decrypted in their
presence.

Thus, many users will want to super encrypt with their own
personal keys.

Thus I believe that the above scheme should be implemented
for mail security between sites, but it should not be viewed
as a total solution.
