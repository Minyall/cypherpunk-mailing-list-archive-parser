I think the reasons are probably tied closely to your second point.
Unless strong cryptography was easily distinguishable from weak
cryptography without taking the time to break it, then how would they
(law enforcement) recognize that someone was using strong cryptography?

Or suppose that some one uses strong cryptography and then wraps it in 
weak cryptography.  The outer shell would seem legal, and the authorities
can't go around randomly breaking people's keys (or so one would assume),
and even if they did, it wouldn't necessarily be legal as evidence anyway.

And finally, you have to consider the possibility of whether a person can
be identified merely by the fact that there is a message that is
intercepted that has strong cryptography in it.  I don't know enough about
remailers and internet protocols/servers to say whether this is a
reasonable objection or not, perhaps someone else does?

So, unless I'm incorrect about one of the above points (and I admit that I
may well be), once cryptography reaches a certain strength, there is no
reason to relinquish that strength, particularly if you are using it for
criminal activity.
