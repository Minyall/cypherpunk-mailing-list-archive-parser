But now we must make a disinction... I'm LD in writing, but can read very
well (when I was in 6th grade I could read like a 10th grader), and do
very well in Math and Computer classes (and non-biological/anatomical
sciences).  So should I be in trade school, because I plan on being a
computer programmer, or go to college?  Sure, I don't do well in language
and (depending on the class) some history classes, which, IMHO, are
weighted more heavily than they should be in both public _and_ private
schools (and yes, I've been to both), but I don't think that should mean I
can't go to college...

Anyway, my point is that there is, at times, a very fine line...

When we write programs that "learn", it turns out we do and they don't.
