The name of the informal logical fallacy Tim May has *not*
made is 'argumentum ad hominem' (literally, 'an argument 
to the man'; attacking one's opponent rather than dealing
with the subject under discussion; aka name calling).

Having said that, while Tim May has not committed a logical
fallacy, neither has he advanced a logical argument.  He
has merely stated his conclusory opinion of the other
person's comment.  By itself, it adds little or nothing of 
substance to the argument.

Logos out
