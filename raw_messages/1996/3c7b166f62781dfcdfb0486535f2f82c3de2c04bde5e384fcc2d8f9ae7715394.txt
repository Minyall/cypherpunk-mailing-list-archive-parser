Yes, I would say the actions of the people active on this list have had
significant effectst. To give one example:

Last summer, 'we' broke 40-bit RC4. Within a week or two, the
US government started to discuss making 64-bit escrowed crypto
exportable (not acceptable, but it's a change).

In the private sector, the opinion in a lot of US firms was 'yeah,
40 bits may be weak, but marketing wants to have a single "secure
version" of the product, so we'll sell the 40 bit  version domestically
and abroad - after all, 40 bits is only theoretically weak - no one's ever
broken it."

After the highly publicized SSL crack, it suddenly became a *lot*
easier for engineers to argue for separate domestic versions with 
stronger encryption. I personally know of three firms where this
occured, and I'm sure there are more.
