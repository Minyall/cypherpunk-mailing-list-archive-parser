	What the US government will allow to be exported is not "strong
encryption."  It is encryption only slightly too strong to be broken
by an amateur effort.  For the right investment in custom hardware, it
falls quickly.  (500,000 $US = 3.5 hour avg break).

	Contrast this to strong cryptography, which if you spent the
entire US GDP on cracking hardware, you have a chance of breaking it
before the heat death of the universe.  (Of course, thats a smaller
probability than winning the lottery on a single ticket.)

	They're not letting out anything that they couldn't break
years ago.  They're not really improving the competitiveness of
American business.  They may be allowing change in what will be
deployed in the US, but it won't really change becuase of the
paperwork requirements.

	In other words, the surveilance state is still winning, and
American business is still losing.
