Maybe the courts will rule that if people put an X-rated header flag on
their web pages then it's legal because concerned parents can have SurfWatch
block it.  The result of that would probably be that a large percentage of
sites would mark their content X-rated just so they are off the hook
legally, whether or not they really have anything pornographic.  But I can
live with that.
