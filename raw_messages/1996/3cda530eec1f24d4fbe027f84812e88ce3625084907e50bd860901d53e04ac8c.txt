Adam,

It is absolutely true that RSA has seen the light, and now believe that
the DH and HM patents are not valid.  I think that they had this realization
on the day that they lost control of these patents, with the breakup
of PKP.

Roger Schlafly has been fighting these patents as well, and it appears to
me that DH should be completely dead, it was widely publicized more than
a year before the patent was filed.

I don't believe RSA's interpretation of the judges ruling, though.
Certainly they will twist the words in the most favorable way.

RSA had been saying that Hellman-Merkle, not Diffie-Hellman, covered
all public key patent ideas; but they were only saying that through
PKP (which was a joint venture between themselves and Cylink)
