This isn't practical for the reason that many people who read and post
to the list are not subscribed to the list.  (There are many gateways,
local mail->news gateways, etc.  eg point your nntp aware news
reader at nntp.hks.net.)

Either delete the junk, or subscribe to a filtered list if deleting or
not reading posts bothers you enough that you think it worth the risk
that the filter owner filters a few posts that you would have found
interesting.  

(killfiling on address is not possible for remailer, and content of
unattributed unsigned anonymous posts is difficult to automatically
filter).
