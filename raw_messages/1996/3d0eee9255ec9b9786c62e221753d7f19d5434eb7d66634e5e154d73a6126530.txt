The fact that the private key is based on fractals rather than prime numbers
really doesn't make a difference.  Fractals are not random, and do in fact,
have a pattern.  The Mandelbrot Set, for instance, can be expressed in a
few bytes of information even though it is infinitely complex.  Therefore,
the fractal has extremely low entropy making it a bad choice from which to
obtain random data.
