A couple of questions [admittedly, I am not the best expect in American
politics]: 

1) Is there anything real that individual citizens can do?
2) Would it be helpful to kick democrats out of office and replace
them with republicans? In other words, are republicans any better
than democrats in respecting citizens' right to protecting their
privacy from the government?
