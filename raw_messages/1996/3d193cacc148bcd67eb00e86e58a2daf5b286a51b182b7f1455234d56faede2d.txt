We're looking for someone who can test an SSL implementation in Java. 
If you're interested send a resume or a URL either to me or to the
group.   My email is mrm@eng.sun.com, the group gets resumes at
jeeves-jobs@goa.eng.sun.com.      If you're interested in the context,
see http://java.sun.com/products/jeeves.     If you're Perry and you
want to flame me send email to mrm@eng.sun.com :-)
