In the documentation for Web Commander (page 7-50, item 19, top of page), 
under the process for getting a digital ID from VeriSign, you state:

"Also, please note that you cannot send keys longer than 512 to servers 
outside the United States."

I would like to ask for clarification on this point. Is this meant to say 
that a server inside the United States is not allowed to use a 512+ bit key 
with a client outside the U.S., or that a Web Commander server outside the 
U.S. may not employ a key of greater than 512 bits? In either case, what is 
the justification for such a statement/restriction? If a Federal 
regulation, could you please cite the Title and Section?

Thank you.
