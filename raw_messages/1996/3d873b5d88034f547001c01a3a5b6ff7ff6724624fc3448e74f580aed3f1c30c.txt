He's been flogging the same shit for a while- I've received three or four
of these spams at another address that I use to make Usenet posts.

That address is an account at a large workstation company that I
consult for.  I've been getting a lot of spam there.
I suggested on an internal mailing list that the amount of spam
that various employees there are getting isn't insignificant and
that perhaps they should sue some of the spammers for wasting
the company's resources and employee time without permission.

I suggest that the "anti-junk-fax" law might be extended to cover
spam mail.  However I don't trust net-clueless legislators to
be able to make even a simple law without fucking it up and
restricting civil liberties.  However, I heard from a friend
that they're doing just that, extending the junk fax law
to cover junk email.  Something like a $500 fine for
each junk email.  Does anyone know more?

Would mailing-list operators be liable under this law when
someone forges a subscription message from "clinton@whitehouse.gov"?
