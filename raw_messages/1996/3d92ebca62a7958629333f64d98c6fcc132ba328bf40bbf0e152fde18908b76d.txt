The S-Boxes in DES were optimized to hinder Differential Cryptanalysis.  I've seen no studies on the effectiveness of jumbling the S-Boxes during encryption -- even Biham and Shamir's book doesn't mention it -- but, I figure, if it helps, DES would probably already be doing it (unless of course the NSA thought the jumbling would make too good an algorithm).
