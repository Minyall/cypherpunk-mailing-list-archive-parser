One gets the "Journal of Cryptology" automatically by attending the Crypto
Conference (at least this was so in the past). I can't see that it carries
much that the "Crypto" and "Eurocrypt" Proceedings carry (though Chaum's
"Dining Cryptographers" paper was in Volume I, Number 1, circa 1988-89).

"Cryptologia" is a much different thing.

Neither is necessary for the disposing of snake oil products, however.
