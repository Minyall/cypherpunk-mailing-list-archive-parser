In the mid-eighties in the UK they adopted the idea of a red triangle
continuously displayed on the screen of movies shown on TV that were
considered to have more than the normal share of wobbly pink bits, airborne
blood, etc.

Viewing figures for obscure 70's French movies shown at 1:30am soared as
all the horny geeks sat through two hours of forest/eating/traffic or
whatever scenes waiting for the 7 seconds of nudity.

I'm sure that far more children saw these movies than would have without
the government sponsored red flag with the words "Get It Here" being waved
like crazy as the movie rolled.
