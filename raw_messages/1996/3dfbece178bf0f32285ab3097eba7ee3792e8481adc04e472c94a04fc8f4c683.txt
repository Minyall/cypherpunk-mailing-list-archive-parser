C'punks,

There has been sporadic interest on this list with regard to
offshore incorporation, banking, etc.  While ads for offshore
services are common in the international press, until now, none
of these companies has an Internet presence.  

THE ECONOMIST has an ad for OCRA, a group that specializes in
offshore company services.  What's new is that they have a Web
page.  It includes a good primer on the benifits from going 
offshore and on selected offshore jurisdictions.  I've never done
business with these folks, but they have good info.
