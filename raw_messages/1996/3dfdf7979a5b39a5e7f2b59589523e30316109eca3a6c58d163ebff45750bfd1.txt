In the interest of those who wish a significant increase in the
signal/noise ratio I make a proposal. Significant crypto related
posts could be prefaced with [CRYPTO] on the subject line on a
strictly volunteer basis, that way those desiring a more topical
list could have one simply by setting the appropriate filter.

Items crypto related but missing the [CRYPTO] header could be
reposted by well meaning souls.

Other appropriate headers could of course be used.

Brian
