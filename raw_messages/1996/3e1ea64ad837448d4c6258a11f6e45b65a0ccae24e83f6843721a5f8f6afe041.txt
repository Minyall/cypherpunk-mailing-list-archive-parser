That's certainly one view. Another is that if you watch the precursors of
legislation, then actions in the Netherlands, the UK, and in the European
Parliament suggest that an independent European escrow initiative might
happen within a year. When it does it will be a trivial matter to harmonize
it with some US offering. The mills in various countries are grinding too
coincidentally for my taste.

Given the glacial pace with which standard integrated crypto has appeared
on the Internet, with Navigator only going to offer the final
link--encrypted e-mail--later this year, the above timing isn't necessarily
one which will be left behind by independent Internet developments. And
given the glacial pace of PGP movement toward integrated internet standard
products, it hasn't a hope of beating the above timing to the punch.
