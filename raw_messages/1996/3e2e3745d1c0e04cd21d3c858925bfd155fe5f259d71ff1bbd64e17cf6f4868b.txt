I would ask, is there any known medical gain that has resulted from 
such a data-base correllation.

I do not accept a researcher's own statements as to the utility of the work 
(S)he's done with someone's funding.  Seen too much of it at close 
quarters...   Nor do I accept reeports in the lay press - these are 
nothing more than re-gurgitated press releases from PR depts of institutions.
