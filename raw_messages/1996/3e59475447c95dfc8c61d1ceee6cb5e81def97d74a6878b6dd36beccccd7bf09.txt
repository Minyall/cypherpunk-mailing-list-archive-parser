I think it is a stretch, admittedly, but that it can be done, and most
importantly, it can be done nearly for "free".

I'm not entirely sure. It is certainly bigger than the factorings that
have been done, but on the other hand it is fairly easy to put
together the experiment, and there are an awful lot of idle machines
out there in the world. I have on several occassions been in
possession of four or five hundred idle CPUs at night, and I am pretty
sure that other people are in that position. The net has also grown
quite dramatically in recent years, and reaching 100,000 reasonably
high speed machines might not be so hard these days. At that point, it
becomes a question of how fast one can get the DES cracker. A constant
factor of two or three then makes a considerable difference in the
outcome, as does the user friendlyness of the overall system.

Well, that would certainly be cool, but this does require real
money. If you are willing to spend it, go for it, but I'm not sure we
can count on people doing that sort of thing. What do you suppose the
odds are that someone is going to build such a thing any time soon?
