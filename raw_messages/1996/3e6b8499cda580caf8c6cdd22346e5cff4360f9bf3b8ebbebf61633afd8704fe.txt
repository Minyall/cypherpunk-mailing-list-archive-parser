Not always possible.  The rule isn't just "40 bit crypto" it's "permission,
which you won't get with over 40 bits unless you're very cooperative."
Applications like Netscape's SSL don't give you the ability to feed your
data through it three times; they process your stream of data and send it.

Also, some 40-bit systems put known plaintext at the beginning of their
output (e.g. a magic number saying that this file is in FooBar40 format)
which means that even if you quintuply encrypt them, you still only
have several layers of 40-bit encryption that you can peel one at a time.
