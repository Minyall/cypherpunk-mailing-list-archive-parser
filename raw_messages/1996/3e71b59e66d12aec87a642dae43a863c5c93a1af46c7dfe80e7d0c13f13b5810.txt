I didn't make clear: their was no charge for down loading their
on-line stuff.  I think they are in the US, and mentioned their crypto
down load as having no restrictions because of the ITAR implications.

Just wondering if anyone outside the US had downloaded `PGP262.ZIP'
from their freely accessible ftp area.

I get my crypto from US sites also, and your's is on the list :-)

	ftp.dsi.unimi.it
	ftp.ox.ac.uk
	ftp.replay.com
	http://www.cs.hut.fi/crypto/

(a few more too that's all I can remember off the top of my head).

Now if their CD cost $10, and they weren't in the US, I might've
bought one.
