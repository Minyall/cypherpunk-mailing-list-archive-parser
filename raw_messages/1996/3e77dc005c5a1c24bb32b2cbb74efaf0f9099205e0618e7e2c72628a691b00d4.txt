Thats fine, but tell me it's going to play at the clearance level...It 
won't.

If there is a serious crime involved, partials are sufficient to make the 
"guest list" if there are other mitigating factors to even suspect you 
might be involved. That's doesn't mean you'll make it to the top, but it 
can certainly cause some painful scrutiny.

Again, process will work, but not allowed in context of clearance.

There needs to be suffcient damage to the ridges by some chemical or 
mechanical means (sand paper, concrete, brick, etc.) to remove the 
distiguishing ridges, and not replace them with a traceable pattern of 
any kind. 

Scraping the fingertips runs the risk of leaving trace marks that are 
just as good as the ridges you tried to remove - even better if you've 
left finger prints as a result. The point to the game is not to search 
any database, but to produce a verifiable match with evidence at the 
scene of any crime. In the case of a clearance, it is to start or 
validate an identification process. IF validation is unobtainable via 
fingerprints, then the issuing body can employ other means (such as 
retinal scans) or deny clearance all together.
