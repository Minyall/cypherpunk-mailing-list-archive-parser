Ugghhh!

This guy's gotta get stopped somehow. Is there an Anti-SPAM list that
would be more appropriate for this?

No hosts seem to be active in the moneyworld.com domain except
usa1.moneyworld.com [208.129.19.69]  - even the name server is dead. us1
is an outgoing-only SMTP server AFAIK - can't connect to port 25, but the
spam came from that host most likely.

Shows directories for chag, netamerica, and natureplus.
chag has the (phony) investment reports.
natureplus shows a bunch of stuff trying to advertise holistic medicine
("Herbs, Minerals, Vitamins & Extracts").

Lookie here - netamerica must be the name of his 'real' company. Has a
bunch of information, the title of the main page is "Direct Internet
Marketing & Financial Public Relations"

Going to the chancellor.stockpick.com pages says that the name of the
company, however, is 'Financial Connections, Inc.'

Looks like this guy is:
	- Going under a fake name/names
	- Advertising by abusing the Internet
	- Using as many company names as he has pairs of underwear
