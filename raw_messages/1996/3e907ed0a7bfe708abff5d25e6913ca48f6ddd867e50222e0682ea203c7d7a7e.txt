Make sure that, unless you don't mind the FBI putting an extra monitor
on you, you don't *ever* transact $10k or more at one time, or on one
purchase in smaller increments over a relatively short period of time.
I know this because one of our customers in Encino was tagged this way
in 1983.  What was really hilarious was that they brought the equipment
in for us to have a look at, since we were experts on HP proprietary
gear and they weren't.  (Or we were a lot cheaper than HP corp.)
