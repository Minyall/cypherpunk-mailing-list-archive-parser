Right or wrong, in some states, at least, you can not only sue a professional bartender, you can sue any individual who serves liquor at a private party and allows a guest to drive home under the influence, if the guest causes damage to you or your property as a result.  Many people support this "vicarious liability" theory as it relates to drunk driving.

Next time, pick a better analogy.  You may have just given their lawyers the analogy they need to prove their case.
