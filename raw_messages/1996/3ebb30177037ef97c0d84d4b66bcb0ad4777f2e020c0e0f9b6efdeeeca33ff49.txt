     Not the networks, the local stations. Each station decides where to 
slot a specific non-network show. 

     In many time slots he was competing sucessfully with The Late Show, and 
The Other Idiot (sorry, it has been a long time since I watched TV, so I 
can't remember the other idiots name). 

     In one city he was place opposite Oprah Winfrey, and _still_ had decent
ratings, but the TV stations got a lot more complaints about him at 3 in the
afternoon, so they put him on after midnight.

     His TV show did not suceed or fail because of what Limbaugh did, but 
rather on decesions that were totally out of his hands. That is why he
is not renewing his contracts.

     Please do not lump all militias in with the Chistian Identity & Klan 
types, you just display more and more ignorance.
