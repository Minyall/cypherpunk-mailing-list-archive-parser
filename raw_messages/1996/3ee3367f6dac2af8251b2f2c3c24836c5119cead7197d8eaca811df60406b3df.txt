That's right. You lack the decorum to spell either my first name or
my last name correctly. "Cypher punks" are a gang of uncouth juveniles

What logic? "Cypher punks" such as Paul Bradley are incapable of
discussing a technical topic (such as Don Wood's IPG proposal) without
putting "(spit)" after Don's name and calling his algorithm "bullshit".
That's from the same person who first ranted about "brute force attacks on
one-time pads", then attributed to me various shit I never said.
