Besides, how do we KNOW they don't keep the keys? Other than their
vigorous protestations, of course -- and even were they paragons of
virtue instead of being about as slimey as they come it wouldn't be
acceptable.

Any system in which a third, untrusted party generates your keys for
you is, plain and simple, totally unacceptable. Period. I cannot
conceive of the circumstances under which I would allow a client to
use such a system if they had anything more important to protect than
their grocery list.
