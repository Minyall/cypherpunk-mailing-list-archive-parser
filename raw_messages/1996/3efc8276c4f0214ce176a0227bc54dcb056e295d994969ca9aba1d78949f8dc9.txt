[My sincere congrats to PRZ & Mr. Goen, and to Mr. Keane for getting
a clue. I am sure the timing of this happy news had *nothing at all*
to do with politics...<g>]

A few questions about the investigation:

What did the ZLDF end up spending?

What did the govt. end up spending?
[I know, it's hard to track taxe$.]

Was this decision on the part of the prosecution as voluntary as it's
made to sound, or were some members of the grand jury starting to make
"nullification noises" as the investigation progressed? Has the grand
jury been dismissed yet? If so, have any jurors spoken publicly about
the investigation?
JMR
