Hey Tim-
Just a thought.  When you stated that other countries might be trying to 
(basically) pretend the holocaust had never happened, because it might NOT 
have happened and may very well be a big lie, you forgot to consider somthing. 
 Had the holocaut happened, which i believe it did, it was of such horific 
magnitude that, since (for a time) we sat back and let it happen, let 6 
million innocent people die, we might be trying to forget about it so as to 
not have to take responsibility for it having happened.  It is much easier to 
say that it never existed and have no responsibility, than to acknoledge that 
it happened, and to look at what kind of people it makes us to let it happen.

Just a thought. :)
