After too much coffee and not enough sleep, it looks like the (soon-to-be-named) shellback.com site will be going on-line on Monday, 11 March. Until InterNIC comes back and blesses us with permission to use the name, we'll be running as 204.177.232.150

I'd like to again ask anyone on the cypherpunks list that has a site, link, file, or other bit of info that they're willing to have us include please let me know via email. I've got some links from my (soon-to-be-former) home page, but I'd like to include a *lot* more stuff.

To repeat an earlier offer, as postmaster, I'm offering the use of our email system for crypto/coder/privacy-related mailing lists, and our drives to store related files/archives.
