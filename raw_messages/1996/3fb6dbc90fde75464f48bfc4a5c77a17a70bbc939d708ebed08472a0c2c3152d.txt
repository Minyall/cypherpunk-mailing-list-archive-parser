Actually, I think that the Merkle Hellman patent is the one considered to
cover all public key cryptography.  RSADSI claims that Diffie Hellman also
includes ElGamal, but Cylink now owns the Diffie Hellman patent and I don't
know if they consider it to also cover ElGamal.

In _Applied Cryptography_, there is no mention of any patents covering Rabin.
Elliptic curve public key encryption schemes are not covered by any public
key cryptography schemes, so it is possible that Rabin is also not covered
under any patents.
