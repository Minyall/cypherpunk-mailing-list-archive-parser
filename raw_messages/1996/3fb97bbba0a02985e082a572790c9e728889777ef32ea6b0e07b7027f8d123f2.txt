The "evidence" is based upon the belief that such techniques as carbon 
dating and statistical radio active half life bearing rocks give an 
accurate measurement of time as we know it. Geologically speaking, we are 
just pissing in the fan to see which way it blows and calling it good. 
And, considering the number of text books and egos to be restrung if it 
was ever conclusively proven wrong would be devastating to say the least to 
the current crop of scientists.

As someone once said (I believe it was Samuel Clemens), "There are lies, 
damn lies, and statistics."

Newtonian mechanics is not "wrong", just an obeservation of mechanical 
behavior at a macro level of abstraction. Newton built on Keppler's work, 
and Eienstein upon Newton's, each refining the other's observation 
towards the true nature of matter and it's behavior in this realm.

Eienstein was nothing more than a clever observer, and QED is workable 
bullshit based upon those operations. Ever wonder why we have fudge 
factors in our calculations? We don't why they work, they just do. This 
tells me we ain't home yet.

MIxing too many metaphors. All is see is gray...:-)
