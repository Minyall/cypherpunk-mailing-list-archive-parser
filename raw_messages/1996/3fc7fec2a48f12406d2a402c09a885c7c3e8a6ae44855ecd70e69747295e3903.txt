You can do this with the existing device driver kit since they supply the
entire source code to the AT hard disk driver.  I took a look and decided
that it would be too much work for me alone.  They also seem to suggest that
you can write "filters" that extend the capability of existing drivers.

I'm one of them, but this low level device driver stuff makes me shudder!
