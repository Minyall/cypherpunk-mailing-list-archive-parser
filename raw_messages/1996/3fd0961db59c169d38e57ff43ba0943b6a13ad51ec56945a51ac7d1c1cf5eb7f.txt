John Brothers,

Which locality do you live in?  I've got all this toxic waste that I've 
been collecting in return for receiving large sums of money, I'd like to 
get rid of it as cheply as possible. I thought I might just burn it in a 
good  "true" libertarian neighborhood.

You don't mind, do you?
