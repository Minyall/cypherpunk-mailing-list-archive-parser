Another problem - if you ever want to get into the US, you can kiss that
chance goodbye.  They might not even let you into the country as a
visitor.  Stupid.  A fair number of Western countries have laws that say,
in effect, that if you do something in your country that isn't illegal in
your country but is in country X, then country X can bar you entry or PR
status or citizenship based on the fact that is *is* a crome in country X. 

Never mind that you may not even be aware that it *is* a crime in another
country, etc.  I suspect that it's intended to bar war criminals and such,
but it could just as easily be used against the common immigrant.
