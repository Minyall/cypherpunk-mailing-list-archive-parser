But on Unix systems, at least, you can make "referer" more difficult
for nosy servers to use -- subject to the "applicable laws" where you
live.  (The license agreement says, "...you agree not to modify the
Software ... except to the extent [that] applicable laws specifically
prohibit such restriction.")

Just back up your Netscape executable, then load it into Emacs (or any
editor which can handle arbitrary binary files), search for the "Referer:"
string, and change it to an appropriate string of the same length.

"MYOB:   " sounds like an appropriate string to me...
