	You forgot something else.

	Jury Selection also involves the removal from the jury any
	individual who might have some knowledge about anything which
	might be relevent to the case.

	So the only people on juries are those who are unemployed,
	on uneducated or usually both.  That they are easilly manipulated
	is a further virtue, from the POV of the Injustice system the US 
	has.
