Huh?  Why?  If I'm an ecash seller, I take a customer's paper money,
withdraw ecash from _my_ MT account, give the ecash to the customer
(_not_ a payment: I just give him the coin -- the pair (n,f(n)^(1/h)))
and the customer is free to use it at will.  It's Digicash's slogan:
the numbers _are_ the money.
