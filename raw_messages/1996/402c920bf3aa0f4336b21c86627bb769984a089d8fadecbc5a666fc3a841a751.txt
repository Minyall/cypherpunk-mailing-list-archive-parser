Well, if it does not apply to Boursy, then you are still going
to get a royal ass-kicking. The EFF and Gilmore are too connected
to UUNET and the cabal to have any credibility on this usenet any
m.

And DIG: I never even subscribed to the stupid fucking list!
All I ever did was respond to the cypherpunks out of a courtesy to
never cut headers.  I could give a shit less about whatever you
"punks" do.  I ain't no "punk" and I don't like the word when
there is an admitted faggot at the helm.

And the guy being a faggot is the whole reason why the EFF
or the cypherpunks have no credibility.  A sick fucking culture it
is now defined as, by most onlookers.

Admitted homosexuals have no place in the modern usenet.
Now keep your replies to the cypherpunks list; I don't
want to hear any more punk shit!
