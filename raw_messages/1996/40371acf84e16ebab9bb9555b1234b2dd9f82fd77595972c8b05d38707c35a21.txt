The product is called DCE RPC and the RPC is used
generically as you stated in the beginning of your note.
There are many RPCs in the world, aside from the ones you
listed.  DCE RPC is also known as ISO RPC as the standard is
based on DCE.  MS RPC is also based on DCE RPC as you
stated. 

DCE is not part of OSF/1 but is middleware supporting
distributed computing which is available on virtually all
platforms: (Unixes, Windows, Cray, MVS, VMS, Mac is in beta,
etc.)  Yes, one of the reference ports was OSF/1.  We sell
the source code separately.

We are now seeing OSs bundled with DCE client software.
The most recent versions of HP/UX and AIX for example.
