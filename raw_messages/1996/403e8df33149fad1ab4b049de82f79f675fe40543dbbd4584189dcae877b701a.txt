I've contacted an editor I know at the Allentown Morning Call (the major
newspaper in the Easton, PA area) and a staffwriter I know at the
Philadelphia Inquirer.

No word from the Inquirer yet, but the Morning Call seems interested --
email me for the editor's email address/phone number. Other folks can
probably give better background than I can.
