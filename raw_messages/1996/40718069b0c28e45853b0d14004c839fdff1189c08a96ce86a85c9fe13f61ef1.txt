CDs sell for more because buyers decided that they wanted a wider range of
titles with shallower sales (hence higher unit costs) rather than a narrower
range of titles with lower sales prices.  The number of CD titles available
is far greater (in general distribution) than the number of vinyl titles
that were available during vinyl's peak year.  This greater availability of
short run pressings raises average unit sales costs justifying the higher
prices.  Had the market decided (when physical production costs fell) that
it was satisfied with a Top-40 CD stock, average CD prices would have fallen
to vinyl levels.

Materials cost is a minor part of total cost.

In both cases, the cost of production is a small part of the cost of goods
sold.  Almost all of that cost is the cost of marketing (as with all
mass-market products in a modern capitalist economy.
