   I was visiting a business running SCO Xenix, and they were all
aflutter over the fact that their 'root' password was fucked, and
they couldn't perform any System Administration tasks.
   I took their SCO installation disks, used the 'find' command to
find the 'passwd' file, and piped it to the editor.  I blanked out
the password for 'root' and rebooted the system.  When logging on 
as root, it prompted them for a new 'root' password.

   By the way, do you know why a 'Back Door' is so named?
   It's because when someone comes in through it, and wreaks havoc,
you wake up with a sore asshole.
