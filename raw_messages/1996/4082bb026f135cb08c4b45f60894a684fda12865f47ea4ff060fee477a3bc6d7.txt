Suppose strong crypto is outlawed in all OECD countries by dec -96.
The known international sites with more or less complete coverage
today amount to a handful. They will be shut down pronto. Of course
lots of private persons have a lot of crypto files hanging around,
but a widely distributed CD-ROM, easily put up as a BBS partition,
wouldn't make the situation worse.
