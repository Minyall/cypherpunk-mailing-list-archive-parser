Cutting off the power supply would render this method useless very
quickly. Oh, so you are going to use batteries? That "when an intrusion is
detected" part sounds rather interesting... Wouldn't be too hard to either
befuddle.

The point is:
	- You cannot be alert at all times.
	- Even if you can, you cannot cover all possibilities with a 100%
	ensurance of safety.

IOW, if a 'pre-dawn unannounced ninja raid' [sic] occurs on you, you are
pretty well beat, if only because the other side knows what they are doing
and you have no idea of their plans.

The only protection against lawlessness is not lawlessness, it is reason.
