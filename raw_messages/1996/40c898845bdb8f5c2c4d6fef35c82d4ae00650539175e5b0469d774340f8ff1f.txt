I'd say that for most applications these days one needn't worry too
much.

Almost all my internal communications these days inside my own LAN are
encrypted. I hardly if ever notice performance issues. When I do, I
decide if I don't care about the traffic (which sometimes is the case)
and then I use RC4.

Anyway, the point is that performance shouldn't be thought of as an
issue unless you have a system built and in use and you find that it
is a bottleneck. Often you would be surprised at how little of a
bottleneck it really is.
