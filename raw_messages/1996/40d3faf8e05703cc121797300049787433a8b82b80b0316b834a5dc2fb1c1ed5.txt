  They're a company involved in mass emailing ads on behalf of their
clients.  They have also sued AOL because of the latter's trying to
protect their subscribers by blocking Cyberpromo's ads.  Cyberpromo
obtained a TRO stopping AOL's block, but the TRO  was set aside on
appeal.
  Dale Thorn posted the following on this list in response to ads he was
receiving from Cyberpromo, specifically:

  I believe Cyberpromo is run by Sanford Wallace.  Think he was also on
60 Minutes raising First Amendment rights along with Free Enterprise
concepts.
  So, is it a spam or someone legitimately using the net in the ordinary
course of business?
