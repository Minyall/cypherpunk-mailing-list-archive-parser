This is precisely the problem Certificate Revocation Lists and Certificate
Expiration Dates address.  There seems very little reason to subpoena a
persons signing key, only decryption keys.  If future software uses
separate keys for these two functions, then there may be minimal danger. 
(With PGP, it should be sufficient to provide the IDEA keys for the
messages in question, leaving the secret key still secret.)
