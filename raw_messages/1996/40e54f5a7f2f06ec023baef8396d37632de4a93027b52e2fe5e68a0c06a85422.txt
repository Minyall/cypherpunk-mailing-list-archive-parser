  There is a guy in Tennessee who publishes a newsletter called _The 
Moneychanger_.  He is one of those Constitutionalists. He did put himself 
through hell to get acquited of an IRS charge - he is a dealer in gold 
and silver and claimed that he wasn't selling anything, only changing 
denominations of Money, with no profits. He won the federal case; the IRS 
called their buds at the Tenn Dept of Revenue and had him indicted on a 
failure-to-remit-sales-tax charge. He was convicted on that by the Jury 
but he is appealing; meanwhile he only deals with out-of-Tenn people.

Which just goes to show that convictions/acquitals under a jury system 
have a lot of random-walk flavor. Further reference at the OJ Simpson 
newsgroups.
