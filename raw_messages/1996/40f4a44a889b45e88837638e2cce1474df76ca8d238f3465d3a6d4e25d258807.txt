erm, a boycott means not _buying_ a product, as opposed to not _using_ a
product. In the case of PGP, I never intended to purchase it from RSA. As
for Netscape, there are other browsers out there (or so I heard). 

Realistically, a boycott is likely to be ineffective. Writing letters to
companies and congresshmucks and working with non-US crypto companies to
create a standard that can be legally imported into the US (for now) would
be more effective, IMHO. Boycotts rely on large numbers of participants,
and not enough people understand or care about encryption. We'd be better
off trying to change that first.
