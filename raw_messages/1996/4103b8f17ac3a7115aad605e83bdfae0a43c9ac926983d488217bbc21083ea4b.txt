    Rich:

	if you want to indulge in personal rants and vendettas, take it to
    personal mail.  secondly, you are slamming someone without the 
    decency or courtesy to even copy him.

	the whole Zundel thing is completely off the concept unless maybe
    a mention that Germany is trying to deny free speech rights to Zundel. 
    The man is entitled to his fifteen minutes in the sunlight, no matter
    how despicable he may be. everybody publicizing Zundel only extends 
    his fifteen minutes in thye sun.

	anyway, Rich, you are being childish.  I have two daughters who
    are always at each other's throats for something, but even a 10 year
    old is not as petty as you're pouting.  why in the world would you
    even want to claim Zundel's trash?  check the mirror for the fool. 

	[ BTW, if I were a sysadmin, I would not cut his service, but I 
    sure as hell would not encourage it. ]

	let's all have a nice day!
