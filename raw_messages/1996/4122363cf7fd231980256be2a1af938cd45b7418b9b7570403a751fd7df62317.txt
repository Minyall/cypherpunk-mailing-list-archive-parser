Sounds like a heck of a good idea, if:

1. You can ID the bad logic with a high percent of success (90+ ?).

2. You can comment/reply for all members fairly, but if limited by the
   large number of postings (and fallacies ?), give priority to ???

As far as Congress expelling members, are you saying that the Senate
and/or H.O.R. can permanently eliminate a person elected by the people?
Has this ever been tested?
