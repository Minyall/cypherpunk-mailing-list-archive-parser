However, the neighorhood IPS doesn't need the kind of defenses required for
the powergrid and other crucial systems. The systems that do require such
heightend security are typically run by parties that can afford such
security. If they choose not to implement them, then it stands to reason
that their threat evaluation does not deem it necessary. Let market forces
govern, lest we spend money on countermeasures for inflated threats.
