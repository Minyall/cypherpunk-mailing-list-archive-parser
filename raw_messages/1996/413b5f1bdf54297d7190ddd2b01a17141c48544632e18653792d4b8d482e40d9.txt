Someone did very poor research, then. In fact there was a Libyan-backed
coup two or three years ago, which was overthrown in about a month. I
distinctly remember the headline in The Economist, which was similar to
"Trinidad Coup Not Considered Cricket." 

Info on the coup and a copy of this bit of folklore is on a Trinidad & 
Tobago Web Page somewhere. Maybe they got a definitive answer in the 
six months or so since I last looked.

This should probably get a [NOISE] for Perry's benefit...
