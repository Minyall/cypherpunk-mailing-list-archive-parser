I guess the final word on assasination politics would be obvious:

It's widely believed that the New Orleans Mafia (the source of my recent
statement about body decomposition in Louisiana swamps) was a prime driver
in the assasination of the late President John F. Kennedy.

I think it's fairly safe to say that having done this didn't do them a
damn bit of good. It didn't do anyone else a damn bit of good.

The world remained just as corrupt as it always was.
