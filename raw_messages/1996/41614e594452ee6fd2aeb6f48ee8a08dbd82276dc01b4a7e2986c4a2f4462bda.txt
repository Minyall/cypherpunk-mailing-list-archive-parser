I know many people who were happy they had insurance due to car
accidents, health problems, or whatever.  What is more, the odds of
these events are carefully calculated and available.  Call an actuary.

Are there similar sources of information calculating privacy risk?  I
don't think so.

Informally, I don't know anybody who has suffered due to a loss of
privacy.

It may be the case that it is politically beneficial to have a society
of privacy fanatics.  But, this is different from the direct benefit
to each participant.

My question remains unanswered, probably because privacy isn't worth
the effort.
