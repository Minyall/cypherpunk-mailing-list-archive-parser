Low, maybe a tenth of an American cent.  But probabilistic payment should be 
used to allow the minimum average payment to go way below this, perhaps to 
an unlimited extent.  The reason is simple:  The cost of providing net 
transactions, and electronic transactions in general, can be expected to 
drop exponentially, just like the cost of telecommunications and CPU power 
do.  Any arbitrary limit to how low they can go will act somewhat akin to 
the minimum wage:  It will deter development of any product or service whose 
perceived value is less than this arbitrary minimum.
