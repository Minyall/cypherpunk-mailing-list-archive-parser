I've never seen Tim "advocate the unemployment" of anyone or any group.
He has merely argued that an employer should be free *not* to hire an
individual for any reason whatsoever.  Such a reason might include his/her
language/dialect, appearance, race, gender, religion or any other
(arbitrary-to-an-outsider) criterion.  This is a standard libertarian
position and shouldn't be too difficult to grasp.
