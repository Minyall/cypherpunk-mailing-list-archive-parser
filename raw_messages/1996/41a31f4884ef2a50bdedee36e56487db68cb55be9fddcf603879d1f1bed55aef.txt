I believe Rich Loomis was referring to the fact that this is cypherpunks

You continually bring up this irrelevant topic whenever someone complains
about your egregious statism on other issues:  

We are sick to the back teeth with hearing what a good guy you have been
on Nazism and the holocaust.  We do not give a shit.  We gave a
shit the first time, but we are up to about the hundredth time
and counting.
