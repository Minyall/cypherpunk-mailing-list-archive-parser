I can't remember the elliptic curve system well, but if the parameters
of the curve are not standard for everyone (which I am afraid they are)
one method is to pick the point first, then solve for the a & b.

If this is not the case, finding the square root may be nice or tricky.

if p=3 mod 4, then the sqrt is
X^(P+1) mod P, where X is the number you are trying to find the sqrt
of.  It can be extended to X=5(mod 8) and a few others, but I'm not sure
how.  There is also a form for X=1 mod 4,but I can't find reference to
it. Hope this helps
