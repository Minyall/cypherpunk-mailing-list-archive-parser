In consideration of the difference between "ratings" and "reputation":

I think of a rating as something which is attached to something
"pre-knowledge", whereas a reputation is something which develops over
time & based upon informed knowledge ("after-knowledge").

A rating is applied to something (a service or whatever) by only those
few individuals who are acquainted with what they are rating.

A reputation is accumulated by the impressions made upon larger numbers
of individuals - a general population not necessarily employed to
collect these impressions - but who have nevertheless sufficient
exposure to and acquaintanceship with the person/service/etc. to make an
informed conclusion about it.  

A rating can make a statement on what something "is" or is expected to
be (eg, general in content vs explicitly sexual), where a reputation
reflects on past behavior.
