I'd like to take a chance on showing my ignorance, but, if I do learn
to trust an anonymous source on something-or-other, and then a forger
comes along and disrupts that, i.e., I can no longer tell in all cases
which is the old source and which is the bogus, that's a problem.

I think I could learn to trust any number of anon's, but will the future
technology be able to guarantee ID's as well as, say, looking at someone's
face whom I know, or talking to them on the phone?
