Yet another obligatory AP (Assassination Politics) reference:  If a person 
is really interested in helping out "starving children" he may be able to do 
far more good by purchasing the death of the local tyrant(s), rather than 
(just) buying more food.  After all, if the donor really believes that this 
starvation isn't endemic to the country, he has to conclude that it's a 
condition which is forced on the victims. In addition, you almost always 
find that these starving countries have well-supplied militaries, defending 
the local warlords against each other as in Somalia.  Indeed, in Somalia the 
incoming food was actually used to buoy up one group against another, 
because access to it is controlled directly or indirectly by the factions.

Some might argue that the death of a single leader doesn't normally fix the 
problem.  While that's often true, it's normally because there isn't 
an automatic guarantee that the next 20+ leaders will ALSO be killed if they 
display the same problems as the first.  Provide that guarantee, and 
(somewhat paradoxically) not only do you not need to kill the 20+, you 
probably won't have to kill the first one!


(wondering when the world will see the light...)
