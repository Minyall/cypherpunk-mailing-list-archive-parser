This scheme wouldn't necessarily map True Names to tokens; merely
list subscriptions.  If an account at a nymserver were to subscribe,
there would be no way to identify the account holder.

The real problem is that there could be a lot of subscriptions
from a site like  nymserver.bwalk.com . . . .
