Did I miss something?

Of the many columns and articles I've read recently, this is one of the
best and most concise so far.  Compare it to, say, the "Netly News" column
jya posted earlier.

What export controls have to do with keeping an eye on "the bad guys" no one
really knows.  Unless the intent is control of domestic encryption of course.

The only major point that I see missed is the key size limitation
of 56 bits and the nature of the agreement itself to extend or rescind
export licenses based on a future key recovery plan which satisfies government
officials.

Fifty-six bits is simply not secure.  Abate missed this fundamental point.

Furthermore, that the only way for individuals and companies to maintain
security for "the bad people(including governments)" is through secure,
virtually unbreakable (large key length) encryption.  A back door and a
relatively pitiful key length limitation provide no real security.

Furthermore, the agreement itself for 2 year conditional licenses is
curious.  There are many obvious questions.  What will satisfy the
government or is this just a ruse?  Are import restrictions the next step?  

The whole nature of the compromise is very strange indeed and I would be
most interested to find out the thinking behind it.

This seems like a statement that would have come from the other side of the
debate.

While this may seem obvious to those who have watched and studied the issue
for years, the layman reading Abate's column gets a distillation of the
issue that I have not seen in other popular media.

In just two paragraphs, he explains to the unitiated reader the origin and
authority behind export controls on encryption as well as their usage by the
government to control local creation of encryption  -- a point that is
almost always missed.

Is this the statement which bothers you?  I simply read it as a summary of
both sides of the debate not as an opinion statement
