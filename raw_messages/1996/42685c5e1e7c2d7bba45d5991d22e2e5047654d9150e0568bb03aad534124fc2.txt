In controlling use of PC's and disabling re-booting - -

I think you can disable the control alt delete stuff in Linux. Besides,
Linux can be set up far more secure than Windows. 

Put Linux in the hard drives of the machines; remove the floppy drives;
disable the reset buttun; put a lockable cover plate over the power switch
and the power cord entry; put a lockable clamp over the power plug at
the wall socket; and lock the computer down onto the table.
