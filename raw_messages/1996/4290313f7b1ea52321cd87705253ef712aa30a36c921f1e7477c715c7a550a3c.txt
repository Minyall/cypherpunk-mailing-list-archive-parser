Security stand-off

The side skirmish over security protocols for credit-card payments
over the Net is just beginning to heat up.  The major combatants here
are Netscape's Secure Socket Layer (SSL), Enterprise Integration
Technologies' Secure Hypertext Protocol (S-HTTP) -- which may yet wind
up under Netscape's wing -- and Microsoft's fairly recent stab at the
issue in the form of its Secure Transaction Technology (STT).
Netscape is way ahead of the game here, having successfully weathered
the scrutiny of the ``cypherpunks'' -- above-board encryption hackers
who look for security holes.
