If you want authentication, you must use a crypto-strength MAC.
Encryption (be it RC4, DES, etc.) is not enough.

False.  CFB has limited error propagation, so if I modify any block
before the next-to-last, it will not show up with your method.



This seems to be a really common error.
If you want message integrity guarantees, you must use a MAC.  Always.
