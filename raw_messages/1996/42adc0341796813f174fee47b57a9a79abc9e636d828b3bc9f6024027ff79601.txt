Good advice. And if we are all waiting for our respective Post Offices
to come aboard we'll have to wait for a long time. I don't remember
how many years ago our Post Office was announcing 'real soon now' for
the first time, because so much time has elapsed since then. I guess
such institutions (bye economic capabilities) are mainly hiring cheap
incompetents who will never catch up with the latest developments.
