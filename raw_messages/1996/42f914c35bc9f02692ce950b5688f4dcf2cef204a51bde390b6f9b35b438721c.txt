	A bunch are listed, including RSA.  What I want to know is,
are any privacy right organizations on the comittee?  How about
consultants organizations?  I know that as a private security
consultant, I'd like to be able to join so that I can be aware of
developments, help the group clarify their aims, and provide my
customers with the best advice I can give them.

	I feel that a good white paper is very important, so we all
know where we're going, and what the road is paved with.
