Some of you may remember an assertion that I made (and posted here) about a
month ago under the the thread "Possible Java hack".  The latest publicized 
Princeton hack is exactly the same thing that I eventually came up with, and 
I've consolidated my findings at <URL: http://www.aztech.net/~steve/java/>

(Crypto and Firewalls relevance will become aparent, once you take a look.)
