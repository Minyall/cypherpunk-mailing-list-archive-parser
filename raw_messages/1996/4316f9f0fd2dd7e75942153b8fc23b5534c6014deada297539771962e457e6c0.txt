NOISE.SYS v0.5.5 should be up at ftp.funet.fi in the
/pub/crypt/random/noise055.zip.

NOISE.SYS is a /dev/random-type driver for DOS systems.

Many changes in this version, including a larger output buffer, a newer (and
better) API, nice installation messages, improved (?) entropy estimation
method, and the possibility of sampling video retrace intervals (you'll have
to rebuild the source with that option enabled though).

This installation only has the barebones documentation for now. A newer
release will eventually have some nice technotes and other goodies.
