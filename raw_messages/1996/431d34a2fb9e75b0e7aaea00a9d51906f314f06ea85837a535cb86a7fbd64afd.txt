I was using Netscape navigator and got the No Cookie error, but that
was understandable since I had set the cookes file to read only.  But
making the file writable, erasing my cache, and quitting Netscape and
bringing up a new copy of Netscape did not solve the problem.  I still
got the No Cookie error.
