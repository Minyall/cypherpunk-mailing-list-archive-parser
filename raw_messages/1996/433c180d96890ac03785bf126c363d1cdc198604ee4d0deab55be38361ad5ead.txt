I currently subscribe to DigitalLiberty and am very new to Cypherpunks. I wanted
to thank you for thinking of us "Newbies" in the Crypto field with this

I hope that your will at some time in the future seriously consider a
comprehensive book
on this and other subjects skewed towards the general public.
