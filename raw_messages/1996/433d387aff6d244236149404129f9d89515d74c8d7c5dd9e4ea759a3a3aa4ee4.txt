Corporations are state-created persons [legal definition of "person", not
colloquial vernacular]. They have some privileges which have surface 
resmblence to the rights of natural people. For example, they can "have 
standing" in a court to initiate a legal proceeding - in their own name, 
not that of an agent or employee or trustee.
