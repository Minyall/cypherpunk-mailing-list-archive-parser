	If you use a unix irc client there is a function call for crypt
that can be used to crypt decrypt data with a key. This not the best or
most secure way of doing things but it does work and it is easy to make
use of many of "Elite/warezpuppy/gotnobrian wanna b" scripts have this
already coded in. Example are phoenix, venom, and the list goes on.
