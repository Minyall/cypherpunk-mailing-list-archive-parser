	Analyzing the traffic through three remailers is more
difficult than analyzing the traffic through one.  One remailer with
three N messages per day is more secure than an equivilant remailer
with N mesasges.

	With physical remailers, you can open the inner envelopes and
read the message, leaving the end user to wonder where the post office
lost the message.  With 'real' remailers, the lost message can't be
read, only not delivered.

message is not obviously readable, why not assume that its well

customers are obeying the law (weaponsmiths, cryptographers, and banks
excepted.)
