Your use of the word "brutal" in this context is a little odd.  Since Sendero
Luminoso are extraordinarily cruel terrorists and mass murderers, it is
entirely proper and appropriate for Fujimoro to attempt to physically
exterminate them.  Possibly what you meant to imply is that Fujimoro 
failed to make adequate distinction between support for the political
ideas of terrorists, and actual participation in terror.
