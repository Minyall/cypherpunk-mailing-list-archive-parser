Hmm.  A case involving Texas cops hovering above a greenhouse for a
month using a 600mm telescope to peek through a 5-inch gap was thrown
out of court on the grounds that the crop was not in "plain view".
(Wheeler v State, Texas Court of Criminal appeals, 29/9/83).  However,
this was some time ago, so I'm sure the US constitution has been
whittled down a tad more since then.
