Well, that "if" is a critical hypothetical. I'm assuming a model in which
people perform most of their legitimate network transactions through Java 
windows. So I think they will be accustomed to typing financial identifiers 
or whatnot into windows labelled "Untrusted Applet Window". Many will
become desensitized to the UAW warning label.

I believe the work on authenticating applet servers to client in terms of
signed Java classes, etc. is the most promising long-term approach.

ObNSB: Although I seem to be cast as an opponent of Java adoption in this
thread, I'm actually a fan of Java and expect to write some Java code RSN.
