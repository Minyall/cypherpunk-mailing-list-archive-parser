You are required to suffer fools in order to maintain any sort of
credibility as the proponent of free speech.  John Gilmore has managed
to destroy his credibility.

Of course he's not required to maintain his credibility and is free to
destroy it in any way he wants to.

Nobody's trying to interfere with John Gilmore's right to practice censorship
on his private mailing list.

But to deny that he's engaging in censorship is disingenuous.
