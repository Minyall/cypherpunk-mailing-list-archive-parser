	Most protocols give you stereotyped headers, which are
perfectly valid for known plaintext attacks.  The rc4 cracks were done
on the Netscape rc4(md5(key+salt) used in ssl.  They were based on
known plaintext in the HTTP headers.

	(Incidentally, we might want to test the key distribution &
reporting mechanisms on a crack of vanilla rc4-40, or another SSL
crack.  Cracking des will not be cheap, and we should do some test
runs first.)
