I remember hearing (if my memory is correct, from the mouth of a Microsoft
employee at Crypto '96) that when Microsoft signs a module, they are certifying
that they saw a signed sheet of paper swearing that either
(1) you won't export the software, or
(2) you have received an appropriate export license.

AFAIK, they don't even read the code.
