At the risk of undercutting Bill's facetiousness, this was of course
precisely his point.

(Note: To a lot of us, even seeing the English form "I've heard that in
less civilized countries...." is almost a direct cue that a facetious
(tongue in cheek, ironic, etc.) remark is about to follow.)

I've heard that in less civilized countries, the same cues for irony may
not be widely known.
