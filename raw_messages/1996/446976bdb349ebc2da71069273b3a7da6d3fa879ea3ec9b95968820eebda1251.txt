You're jumping to a lot of conclusions. In fact, the neural net program
might well "rediscover redlining." Redlining is, after all, a rational
response to a situation in which data are murky, competition for loans is
strong, and the consequences of bad loans are serious.

(I recall reading around 1986 that such "black box" loan programs were in
fact "concluding" that loans to certain zip codes were not desirable.)

"Equal access to capital" remains the nonsense it has been in all of these
posts between Matthew and Red Rackham, and I won't get started on it here.
