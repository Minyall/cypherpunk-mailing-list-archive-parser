   7-27-96. WaPo: 
 
   A report on the Army's Battlefield Combat Identification 
   System (BCIS), designed by TRW, which identifies friendly 
   targets through triple-checked microwave pulses, encrypted 
   signals that change frequencies 43 times a second to 
   resist jamming or detection by the enemy. 
 
   (The roasting of friendlies depicted in "Courage Under 
   Fire" is cited as firing increased public interest.)
