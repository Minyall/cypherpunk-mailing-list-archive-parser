Note that John Judge, political/conspiracy researcher, has described
much or most of this material in detail in his papers and speeches,
several years ago.  The Opal File, also several years old, details the
economic takeover of New Zealand area by various parties, along with the
installment of satellites by Hughes Corp., ostensibly to search for oil
and all that stuff.

I don't have any really current Judge material, but if he's still alive,
he's probably researching the use of non-Hertzian/directed/pulsed energy
formats, or even cryptography of a fundamentally different nature than
what is commonly discussed here.
