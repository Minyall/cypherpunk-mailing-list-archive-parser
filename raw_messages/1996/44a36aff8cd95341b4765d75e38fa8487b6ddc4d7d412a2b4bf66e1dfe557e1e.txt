I have a question.

There seems to be a lot of excitement over the key escrow stuff da gubermint
is trying to install.

Couldn't one burn off maybe 10 ** 200 keys and say, hey gubermint dude, these
are like, gonna be my keys.

Wouldn't this place them into a brute force search if they wanted to play
with your info?

Doing this will likely add to the tax burden for all dem disk drives needed
to store them numbers. :(

If ya can't do that, then they must be gonna sell key space like da radio
spectrm - which means some number is gonna mean something to someone
somewhere - yum yum say the hackers and the crackers.

I'm thinking there will be a way no matter what happens....
