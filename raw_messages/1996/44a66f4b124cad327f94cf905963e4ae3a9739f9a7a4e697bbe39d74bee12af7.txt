Oh, right.  I remember now.  All the off-topic junk I see on this
list is just my imagination.  All the billions of "UNSUBSCRIBE" and
"SIGNOFF" and "SET NO-MAIL" messages I see on the mailing lists I'm on
are just bits of lint that slip by.

The "enforcement" is always a reactive thing.  I don't think you'd get
far with a parent explaining that the material they consider indecent
which somehow showed up on alt.kids.only would be dealt with by
blistering flames.

So you think those who want a "controlled cyberspace" would be happy
with newsgroups that stay "mostly decent"?  I strongly doubt it, and I
will also add that such "enforcement" is far, far less effective on
newsgroups than on mailing lists.
