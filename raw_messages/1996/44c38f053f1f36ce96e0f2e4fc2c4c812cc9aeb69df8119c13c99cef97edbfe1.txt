True.  But it is a seperate program from email clients which means that anyone
wanting to use Private Idaho has to download it, install it, and learn how to
use it in conjunction with one's email program.  Most people who may have a
need for anonymity have probably never heard of PGP or Private Idaho.  I
think that until remailer functions are actually built into the programs that
people use, remailer use will be rare.
