I have no problem with the existance of anonymous remailers, and I
don't want to see them banned or prevented -- indeed, I encourage
their existance.

However, that doesn't mean that I always favor their use, or that I
won't look down on someone for using one inappropriately.

To put it another way: I believe that every adult person has the right
to have sex with any other willing adult person. However, I think it
might not be tasteful if my neighbors decided to bugger each other on
the front lawn. Not, you understand, that it should be illegal, but it
does make me wonder about them.

In the case of the given poster, he claims that he's using anonymity
not because he fears backlash (he should but thats another story) but
as a form of "protest". This is as illogical as the content of his
messages...

Why is this sad? I think you don't get the difference between what is
permissable and what is in good taste.
