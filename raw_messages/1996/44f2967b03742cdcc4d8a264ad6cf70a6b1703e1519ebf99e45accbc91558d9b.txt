I do not believe the IRS particularly cares what all those tons of 
tax legislation books say, and I am sure they do not know.

Unicorn seems to be thinking in terms of constructing magic pieces 
of paper that will protect you from the bad boys, whereas Sandy is 
thinking in terms of making sure the bad boys cannot find your money.

While doubtless magic bits of paper are useful to some extent if 
you are a genuinely multinational corporation, if the bad boys 
see smaller fry carefully concocting magic paper they will say 
"ah, tax haven", jump on you like a ton of bricks, extort information 
from anyone in their jurisdiction as to where your money is (which 
is why Sandy recommends a lawyer who works OUTSIDE the jurisdiction) 
and confiscate all your assets and not give them back until you can 
prove you have paid taxes on everything you might possibly have 
earned and some things you could not possibly have earned.
