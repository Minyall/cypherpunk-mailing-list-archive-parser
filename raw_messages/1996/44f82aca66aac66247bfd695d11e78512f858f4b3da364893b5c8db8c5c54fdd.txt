	Anonymity only works when many people use it.  So yes, if the
gateway is discovered, the client list might be obtainable (unless
there are many entry points, each funnelling out through an point
thats designed to go down & be replaced.  Think remailer chains.)

	An ecash gateway could provide other services as well, say
currency conversion.  By offering rates slightly better than todays
market,* you can draw a lot of legit money through the system to act
as cover for other money.  Heck, people might even find its easier to
do business in the Seychelles than in New Orleans.

 *a trick which some shops play by timing their trades; if the
dollar is low today, buy a stack of dollars, when its high, sell your
excess.  Pass great rates onto your customers, and make very little on
each transaction.
