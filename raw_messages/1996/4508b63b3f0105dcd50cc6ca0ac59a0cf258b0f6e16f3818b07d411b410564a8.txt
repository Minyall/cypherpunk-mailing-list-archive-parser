It appears that someone has figured out that medium-sized jurisdictions 
don't want to be left out of the trendiness. And has put together a 
product that can be peddled at the trade shows where Police Chiefs go.

I recall reading that there's something like 25,000 different police 
departments in America. It's a sizeable market. And a very politically 
correct one, right now.

Do these managers _need_ this stuff? Well, did they _need_ all those 
black-ninja hollywood flavored SWAT uniforms?

Now, if they could just get a few more PC-of-the-month phraseologies into 
the title of their product, they'd sell twice as many.  Start with 
"anti-deadbeat-dad software", maybe. "Pro Diversity". "Environmentally 
Friendly Software".

Is America great, or what?
