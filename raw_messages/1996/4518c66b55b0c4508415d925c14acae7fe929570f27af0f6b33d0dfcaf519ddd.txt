A foreign language is useful only when there are large numbers of
folk around who speak *one* *particular* foreign language, and these
folk have knowledge and skills and power and wealth, for example
if you are close neighbor of Germany or France.

Americans feel no compulsion to learn foreign languages because
the only time they need a foreign language is spanish to
negotiate with whores.
