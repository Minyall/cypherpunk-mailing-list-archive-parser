>>>A Missive From: David Kovar (kovar@nda.com)
>>>
>>>What is the connection between crypto and bagpipes? Well
>>>crypto is regarded as an armament by the US ITAR regulations.
>>>Later this month a British court is to rule as to whether
>>>bagpipes are still classified as "instruments of war"!
>>>The story is in today's Times newspaper (The British one)
>>>It seems that a piper is being taken to court for practising
>>>on Hampstead Heath, which has a bye-law forbidding music.
>>>Mr Brooks, the piper, has denied the charge, citing a case in 1746,
>>>where bagpipes were declared to be instruments of war, not musical
>>>instruments, and a subsequent Act of Parliament which specifically
>>>stated that they were weapons. He claims he wasn't playing a musical
>>>instrument, but practising with a weapon!
>>>
>>>The imagination boggles if his claim is successful! Will it
>>>be possible to sue pipers for assault with a deadly weapon?
>>>Will airports be equipped with bagpipe detectors?
