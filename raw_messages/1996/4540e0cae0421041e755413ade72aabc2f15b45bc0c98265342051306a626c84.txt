Wei Dai's crypto++ has pretty much everything, in c++. 
<http://www.eskimo.com/~weidai> has the info and a pointer to
the latest version (2.0) at an export-controlled-site.

The old versions, (1.0 still has the algorithms RSADSI disputed) 
are available in <ftp://ftp.utopia.kacktic.nl/pub/replay/pub/crypto/LIBS> 
under the names crypto10.zip and crypto11.zip (I think). I didn't see 2.0 .

I think Hal Finney's has some of it ported to Java. ( www.portal.com is 
inaccessible at the moment)
