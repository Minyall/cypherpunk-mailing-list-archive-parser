Hello!

It could receive message but not remail. What could be the problem?
A sample of the Statistics Table is as follows:

Messages remailed      0
Messages discarded    3
Messages received    10

Other particulars are:

1) Pool set as 3 for light traffic
2) POP 3 working fine in other email applications.
3) Platform is Windows 3.1

Some Questions:

1) What should be the entries in the PGP Options dialogue box?
2) Do I have to create separate public and secret keyrings for 
the remailer?

Would apprecaite any help.

Makofi
