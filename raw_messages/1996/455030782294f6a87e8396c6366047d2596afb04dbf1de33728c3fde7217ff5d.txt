Okay, so i'm an idiot. :)  I ran out the door in such a hurry on friday
that I didn't bother to make the asendmail package globally readable.
Apologies to everyone who tried to get a copy and got a permission denied.

It is now really and truely available from:

http://www.infonex.com/~ncognito/asendmail.tar.gz

Sorry for the hassles.
