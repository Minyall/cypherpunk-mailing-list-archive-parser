You should have stuck with that.

Unknown. Cracking 3DES and 1024 bit RSA are both hard, but the
algorithms used for brute forcing both of them are very different. I
would say that making comparisons between them is probably in general
a bad idea, especially given that over long periods of time the
techniques used improve at different rates.

The conservative attitude is, in any case, always "encrypt until it
hurts and then back off a little bit."
