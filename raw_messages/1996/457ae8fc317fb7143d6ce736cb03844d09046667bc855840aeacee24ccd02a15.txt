My recollection is that when IBM first started selling IBM PC, they offered
a choice of (at least) 3 operating systems right from the start: UCSD p-system,
CP/M-86 or PC-DOS.  IBM didn't do anything to prompte PC-DOS over the other
two. It won fair and square in the marketplace because the other two were
even worse crap. (Later versions of CP/M-86 got much better.)
