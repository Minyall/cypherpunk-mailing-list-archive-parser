This has happened before; an Aegis ship in the Persian Gulf shot down
an Iranian Airlines (or whatever it's called) aircraft; i'm not sure
how many died in that incident (i think about 70 - can very well be
wrong). The US just "apologized" for the mistake AFAIK.

PS. This happened 8-10 years ago if i recall well.
