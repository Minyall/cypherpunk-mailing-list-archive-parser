I posted it for two reasons.  

1) There have been alot of rumors spread about what the Registration Wizard
does and does not do to comprimise your privacy.  This dispells many of
those rumors.

2) The program's use of encryption to conceal what products it looks for.

If I was going to post unrelated articles of that site, it would have been
the Win95 dirtly little secrets article and/or the Softram hoax.
