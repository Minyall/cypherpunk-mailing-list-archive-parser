Despite the ugliness of floating point arithmetic (lack of
associativity, for example) and my general distaste for it, I would
have to agree that 64-bit floats are higher precision than 32-bit
fixed-points, since more than half the bits are mantissa.

Do major currency traders really store money as 64-bit floats?  It
surprises me.

By the way, I thought the "get real" pun was funny and not at all
disparaging.  But I hope that "get rational" is good enough for
currency exchange.
