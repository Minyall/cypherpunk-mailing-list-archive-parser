	Actually, a simulation ought to work pretty well at fooling most extant
devices, and any devices likely to be developed soon. Now, fooling the guards
watching you at a secure site may be a problem (a hand up your sleeve?), as
may getting someone else's biometric information in the first place. The
latter gets into the area of cryptography since whoever has such information
(other than the original possessor) is likely to hash it anyway.
