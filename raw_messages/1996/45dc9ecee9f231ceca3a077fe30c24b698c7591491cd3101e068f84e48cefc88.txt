In light of recent claims,i would like somebody to clear this up for me.
There seems to be a great deal of conjecture over wether or not the Deeyenda Virus exhists.
Symantec denies it's existence,although i hear differently??
Greatly appreciate anyone who can shed some light on the subject,even though C-punks list doesnt usually deal with this topic of thought ;)
Anyone come across the pkz300 trojan,if you have it send it please.
A student,a paper,and a possible future career are at stake here,so please dig deep into your 
pockets!!!!!! Asking a lot i know!
