Per the tendency of federal agencies to let it be publicly known that 
they lie openly to trap suspects (and apparently this technique has been 
OK'd for local enforcement as well):

This is going to backfire on them (and us), and probably has already.
If govt. protects its "sources and methods", however nefarious, to the 
extent that the public is never asked to assent to these methods (even 
though a few of us know about them anyway), then the public doesn't have 
to become overtly cynical about what's going on.

On the other hand, whether you think the people have this much right to 
know or not, when the public consciousness embraces the concept that the 
police openly and regularly lie (and that it's a "good thing" they do), 
the result will be greater public cynicism, distrust, paranoia, hatred, 
and anarchy (the bad kind).
