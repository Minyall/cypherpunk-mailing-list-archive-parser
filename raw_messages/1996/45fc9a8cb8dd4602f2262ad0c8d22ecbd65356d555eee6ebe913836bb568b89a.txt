I have several pieces of evidence which suggest to me that the government
is leaning on companies in ways which are not always apparent. (I can't
share all of the evidence I have...I know this is unsatisfying. I'm not
asking you to "trust me," just noting that this is what I have either heard
from usually reliable sources or from direct participants.)

I am reluctant to ascribe malice to any of the players in this drama, just
differing goals (in the Great Game).
