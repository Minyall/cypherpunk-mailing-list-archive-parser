However, accounting systems DO NOT use 32 bit fixed point arithmetic.

One client of mine had around $10Billion under management. Do you
think they were doing their accounting on a system that could only
deal with fixed point numbers of 45Million or so? Hell, individual
trades are larger.

Floating point systems are built to do approximate math on a very wide
range of number sizes. Accounting systems require exact math -- down
to the cent. Floats aren't suitable.

Anyone who needs to understand why should go off and read Knuth,
Volume 2.
