can our gov possibly enforce this crypto law? --esp over the net?
I think what happend is the dod released the net (arpanet/Internet) to the
people without looking at the implications that could arise.  The people now
control the net and not the gov--and they don't like it!
anyway our government is ruled by the people for the people--so we should
not have any kind of special laws--ones that only apply to the net and not
the rest of the world, after all we have a thing called free speech!
