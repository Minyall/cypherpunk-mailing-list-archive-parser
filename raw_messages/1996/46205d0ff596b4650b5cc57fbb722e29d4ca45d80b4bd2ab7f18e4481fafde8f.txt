     Am I the only one in this country who, when hearing about TWA f800 
shrugged his shoulders and thought (or said) "Time flies and aeroplanes 
crash" (Name the band and album and I'll be impressed)?

     Shit breaks. When shit breaks or gets broken on an airplane, people
die. People do this (dying, but not on airplane) all the time, rich people
poor people, bright people, stupid people. 

     We all will die at some point, it is like taking a shit, everybody 
does it, and it has to happen. What is the big deal? I can understand feeling 
sad when a loved one dies, or happy when it happens to someone who you think
diserves it, but, like I said it'll happen to all of us sooner or later.

     I won't even go into the amount of coverage this crash got compared to
the inital reports of the value jet crash.
