Nothing, but we're not doing that, and nobody has asked us to.
If we did something like that, I imagine you'd know up front.

We've been busy getting the damn process to work and get
approved.  It's simple this way.  There's one CGI and
when you run it, it produces output and ergo that's the
"filename" you see.  With some time, we could get clever
and synthesize the name you want.  It's not the highest
of priorities in this process right now.
