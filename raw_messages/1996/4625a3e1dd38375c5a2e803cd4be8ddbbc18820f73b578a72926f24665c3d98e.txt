Agreed, for a large number of users (say >1,000) it is quite difficult
for one thing, running crack can be too time consuming to be feasible. 
For a small number of users (many of the LANs I administer have less
than 30 users), however, it is not at all difficult. It helps, of
course, if you can trust your local users --- possible when there are
only a few and you know them all, impossible when there are many and
they are faceless. 

The less work I have to do to keep the systems/network secure, the more
time I can make available for *real* work on those system. Few sites can
afford a full-time security person, that is the reality that I live in
anyway.
