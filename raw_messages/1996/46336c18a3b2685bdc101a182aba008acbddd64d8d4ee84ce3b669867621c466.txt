Me thinks this is an attempt to associate this bill with the Republicans
("the other party did it!").

  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Another P.O.S. rhetoric.  ("emerging concensus", etc ...)

Amazing!  Then why did the report conclude that key escrow should
NOT be forced upon the unsuspecting public?

Obviously.  Why?  I find this level of pure and arbitrary assertions
very distasteful.  If one can get away with making random assertions,
then one is not really responsible to the American public.

Yes, let's force the public to test it for us.  Which is what the
report recommended AGAINST.  Of course, once it is in place, it is
the standard.  Oh my god!  How did THAT happen?

Bull shit.  Every discussion has been:  "Key escrow?"  "NO!"  "Key
escrow?"  "NO!!"  "Key escrow?"  "NO!!!"  "Key escrow?"  "NO!!!!" ...

THERE is an understatement if I ever heard one ...

Sick of this P.O.S.
