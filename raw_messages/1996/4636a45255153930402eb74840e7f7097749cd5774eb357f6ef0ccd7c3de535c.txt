Cypherpunks always has been and remains an open list.  You shouldn't
need to wonder given cypherpunk views on free speech :-)

No.  But I too am rather suprised to hear an EFF board member
apparently speaking against free speech.  OK, so maybe she was
mis-quoted so I wait for her rebuttal, but nope, she basically to my
reading reiterates nothing but negative opinions on free speech and
anonymity.

Tim's quotes of her CFP speech further demonstrates her leanings.

Lets put it this way: if Louis Freeh offered to be an EFF board
member, would you take him on board?  If he seemed quite
pro-anonymity, and free speech, and later turned out to be having
doubts, would you keep him?

Ie if her views are proving a liability for EFFs reputation, perhaps
you all ought to get together and see if you can work something out?

Anonymity is a pretty darn major issue here, so it'd be really sad to
see EFF coming down on the wrong side.  I've seen some of the other
EFF insiders own opinions, and would like to see them adopted in place
of Dyson's views, which whether they are her opinion or not, are more
likely to get misrepresented by the press as such, in face of a lack
of an EFF position.  EPICs statement looked a reasonable start.

She sounded pretty anti-anonymity to me.

Are there a shortage of political and net-aware libertarians for board
candidates or something?

Perhaps the quote was unfortunate, perhaps she has also said
pro-anonymity things.  But a person who is pro-anonymity would surely
try to emphasise the pro arguments also?  The material I have seen so
far does not seem to indicate that this is the case.

If this is the case she needs to be _much_ more careful about what she
says in `personal' interviews.

Be sure to express the pro-anonymity arguments while you're zealously
hammering out every last thing that can go wrong with anonymity: like
that free speech is not possible with out it.  It's pretty much all or
nothing, either you think free speech is worth the risk, or you prefer
big brother, government access to keys, the works.
