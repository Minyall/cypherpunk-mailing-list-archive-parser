John Thomas has provided copies of printed material
handed out at the Dallas meeting on FIPS for the Federal
Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) on December 5-6.

It consists of lists of particpants, charts, diagrams and
outlines of the government's prayerful intentions for KMI 
which Mr. Thomas admirably assessed in his post earlier today.

We've digitized and put it with his post on the meeting at:
