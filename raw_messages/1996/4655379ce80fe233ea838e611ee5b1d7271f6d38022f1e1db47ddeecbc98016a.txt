Is this the St. Martin's Press "True Names" edition that was listed in 
amazon.com? At one time, it was going to be released August or Sept. of this
year.

I have to mention that the owner of Dreamhaven Books here in Minneapolis
complained to me last year that he has a "truckload" of remaindered copies
of "Peace War". They still have a bunch--every time I've been in there, 
there's a hardbound "Peace War" on display with a price tag of $1.00.
Buying a copy of "True Names" right now is about as easy as buying an
original Dead Sea Scroll--but if anybody wants a cheap copy of "Peace War",
look up Dreamhaven in Minneapolis.
