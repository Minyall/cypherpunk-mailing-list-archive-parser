I'm concerned that it may not last though.  Many people now complain about
how low the signal to noise ratio is (even more than they complain about
this list). I've heard people say that they have given up on newsgroups in
favor of mailing list, web-zines, etc.  So, if it gets too bad, might it
just fade away? Or, if it remains but becomes unpopular, will it be easy to
restrict if we use it for anonymous messages?

In the U.S., at least, attempts to enforce identification of Internet users
or anonymous posters to newgroups and such are likely to meet with stiff
legal resistance.  The Supreme Court has ruled that anonymous use of
protected speech (e.g., political handbills) must be permitted.
