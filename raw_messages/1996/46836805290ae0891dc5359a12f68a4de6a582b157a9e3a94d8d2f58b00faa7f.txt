I don't understand this conclusion.  One book people aside, it is generally
believed that humans evolved in an evolutionary context and they certainly
frequently use cooperative strategies.  Cooperation usually also involves
the ability to sanction misbehavior.  Unilateral disarmament is throwing
away your sanction.
