I misdirected this yesterday. Yes, its relevant: it answers the
contention that ecash somehow lowers government seignorage income.

Ah, no. Sorry.

The Fed does indeed monetize debt, but 1) that isn't related to
seignorage, and 2) all new money is monetized debt, and it makes no
difference whether it is held in paper or bank accounts or anything
else.

Again, you really don't know what you are talking about.

The vast bulk of the money in the field is not currency. Most of it is
in the form of bank deposits and is circulated through bank mechanisms
like checks and such.

When the Fed wants to expand the money supply, it buys government debt
on the open market, paying for it with nothing at all other than
changing numbers in the Fed's computers. This is how debt is
monetized. The bulk of that money never becomes dollar bills, and
whether it is circulated via checks or ecash or direct deposit or
whatever makes no difference to the amount of fake interest earned. I
say "fake interest" because it isn't real income to the government at
all.

The amount of currency in circulation is dependant purely on demand by
consumers, via banks, for currency. When banks want dollar bills, they
ask the Fed -- they hand the fed electronic money and the fed gives
them back dollar bills. The amount of currency, however, has nothing
to do with the amount of bonds being held -- whether the monetized
debt is held in bank accounts, in dollar bills, or in ecash makes
absolutely no difference.

Again, you just don't know what you are talking about. E-Cash has no
impact on the fake interest earned by the fed, which is not seignorage
to begin with.
