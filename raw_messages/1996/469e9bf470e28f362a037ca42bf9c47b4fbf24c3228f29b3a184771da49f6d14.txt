No, mh is sufficient for all your mail handling needs.


"man slocal" for starters.  For advanced stuff you can always 
write a script that takes messages and chews on them and either 
sends them to rcvstore or to /dev/null.


I think I'll write a script that parses each letter looking for
text from D**** S********* and adds that text to my "D**** 
S********* Travesty Database".  Then it will select random 
sentences from that database and construct long cascade insult-
fests between D**** S********* and himself and mail them to 
cypherpunks via an anonymous remailer.


Just kidding.


I think I'll write a script which globally searches and replaces
"D**** S*********" with "Duncan Frissell" in my cpunks folder.



Just kidding again.


Okay bye.
