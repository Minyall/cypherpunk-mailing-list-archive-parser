And not only is OCR able these days to handle general fonts easily enough,
but almost all printed code is in fixed-width fonts, i.e., non-proportional
fonts. This makes OCR easy. (I'm no longer a heavy duty OCR inputter, but I
used to get nearly 100% accuracy even on things like Times Roman
proportional fonts...Courier and other fixed fonts were child's play.)

But there's an even bigger issue: human inputting of text is _cheap_,
especially in various Third World nations which have a thriving industry
doing this. (For example, various credict card companies ship their paper
copies of credit trasnsactions to warehouses of people in places like
Barbados for manual keying in of data.)

For just the amount of money we've spent (in our consulting fees) on
discussing just this issue of OCRing, the entire content of the MIT PGP
source code book AND Schneier's AC could have been manually inputted by
Barbadans or Botswanas, or probably even by Europeans.

Of course, there are vastly easier and cheaper routes, such as just sending
the stuff directly, but this makes the point that there is no difference
between text and machine readable text.
