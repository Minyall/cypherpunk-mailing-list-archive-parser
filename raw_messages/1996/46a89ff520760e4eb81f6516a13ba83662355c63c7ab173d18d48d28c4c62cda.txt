I haven't revisited the site to check, but I distinctly remember a
statement to the effect that the system was a one time pad system. 
However, due to a mistake somewhere in the chain, some of the one time pads
were used twice.  The resulting two time pad system gave NSA the wedge they
needed to recover what they have.
