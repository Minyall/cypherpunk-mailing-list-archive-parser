There are people and companies who make a nice business in currency
exchange, ranging from the large companies one finds in international
airline terminals and banks to the smaller, "Mom and Pop" moneychangers one
finds in barrios and other such places.

These moneychangers attempt to make a "profit" on each exchange (else
they'd hardly stay in business).

It will probably come as a surprise to them that, according to both a CPA
and Jim Bell, no taxes are owed on their businesses, as "no wealth was
created."

Don't believe everything you read on this list, folks.
