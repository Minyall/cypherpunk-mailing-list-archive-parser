The intent of that law is to prevent the shifting of advertising costs to the
unwilling recipients of junk faxes.  (The $500 per message damages figure is what
prompted me to raise my proofreading rates to $500 per message.)

Twisting this law to apply it to junk email sent to computers with carefully
selected peripherals and net connections is certainly following that
anti-cost-shifting intent.  Quite amazing, that, to twist a law so cruelly and at
the same time follow its intent.

However, which way a judge would jump on it remains to be seen.  One source
considers its application to junk email to be unlikely, because in essence it's
too much of a twist.

See:
        http://www.ca-probate.com/faxlaw.htm
for another copy of the law, and
        http://techweb.cmp.com/net/issues/036issue/036law.htm
for an opinion that actual application of the law to junk email is unlikely.
