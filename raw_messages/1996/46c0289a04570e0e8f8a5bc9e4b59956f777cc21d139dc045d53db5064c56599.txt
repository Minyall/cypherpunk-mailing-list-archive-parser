But, define "malicious purpose."  One man's low-level format is another 
man's desired application of the moment.  I hate to paraphrase a tired 
line, but "self-replicating programs don't hurt computers - mean people 
do."  The term "virus" connotes a pathogenic quality in the mind of 
many.  Unfortunately, this tendency continues in the use of the word 
'virus' within our community.

While I understand that "intent" is something with which lawyers have to 
contend when they defend or prosecute a case, I don't think that the 
notion of intent to commit harm extrapolates correctly into the field of 
virus writing.
