I'm trying to figure out what the difference is (legal) between a "book" an 
an "OCR-able" book.  FAIK, all fonts are OCR-able, simply with widely 
varying degrees of difficulty.  A fixed-spacing, non-microspace justified 
typewriter font is probably one of the easiest ones to OCR.   Did the export 
license application for this "OCR-able" book say that "It's an OCR-able" 
book, or did they just include a copy of that book on paper?
