Yes, but because of the fact that they can't store everything, and will
have to be selective, many holes can be found.  This is why we have stego.

But most of the time it would take them long enough to decrypt that the
statute of limitations for the crime has worn out.  So unless they can do
it real-time, or at least within a _few_ years, it becomes useless except
for defimation of the suspect's character.
