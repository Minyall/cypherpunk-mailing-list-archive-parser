As much as I dislike Perry's strutting on CP, I dislike even more folks
who dream up some hair-brained scheme, then claim it's the greatest thing
since sliced bread, without so much as anything approaching peer review,
and are obviously out to make a quick buck when they take the company
public.  I hate to say it in public, but Perry's 100% correct.

Especially ones who end their rants with multiple exclamation marks.  The
more exclamation marks I see, the faster the message gets thrown in the
trash.
