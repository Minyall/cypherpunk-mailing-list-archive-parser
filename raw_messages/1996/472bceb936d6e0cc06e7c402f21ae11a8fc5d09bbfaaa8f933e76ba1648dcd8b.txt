I set the article up with a dark red background and large, yellow lettering
- and posted it on my home page.

Underneath the article is a picture of Lenny Bruce, with the caption

"Lenny Bruce
A better protector of your freedoms than Pat Robertson."

Also on my page is a letter from a pot head who e-mailed every congress
person on the net and invited them to arrest him for smoking pot.
