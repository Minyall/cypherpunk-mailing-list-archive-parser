Hi!

There appears to be some new Netscape files with US
encryption in ftp://utopia.hacktic.nl/pub/replay/pub/incoming/

netscape-fts2-hp10.tar.gz	Fast Track Server 2.0 for HPUX10
netscape-fts2-nt.exe		Fast Track Server 2.0 for WinNT
netscape-hpus-30b5.tar.gz	Navigator 3.0b5 for HP-UX
netscape-linux-30b5.tar.gz	Navigator 3.0b5 for Linux
netscape-ssl30-src.tar.gz	SSL 3.0 source code
netscape32us-30b5.exe		Navigator 3.0b5 for Win95/NT

By the way, is it possible to get a certificate for the
Fast Track 128 bit servers outside of north america? Or
would the certificate issuer be conspiring to export
crypto if he exported a certificate?
