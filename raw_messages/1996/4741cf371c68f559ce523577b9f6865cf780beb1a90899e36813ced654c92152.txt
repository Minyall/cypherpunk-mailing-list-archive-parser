Thanks to Harry and Kenneth for correcting the URL for the
NISSC96 papers.

We've converted the toc.pdf to HTML for easy scanning of 
the impressive list of papers and panels:

   http://jya.com/nissc96.htm

Now who's going hyper-link the TOC to the files? Ease the
scrooge download torture?
