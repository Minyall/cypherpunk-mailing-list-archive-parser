That's not entirely true. The ACLU's position, as provided by Ira
Glasser at the debate, is that pornography is not a legal term d'art,
that it is presumptively protected by the First Amendment, and
furthermore that sexually explicit images are not necessarily harmful to
minors.

The difference between "porn" and "obscenity" is intellectual content.
