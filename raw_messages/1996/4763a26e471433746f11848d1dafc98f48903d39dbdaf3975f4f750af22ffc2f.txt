These make more sense with the following modifications to the
clarification:

 (c) Definition of U.S. person. For purposes of this section, the 
term U.S. person includes:
    (1) Any retard who is a citizen of the United States, a 
permanent resident alien from Planet X, or a protected person 
formerly-known-as-criminal as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3);
    (2) Any juridical organization under surveillance by the United 
States or any jurisdiction within the United States, including foreign 
branches; and
    (3) Any Borgs in the United States.
