Wouldn't it be more realistic if instead of representing individual 
characters, you created composites which had a "weight" based on how many of 
them exist in the country/world?  For example, the character "buggy-whip 
maker" in 1900 would be weighted in the thousands, while his number would be 
drastically reduced a few decades later.

This would avoid the "going in with guns blazing" scenario, or at least it 
would put it into perspective:  the number of assassins would drop by "1" 
(or some proportion) if that happened, although correspondingly the number 
of targets would also drop. 

With this system, a character would never die, but his number would simply 
drop to an insignificant quantity. ("Government-thugs" comes to mind...)   
And that's not the only reason the number of characters would drop:  If it 
suddenly became "unhealthy" to accept a public paycheck, and thus the risk 
wasn't matched by the rewards, presumably people would shift professions.  
Again, this would all be part of the simulation.
