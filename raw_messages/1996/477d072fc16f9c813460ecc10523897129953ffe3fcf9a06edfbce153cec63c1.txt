I'm curious as to how C2 is going about this `internationalization'
process?  Do you do your software development outside the US?  Do you
do a joint development inside and outside with clean room code?  Do
you export software with hooks, and employ lawyers to defend against
the possibility of getting knobbled for ITAR violation on this basis?

Regardless, congratulations on another good product, deliverable
worldwide.  A very cypherpunkly goal, strong crypto deployment.
