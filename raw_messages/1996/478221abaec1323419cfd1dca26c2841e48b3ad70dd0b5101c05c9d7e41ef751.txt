Perry,

Can we add "Doc" Hallam-Baker to the pledge program?

Seriously, c-punks is an incredibly valuable resource/forum. There are many
hundreds of folks on the list (like me) who may not have the relevant
technical expertise to contribute intelligently and/or frequently, but I
think that we all _learn_ a great deal by reading the timely and thoughtful
essays, debates, and points of view selflessly and sometimes thanklessly
contributed by the likes of (in no particular order and by no means
inclusively) Messrs. May, Sandfort, Unicorn, Green, Parekh, your goodself
and many, many, many others.

Of course, there are always those who will willfully waste thousands of
man-hours per day for the list with their obviously unwelcome drivel (I do
not here make reference to the clueless "suscrives" who stumble onto the
list with questions about "kewl stuff").

In a physical setting, even the most obtuse person eventually realizes that
he or she is being ostracized, but in the ether...

(Sigh...)
