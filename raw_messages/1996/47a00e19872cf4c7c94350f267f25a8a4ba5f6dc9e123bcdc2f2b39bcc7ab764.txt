Nowhere in the Constitution does it say that firearms (or crypto in this case)
are a threat to national security.  In fact, the second amendment explicitly
dictates that people have the right to own firearms.  The term "national
security" has been used too often to justify the government's actions.
National security means making sure that terrorists don't find out the ICBM
lauch codes, not making it illegal for people to use unescrowed encryption.
