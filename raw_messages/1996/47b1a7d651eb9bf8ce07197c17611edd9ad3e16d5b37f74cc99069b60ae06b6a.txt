If y'all have heard, Clinton signed an executive order 2 days ago creating a
new panel to examine how to "protect" "critical" computer systems. The panel
will be made of of the usual suspects with a non-govt person ($5.00 says it
will be someone from one of those wonderfully independant companies like SAIC,
MITRETEC, EDS, E-Systems). 

Needless to say, it looks an awful lot like NSDD-145 all over again with the
panel recommending changes to the law to allo for greater coordination of LE,
intell for govt computers and god knows what for non-govt computers.

Anyway, the directive is now up on our site at
