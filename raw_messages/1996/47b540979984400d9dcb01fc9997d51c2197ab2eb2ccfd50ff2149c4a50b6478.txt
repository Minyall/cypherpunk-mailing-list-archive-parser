Hey motherfucker, I TOLD YOU to leave out the stupid
cypherpunks header!  Just when are you going to learn

Hey cocksucker, the KKK have nothing to do with faggots!

There is a basic understanding in life by ALL GOOD MEN
that Faggots are defective creatures.  NOBODY wants to
be seen with or associated with faggots!

John Gilmore is a Faggot, therefore he is defective.
And we question any of his associates.
open and shut case.
