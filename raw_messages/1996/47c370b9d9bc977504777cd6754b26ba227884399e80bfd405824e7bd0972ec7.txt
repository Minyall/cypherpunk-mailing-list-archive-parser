Mr. Freeh, 
   testifying at Thursday's hearing in favor of an optional 
   key escrow plan, noted that the point is not to prevent all 
   copies of uncrackable code from going abroad --  that's 
   clearly impossible -- but to prevent such high-level code 
   from becoming the international standard, with architecture 
   and transmission channels all unreadable to world 
   authorities.


Looks like the fibbies (FBI) haven't been reading the "Proceedings of the
IETF".  Strong crypto is already an international standard.
