I just got back to Chapel Hill, dug up my NTK docs, and you go and do 
this :-)

Newton script is not a particularly ideal language for crypto (or 
networking). It's byte code interpreted, and more annoyingly, has 30 bit 
integers. The C++ compiler has been promised for a while, but it looks 
like it may actually appear soon (the new newtons seem to be doing really 
well on word-of-mouth- at the moment I guess apple will do anything that 
will get the cash flowing :-(
