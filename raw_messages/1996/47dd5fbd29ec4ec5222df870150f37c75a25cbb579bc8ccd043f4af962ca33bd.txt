You beat me to it.

Anyone have the current black-letter regulations? I'll have some time
to kill over the holidays that might as well be used for civil 
disobedience. What's likely to happen to me if I refuse to show ID? 
Provide invalid ID, don't get caught, then publicize the fact? Provide 
invalid ID and get caught? Or, better:

"My wallet was stolen. The only ID I have on me is my ACLU membership 
card and my PGP key. Can I still get on the plane?"

I'm serious. Short domestic flight, no pressing appointments. This could 
be fun.
