Er, yes, I see I misspoke again. (Speaking well outside my areas of
technical expertise tends towards the manifestation of such gaffes, so I'd
be perfectly happy just to shut up if y'all would stop asking me direct
questions.) 

To the extent I have any clue what I mean myself, my position is that the
privileges accorded to a particular bit of untrusted code should not be
derived automatically from the signature on said code.
