I doubt that. PGP has been distributed for years with less safeguards than
Netscape. It is available on more free-world sites than Netscape US. This
did not prompt the powers that be to force MIT to take down their site. The
feds know that it is impossible to prevent software that is available on
the net from being exported. Why would they harass Netscape once the
inevitable happens?

   Defeat the Demopublican Unity Party. Vote no on Clinton/Dole in November.
