	However, if you're tired of the Lesser of N evils, 
	Cthulu's export policy is that you can't escape 
	anyway, and your puny mortal lives will be absorbed 
	along with his morning coffee.  Your encryption 
	technology is futile against the Elder Gods, and the 
	arcane formulas in the Cyphernomicon of that mad 
	physicist Tim The Enchanter may summon spirits from 
	the vasty deep, but no secrets are safe from 
	Nyarla-S-Ahothep who knows all and sees all.
