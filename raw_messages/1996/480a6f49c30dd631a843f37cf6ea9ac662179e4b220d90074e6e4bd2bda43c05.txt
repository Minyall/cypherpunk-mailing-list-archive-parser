this program is not specific to credit card numbers.  it sounds like
it could have just as easily been written to watch for a login: or
password: prompt and then record everything entered after that.

the point is not that this can be done, the point is that users need
tools that would check for programs like this running on their
system.  is fv making a 'fix' available?  i would imagine a  'fix'
would be a program that would look for tsr type programs (or inits on
a mac) that do this sort of thing.  

this is the sort of thing that crypto can help with.  there should be
a site that PGP signs the programs available from their site.  these
signed programs will have been testing on the appropriate system and
verified to be free of small malicious programs such as the one you
describe.  alternatively, the author themselves could PGP sign the app
(this is already done) and this would be what users should d/l.

it's disapointing to see the spin put on this by fv.  instead of
going with scare tactics, they could encourage PGP signatures and suggest
solutions to this problem like the ones i mentioned above.  in fact,
fv could even volunteer to help set up a site where all software has
been tested and signed by someone who has had their PGP key signed by
fv, sort of an expansion of the web of trust.
