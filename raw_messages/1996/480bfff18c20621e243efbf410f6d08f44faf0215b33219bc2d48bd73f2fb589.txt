This sounds a lot like Ray Cromwell's program, "decense".  It's more or less
the web equivalent of the penet remailer.  It is possible to attack even if
requests and responses are encrypted with traffic analysis.  The main objective
of such a system would be to make it very difficult to match a "real" URL with
the "anonymous" one, but not virtually impossible.  Encrypting the site list
won't help because the key would have to be stored somewhere on the system.
Many web servers have a security hole in them where the source code for a
CGI script can be requested instead of actually executing the script.  It's
not a good idea to assume that the executable will not be readable by anyone.
