re:
>          GET ME OFF THE DAMN LIST

Read the damn directions you got when you signed on.  You know, that first
message that told you to save the damn message in case you ever wanted to
sign off the list in the future.

Your cluelessness does not create any obligation in me to fix your problem.
Perhaps if you were a little less rude someone might be inspired to give
you useful information.
