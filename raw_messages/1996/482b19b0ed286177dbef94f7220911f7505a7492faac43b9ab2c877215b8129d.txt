This is the first in a regular series of postings of cypherpunks
who have joined big brothers fight to deprive you from Unescrowed
Crypto. Some of these pigs have come out in favor of the new anticrypto
bill which makes it a crime to use crypto if big bro can't read it
and also sets up key escrow but others have just said that they
don't care if the government can read YOUR mail as long as they get
what they want.

A few megabytes an hour of email from real cypherpunks/patriots
should help these guys see the errors of their way when they give away
your rights.
