Actually, here in Oklahoma almost everyone has a gun (not that they use
them though, but many carry). Incidentally, everyone including most down
to earth truckers is exceedingly polite. When I went to NYC first time,
I was shocked how less polite people were in comparison with Oklahomans.

Are the folks in Flushing, NY or around Avenue of the Americas allowed to
possess firearms? :)

Russians in Russia are even less polite, and guns are outlawed.

Maybe your hint really makes sense and after initial depopulation the
citizens will use different, more considerate, ways of dealing with each
other. Or, alternatively, maybe people will hide behind anonymity most
of the time to avoid becoming vistims of jimbell's clearinghouse.
Really, it is very hard to assasssinate username@alpha.c2.org, although
it is possible to hire nyms to write programs and pay them hard earned
digicash.

If we think about anonymous computer contractors and anonymous
employers, the interesting question is how to maintain reputations and
how to check references.
