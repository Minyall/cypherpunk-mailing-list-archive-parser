OK, nice pictures of some interesting-looking people.
But the only globally known participant featured is
Eric Hughes; he is also the only one presented with
a second name. For the others, it would be nice if
you wrote clarifying texts, including crypto-anarchic
relevance, in the way of:

'N.N., well known Java-programmer who wrote the Foo
 firewall-cracker.

 N.N., fanatical anarcho-capitalist with $2M in
 Cayman bank accounts.

 N.N., wife of N.N., cute and proficient at Word
 and Pagemaker, voted for Clinton.

 N.N., hardware salesman, boring but paid for the booze.

 N.N., as always out to get laid but didn't make it
 this time either.'

This would make the masquerade site so much more
interesting to us outsiders.
