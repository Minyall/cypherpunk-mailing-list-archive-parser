Some findings of game theory are really just formulations of common sense,
or proofs of things intuitively suspected, and are both valid and useful.
Some have worked their way into mainstream economics. I think, for example,
of the "Prisoners' Dilemma".

In fact it is exactly that result that is at the core of MAD. It only works
in advance if both sides know the payoff matrix, which is why many of the
"incomprehensible" leaks of our capabilities took place and why we took
great pains (as did the Sovs--can you say "Markov"? or "Kolmogorov"?) to do
demos of our capabilities that they could easily observe.
