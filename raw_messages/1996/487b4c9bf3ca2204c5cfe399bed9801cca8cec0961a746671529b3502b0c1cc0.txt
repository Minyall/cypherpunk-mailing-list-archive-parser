C'punks,

To which Jim Bell replied:

My question for member of this list is:  When Bell finally
goes too far and they arrest or shoot him, how can we best
capitalize on his martyrdom?  Or in a more negative light,
what damage control will we need to do in that case?

Now I know that barking dogs rarely bite, but Jim may just
fool us and find his cajones.  In any event, the sort of 
yapping he is doing could itself be considered a crime that 
could attract the sort of negative attention he apparently 
craves.

Any suggestions?
