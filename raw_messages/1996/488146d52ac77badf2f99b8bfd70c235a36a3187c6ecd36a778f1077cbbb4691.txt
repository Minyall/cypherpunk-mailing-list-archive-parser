www.altavista.digital.com, which is the address of almost everything :-)

If you don't count the parity bit as part of the byte here, you probably
shouldn't count it in a typical 7-bit-ASCII-plus-parity situation either.

As far as jamming 9-bit-bytes across a bus, that almost certainly _is_
8 bits of data and one parity bit; people have been agitating for
and debating parity on memory busses for a long time.

AT&T's Datakit switch (an ancestor of ATM) used 9-bit bytes on its data busses,
where 8 bits were data-from-outside and one bit was a control-vs-data indicator,
which let cards listening to the bus decide whether to think about the byte
with their control processors or just shove them onto an output wire.
