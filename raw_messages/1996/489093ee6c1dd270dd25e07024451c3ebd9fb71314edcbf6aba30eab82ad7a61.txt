   7-23-96, WaPo: 
 
   "The Cryptography Wars." Op-Ed By Kenneth W. Dam and 
   Herbert S. Lin 
 
      In a June 10 editorial The Post disagreed with the NRC 
      report, suggesting that law enforcement and national 
      security interests require that current restrictions on 
      cryptography be maintained. The Post asserted that it is 
      "too soon" to accept that encryption can help law 
      enforcement and national security. 
 
      But arguing that it is premature to believe some uses of 
      encryption do benefit law enforcement and national 
      security simply denies reality. We emphatically reject 
      The Post's implication that we "sacrificed" law 
      enforcement and national security considerations in 
      favor of economic interests. Indeed, only a fully open 
      and inclusive public discussion can lead to the national 
      consensus upon which any successful cryptography policy 
      will depend.
