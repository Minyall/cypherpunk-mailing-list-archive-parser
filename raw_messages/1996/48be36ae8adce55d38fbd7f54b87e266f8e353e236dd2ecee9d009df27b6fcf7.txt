I recommend a book called "Handbook for Poisoners," by Raymond Bond.  While 
it is mostly a collection of (mostly fictional) poison stories, the forward 
is a rather extensive non-fictional summary of poisons as was commonly known 
when the book was written, in 1950 or so.  The main problem is that it 
doesn't include the various anticholinesterases then known, such as Tabun or 
Sarin.
