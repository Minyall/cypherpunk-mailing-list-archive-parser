I cannot confirm that but I do know 3.0 will be downward compatible 
using RSA keys for people using 2.x, I also understand that IDEA will 
be the symmetric algorithm though I can`t confirm this.

I know 3.0 uses discrete log cryptography but whether it will be 
El Gamal or DH or other I don`t know. I would imagine in the end it 
would come down to a question of what is unpatented first and I have 
no idea on the patent date for El Gamal (is it even patented?) but DH 
hasn`t long to go....
