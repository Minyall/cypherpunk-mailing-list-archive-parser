Well - I have a very different opinion of all religions in general and
your criminal cult in particular, and I think we'll just have to agree
to disagree. We have nothing to gain by debating the virtues of LDS any
further - and if we did, we should do it on alt.religion.mormon or on
soc.religion.mormon moderated, not on this mailing list.

There's an asshole named Timmy May who started this flame thread, and
many others like it. Timmy has nothing to contribute to the cryptography
discussions, so he entertains himself by attacking various people and
their religious views and watching the resulting flame wars.

I suggest that in the future we all ignore Timmy's flame bait.
Just killfile the asshole.
