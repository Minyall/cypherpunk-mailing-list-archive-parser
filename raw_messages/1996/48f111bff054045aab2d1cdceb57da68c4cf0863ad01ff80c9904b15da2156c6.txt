I have found and reported to the anonymizer that it does not 
always protect you against perl-based cgi scripts.  I did this by 
accessing a form-based email page (based on Matt's script) which includes 
environment variable values in the msg to the recipient.  I didn't 
receive any response back from them after I emailed them the info.
