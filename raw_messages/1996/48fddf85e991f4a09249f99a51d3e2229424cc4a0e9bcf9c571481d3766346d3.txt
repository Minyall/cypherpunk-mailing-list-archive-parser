Probably a coincidence.  The last time I flew with a checked gun was
1980.  Back then, they just asked you to declare it.  In fact, I forgot
to declare it in Seattle, and in a fit of concience told a ticket agent.
Whereupon I was given a most nifty tour of the bowels of Sea-Tac to show
an agent that the piece wasn't loaded and that there was no ammo in the
same bag.  Ah, the good old days...

I've flown tens of thousands of miles on Alaska Airlines... they were
always very mellow about things other airlines seemed tense about.

One more quick anecdote:  Back in January, I happened to be "between
picture id's" and needed to fly.  I showed a 2 year expired Alaska
driver license.  The clerk had a tough time finding the DL number (I had
to show him where it was), but didn't even notice the expiration date.
He did copy the DL number into his terminal, though.
