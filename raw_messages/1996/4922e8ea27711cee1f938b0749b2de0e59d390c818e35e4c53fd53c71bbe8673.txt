I think Simon was referring to the obsolete draft that defined the content
type "application/pgp".  The multipart/signed content type, IMHO, is hardly
kludgy and is the best way to MIME encapsulate data.  "Application/pgp" is
definitely kludgy.

BTW, those of you who do use PGP/MIME signing software should tweak the
configuration a bit so there isn't an apostrophy in the MIME boundary.  This
makes it very difficult to verify the signature using metamail and possibly
other MIME interpreting programs.
