        I don't see how necessarily. (1) He supports the bill, and (2) he
thinks the bill is within the realm of constitutionality, his statement is
rather weak, but I think if you take the two points above, their summation
is obvious and _is_ contrary to the bravado of Gore's MIT commencement
speech. This is not to say he could very well back off to save face, which
is what he is starting to do, and I hope he continues to do...

For Immediate Release                                       June 12, 1996

                         STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT

The Justice Department is reviewing today's three judge panel court
decision on the Communications Decency Act.  The opinion just came down
today, and the statute says we have twenty days to make an appeal.

I remain convinced, as I was when I signed the bill, that our Constitution
allows us to help parents by enforcing this Act to prevent children from
being exposed to objectionable material transmitted though computer
networks.  I will continue to do everything I can in my Administration to
give families every available tool to protect their children from these
materials. For example, we vigorously support the development and
widespread availability of products that allow both parents and schools to
block objectionable materials from reaching computers that children use.
And we also support the industry's accelerating efforts to rate Internet
sites so that they are compatible with these blocking techniques.
