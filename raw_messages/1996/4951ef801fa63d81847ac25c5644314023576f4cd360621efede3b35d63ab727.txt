Just to clear up Rich Grave's comment regarding the Electronic
Frontiers Australia's attitude to crypto.

EFA did not object the the ABA's report and it's comment about
crypto. They did object to an earlier government report which
said that crypto should be *mandatory* - since turning people
into criminals for transmitting plaintext is just as daft as
turning them into criminals for transmitting encrypted text.

Hope this puts things straight.
