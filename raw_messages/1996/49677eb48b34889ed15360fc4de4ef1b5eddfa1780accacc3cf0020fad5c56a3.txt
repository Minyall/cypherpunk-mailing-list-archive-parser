This is the same company that made the claim earlier on this list to "break 
our code and own the company for $1".  It definately generated a lot of 
comments then, I think about six months ago.  They changed their name to 
IPG midway through the process.  This should be in the archives.  Sorry 
about the late response to this but I have been unavailable for the last 
four days working on a project and am just beginning to catch up on sleep 
and mail.
