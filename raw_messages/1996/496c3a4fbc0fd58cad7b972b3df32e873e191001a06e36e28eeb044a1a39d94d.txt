   A welcome inquiry, Tim.
   
   Is it not likely that the best crypto in many of the
   countries is kept off the market in the national interest,
   cloaked in the greatest secrecy like other crucial weapons
   of survival? Especially to defend it from NSA-like
   predators.

   Was this not the practice in the US before public key genie
   escaped?

   And is surely still the case for the very best US crypto --
   not that which can be readily purchased or purloined.

   The market, and PGP, are probably condoned as a cloak for
   the best, in the US and elsewhere. Or bait. Or traps.
