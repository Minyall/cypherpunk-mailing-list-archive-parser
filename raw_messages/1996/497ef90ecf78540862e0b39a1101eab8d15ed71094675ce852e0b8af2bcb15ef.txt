It's already been done with MS Exchange.  I assume that this new version
("Outlook", did you call it?) is backwards compatible with Exchange

gazillion Microsoft Developer network CDs one can find more information?]]

Well, the MAPI SDK used to me on the MS FTP server, but I don't know where
it is since they did their reorganization.
