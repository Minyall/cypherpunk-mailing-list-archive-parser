	Given discussions as to attorneys holding passphrases, et al, perhaps
a tutorial from the lawyers on the list (yourself and others, since
disagreements among J.D.'s have been known to happen) on what attorney-client
confidentiality does cover?

	Most of them aren't anonymous, either... although that does give me
