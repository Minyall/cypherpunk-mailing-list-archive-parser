   Can anyone in IL, or elsewhere, report more on the head-job
   of The Engineer:

   Any crypto used to authenticate the target for the boombox,
   or to obscure links to the assassin?

   How was the blast specifically targeted at him and not a
   phone borrower?

   How it was set off -- by user-dialing, remote control, some
   other means?

   Any fishy smelling brand names to immediately run from?

   Answers urgent.
