	Hmm... good question. I've seen various quotes from Randy Weaver in
various publications, including Time and other non-right-wing ones. None of
them indicated him as an actual neo-Nazi or racist, even in the stories (such
as in Time) which appeared to assume that militia member = neo-Nazi (quite
incorrect, from what I know of the subject. For instance, the most
anti-government of the gun-rights organizations, which appears to have quite a
few militia members, is Jews for Firearms Ownership. The founders of the
organization in question believe that gun rights are necessary to prevent
another Holocaust. Other gun-rights political organizations concentrate on
self-defense from non-governmental criminals). I don't know when I'll have
the time to check on the matter.

	Most mailing lists do on a regular basis... my (passing) scans of the
archives indicate that cypherpunks is prone to this.
