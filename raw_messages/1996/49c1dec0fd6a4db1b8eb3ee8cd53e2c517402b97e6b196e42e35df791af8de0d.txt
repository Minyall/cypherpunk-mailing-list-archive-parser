The latest issue of IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 
This issue contains the best papers of the IEEE symposium on securtiy and 
privacy 1994.

There is a very good artical, Prudent Engineering Practice for Crytographic 
Protocols, which I think should be required reading for all those involved in 
the design and implementation of Secure protocols.
