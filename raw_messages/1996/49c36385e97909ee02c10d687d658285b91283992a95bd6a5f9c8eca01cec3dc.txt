I think there is already work on encrypted telnet (stel) by the CERT/IT 
people.
----------------
	If a completely encrypted http method (ssl) is indeed available, a
(clunky) solution to both of the above would be a web proxy on an encrypted
server that would act like a ftp or telnet proxy. I'm not sure about the limits
of the html language for doing this (updates, et al)- it may have to be
graphics to the user and form input back, which would take a while.
