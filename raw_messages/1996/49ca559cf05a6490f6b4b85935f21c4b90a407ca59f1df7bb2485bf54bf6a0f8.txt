   6-14-96: NYT ad for The New York Times Magazine: 
 
 
   Cash is dirty. 
 
   Cash is heavy. 
 
   Cash is quaint. 
 
   Cash is expensive. 
 
   CASH IS DYING. 
 
   "You believe in banks don't you? That's good, because 
   ultimately money is backed by nothing but your own 
   confidence, habit and faith -- a form of faith as powerful 
   and essential to modern life as any religious belief. The 
   coming digital era will make this plain to everyone, as 
   never before."

   From "Dead as a Dollar" by James Gleick ...the cover 
   article in this week's issue. 
 
--------- 
 
   Yes, the James Gleick whose co-founded Pipeline is near 
   dead as a dollar. Hope his multi-million-dollar PSI-buyout 
   lives.
