Something I ran across in an old book on number theory

In 1953 D.H.Lhmer used the SWAC calculator to check for Mersenne primes 
(2^n-1). The largest one found was n=2281 - the runtime was 66 minutes.

Anybody with access to one of the new Cray fish-tanks want to get a 
datapoint for the closest machine in 96 so we can check on how well 
Moore's law worked?
