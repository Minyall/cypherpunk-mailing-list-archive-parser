Neither do I, or my friends who heard about it.

What worries me is that people still subscribe to the cypherpunks list
after this assault on free speech takes place.

If pimps like Gilmore ever succeed in controlling people in the Net,
it will be because of people accepting to become prostituted.

I am not a petty nationalist, but where I come from, after such an
expulsion a lot of people would unsubscribe, and the issue would appear
in the daily newspapers (several pages of which every week are devoted
to Internet news and activities).

Pity I'm too busy nowadays (in dictionary software production). I would
gladly write articles on Dimitri's expulsion and the facade of Free
Speech in mailing lists etc., as I occasionally have written articles
as a part-time journalist.

Believe me, the nature of the (cypherpunks) list as well as the
importance of the person expelled (at one time I wanted to interview
Dimitri for other things he exposed), makes VERY HOT NEWS indeed.

But since I have no time, it's likely someone else will report this.

What we're REALLY interested in, is exposing fallacies about
Freedom of Speech when "private mailing lists" are the biggest threat
to it, nowadays, ever since the Net was invented.

I will pass this on to relevant people and see what happens.

Sincerily

P.S. already cross-posted this to "Eleftherotypia", perhaps the biggest
     and most democratic-minded newspaper in Athens, Greece.
     (if it bounces, I got the address wrong and will resend).
