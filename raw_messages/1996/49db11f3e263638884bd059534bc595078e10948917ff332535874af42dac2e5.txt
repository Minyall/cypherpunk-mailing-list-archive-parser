Good. That's called deterrence.* The market decides.

>From your earlier message, though, describing the "spamming" you do, I
really don't see you as needing deterrence. When I hear "spam" I think of
the Jeff Slaton/Vernon Hale/Crazy Kev/John Reese variety of carpet-bombing
both Usenet and millions of email addresses indiscriminately. OTOH, if you
really target your audience well, especially if a human and not a bot is in
charge of selecting prospects, then I'd call that "cold calling,"  not
"spamming." Unsolicited email is moderately annoying, but I don't think it's
anything to complain about. I filter all mail from unknown addresses anyway. 

* - The cool thing about this kind of deterrence is, since you're only
defending virtual turf, you can sabre-rattle to your heart's content without
worrying about having to actually follow through.
