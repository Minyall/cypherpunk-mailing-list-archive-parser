Lothrop Mittenthal, who is Senior Cryptologist at TET, gave a sparsely-
attended talk about some or all of this stuff at the RSA conference in
January. The title was "Statistically Efficient Inter-round Mixing in Block
Substitution Devices". I came in late and was ill-prepared to evaluate much
of what he was presenting, so I can't offer any useful technical opinion.

Copies of his transparencies are in the RSADSC proceedings, so you might try
to borrow someone's copy, or I suppose someone could scan `em and mail you
a copy. He didn't give an email address AFAIK, but according to the
proceedings his phone is (in the PST zone) (805) 498-3621 ext. 5005

Lots of cypherpunks were wandering around there, so maybe someone else heard
the whole seminar and can comment. (CME ?)
