Let's see - since you came here, you posted many huge spams about various 
things, all of a sudden after your tiff with Tim, we started getting 
daily warnings about Tim May, followed more recently by daily warnings 
with ASCII art - in a recent message you responded to the question of 
ASCII art and thus proved your implication, the list has been getting 
much advertisement spam that starts wtih Fuck You Spams, and even more 
recently the list has been conveniently subscribed to several other 
lists, and now there is loop on the list caused by you.

I've been on this list since '93.  You've been here since what? early 
96?  You're the first and only person to be kicked off the list 
officially - even Detweiler left by his own accord. Patterns are very 
obvious.

So tell us Vileus, how much does the NSA pay you to cause mayhem on this 
list?  You certainly have lots of time on your hands, so when you aren't 
masturbating to your own posts, you're typing away more spams.  So what's 
the pay check of an NSA scumbag who does what you do for a living?
