>From what I've read about Java, it is not possible to use Java in this
way.  But keep in mind that while I've got this neat-o book on Java at my
elbow, I'm not independently wealthy nor am I a college student with lots
of time on his hands, so I haven't gotten very far into the book.  But
from what I've read and heard, it's not possible to compromise the
integrity of the interpreter - unless, of course, you buy into the
conspiracy crap that FV is trying to sell, and an Evil Computer Genius has
managed to replace your Java interpreter with one of his own design, which
he then uses to subvert your entire operating system and machine, etc.

through the hurt and the loss and the agony only the night ever hears, is a
waiting soul.  Patient, permanent, abundant, it opens its infinite heart and
asks only one thing of you ... 'Remember who it is you really are.'"
