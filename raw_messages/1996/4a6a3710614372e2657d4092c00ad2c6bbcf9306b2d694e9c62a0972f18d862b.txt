There is an ad-hoc group of government representatives (called an
"expert group" actually) working on an OECD set of cryptography policy
guidelines.

They have a big five day meeting coming up starting 12 December in
Paris.

A September draft of their guidelines was leaked and put on a WWW 
site in Austria: 

   http://www.quintessenz.at/Netzteil/OECD/index.html 

as a Word 6 file.

I got it, turned it into HTML and put it on my site with comments.

Recently, someone from the OECD crypto secretariat emailed me 
indicating they had read my comments and found them reasonably 
constructive.

I have since added more comments, which I emailed to the secretariate
person.  If anyone has something constructive to convey to them, email
me and I will put you in touch with them.

I understand there will be an article on the debate in the next 
weekly edition of The European newspaper.

The people at Quintessenz apparently have a later draft which they are
scanning and will put up on their site ASAP.
