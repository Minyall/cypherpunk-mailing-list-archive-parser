Lots of people seem to have misread my statement about java programs
and I/O.

To repeat:

I fully understand that Java is a general programming language and can
do I/O. However, "Safe" Java subsets, like the ones used for writing
applets or presumably the ones that would be needed for markets in CPU
cycles, do not do i/o. One could add i/o to the suite, but that would
be dangerous.
