Phil probably did not put up the code, but that is not the point.
They held his feet over the fire for three years and then, as the
statute of limitations ran out, dropped the case---perhaps because
they could not prove that Phil made the code available, perhaps
because they did not want to subject their position to judicial
review, probably for a combination of those reasons.  But that in no
way amounted to a change in what they claim.  In my case the
government's lawyer has made it quite clear that they would consider
putting cryptographic software on a web site as a violation, and I
don't think that for this purpose there is any distinction either in
the government's mind or in reality between an FTP site and a web
site.
