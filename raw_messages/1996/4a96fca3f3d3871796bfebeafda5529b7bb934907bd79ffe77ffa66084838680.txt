So?  I hate to be flip, but is there a coffee shortage in your area?

Stimulants don't have the same effect on everybody.  "Normal" people
who take stimulants tend to act a lot like untreated hyperactives:
jittery, unfocussed, irritable.  Your point about long term use
is well taken, many people find the positive effects wear down after
a while.  Sometimes this is alrite, because in the meantime they
have been able to learn coping strategies they were unable to learn
before.  Sometimes it is not alrite, because their problems are too
severe, & they need other treatment.
