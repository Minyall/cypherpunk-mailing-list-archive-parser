Orycon 18 is a local Science Fiction convention held at the Red Lion hotel
at Janzen Beach this weekend.  I will be having a room party for
Cypherpunks and related crypto-anarchist-types sometime during the
convention.  Anyone who wants more information, just drop me a line.

I will be on a couple of Internet related panels, as well as a "PGP and
Cryptography panel".  Anyone interested in helping out with those, contact
me as well.
