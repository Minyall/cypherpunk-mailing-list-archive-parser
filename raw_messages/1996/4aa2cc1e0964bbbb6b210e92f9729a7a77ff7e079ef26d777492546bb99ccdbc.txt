The obvious fix would just be to disallow the use of CGI scripts in anonymous
web pages.  In order for a file to be designated a CGI script, the must
be explicitly specified as such in the httpd configuration.  The web is
every bit as passive as Usenet.  The only difference is you can't make a
program that will execute on the NNTP server everytime it is retrieved (which
would be the Usenet equivalent of CGI).
