Hi.  President M5 of Psychonia here.  I'm afraid we've recently
enacted legislation in the tiny nation of Psychonia that makes it
illegal to parenthesize question marks in electronic mail messages,
because such acts are a direct offense to some of the members of
primitive hill tribes who live in remote portions of our land.

I issue this warning not to set foot in Psychonia or any of the
countries with whom we share extradition treaties, or you will be
arrested and brought here for trial, conviction, and punishment.
