First off, if you were born in the US, they have your feet and/or hand 
prints on record. Secondly, fingerprints are not an absolute proof 
positive means of identification. They are sufficiently unique enough 
that it satisfies the statistical error acceptability for many 
governmental agencies.

I wouldn't worry about it personally. There are more effective ways of 
getting around such things if you really need to. If you don't have any 
historical baggage, then don't make waves.
