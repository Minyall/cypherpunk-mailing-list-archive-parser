I just want to comment on this, as this is one of my pet peeves.

There are universally valid truths.  You implicitly admit so by
stating "...at most, one religion is correct".

The problem is we can not always determine what the universally valid
truth is (especially so in moral/religious matters), so we tend to
cop-out and say there are no truths, or something along the lines of:

"Well, that might be right for you, but not for me." 

or the one I love to hate:

"Perception is reality."
