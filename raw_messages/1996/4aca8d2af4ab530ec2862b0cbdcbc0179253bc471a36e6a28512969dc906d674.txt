	that's the bullshit they would like you to believe.

	in the first place, under military regs, a degree research would 
    be illegal without full permission.  It also was not given to just one
    unit, but to many ==and all identified ones were either SEALS or
    USMC recon and special units --why just he elite and why so many
    groups --all with a blessing...?

	you take your liberal idealism and see how long you have your 
    freedom. your probably one of those who would say "...I have the
    gold so I can buy the gun!" to which I would say, "...ah, but I have 
    the gun, so I will have both your gold and my gun."

	no, I don't follow Bo Geitz, or belong to any of the militias,
    but I expect I am a bit more pragmatic than a liberal.
