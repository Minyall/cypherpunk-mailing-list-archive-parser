I agree. This post was very funny, in the normal sense of the word.

Therefore, to ordain myself Devil's Advocate Being, is it not wrong, in
principle, for us human beings to inquire into the affairs of the humans
claiming the authority of Divine Governmental Beings? Are not the actions
of the Fort Meade Beings a matter for their own personal conscience,
absent any immediate, *direct* impact on us that would justify an
appropriate reaction, be it fight, flight, or encryption? Please assume no
funny theological beliefs in the existence of other Non-Divine Beings, or
sympathy therewith. 

Of course, on individual principle, I quite agree with you, which is why I
do not believe I could ever become a cleric or even disciple of any odd
religion. I'd really suck as a soldier, too.

However, of Hobbes, Rousseau, Marx, Motesquieu, and Locke, I find Hobbes
the most logical. People just suck, and ethics aren't enough. Karl Marx 
and Jim Bell talk about the withering away of the government, but what 
they're really talking about looks like a new and more onerous form of 
government to me. There is a need for force, and I much prefer a balance 
of powers to either unified world government or unorganized individual 
force.

Clearly there is room for maneuver as to how to organize the threat and
use of force, and most people, myself included, do not like the current 
alignment of forces. We can choose multilateral disarmament, or 
deterrence. 

Any time you talk about the organized deterrence of "Bad" behavior,
whether it comes from the NSA or the Cypherpunk Cabal, you're talking
about a system of government.
