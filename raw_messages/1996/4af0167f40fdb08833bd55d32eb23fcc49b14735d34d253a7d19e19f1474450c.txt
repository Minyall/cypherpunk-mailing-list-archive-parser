	Some of the technically less sophisticated would. But these people
hardly ever use remailers anyway.

	The way I am thinking of setting one up would work as the front
end would accept the mail, and the back end, a seperate account would
send it. By using multiple back ends, traffic analysis would be made
marginally less easy, and there would be less complaints about the front
end.
