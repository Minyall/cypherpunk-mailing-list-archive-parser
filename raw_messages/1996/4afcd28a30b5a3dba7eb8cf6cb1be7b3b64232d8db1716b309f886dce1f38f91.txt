Now, for those folks who oppose the personal ownership of firearms, or 
at least "really dangerous" firearms, I'd like to know exactly what's 
the difference (in principle) between the above "...high-quality

itself from criminal or...", and making firearms widely available?

Surely the NYT is not going to join the NRA equivalent of pro-personal- 
crypto crackpots, anarchists, and all that?
