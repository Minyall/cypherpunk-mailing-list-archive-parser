  I sent a description of an attack against FV based on replacing
or hacking winsock to cypherpunks last night.  This attack seems
to meet Borenstein's criteria of being as automated and implementable
on a mass scale as their keyboard snooping attack.  So far I have not
seen any response from FV.
