In the first place cypherpunks is distributed in the UK. That
means I can issue a writ in the UK.  Secondly I deny Alan's claim
that I have contravened the US imigration laws. Since I am not
a public figure the burden of proof is upon Alan to prove his
claim.

I know an awful lot about the US libel laws after having spent
time assisting in a complicated criminal investigation during
which such a claim was made. As for the UK laws, there is 
practically no defense against a libel claim that one can
file in court. There is absolutely no basis on which to 
justify them. This is why the Singapore government uses them
as a form of censorship.
