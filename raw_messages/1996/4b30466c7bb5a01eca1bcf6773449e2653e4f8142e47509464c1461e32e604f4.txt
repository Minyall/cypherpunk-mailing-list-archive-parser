I've been looking for a good price on a large Hillary Clinton button for 
several weeks now. The best I've seen so far was $3 at a booth in the 
Santa Monica 3rd Street Promenade. Since I want to give the absolute 
least cash possible to these people (less than none, preferably) I'd 
just like to know if anyone knows of a better deal.
