If done in parallel, on a dedicated, 200 MHz custom chip, my WAG says that 
such a chip could try, and statistically analyze the results of 10 million 
DES codes per second.   (it would do the decrypts on a number of parallel 
DES blocks, and look for typical ASCII code pattern probabilities, again all 
in parallel.)  A typical cracking system might have 100 boards of 100 such 
chips, or perhaps a 100 billion such decrypts per second.  Checking the 
keyspace would require 2**19 seconds, or about a half million seconds, or 6 
days.  Average decrypt, of course, in 3 days.
