Quite a while back, I read an article in National Rifleman (the NRA
magazine), that for part of  the 19th century  it was the law that all 
adult men in the Balkan statelet of Montenegro must carry a pistol
when in public (a close relative of the ruler had a monopoly on the 
manufacture and sale of firearms in the kingdom).

Traveler's reports noted the extreme civility of Montenegrin
society during this period.
