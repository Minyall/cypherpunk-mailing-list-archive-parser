I have both versions.  They call it the "Business Edition", and the master
key is optional, not required.  The master key has to be in place before
anyone else generates their key, otherwise the master key won't work.  You
have to go in and turn this on so it isn't something that gets implemented
without *someone* knowing.  As for everyone else knowing that there was a
master key generated...
