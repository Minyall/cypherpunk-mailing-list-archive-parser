There is a trivial trick for making the decrement TTL/change checksum
operation very fast, based on noting how a decrement would change the
checksum. Most very high speed routers attempt to avoid doing ANY
processing of the packets at all beyond this, and IPv6 has no header
checksum partially in order to reduce this overhead further. Forcing
routers to do more work is a Very Very Bad Idea.
