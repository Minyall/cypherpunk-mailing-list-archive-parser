Does anyonw knoe about crypto export restrictions in Israel? The Crypto
Law Survey (http://cwis.kub.nl/~frw/people/koops/lawsurvy.htm) says that
there are some restrictions, but "their scope is not clear". Also I have
been iformed of occasions when a company in Israel does not export strong
crypto. Still I believe I have seen many programs from Israel that have
unlimited strong algorithms.

The real question is, why can't Checkpoint who manufactures the Firewall-1
sell DES version in Europe, but only in US and Canada. Elsewhere they use
a proprietary algorithm called FWZ (48-bit). I have not any analysis done
on FWZ so I don't think anyone is using it.
