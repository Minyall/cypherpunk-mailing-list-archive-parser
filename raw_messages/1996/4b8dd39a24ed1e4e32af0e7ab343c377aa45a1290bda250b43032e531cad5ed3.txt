If the right to speak anonymously is an "extremist" position in the eyes
of the EFF, then they are no friends of liberty.

It is hardly an "extremist" position outside of such countries as Cuba,
Iran, or China.

It is the overwhelmingly mainstream position, not just among netizens,
but when last heard, amongst supreme court judges and ordinary people
in the street.
