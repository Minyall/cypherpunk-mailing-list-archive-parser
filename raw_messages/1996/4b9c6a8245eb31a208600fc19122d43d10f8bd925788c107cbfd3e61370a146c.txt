I agree strongly. In my Econ 101 class, lo those many years ago, I was
constantly reminded to "Remember the Croughs Axiom!"

It is why MacDonald's workers, who work at a company which has invested
truly vast sums of money in the capital of its outlets, pays its workers so
much more than do the legal firms, advertising firms, etc., which have
invested almost nothing in the capital of their facilities.

This is why so many lawyers choose to move into hamburger flipping. In
fact, the lawyer who won the "hot coffee" lawsuit is now a Milkshake
Trainee at the East Outback, Wisconsin MacDonalds.
