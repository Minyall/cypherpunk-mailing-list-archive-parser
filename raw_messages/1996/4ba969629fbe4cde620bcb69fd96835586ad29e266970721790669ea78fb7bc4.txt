BTW, I attempted to comply with the law in a recent request posted to
ba.jobs.offered and scruz.general: I solicited workers for some brush
clearing on my place, but advised them to only apply if--appearing to be
Hispanic, Latin, Mexican, or otherwise unOfficial--they provided proof of
their legal ability to work for me.

Personally, I don't care. In fact, when employing gardeners and yard works
I prefer Mexicans. But the law says, these days, that I must verify the
legality of workers *if* they appear to be dark-skinned, Mexican, Latin, or
the like. I say "if" because there are no requirements in general for
white-skinned, Anglo workers....no work permits, no proofs of citizenship
(such a document is currently lacking in the American pantheon...I, a mixed
descendant of Mayflower colonist and Scandinavian immigrants, lack such
"proof").

Predictably, I got e-mail threatening me with legal action (ha!) and
claiming me to be a racist.

I promise not to ask my potential employees for legal proof of their right
to work if the Feds and Sacramentans promise not to make it a law that I
check such things, and if the laws are not written such that I am a felon
for not asking for such documents from a dark, dusky Mexican but not from a
blonde- or red-haired ubermensch. (Jews I haven't figured out...some seem
to pass the "no documents required test" and some I want to demand Green
Cards for...ironically, it may be "discrimination" for me to request that
these "dusky" folks supply proof of their permission to work in these
Beknighted States. A strange world we live in.)
