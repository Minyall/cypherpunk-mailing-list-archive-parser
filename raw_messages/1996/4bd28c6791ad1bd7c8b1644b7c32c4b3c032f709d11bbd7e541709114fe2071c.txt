First, pray tell, what prevents me from writing a virus that patches,

Wow! I didn't think of that!

And while I'm at it, it doesn't take much to be more secure than
credit card payments. You shouldn't be too proud of that.

And it shouldn't take an experienced programmer one whole week to
write a keyboard sniffer.

But I think it's not too pessimistic to say that _any_ software-based
payment scheme can be hacked using malicious programs.

Oh, wow, it's your secret. I would post a message containing the
credit card number encrypted with a public key cipher to
alt.foo.bar. Or to the IRC. And it's not too difficult to hack
university computers, so I could even receive mail there without being
traceable. Not to speak of remailer chains. Any other ideas?
