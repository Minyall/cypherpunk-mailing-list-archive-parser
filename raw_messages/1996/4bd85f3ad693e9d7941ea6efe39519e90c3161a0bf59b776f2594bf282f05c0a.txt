You forgot:
	Dr. Dimitri Vulis (Rabid spewer of flames about someone/something
involving wheelchairs and vegetables, as though carrots, or any other
vegetable, use wheelchairs, but no-one really knows what this branch
of Lance is talking about, nor wants to.  This particular tentacle
somehow manages to make reference to its favorite imaginary topic in
every messaage it writes on any topic whatsoever.  Also, never mispell
its name.)

PS: For the record, I find that Dimitri often has interesting things
to say.  I just wish he'd stop talking about wheelchairs and
vegetables.  Makes me get sad (I broke my back and almost ended up in
a wheelchair, but I'm much better now) and hungry (I'm a vegetarian)
at the same time.
