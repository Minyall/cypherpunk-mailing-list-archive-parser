And remember, you can do that simply by putting your applet in an
HTML document and then spam-mailing the document with appropriate 
MIME header information to zillions of people.  Everybody who's
reading mail with Netscape (and maybe IE) will see your little
HTML document (which needn't be anything special), and your applet
will be able to fire up and start stealing cycles.

In fact, it'd be cool to set up a mail sender that would construct
such a page automatically with each outgoing mail message.  That
way, ordinary postings to mailing lists would go out with that spiffy
HTML look, and you'd get all those CPU cycles without angering the
community (much).
