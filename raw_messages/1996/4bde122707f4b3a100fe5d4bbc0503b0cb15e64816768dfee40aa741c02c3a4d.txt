How would you qualify the seizing of 50+ % of our productive work?

Since only the productive work permits an individual to live, could
you say that they steal half of your life?  Why not?  Then, any tax
man targeted by AP who is past 1/2 the life expectency is getting an
"an eye for an eye" or better deal...

Are you telling that giving your wallet to a mugger is not done under 
violence directed against you since he did not shoot you or beat you 
in the first place?  Do you tell me that the fact that he did not use 
his gun means that there is no violence implied?

Under every pile of red-tape lies a fully loaded gun.  And *this* is 
what gives govt employees their attitude toward you.

Just some thoughts.
