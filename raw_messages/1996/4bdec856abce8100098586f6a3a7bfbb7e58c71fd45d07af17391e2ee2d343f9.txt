Utility functions, are never irrational. I like tangerines and hate
apples, some other are the other way around, but it is not irrational.

Concavity of utility function of money (equivalence of risk-aversion)
for most consumers is an empirical fact.

I agree that rationality per se should not be mandated by the government 
rules  though.
