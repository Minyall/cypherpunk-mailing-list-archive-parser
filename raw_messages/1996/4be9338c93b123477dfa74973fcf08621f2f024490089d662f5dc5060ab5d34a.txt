800 numbers aren't free.  They're just paid out
of a different account.  I don't pay for them
directly, but I do indirectly through the increased
prices of the goods and services sold by the
company with the 800 number.  I'd hardly call
that being a 'parasite'.

Too bad there's not always a choice, a lot
of companies use only 800 numbers for service
hotlines etc.
