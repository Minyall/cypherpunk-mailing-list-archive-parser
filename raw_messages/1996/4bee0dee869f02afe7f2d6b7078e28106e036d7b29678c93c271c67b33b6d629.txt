This model isn't as practical as it seems.  For one thing, it is a classic
case of barter: exchange for things that you want but don't have.  This
becomes extremely difficult with specialization.  Letsay I make only
CryptoDoom, its the only thing that I have the skills to make.  The things
that I want but can't produce each day are numerous: food, transport,
housing, ad infinitum.  One-to-one barter is only usefull if both agents
(in a 2 agent economy) need only 2 goods and specialize.

This is the root of money: a means of exchange between heterogenous
products.  Allthough a parallel digital internetwork would allow
occasional barters to increase there viability, it does not mean that
barter will replace money.  But there's some ambiguity here: What is
implied by "The case of parallel digital currencies this exchange market
would...."?  Does this recomend exchange markets (barter) or fiat
(currency)?
