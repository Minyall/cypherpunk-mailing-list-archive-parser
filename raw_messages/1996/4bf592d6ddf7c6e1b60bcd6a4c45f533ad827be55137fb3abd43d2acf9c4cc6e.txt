You are using two code books for double encoding. This is the kind of
problem analysts solve while brushing their teeth. All the analyst has to
do is determine your translation programs (easy to do since they have such
obvious anomalies) and create reverse code books. The malapropisms are so
obvious that there should be little difficulty aggregating the longest
phrases that make up one codebook entry.
