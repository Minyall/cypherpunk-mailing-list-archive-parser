Yes, Bosnians and Serbs would not be killing each other if only they could
receive government-approved information!

(Hint: This shows that neither governments nor churches nor the United
Nations knows any better solutions to the "who do you trust" problem. And,
I believe, mostly governments and other such entities exist to serve their
own interests.)

As to what I presume is an insult to the folks on this list ("I'm
personally not interested in conjuring up the latest utopia for a
minoritarian sect of illuminati"), you know where the exit is.
