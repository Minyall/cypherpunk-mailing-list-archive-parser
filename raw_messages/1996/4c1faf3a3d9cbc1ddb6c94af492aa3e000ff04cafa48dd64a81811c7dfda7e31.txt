   The USA practiced the WWII german approach.... high technology to make 
up for smaller resource base.

The USSR practiced the WWII approach of the Allies.... drown the opponent 
in your production capacity of basic killing machines.

If you are trying to make us believe that the USSR had smaller arsenals 
and lesser numbers of soliers manning the front lines, you are going to 
have to take your proposition to one of those "progressive" forums where 
historical fact is not permitted to get in the way of a good work of 
ideological fiction.

You're two generations too late, old lad..... You should have been a 
writer of encyclopedia articles for the Stalin regime.
