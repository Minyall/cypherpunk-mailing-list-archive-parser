Vulis, this is your 2nd spam to this list which is totally unrelated to 
any cypherpunk issues.  As this is totally off topic, flame mail, and 
spam, I suggest you grow up.  Again my original message to you stand: 
grow up.

2nd, since you are bent on sending your flames to this list, I move to 
vote you off the list.

Have a nice day.
