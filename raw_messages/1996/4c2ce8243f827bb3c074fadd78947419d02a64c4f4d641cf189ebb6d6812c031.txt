Its up to you what you call it, but here is an interesting example:

An international phone call costs about 2 cents/min to produce. The average
rate paid for by the consumer is 62 cents. That's means the carriers mark
up this particular product by an amazing 3000%.

Can you name another business that has comparable mark-ups?
