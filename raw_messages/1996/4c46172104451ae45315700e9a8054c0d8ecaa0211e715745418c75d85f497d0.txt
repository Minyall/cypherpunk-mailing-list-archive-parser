Horrors.  I'm agreeing with Phyllis Schlafly. 

I know I'm going to kick myself tomorrow for saying this, but I found
that to be a very nice rant against Big Brother in many of its 
manifestations.  

Of course, we still have Little Brother (the family),
and Cousin Elmer (the Church), but isn't it nice to see that 
the RRR is on our side on such an important issue. 

Way to go Phyllis! :)
