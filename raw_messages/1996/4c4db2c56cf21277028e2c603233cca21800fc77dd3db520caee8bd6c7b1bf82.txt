I think you will find ultimately that personal communication is just 
that, i.e., personal.  OTOH, the means by which that communication are 
effected (phones, computers, with or without encryption) are the things 
that the government wants to control, presumably to get at information 
that you and I couldn't conveniently communicate in person, in private.

The very idea that people don't have the right to hide their private 
conversations from *anyone*, including police, is ludicrous, and can't 
possibly be enforced, but the devices (if any) that are used, that's 
another matter.

I hope someone understands what I'm getting at, and can add to this.
