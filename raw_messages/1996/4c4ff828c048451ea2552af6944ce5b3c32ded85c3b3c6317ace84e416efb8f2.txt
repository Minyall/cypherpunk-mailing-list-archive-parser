Gabriel, were you watching this closely?  This is a great working
example of all the policing the Internet needs.

You didn't mention the spread of misinformation[*] as one of the
NetCrimes you were looking out for, but it is a far worse ``offense''
than anything you pointed out earlier (mailbombing, forging etc. are
defeated by proper security and administrative procedures).

[*] Misinformation in the sense that it is patently wrong, with the
facts readily available to anyone with half a clue (this is not meant
as a slur towards Steven Weller, he apologized and corrected himself),
and not propaganda.  Much like the Good Times Virus warning.
Propaganda is free speech, which must be defeated by more free speech
if it is to be defeated.
