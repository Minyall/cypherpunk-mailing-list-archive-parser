The fact remains that John Gilmore has "punished" me for speech that he didn't
like by unsubscribing me from both cypherpunks and coderpunks mailing lists and
by instructing majordomo to "play dead" in response to any requests from me.
That's rude; that's sneaky; that's censorship; that's John's right.

I am not a lawyer, but I hope that if and when someone gets sued over something
posted to this mailing list, John "deep pockets" Gilmore is named a codefendant
and is unable to convince anyone of his common carrier status.

(I remind the lawsuit-happy audience that John Gilmore was the fifth employee
of Sun Micro and was given some equity in the company, which after the IPO
became worth millions of dollars.)
