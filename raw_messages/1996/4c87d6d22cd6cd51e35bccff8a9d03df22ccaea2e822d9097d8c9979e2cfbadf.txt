Why not have any list deal with a heirarchy of security, so that:

n-number of posters will use the highest level of security
m-number will use a lower level of security
k-number will send plain text

Flags can be assigned for various purposes:

What level of encoding I send my messages with
What level I can receive
Restrictions on delivery of my messages according to a table maintained
  by the list managers
