If they intend to prosecute in a U.S. court they are.

Which crowd of lawyers was this?  Must have been after open bar.

Look it up, the doctrine is called "fruit of the poisonous tree."

In your example, the evidence would be refered to the FBI or the Secret
Service, or more likely both provided the intercept clerk's superior
wanted to even expose the existance of the intercept program to begin
with- unlikely in my experience.  From there, it being fairly clear that
the intercept was illegal to the FBI / Secret Service, they may visit and
see if they can dig up a plausible explanation as to how they "really" got
interested in your activities, but refering to the intercept is right out.

See e.g., United States v. United States District Court (Keith), 407 U.S.
297 (1972); Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165 (1969).

Warantless surveillance can only be used in criminal prosecutions where
the "primary purpose" of the surveillance is intelligence.  United States
v. Megahey, 553 F.Supp. 1180, 1189-1190 (E.D.N.Y. 1982).

That evidence will have to survive a hearing on exclusion.  Highly
unlikely if you were accidently overheard.

Judges are protective of their jurisdiction.
