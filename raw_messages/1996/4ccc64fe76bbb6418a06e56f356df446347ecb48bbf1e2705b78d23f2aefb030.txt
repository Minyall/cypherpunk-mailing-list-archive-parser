It has similarities.  But AP will not be the enforcer of *one* 
opinion.  And, according to Jim Bell, people will realize that the 
best way to behave is to adopt a low profile.

Again, this is where I do not agree with JB, although I cannot say I 
disagree.  I simply do not know.

Maybe, since the basis for sustenance of human life is production, 
and since the majority has to be producers, the majority will endorse 
more libertarians ideas.

But again, maybe Joe Average was so convinced that "the rich" owe him
a free lunch that AP will lead to complete destruction of the system.

I personnally tend to believe that Joe Average still has some common 
sense and integrity.
