Something that I thought would make an excellent data haven would
be older offshore oil platforms, Their size would allow extended
living periods, electrcity and communications are in place, They
are generally built outside of the territorial waters of most
countries to avoid any damage to the shorelines if oil spilled
(possibility for becoming its own country?) and with the hoops
that Shell Oil went through to please Greenpeace with its last
oil platform.  You have to wonder how cheap these could sell 
for just to get them off the oil companies hands? 

Comments or suggestions?
