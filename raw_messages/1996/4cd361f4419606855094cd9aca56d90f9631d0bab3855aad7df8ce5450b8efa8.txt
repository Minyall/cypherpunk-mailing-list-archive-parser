If this isn't disturbing the peace, I don't know what is.

Patrick McHenry wasn't interested in the homeless, _for their sake_.  He 
was using them as a pawn to act out his own neurotic vision of "social 
activism".  If there hadn't been any homeless in the city, Patrick 
McHenry would have latched onto some other - any other - issue. It's the 
screaming into the microphone that he wants.
