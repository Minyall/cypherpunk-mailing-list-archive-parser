The glory days are long past, and cannot be revived
by forming a new mailing list.

I've never thought of the cypherpunks as being of the mind to "abandon"
the "worthless" masses to their own devices.   Rather, I thought of them
as being of the mind to associate among those who thought like
themselves about privacy, who shared the values of self-reliance, who
supported the ideals of individual liberty, and who were open to
including on the list anyone who wanted to better understand the
subjects which are discussed there.

But that quote above reminds me of the patent office's statement, often
recounted, of how everything which could be invented had already been
invented, and there couldn't possibly be any more new ideas introduced.

It all depends, as usual, on the individuals involved -  on the quality
they bring to the subject, to the list, to the enterprise.

Interesting question:  what do elite sophisticates *do*, once they've
reached their pinnacle?
