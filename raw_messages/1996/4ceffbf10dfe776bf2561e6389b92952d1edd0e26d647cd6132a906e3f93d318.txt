Being new to crypto subjects, I guess I'm pretty gullable about how much one
should use encryption in general.  I remember reading somewhere that it
would probably be best for the 'world as a whole' if everyone used
encryption whenever possible so that when you DO send encrypted messages
that actually contain information you want kept secret, it doesn't stick out
like a sore thumb.

To that end, I should imagine that once I have a person's pgp key, they may
well never see another cleartext message from me again!  Of course, now I'm
trying to figure out how to use the anonymous remailers and such.  Boy, this
is fun!

Of course, the fact that my government doesn't really care for the idea of
publicly available cryptography makes it even more enticing.
