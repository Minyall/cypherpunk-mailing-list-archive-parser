I just heard a very short blurb on CBC radio about a KGB mole within the NSA
from the 60's (?) getting arrested by the FBI. Pretty much no details 
were given. Any info?

(Apologies if someone else has posted this today, I'm following the list 
from the hks archives, which I assume have a minor delay.)
