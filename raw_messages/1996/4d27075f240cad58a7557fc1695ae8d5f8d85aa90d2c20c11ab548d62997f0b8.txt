In the extreme case, everybody would be sending messages in the clear.
In the case of mandatory GAK, it would be easy to open a bunch of
messages and see if what was inside looked like cryptography.  The
privacy violation could be minimized by requiring a Congressionally
approved test program to applied without any human reading it.  If
the test program said it was cryptography, then this could be considered
just cause for a judge to issue a warrant to the authorities for the
study of the actual message.

The laws regarding what is considered legal evidence are easily
changed if there is a need for it.  Probably they don't need to be
changed all that much.  If you see a lot of PGP messages coming
from somebody, you get a warrant and search their computer for
illegal software.  When you find it, you lock them up forever.

In the absence of strong cryptography, remailers do not offer much
anonymity.

If the penalties for the use of cryptography are significantly greater
than the penalties associated with the crime, you may opt not to use
cryptography.
