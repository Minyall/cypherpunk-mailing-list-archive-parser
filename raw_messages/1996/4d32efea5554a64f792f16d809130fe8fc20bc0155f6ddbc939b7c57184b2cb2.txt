look, I was not going to rub this in your face at all, but you don't
seem to have a clue about this. the fact that you/others here can't 
scrounge enough imagination to come up with an attack against wiretap laws 
based on case law and think such a think is a waste of time
is pretty meaningless in your case. I don't think
you have an imaginative bone in your body, hence the great vitriol
that you unleash upon me whenever I use my own.

from the article just recently posted:

as TCM just pointed out, this is a departure on the part of the administration
in describing the tactics of clipper. clearly, WIRETAPPING AUTHORITY IS
KEY TO CLIPPER LEGITIMACY. hence a legal challenge to wiretapping is an
extremely critical angle to the situation.

as I just recently wrote, it seems to me one of the key points of discussion
that is just now emerging in this debate is the demand by the gov't
that wiretapping be done IN SECRET without knowledge of the suspect,
whereas civil libertarians seem to be challenging this point in particular.
it could be a magic bullet it defeating wiretapping. it seems to really
get to the core of the debate about key escrow etc.

the same distinction again. very interesting.  I was just emphasizing
that in my post.

whoa, apparently this would be news to Unicorn, who thinks it would be
a waste of time to argue against the established legitimacy of wiretapping
and considers himself a premiere lawyer-dude.  well, I'll just let Unicorn
argue with Weitzner, (whose credentials are rather impressive and I 
trust more, btw..)  I'd be interested to hear what Weitzner says, 
Uni...

so what we have here is a very knowledgeable lawyer who has helped
out EFF argue that wiretaps are unconstitutional based on the precise
aspect that I was focusing on in a post that Unicorn flamed me for:
that they are secret, unknown to the suspect,
and that this thereby might constitute an "unreasonable"
search and seizure. I don't claim to have originated this of course, but
I was emphasizing it in my post, and Unicorn objected.

reading what Weitzner wrote, it is not inconceivable to imagine
him having the position that wiretaps in their present form might
not survive a court challenge, i.e. it would at least not be
a waste of time to mount such a case, as Unicorn belligerently
bellows above is obvious to anyone with a smidgeon of legal
background..
