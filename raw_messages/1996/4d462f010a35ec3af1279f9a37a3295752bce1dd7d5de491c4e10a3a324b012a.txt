I'm glad you asked.  I wouldn't pretend to have *the* answer, but rather 
than screw around with basic Constitutional enumerations, I think the 
"authorities" should have had the guts to challenge those cases (at 
least the most obvious ones at first, to get the ball rolling), by 
investigating and declaring mistrials based on some kind of jury 
manipulation which showed bad faith on the part of the locals.

If they had the guts to do that, rather than cop out to people's 
*democratic* emotions (the easy way out), we'd be a lot better off.
BTW, this applies to a helluva lot of bad law, terrorist for one.
