I'll have to reread John's piece tomorrow (I'm on vacation right now), but
it doesn't surprise me. He and I have been arguing about this topic via
email for the last week or so. He takes the traditional liberal view of 
government regulation of drugs is necessary; I take the more libertarian one.

The Cato Institute, BTW, will be putting together a roundtable on this soon.
