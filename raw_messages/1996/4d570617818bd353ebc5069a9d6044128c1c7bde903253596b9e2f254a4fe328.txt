An admin could just copy the mail spool file to a safer place, then read
through at their leisure.

Unless its someone totally clueless (which some ISP's are), I doubt that
they are pulling off the pop3d.  It could be that your mail spool file is
locked by a mail transport agent, and that is why that error message is
occuring.

Any thoughts?
