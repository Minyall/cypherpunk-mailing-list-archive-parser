I'm not sure I understand what you mean.  I sent the text of the law to
the list.  The position that you take (that increse in inflation can send
you into the next tax bracket) is incorrect.

The bill took effect in 1993. (1992?)

Rates will not change with respect to inflation (to the extent that
inflation is accurately measured by the CPI).

I believe an exception was made for the top bracket in 1994, but I don't
recall how it was implemented.
