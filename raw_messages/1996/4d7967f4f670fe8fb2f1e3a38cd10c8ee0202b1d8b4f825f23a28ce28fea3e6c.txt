When asked, he also indicated that the PGP 3.0 message formats would be 
embedded into the API in such a way that it would not be possible to use 
the library to generate or process stealth.  Of course, you could always 
strip the unstealthy data out as you would with PGP 2.x, but that doesn't 
help on the receiving end.
