        Like someone who crosses the road without looking both ways is
asking for trouble? O necessity, we worship at your altar.
        Some folks--in fact, most Israelis--were born in Israel.
        The rest of your remarks about "a...state surrounded on all sides
by Arabs who want their land back" doesn't exactly describe the
Palestinians' relations with denizens of neighboring territories prior to
the rise of Zionism, or even since, for that matter.
