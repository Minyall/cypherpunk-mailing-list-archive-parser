| This is truly bizarre. First, if they were on the NASDAQ, they'd have a
| 4-letter ticker symbol, not a 3-letter symbol. MSFT (Microsoft) is on NASDAQ.
| IBM (IBM) and F (Ford) are on the New York stock exchange and/or
| American stock exchange.

	Oops.  Misread my stock service.  I usually pay little
attention to what exchange something is traded on.  CKP is on the
NYSE.

| Sometimes the stock of a foreign company is traded in the U.S. in the form
| of American Depository Receipts (ADRs) not sponsored by the company. How
| could that impose any obligation on it?
