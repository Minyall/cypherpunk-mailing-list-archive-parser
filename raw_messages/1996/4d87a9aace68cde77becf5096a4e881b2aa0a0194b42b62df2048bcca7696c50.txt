This is not exactly correct. The check for white list will be there
exactly as you specified. It will have a toggle switch, so that we
can turn it on and off, depending on how badly we are hit with
forgeries.

Please do NOT use this pre-filled ballot to vote (although of course
I would be pleased with cypherpunks helping to let such an experiment
go). According to voting rules, you have to vote only in response to the
full CFV posted to news.groups. If you do not have access to news or
your news system expired the CFV already, you can retrieve the CFV
(containing the rationale, charter and the ballot) by sending email to
russian-cfv-request@netagw.com. Body of your message will be ignored.

All votes that use pre-filled ballots are invalid.

	- Igor.
