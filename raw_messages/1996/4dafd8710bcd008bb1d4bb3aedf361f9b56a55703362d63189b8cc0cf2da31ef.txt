Actually, that's not quite right.  People dealing in physical goods
typically ship them AFTER the "yes" response from the user.  And one of
the next enhancements to our system, currently implemented and in
testing in-house, will feature digitally signed notices to merchants
when credit card authorization is obtained.  At that point, the
merchant's risk will be no greater than in traditional mail-order credit
card sales.
