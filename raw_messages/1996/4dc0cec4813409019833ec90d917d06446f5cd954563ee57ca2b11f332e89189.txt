Allow me to say here that I do not belive that Netscape will be amongst 
those fooled so easily. But IBM, HP, TIS, and others have already been 
fooled. The USG does not need to get every software company to agree with 
their proposal. Divide and conquer. Seems that the USG has done a 
marvelous job of D&C so far.
