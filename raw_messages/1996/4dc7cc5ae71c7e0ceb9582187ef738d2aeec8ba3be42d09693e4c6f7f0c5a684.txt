Mr. Geiger:

I do not have interest in nor time for a flame war.  But I do appreciate 
your perspective, whether or not I agree.

Rather than flaming, I propose that all interested readers post their 
*CONSTRUCTIVE* ideas on the CyberTerrorism issue.  If you feel it is 
not an issue, then don't respond.  

I'm not looking for opinions on politicians, the government, etc., 
nor do  I care what you think of me or my views.  However, if you can 
put  some _solid_ thoughts into bullet items, or any other format you 
deem useful, perhaps we can move forward.

Ideas.  Actions.  No commentary, raves, rants, flames, or other bandwidth wasters.

Let's see what we come up with.
