Unless the definition has changed recently, a "logic bomb" is normally a
piece of code in a program that is triggered when a specific event occurs
(such as the programmer's name not appearing in a payroll file for a
designated period of time [which might trigger a salami round off routine
to start cutting checks 2 months after s/he is no longer working for the
company]).
