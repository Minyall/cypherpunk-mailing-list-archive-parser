This has been done in the past using several vairants (but not in a image 
program).

The key to the success is that the application in question has to be 
compromised to respond to these codes, either by design or by hacking. 
Either way the individual responsible must modify the execution 
mechanism, not just the data itself.

Let's see -current examples of computing items with this kind of a 
"feature"... magic cookies, macros, OLE, DDE, MS Objects, JAVA, and the 
list keeps growing.
