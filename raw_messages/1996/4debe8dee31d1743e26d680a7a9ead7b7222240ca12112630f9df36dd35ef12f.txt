As has been mentioned earlier, all an attacker has to do is encourage
some of the light to exit the fiber, by bending it, contacting it with
a detector, etc.

If the detector is sensitive enough, the loss induced by this is minimal.

This sort of tapping is exactly the sort of thing quantum cryptography
is supposed to prevent, or at least identify.  Nothing short of quantum
methods is going to spot the tap, unless you happen to come across the 
tap by inspecting the entire length of the fiber.
