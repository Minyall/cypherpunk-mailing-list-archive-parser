I'd appreciate a response from M.Aldrich and anyone else who's into disaster
recovery:

Someone I know had their (paper) files submerged in water. Now all the papers
(most of them xerocopies, some photographs) are stuck together. They are, of
course, confidential to some degree. Can someone refer us to someone in
the Boston area who could assist in recovering the files?
