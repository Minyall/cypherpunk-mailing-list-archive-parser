Obviously the Austrians, like anyone with half a brain, said that more
capital means more wealth for everyone, and more capital relative
to workers means a bigger share for the workers.

It does not follow however, that the Austrians said that 
if the government directs the flow of other peoples capital 
like a farmer watering his fields, the fields so watered will
benefit.
