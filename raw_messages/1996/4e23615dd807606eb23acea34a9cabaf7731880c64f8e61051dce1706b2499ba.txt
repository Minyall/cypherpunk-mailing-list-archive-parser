The problem with running Igor's program on PC has to do with the last
allocation cluster of each file: it's in use (so this program won't
write over it), but it only has new data at the beginning, and might
contain some interesting old data at the end.

For the PCs, Norton Utilities (now from Symantec) include a wiping
utility that addresses the above problem. Specifially for OS/2 HPFS,
the Gammatech utility also include one.
