A total distortion of the man's point. Imagine someone suffering from
an unknown ailment for years. One day, he is finally diagnosed, a
treatment is given, and he feels better.

All you can do is try to argue that he shouldn't be treated.

Did you listen to that guy at all? He was in pain and anguish over the
fact that his life was totally screwed up in spite of his best efforts
to make a go at work he loved. Now he can function. You want him to be
"diverse" and go on not functioning. He doesn't want that. Who are you
to tell him how live his own life?
