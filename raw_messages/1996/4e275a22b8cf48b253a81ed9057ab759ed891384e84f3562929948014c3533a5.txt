There is an easy technical solution to this: store a one-way hash of each entry
in a database field, so if one wants to be removed, all one has to do is send
the one-way hash of their personal information.  If there is a database entry
that matches the hash, then it is up to the database maintainer to remove the
entry.  If there isn't a matching entry, then no personal information will have
been given out.  I wonder how many "privacy conscious" database maintainers
will actually implement a scheme like this.

TRW credit databases have been broken into many times, and they have more
information then Lexis-Nexis (credit-card numbers minus the last four digits,
addresses, telephone numbers, and of course, credit histories).  Nothing
really devestating has happened because of these incidents.
