This list used to focus on privacy issues, crypto protocols, algorithms,
national crypto policy, etc.  I saw the Netscape cracks announced here, I
saw squeamish ossifrage here, now I see nothing of the sort.  Now I see
that people are discussing heckling the pres., black helicopters???.  I
have heard Phil Zimmerman frequently call Paul Zimmerman.

See you guys later.
