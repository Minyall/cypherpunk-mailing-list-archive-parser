I would refer you to Union Bank of Switzerland in the late 80's
(kidnapping), BCCI (drug and intelligence money), BMI (drug
money/offshore insurance fraud), PNC Bank (accounting fraud), and a host
of others I won't bother to list.  Banks do suffer from these disclosures,
in many cases quite severely.  (PNC bank was nearly ruined by their fraud
harboring disclosures).  Why exactly is it that you think frauds,
seizures, compelled customer referrals and the like go unreported to the
authorities in something like 75% of the cases?  Why exactly is it that
you think banks seek to open offshore branches with autonomy and distance
from the home branches?  Answer: Banking is as much about confidence as
any business can be.  Anonymous or not, the presence of funds which
infringe on regulations in one area or another are frightening to normal
banking customers.

I know it's a lot to ask, but please stick to areas you know please,
rather than making up facts to support your arguments.
