	Give me 15 well trained soldiers(near special forces level) and I
can do it in less than 60 days. Without touching a computer. 

	There was a blue print published by Omni Magazine in the mid to
late 80's written by Henry Kissinger (IIRC). 

	Give me 15 McVey's with the ability to follow orders and I'll have
this country in chaos in 2 weeks. 

	It isn't that hard, it is just that almost everyone prefers the
current system to total death & destruction chaos that follows a strong
government collapsing. Society holds itself together in large part not
because of the rule of law, but becaue most people want it to.
