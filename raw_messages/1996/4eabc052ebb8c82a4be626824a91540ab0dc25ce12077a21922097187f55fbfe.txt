Right On!  PDP 11's rule!!!

My favorite one was an 11/34 with "Hardware Floating Point" that had a
GT-43 vector display processor as a coprocessor.  You'd build a double
buffered display list of vector instructions for the coprocessor,
using your handy dandy fortran program, and then let it rip.  As long
as you weren't trying to do hidden line removal, or draw more than
about 200 vectors, you could get smooth, real-time wire frame
animation.  We had it hooked up to a couple of knob boxes and some
nice three axis joy sticks connected to 10 bit A/D's.
