(Please forgive the uninformed method of my inquiry.)

Would any here happen to know where I might come across a later 
version of 'Medusa's Tentacles?'  I've got the first release, 
alpha/beta 1, but, as many probably know, it carries a few bugs, such 
as not allowing purging of fuzzybases...
