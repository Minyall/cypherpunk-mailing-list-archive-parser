Yes, except that we weren't talking about securing the privacy of the
conversation; we were discussing methods of keeping the identity of
the caller from being reported to WATS-line customers.

Until recently at least, ANI and CLID information was not available
on calls from cellular phones (the rationale was that the cellular
phone customer has to pay for *incoming* calls as well).  I thought
that this was mandated by law, in Mass anyway.

Certainly, though, if I was calling the BATF toll-free to rat on my
neighbourhood Uzi dealer, I'd never call from my own phone, anonymous
re-phoner or not.
