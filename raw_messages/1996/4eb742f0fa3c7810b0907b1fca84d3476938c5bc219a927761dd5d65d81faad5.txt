I guess Perry didn't see the word 'encrypted'... Perry, you really ought to see the web page - it's
quite good, and has a lot of good information.  It also illustrates some of the pitfalls inherent in 
writing such applications, and exposes bad code written by commercial vendors.  I thought that that 
was part of what Cypherpunks is for, but maybe it's just for Perry-approved posts.
