It sounded cool (as heard on the moderator's list), but too complex for my
needs, and I think it required some stuff I don't have. Of course, for a
higher-traffic group, it's worth it. I don't see a way around the problem.

1. If you're like me and you habitually read your mail online on a host on
the Internet, no matter how secure, then that's a security risk. Of course
one could, and many people do, create multiple PGP keys, one for casual
authentication and encryption online, and another held in check for stuff
that needs to be secure. I just don't bother with a "10% secure" key for 
cpunks and casual mail, though I do sign most of my Usenet posts.

2. If you send a PGP-signed message to a non-PGP-aware list, there will 
be questions, and sometimes ridicule. Sometimes this is an opportunity 
for education, sometimes it's just not worth the trouble.

3. Using PGP may attract the unwelcome attention of hostile local or
foreign governments, or possibly other armed thugs. 

4. "It's too hard."
