Moreover, parliamentarians from different sides of the aisle usually
have different points of view, and an interest in "outing" each other.
A parliament where everyone had the same point of view would be
uninteresting for this problem -- your friendly local terrorist would
just blow up the whole building.

A practical example of this kind of thing is the situation of judges
in Colombia.
