That reminds me that I have been meaning to send out what I use for PGP
and ucbmail.  First of all, since you can ~| outgoing messages, I don't
need any support for sending.  For receiving, there's two ways to
'edit' messages: 'e' invokes $EDITOR and 'v' invokes $VISUAL on a
message.  I actually use 'v' so I set $EDITOR (in my .mailrc) to
~/bin/mypgp which looks like this:

	#!/bin/csh
	pgp -f < $* | more

So to read a PGP'd message, I just type 'e' ...

Anyone else do something interesting with ucbmail?
