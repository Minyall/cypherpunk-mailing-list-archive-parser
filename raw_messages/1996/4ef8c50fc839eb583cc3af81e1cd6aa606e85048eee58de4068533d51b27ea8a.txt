cpunks,

i was thinking about the whole PRZ thing last night and especially about 
our lack of information.  One of the best things that could happen is to 
get some or all of the members of the grand jury on the net and 
subscribed to the CP list so we could ask questions.

If they just had e-mail we could submit questions to them and ask that 
they reply to the whole list.

In this vein, it would be nice if someone (c2??) would offer dialup 
access for any members of the grand jury who wanted it.

i would be happy to offer shell accts to any member so they could 
enlighten us about the mysterious ways of the TLAs.  Unfortunately, they 
would need to obtain telnet access for this.

Is there any way we could offer these accts to them?  i suppose their
names are not known so this is obviously a problem and it wouldn't
speak well of the cypherpunks to go violating someones privacy just so
we could ask them to explain the government to us.

Just some thoughts...
