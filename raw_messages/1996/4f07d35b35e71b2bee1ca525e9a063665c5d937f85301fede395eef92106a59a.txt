	50 megs?  You expect me to pay 20 bucks, and you won't even
download the contents of ftp.dsi.unimi.it, the archives on hks.net,
and maybe a few other international crypto archives?

	More seriously, a completist cd rom would be nice, but the
marginal cost of filling the CD with stuff is pretty low.
