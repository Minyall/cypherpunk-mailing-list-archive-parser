Reminds me of an old joke:  "This computer's so fast it does an infinite 
loop in 5 seconds!"

They probably just wanted to establish that it could be done, to show that 
this wasn't dependant on high-cost laser systems.  External cavity lasers 
raise cost and size substantially, but in a laboratory setting they're the 
most convenient to use.

It's an old habit, I suppose.  It's hard to explain "one trillion", at least 
to non-tech types.  A good modern replacement might be to say, "200 CDROM's 
per second", except that even today most people don't know how much storage 
a CDROM represents.  "16 million one-way phone calls" is also helpful as a 
benchmark.
