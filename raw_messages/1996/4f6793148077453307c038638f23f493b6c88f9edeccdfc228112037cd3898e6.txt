Unfortunately for us, we are not in a position to do so, as we are
subscribers to the list, not the management. Doubtless, being a
mentally challenged person, you will continue to harrass us, post
obnoxious messages, and do other things in spite of the fact that none
of your victims will be in a position to help you out.

If you had an ounce of intelligence, of course, you would simply use
the automated unsubscription instructions you got when you
subscribed. Sadly for the rest of us, who will now have to deal with
your whining indefinately, intelligence is a commodity in precious
supply around this planet.
