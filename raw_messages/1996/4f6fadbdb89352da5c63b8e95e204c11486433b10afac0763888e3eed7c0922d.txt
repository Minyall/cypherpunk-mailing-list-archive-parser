All moderated newsgroups should use it.

However the robomoderator that Igor Chudov wrote uses digital signatures to
authenticate _posters as follows: there's a "white list" (as opposed to "black
list") of trusted posters whose submissions will be approved and posted
automatically, without going through any moderator. A person on the "white
list" can request that the robomod check his signature and not post it if the
submission may be a forged e-mail. I strongly urged Igor to make digital
signatures mandatory for "white list" membership, but he argued that a lot of
likely posters lack the brains to use PGP. The robomod will look at things like
"Received" lines in the e-mailed submission to try and detect forgeries.
