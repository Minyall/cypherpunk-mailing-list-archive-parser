For all intents and purposes so far, "Nathaniel Borenstein" is something that
occasionally sends mail to the cypherpunks list, apparently from nsb.fv.com.
I expect that NSB turns out to consist of more than that, but not in my own
experience. This entity persistently offers a public key from an email address
@nsb.fv.com. If I retrieved the key from that address, I would have a
reasonable expectation (though not assurance) that I could use it to verify
the integrity of signed messages emanating from that address. 

In my world, "you" == nsb@nsb.fv.com, and hence "your key" == the key I could
fetch from nsb+faq@nsb.fv.com.

I discussed the identity issue above. Assuming a corresponding key can be
found (which is clearly the case here), the signature on the message can be
verified as a MAC. It would have been nice to be able to check, for example, 
that the SHOUTING IN CAPS in your announcement wasn't just the result of some
manipulation of the message in transit to make it appear more hysterical.

FWIW, I have lost a great deal of respect for you today (unrelated to the
content of this message).
