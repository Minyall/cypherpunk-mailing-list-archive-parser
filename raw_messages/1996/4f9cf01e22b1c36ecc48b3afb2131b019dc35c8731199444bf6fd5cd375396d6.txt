      Good sir, allow me to point a few things out:

      1) It is late fall, almost winter. It gets _cold_ in Jersey, and it 
is WARM in California.

      2) You are being given a chance to go the bay area, at OTHERS expense,
and all you have to do is give little speech. 

      3) You are being asked to put your money where your mouth is, and you
don't even have to put up YOUR money. 

      4) Your reputation is going down, down down. About half the time you 
seem like an intelligent individual. The other half you act like a spoiled 
5 year old. If the latter half are forgeries, then I suggest PGP. You are 
being given a chance to regain your reputation. Take it.
