	If it was a government sting operation the detials might be
easily found.  The kind of information we're discussing is clearly of
high value to a great many people in the 60% bracket.  Looking for it
for free...Well, you may get what you pay for.

	I think that there is a high amount of value in a high volume,
low overhead sort of tax avoidance operation.  Right now, moving money
overseas is expensive, and there is a high service fee.  Reducing the
up front costs that someone has to pay to get started is a market
opportunity.  As is producing accessible information about how to get
started.  While Unicorn may be correct in suggesting three or four
volumes of tax law to get started properly, thats like suggesting Bach
and Comer for someone who wants to get on the internet.  When it was
needed, there were far fewer people here.

	As to the obvious rejoinder of, 'as soon as its obvious, its
illegal,' if enough people start to do it, theres a large lobby for
keeping it legal.  And if the overhead is low, all of those people
have lots of money to spend keeping it legal and cheap.
