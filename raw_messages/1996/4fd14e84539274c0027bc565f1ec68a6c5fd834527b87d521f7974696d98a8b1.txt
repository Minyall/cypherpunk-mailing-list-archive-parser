     There is a solution. Trade Schools, and Parental Envolvement. It could 
very well be (and if I had the money I'd make the bet) that _many_ of the 
"troubled" youth of today are simply undisiplined. (Fortunately, most of 
them couldn't afford to bet against their parents in an AP world). It would
also seem to follow that if parents were spending their own money (or 
perceived it as their own money) that they would take a greater interest in
their childrens education.
   
      For those that are truly not scholastically oreinted, there would be
trade schools. I would also bet that you could teach a child everything they
need to learn (other than a trade) to cope in this world in about 4 years.
