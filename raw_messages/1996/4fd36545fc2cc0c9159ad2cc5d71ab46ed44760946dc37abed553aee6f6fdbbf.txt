I recall we've been through this over a year ago, when I saw an announcement
of a cypherpunks physical meeting where someone was excluded for his political
views, and I said that I don't consider myself a cypherpunk. I'm glad that
John and Bill, the auhorities on cypherpunk membership, finally concur.
