Agreed, but there are other factors to consider. For example, it is not 
everyday that someone runs their fingers over sandpaper (via sander or 
not). This may indeed destroy the tell-tale finger print initially, but 
it leaves a distinguishing pattern, that can be matched to other evidence 
such as blood, DNA, fiber, etc. In some instances like this, the computer 
is useless to match finger prints, and balance of the decision rests with 
incriminating evidence. To wit: the "mutilated pattern" provides key 
identification if a good print is lifted and matched directly to the 
suspect - even though a copy of the "new" print doesn't exist.

I never maintained that the CIA or other body employs more than the standard 
issue. What I am saying is that there are other methods out there to 
validate means believed to be compromised - should a situation warrant 
such invasive techniques. I have never encountered any situation that 
called for anything other than fingerprints - even inside DoD (which in 
my opinion can be far more paranoid than the agencies).
