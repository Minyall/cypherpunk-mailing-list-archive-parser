The "International Strong Encryption" phrase is something that we
need to become active in stopping.  Anything which responds to such
announcements should put a different spin on this phrase.  If the
Clipper farce is accepted as "strong" encryption then the battle is
lost; maybe something like "it is _international_ strong encryption
because it is the strongest encryption people like Saddam Hussein [insert
bogeyman du jour] want Americans to have access to"
