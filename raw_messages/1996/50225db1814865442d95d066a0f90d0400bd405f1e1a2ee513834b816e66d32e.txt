Since the previous Subject: in this chain was different, I presume that
aga installed the one quoted above.

Normally I just killfile these sorts of things without reading, but that
subject line caught my interest.  Clearly the author is using all three
as insult.

Let's thing about this for a second.  The author makes value judgements
based on body weight and sexual orientation.  What does this tell us about
the authors reasoning ability?

Congratulations, aja, you've developed a firm reputation based on your
public actions.
