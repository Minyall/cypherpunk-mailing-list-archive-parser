Ross Perot isn't a political party.  The Natural Law Party most certainly did
not get registered in all 50 states twice in a row.  This is only their second
election and they only got registered in 36 states in 1992.  Ross Perot may
have gained ten times the votes, but he did it with 100 times the money.  He
also accepted matching funds.

The Libertarian party has branches in all 50 states and has run candidates for
the senate and representatives.  The Libertarian party's homepage does say
that they are the third largest political party and the Reform party's page
does not seem to have any info on number of members or anything that would
contradict the Libertarian party's claim.
