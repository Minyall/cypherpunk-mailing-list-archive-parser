How could you break "PGP" per se using lots of computer power? Its an
encryption system, not a particular key. What would the Cray have been
doing? Running an AI program trying to come up with new factoring
algorithms?

Now, I could believe that someone could break PGP -- perhaps by
finding some weakness in the implementation of RSA, or the RNG, or
maybe even a weakness in RSA itself. However, I have a great deal of
trouble believing that PGP *itself* was broken "using a Cray". If it
is going to be broken, it will be done using a few pounds of neurons
fed by a blood supply (at least until real AIs are out there
publishing math papers).

I doubt it. The statute of limitations was going to expire soon in any
case.
