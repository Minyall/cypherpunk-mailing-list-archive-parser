You should read your own quotes.

No one claimed that you can't increase productivity and income on
average under some circumstances by increased capital investment. What
was being made fun of was the simplistic misunderstanding of what the
underlying mechanisms are. Prices, including the price of labor, are
set purely by the marketplace. Under some circumstances, incomes will
be determined by investment levels made by employers. Under others,
they will not.  The important feature is the market principle, not the
capital investment. The point of my "green pylons" posting was to note
that it is the market direction of the investment and not the
investment that is important. Impediments to trade create wastes of
capital just as surely as burning cash in the marketplace does. If you
were really an Austrian, and not a confused person, you would know
that all the Austrians and Chicago School people are for completely
free trade, something you don't seem to get in your expositions on
capital flows.
