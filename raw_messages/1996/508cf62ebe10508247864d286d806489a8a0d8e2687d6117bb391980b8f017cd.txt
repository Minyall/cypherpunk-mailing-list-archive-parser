Our esteemed figurehead, Bill Clinton, will be doing
the first stop of his "Road to Victory Tour" campaign
this Friday, just a few blocks from my apartment.  Does
anybody have any cool suggestions on things to do to
harass, heckle, or maybe get taken down by the Secret
Service?  (Or should I just yell, 'Clinton, you suck!'? :)

Special P.S. to all FBI wiretappers: This is a joke.
