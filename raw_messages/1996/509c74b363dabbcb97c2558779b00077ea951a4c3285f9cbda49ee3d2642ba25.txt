Well their are several reasons I myself would rather use the "free" version in a commercial enviromet:

1. Source code is not available for the ViaCrypt version.

2. No OS/2 version

3. I really don't like the Windows GUI that ViaCrypt has developed. (I am biased by the fact that I have written my own <G>).

On # 1 this is a problem for those that like to have the source code and compile the program themselfs and without the source code one is unable to run it on an unsupported platform (see #2)

On #2 this is a bussiness dicision made by ViaCrypt. I'll leave it at that. (no sense starting an OS war).

On #3 this again is just a personal preference issue and would not rate it as a big factor.

I am corresponding with PGP Inc. on the legal issues of using the "free-ware" version in a commercial enviroment.
