As I read the regs, it's not an export at the moment it's launched, but
it's almost certainly an export when it reaches Mexican airspace or when it
touches Mexican soil.

The "rocket exception" is not useful vis-a-vis crypto. Period. I'm very
sorry I ever had anything to do with this thread and I'm not posting about
it again.
