OK, somebody correct me if I'm wrong here, I haven't used anon.penet
since I got mixmaster running ...

When you send a message to someone at anon.penet, the anonymous remailer
assumes that, since you're using a remailer, you want to be anonymous.
So it gives you an account, sends your message on via that account, and
informs you of the account information.  If you try it a second time,
you're already in the database, so you don't hear from them again.

So if you make your first post to cypherpunks, and somebody has subscribed
to the list via the anon.penet remailer ...
