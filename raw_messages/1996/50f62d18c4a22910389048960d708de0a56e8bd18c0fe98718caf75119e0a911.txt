I agree, and hope so. "Key Recovery," while not as Orwellian-sounding as 
"GAK," is a step on the path to honesty WRT the English language, though 
it's important to continually point out, as Tim did in his post, that 
*access* -- rather than just recovery -- is obviously what Mr. Freeh wants.

I'd count this likely change in terminology as a "cypherpunk victory," 
albeit a very small and certainly a very hard-fought one.
