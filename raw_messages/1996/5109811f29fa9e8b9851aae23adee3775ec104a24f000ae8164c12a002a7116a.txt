McNeil & Lehear (sp?)  (ok, I know, one of them is gone, but I forgot
which) News Hour had a segment on crypto policy.  Generally a balanced
non-technical report, except that there is no mention of the free
speech issue.

If there is a repeat near you, it's worth listening to, to hear (or
see) what the informed non-technical public hears (sees).
