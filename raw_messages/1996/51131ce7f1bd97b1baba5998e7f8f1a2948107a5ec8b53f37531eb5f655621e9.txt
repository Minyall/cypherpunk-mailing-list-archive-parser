In the case of postal mail, return address forgery is so easy that anyone
who can address an envelope can figure it out.  Requiring something
scribbled there certainly wouldn't help protect against anonymous mail. 
You would have to couple it with "is a person" checks to ensure the person
posting it is the person referenced by the return address.  Bye bye corner
post box.
