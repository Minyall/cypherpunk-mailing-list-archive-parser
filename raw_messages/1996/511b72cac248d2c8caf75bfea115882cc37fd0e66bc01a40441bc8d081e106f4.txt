information -- thanks.

But the original author also needs to step back and understand his
security needs.  In particular, if you're trying to protect your
information against an enemy who is willing to spend $10B to get it,
they'll have a lot of options other than hiding in a back room with some
cracking equipment.  Would you be willing to sell them the information
you're trying to protect for (say) 10% of that $10B?  Would your partner?
Your wife?
