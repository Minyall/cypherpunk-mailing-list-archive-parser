They couldn't get a law passed _then_. Nor did they need to. They also
don't need one now, because they have rubber regulations at their disposal.
They will be able to get a law passed, should their interpretation of the
regulations be thrown out by a court. Passing such a law will be *trivial*.
Just put in the exceptions for the powerful special interest groups, such
as banks. The vote will be near unanimous, as it always is in similar
cases. See Digital Telephony.
