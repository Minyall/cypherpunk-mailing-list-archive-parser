Nonsense.  Your message is a **HOAX** !

Instead, check the "Computer Virus Myths Home Page",
and the specific page describing "Deeyenda", at:

http://www.kumite.com/myths/myth027.htm

>>>          FCC WARNING!!!!! -----DEEYENDA PLAGUES INTERNET

The FCC (Federal Communications Commission) does not issue such
messages.
It's not part of their mandate to do such.
