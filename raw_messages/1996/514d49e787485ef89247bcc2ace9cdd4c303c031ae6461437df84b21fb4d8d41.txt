   Perry's askance leads me to propose stealing Littman's
   book. It's as techno-thrilling as cypherpunks in describing
   the melodrama of unexpected human/technology malfunctions.

   True, only a bit of bare crypto in it, with Kevin advising
   Littman to use PGP so his Well mail could not be read -- as
   Kevin's e-mail to Littman was by Shimomura and Markoff.
   Littman says that was how Markoff learned of Kevin's and
   Littman's exchanges and why Markoff started hustling
   Littman for leads on Kevin to feed the trackers.

   Also, crypto-related: The fact that Shimomura's supposedly
   secret files were not protected by encryption or other
   security is what causes Littman and others to think there
   was a sting (perhaps with TLA help) rather than foolish
   vanity of the security wizard.

   Best, the book provides Clancy-like fun in deciphering the 
   question of why humans abuse technology to mask their 
   own frailty.
