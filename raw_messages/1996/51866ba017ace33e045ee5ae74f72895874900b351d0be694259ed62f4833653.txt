Of course, this appears to be implying that _domestic_ data will be subject
to Clipper 3  restrictions, else this statement is meaningless.

So, will my stored-value cards that I "charge up" in California and carry
in my wallet to Zurich be GAKked? If not, Morris's statement is
meaningless. If so, domestic data is intended to be GAKked.
