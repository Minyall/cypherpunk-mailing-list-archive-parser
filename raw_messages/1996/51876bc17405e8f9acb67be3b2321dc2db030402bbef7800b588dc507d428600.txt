Why should they care?  Huh?  Well, unless you can give them a list that
separates all the sheeple from the wolves, I guess they'll have to
continue their random monitoring just to make sure...

Does anyone really care that the "persons in charge" wear uniforms?

Oh, sure they do.  Let me tell you something.  Big money tells little
money what to do.  I won't bother you with details, as it's beyond the
capacity of email at this time.  But if you think the President is really
in charge, sorry, he's "administratively" in charge, and subject to:

1. Impeachment (the "normal" method of removal, if he doesn't play ball).

2. Other kinds of removal, by Big Money, some of which are very messy.
   Go look at the Zapruder film.  If you think "Oswald" did it, don't
   even bother to reply, as such a reply would go unread.
