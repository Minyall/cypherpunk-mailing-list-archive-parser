....which dates back to laws that said women and children were mens' 
possessions.  Very archaic.

A case from several years ago comes to mind.  Apparently a federal(?) 
court ruled that a 16-yr-old girl's parents were in the legal right 
to burn her krshna books and ban her from practicing it. [There was a 
protest in downtown SF sometime in 1989 or '90 about this.]
