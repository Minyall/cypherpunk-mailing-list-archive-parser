It was Hayek who wrote: "We have no intention, however, of making a 
fetish of democracy. It may well be true that our generation talks and 
thinks too much of democracy and too little of the values which it 
serves... Democracy is essentially a means, a utilitarian device for 
safeguarding internal peace and individual freedom. As such it is by no 
means infalliable or certain. Nor must we forget that there has often 
been much more cultural and spiritual freedom under an autocratic rule 
than under some democracies -- and it is at least conceivable that under 
the government of a very homogenous and doctrinare majority democractic 
government *might be as oppressive as the worst dictatorship.* [emphasis 
mine -DBM]."
