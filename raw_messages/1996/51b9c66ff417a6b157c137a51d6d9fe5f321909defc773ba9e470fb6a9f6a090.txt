I can understand people in other lands having some troubles with many
English words, but one would've thought the constant stream of comments
about the correct spelling of "subscribe" and "unsubscribe" would
eventually get through. Or that people would learn to cut-and-paste from
posted instructions.

Once again, instructions on unsubscribing are included below.

Alas, as usual, those most in need in need of such instructions are the
least likely to ever read these messages.
