 I just summarize grace and serenity to:

    Lord grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change.
      The courage to change the things I can.
        And the wisdom to hide the bodies of the people 
          I had to kill because they pissed me off.
              --attila

    Intimidation is just another form of communication.

::God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change;
::The courage to change the things I can;
::And the firepower that makes the difference.
