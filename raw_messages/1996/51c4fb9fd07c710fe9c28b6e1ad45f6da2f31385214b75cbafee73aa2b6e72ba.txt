PITA, indeed... Not only do you have to re-sign everyone's keys, you also
have to have your key re-signed. When simply changing keys (eg. for a
larger keysize) it's usually sufficent to sign your new key with your old
one, but if you're revoking your old key, the signature won't really mean
anything. I suppose you could sign a message with your old key, saying
"I'm switching keys, here is my new key, please sign it.", and after you
have some signatures on the new key, revoke the old key.

I agree, but in the context of key signing, your key signing reputation is
all that really matters. I would accept a key signed by Bozo the Clown, if
Bozo did the proper research into the keys he signs and has never signed a
bogus key. Of course, being well-known for other reasons would help people
to remember your name. :)
