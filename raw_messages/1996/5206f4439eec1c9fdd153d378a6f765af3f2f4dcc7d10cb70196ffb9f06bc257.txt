We don't really have one, because we respect privacy in general.  Kind of
a "congress shall make no law" approach. Skidmore seems to have a pretty
reasonable policy at http://www.skidmore.edu/help/rules/mail-privacy.html

If you know of others, please pass along for the discussion on the resnet
list, http://www.acns.nwu.edu/resnet/resnet-forum/resnet-forum.html The
subject line there reads "off topic" for that list, but I don't think it
is.
