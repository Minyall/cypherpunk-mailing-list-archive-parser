I'm an accululator :-)

The investments I have I worked for.  The investments I have are as a
result of forgone immediate pleasures (no flash cars, foreign
holidays, no hire-purchase, no consumer electronics etc).  You
probably would look down on my current "standard of living" (something
real life aquaintances like to rib me about).

See, if you spend your money now, on the above, you have no right to
criticize me when I look relatively wealthy later.  It's your choice
to blow your money.

Btw, people of your mentality (communists/socialists) already make it
very difficult for me to accumulate, due to the exhorbitant tax rates
to support those who chose to blow their money as soon as they have it
(or often _before_ they have it, incurring 25% APR credit card
interest rates on top).

For the list of abusive taxation regimes thread: UK tax rates are 24%
basic, 40% higher rate.  Plus 10% national insurance `contributions'
(compulsory state pension payments).  Plus 17.5% VAT.  Plus property
tax.  Plus `capital gains' tax (at either 24% or 40%, the same as
whatever income tax rate you're on).  Plus ~400% Fuel tax rates
(petrol is L 2.76 / imperial gallon which is 3.66 US $ / US gallon!).
