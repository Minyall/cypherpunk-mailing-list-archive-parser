On the "ideal that all children should attend college":

I grew up in Ohio and went to school in the 1950's.  College was a 
luxury, or necessary only for professional jobs (doctor, etc).
There was no Ohio income tax, and no state lottery, both of which were 
instituted (in the 1970's) at least partly on the premise of helping 
schools.

I don't have to elaborate on where the money went, right?  But, if you 
are suggesting seriously that one of the greatest money scams of all 
time, which involves not only moving pay-for-school to the masses (i.e., 
requiring college for nearly everyone), but makes indentured servants 
out of most of the people who get a serious degree, well, you're up 
against the big bucks on that one.
