Subject: Announcing the release of premail 0.44
Message-ID: <199607050216.TAA16873@infinity.c2.org>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain


   The long awaited release of premail 0.44 is now available. This
release integrates PGP and anonymous e-mail functions into Unix
versions of Netscape 3.0's built-in mailer. It also does a pretty good
job with Pine 3.94 (transparent integration of plain PGP mail,
decoding of MIME protected mail requires a single command).

   For those of you interested in experimenting with S/MIME, it
contains some S/MIME functions, but does not yet fully comply with the
standard.

   The main premail Web page is:

       http://www.c2.net/~raph/premail.html

   The premail documentation is at:

       http://www.c2.net/~raph/premail/

   I appreciate any bug reports, suggestions, or comments.

Raph
