Nevertheless, security labels *already* exist in IPv4.

Actually, we're talking about the network level.  The transport level
is where TCP and UDP reside, not IP, which has the security labels.

I'm beginning to agree with the CDA supporter who claimed that "you're
just trying to protect your pornography by saying it's impossible when
we all know otherwise."  Of course, that person really didn't know
otherwise, but I do.  The abstract model of the Internet network layer
thinks of all transport entities as equivalent, as are all link
entities.  In the real world, such mixed user bases are unusual.  If my
scheme were implemented, service providers would probably have to
segregate shell account access onto "childproof" and "adult" machines,
or acquire a TCSEC B level system.  Either approach works, and most
would likely choose the former, since its cheaper.  It's still not
really that many machines.

I don't want the labelling to exist at all.  But I note that even PICS
labelling is not strictly voluntary.  A content provider who fails to
label adult material as "unsuitable for minors" is fully liable for
legal penalties should such material be transmitted to a minor.  The CDA
has nothing to do with it.  It's the same situation as when a bookstore
sells Playboy to a minor or a liquor store sells him beer.

As I outlined the scheme, network layer labels are just as "voluntary".
They really are in the DoD security world, too.  If you create a file in
an editor, you're responsible for making sure the right classification
goes on it, and *you're* going to be held accountable if the information
is leaked because you put the wrong label on it.
