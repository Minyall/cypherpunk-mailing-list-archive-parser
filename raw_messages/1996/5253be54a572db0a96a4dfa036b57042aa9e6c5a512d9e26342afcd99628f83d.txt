Why is the 128-bit version available only in the United States?
It can't be due to ITAR since export of crypto to Canada is ok.
Does it have something to due with RSA only being patented in 
the United States so that's the only place RSADSI wants it
used? I noticed that Netscape's SSL implementation is available
only to developers in the U.S. as well.
