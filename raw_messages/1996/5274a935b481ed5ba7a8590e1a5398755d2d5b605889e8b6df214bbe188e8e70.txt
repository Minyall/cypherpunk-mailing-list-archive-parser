Sorry to disturb everyone, but I've got a questions that is (gasp!) 
immediately related to crypto:

Does anyone have any info on the encryption used in the Paradox (4.5 for 
Win) database? I've got someone that has an encrypted (well, 
password-protected :-) Paradox database that needs some maintenance, and 
the person that knew the password is now - shall we say - 'no longer with 
them'. Right now, doesn't matter if it's something clever, or a brute-force 
hack; they just need to get into the tables and such.
