Here I have to respectfully disagree, totally, with Jim.  One
does not have to "reserve" one's rights.  They are inherent and
my be exercised pretty much at will (I say "pretty much" because
there are situations where "implied contract" applies).

A restaurant or bookstore is a public place in that it is open
to the public.  Nevertheless, without first "reserving the right"
to do so, the owners may tell you to leave if they don't like 
the way you sound, look or smell.  Criminal activity is not
required legally nor ethically.  Your ejection may, in fact, be
totally arbitrary.  I don't see a privately maintained, "public"
list as being philosophically any different.
