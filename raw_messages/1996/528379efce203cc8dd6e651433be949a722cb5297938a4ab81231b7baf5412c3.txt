Oops again, Lance, for you, as you posted my private response to you publically!

No harm done, but my "this discussion belongs on the list" was an
indication of why I was being very terse in my comments. (I take more time
when I know a bunch of people are reading my stuff than when I am just
talking to one person, and when we may have some private shorthand
comments.)

So, everyone, please ignore everything Lance quoted of mine in his message
and wait for the comments I will make to the list as a whole. (Or don't, as
the shelf life of threads really does match the "thread du jour" name some
of us use.)
