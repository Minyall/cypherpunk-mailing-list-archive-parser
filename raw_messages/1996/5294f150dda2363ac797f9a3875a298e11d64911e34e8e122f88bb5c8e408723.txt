	There is no way to demean the integrity of an election
	process that has no integrity, no ethics, and 
	relies on nothing more than brute force. Maybe it
	would be more precise to say it relies on nothing
	more than who can play the best shell game.   

	Jim Bell's solution would be a vast improvement.

	Patience is a virtue,
		Virtue is a grace.
