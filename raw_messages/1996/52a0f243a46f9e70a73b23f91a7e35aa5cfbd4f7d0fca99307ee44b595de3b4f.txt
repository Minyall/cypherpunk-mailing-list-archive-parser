Or how about if you launch a defective missile, GPS-guided, and the firing
circuitry just happens to be misprogrammed so that it won't detonate, and
the GPS module just happens to be very modular and easily recovered for
use in another project?

Maybe this missile could be carrying a crypto-CD, put there as a joke by
an unknown employee.
