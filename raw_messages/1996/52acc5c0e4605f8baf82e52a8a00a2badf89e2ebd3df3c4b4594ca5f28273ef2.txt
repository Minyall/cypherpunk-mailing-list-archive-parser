The mark of a good conspiracy theory is its untestability.  Your theory
fails here, because you could perform autopsies on those hosts who have
died of natural causes to recover the mind control devices.

Suggest you amend the last sentence to read "...one of these devices, which
dissolve immediately upon death, and which are impossible to remove..."
etc, etc.
