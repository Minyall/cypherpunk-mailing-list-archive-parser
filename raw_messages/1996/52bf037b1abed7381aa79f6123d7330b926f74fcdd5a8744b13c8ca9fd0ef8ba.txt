The Feb 9 session of the "Group of Experts" Mr. Gilmore 
mentions was restricted to official OECD delegations.  See:


     http://www.nla.gov.au/gii/programl.html


Papers of the open conference on Feb 7 and 8 were promised 
posting on the Web concurrently but none have yet appeared at:


     http://www.nla.gov.au/gii/papers.html


Cryptographers Quisquater, Denning and Diffie (and others at 
the Paris December sessions) were scheduled for Feb 7 and 8. 
Professor Denning was listed to give "The Future of 
Cryptography" discussed on cypherpunks a while back.


Perhaps a public-spirited participant will share the fruits of 
the open and restricted events, as with the Paris gathering.
