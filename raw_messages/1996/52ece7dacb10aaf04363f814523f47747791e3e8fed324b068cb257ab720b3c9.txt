All the corporate officers are public knowledge.
The corporate veil can pretty easily be perferated if there is a willful
attempt to avoid liability when conduct gets above a certain threshold.

This would be pretty easy to show in the event the corporation never made
dime one and never intended to.

Using corporations as a shield is, in my view, less desireable than having
blinded remailers.
