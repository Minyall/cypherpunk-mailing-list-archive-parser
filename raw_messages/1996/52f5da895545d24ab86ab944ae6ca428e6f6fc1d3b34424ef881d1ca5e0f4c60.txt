Yeah, it's been a wild week.  There was also an airplane hijacking
today, which ended peacefully.  The hijacker had a laptop wrapped
in tinfoil he was claiming was a bomb.*  And of course Clinton's
first speeches after the TWA crash were "we don't have any evidence
of terrorism yet but you'll all have to give up your civil liberties
so we can do a better job of protecting you."

*Penn Jillette proposed that a good boot-up program for laptops
and PDAs is one that displays a big timer counting backwards,
for use in airports that want to see that you've got a real laptop.
