This stego system must be damn slow seeing as they only ever misspell 
it in one of two positions, ie. unsuXscriXe, X any letter.

Still, i`ll assume it was a cunning plan to trick me into telling him 
how to unsubscribe.

To unsubscribe from the cypherpunks mailing list:

Send a message to majordomo@toad.com with the *MESSAGE BODY* reading
exactly as follows:

unsubscribe cypherpunks you@your.domain.com
