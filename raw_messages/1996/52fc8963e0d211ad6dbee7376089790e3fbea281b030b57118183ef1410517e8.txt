The Wash Post today has page one lead story on the sharp rise in
wiretapping by the Clinton administration. Former restraints due to high
cost have been overcome with more money and more efficeint technology,
eagerly supported by a bipartisan Congress and grateful LEA and DoJ
cartelest conspiracists. 
 
 
And, there is a lengthy Op-Ed on the "growing stealth slice of the
shrinking defense pie." 
 
 
Lots and lots of secrets, can't get enough of them, can't tell the public
what they are, about real and imaginary terrorists and anti-terrorists --
and bypass the private citizens that threaten budgets and jobs and inner
sanctum privileges.
