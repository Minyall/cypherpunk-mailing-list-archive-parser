    I always find it ironic when government representatives such as this 
individual feel that they can put on an air of superiority by saying that 
we, the public, are privledged to be able to do something at all.  
Apparently they forget that not only are we the reason they have a job, 
but we're the reason for government, period.

dossiers.
