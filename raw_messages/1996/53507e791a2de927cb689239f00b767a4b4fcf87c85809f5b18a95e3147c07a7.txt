The new edition is supposed to be a substantial rewrite, updating the book
to include a lot of the recent stuff on the NSA. Don't quote me, but I
think Bamford has a co-author, though I've forgotten who it is.

I paid the princely sum of $16.95 in 1982--expensive for a book back
then--for "The Puzzle Palace," and read it cover-to-cover (well, I guess I
skimmed the footnotes). Even before I got into crypto in a big way, I knew
this stuff was important to me.

I certainly plan to buy the Second Edition.
