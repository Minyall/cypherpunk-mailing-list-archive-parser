These guys are worse offenders than whowhere, and they do abusive
fingering (the only webrobot that has shown up so far in my finger
logs):

They have an e-mail address for me I used once in a Usenet test post
5 years ago.  Since that address was entered into their database on
the 9th of March, 1996 the only place they could have gotten it from
is one of Tim May's old Usenet backup tapes.

Coming soon ``Expanded database size''?  I can hardly wait ...
