A clarification regarding something I wrote a few days ago:

A charge card (like the original AmEx, not like Optima) is not the same as
a debit card. I have a debit card, tied to my checking account, and using
mastercard's clearinghouse. To issue a debit card, the organization needs
to keep checking accounts. Even if it doesn't pay interest, doesn't make
commercial loans, etc, it still would be subject to weird Fed regulations
and probably couldn't maintain anonimity.

But the lack of a dispite resolution mechanism is really the killer.
