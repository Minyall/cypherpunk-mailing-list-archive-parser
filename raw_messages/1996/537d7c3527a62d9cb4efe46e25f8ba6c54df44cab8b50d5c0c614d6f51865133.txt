You've just lumped all possessions into a single category.  There's a
valid argument against private ownership of land when ownership of that
land can be (and usually is) moved from the people at large to just a
few people, then eventually to dictators, etc.

But are you suggesting that if I trade my labor for some material item
which was built with other people's labor, and that material item is
sufficiently portable that it doesn't have to occupy a significant
piece of real estate (i.e., a house, a large boat), *they* should be
able to take that material item away from me anyway on whatever pretext,
on the basis that possession of it is a *privilege*?  Is my paycheck,
given to me directly for my labor just a privilege?
