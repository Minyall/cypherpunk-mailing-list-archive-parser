While I'm at it, I should offer my prediction that the Southern Poverty
Law Center likely will become active in attempts to regulate and control
the Net.

To the SPLC, bomb-building and other, um, incendiary information should
be restricted. In today's Washinton Post, Morris Dees, the Center's
co-founder, indicates that a book Timothy McVeigh read influenced him to
bomb the Oklahoma City building.
