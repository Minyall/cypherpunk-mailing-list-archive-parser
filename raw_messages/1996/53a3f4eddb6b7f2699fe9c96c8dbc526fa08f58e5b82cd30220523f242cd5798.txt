I *really* wish people would use his *whole* name, so we don't confuse him
with the other Bruce Taylors on the net.

His whole name is: Bruce "Penis With a Blister On It" Taylor.

Since that's the phrase he kept repeating over and over at CFP96, it *must*
be his middle name...

I'll save the joke about lawyers and neckties for another occasion. ;-).

Cheers,
