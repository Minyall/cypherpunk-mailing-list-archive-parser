Has anyone heard anythong about PGP 3.0?  Is it still due Real Soon Now?  Or 
might it be worthwhile to break out VC++ and do a port as a cpunks cooperative 
project?

"46.  The U.S. government declares a ban on the possession, sale, 
transportation, and transfer of all non-sporting firearms. A thirty (30) day 
amnesty period is permitted for these firearms to be turned over to the local 
authorities.  At the end of this period, a number of citizen groups refuse to 
turn over their firearms.  Consider the following statement:  I would fire upon 
U.S. citizens who refuse or resist confiscation of firearms banned by the U.S. 
government."
