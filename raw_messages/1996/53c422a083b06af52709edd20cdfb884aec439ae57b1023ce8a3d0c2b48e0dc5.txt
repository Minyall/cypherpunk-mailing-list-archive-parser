You sez:

: There has been sporadic interest on this list with regard to
: offshore incorporation, banking, etc.  While ads for offshore
: services are common in the international press, until now, none
: of these companies has an Internet presence.  

: THE ECONOMIST has an ad for OCRA, a group that specializes in
: offshore company services.  What's new is that they have a Web
: page.  It includes a good primer on the benifits from going 
: offshore and on selected offshore jurisdictions.  I've never done
: business with these folks, but they have good info.

I maintain a small page with offshore resources at:
