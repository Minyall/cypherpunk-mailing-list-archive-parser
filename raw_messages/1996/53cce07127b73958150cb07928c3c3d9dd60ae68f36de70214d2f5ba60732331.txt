The AlterNIC is a figment of its creators imagination. It has about
the same credibility level as the claim of the Freemen that they
aren't subject to U.S. law.

They can offer to sell you anything they like, of course, and you can
pay them, but you don't get anything at all for the money. Domains
registered with them don't appear in the real DNS.
