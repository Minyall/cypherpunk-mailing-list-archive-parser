Uni, thanks for noting Bell's XXX-poison, I'd stopped reading 
him, presuming his prescription was a dumb placebo for helpless 
hypochondriacs.


Now, his clumsiness is revealed to be a trick to conceal the 
deadliness of his toxin. Still not sure if he's understands the 
sickness he's spreading. He probably hasn't checked his 
contaminated sources very carefully, or maybe got infected and 
is terminally out of his mind.


Is there a doctor on the list, or a mortician?
