I don't know if this was an isolated incident, but I recently attempted to
pick up a package at the Post Office using my passport as I.D.  NO, I was
told, this is not acceptable identification, and as a union worker, you
can't tell me what to do.  Appeals to chicken-hearted management were
brushed off; I finally identified the highest ranking union official (shop
steward?), who reluctantly ordered the recalcitrant worker to fetch my parcel.

Your guess is as good as mine...
