Ya' know, I keep seeing government references to all this terrorist
technology and know-how on the Net, but when I do some pretty exhaustive
searches I come up pretty-much empty handed.  Are their claims just
rhetoric or am I incompetent at using Web search tools?  For example, where
can one find on the Net: the means to anonymously purchase CBW precursors
or strains, manufacuting and know-how? Where can one find practical EMP
designs and components?  Where can one find practical Fuel/air explosives
device construction info?

I'm sure you can think of other significant items I've left out.  Hope you
get the picture.
