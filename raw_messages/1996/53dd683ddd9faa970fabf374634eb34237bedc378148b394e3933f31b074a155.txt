   "VeriFone and Netscape Plan Software To Ease Internet
   Credit-Card Payments."

      They aim to simplify payments with software for both
      banks and merchants. The bank software would allow banks
      to use their existing computer systems to read and
      process transactions. The merchant software would allow
      merchants to buy just one software package to put up an
      electronic storefront and payment system on the Web.

      Netscape said the software will include a new encryption
      technology that Visa and MasterCard are expected to
      announce in two to three weeks. That technology would
      break sensitive information into 1,024 bits instead of
      the 128 bits used currently.


   "AOL, Netscape Are Discussing An Alliance."

      Netscape and America Online Inc. are in talks to forge
      an alliance aimed at furthering their lead over the
      on-line push by software giant Microsoft Corp. "If you
      can't beat 'em, unguent 'em," Case-squirted an a-oiler.
