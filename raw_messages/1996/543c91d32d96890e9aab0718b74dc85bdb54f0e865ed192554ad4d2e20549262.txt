I agree on expanding the symbols to represent the alphabet.

For example, if the crypto-alphabet for e is 23, 45, 190, 200, etc, one can
remove some of the frequency for a letter.  This definately makes it harder
to attack with the frequency analysis method because the "resolution" of the
distribution for the letter is lessened to a near randomness.  (So it looks,
there are still clues, eh?)
