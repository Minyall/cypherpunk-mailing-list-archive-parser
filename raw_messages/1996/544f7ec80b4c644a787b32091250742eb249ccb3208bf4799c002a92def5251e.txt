     This might be a little out of context, but:

     I'd be willing to bet that about 75% of the people on this planet
would be happy being meidicated, and at least 50% get that way on a 
regular basis. The real question is, is it a good idea to teach kids that
drugs are the best answer to a problem? 

     Again and again I will state that I do believe that ADD is a problem, 
but I'd bet that at least half the time you are medicating the kids because
the parents have the problem.
