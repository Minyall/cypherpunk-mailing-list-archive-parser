	Canada also has less smoking, teenage pregnancy, and various other
factors which are known to raise health insurance costs. I've seen some studies
in which these _entirely_ account for the differences... and keep in mind the
rate of health care inflation of the two countries (depending on the study,
either the same or higher for Canada.)
