There is a story floating around XXXXXX circles that The Japanese carrier
approaching Pearl was spotted on the recently-installed (Navy) land radar
in Hawaii. The target was reported out of the ops room, but ignored by the
same situation room that screwed up (years later) the response to the
Pueblo's distress calls in international waters just offshore from North
Korea. 

Don't even ask me about the screwups I saw them make when I was stationed 
at a XXXXXX base  in XXXXXX
