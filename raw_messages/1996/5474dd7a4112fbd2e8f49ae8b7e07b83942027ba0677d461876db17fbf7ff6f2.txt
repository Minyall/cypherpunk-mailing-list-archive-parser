Phew.  I thought for a moment you meant legal problems.

Yes, I concede, there are significant logistical hurdles confronting the 
multi-jurisdictional crypto project.  One assumes, however, that the 
initial capital investment will be somewhat offset by the first in market 
advantage of the position.

Further, a entirely foreign production, say for chip manufacture, would 
probably make things easier.  I had specifically contemplated hardware 
applications.  Indeed, there are problems with both, but they don't stem 
from ITAR.

Are you talking specific licensing provisions, or implementation.  I 
don't follow.  (Though I'm fairly sure I'm missing something obvious).
