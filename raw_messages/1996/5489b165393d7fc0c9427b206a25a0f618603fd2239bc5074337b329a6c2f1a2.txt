Derek - We accept the gaunlet that Cyperpunks threw down, We will 
provide the complete set of algoritms and free demo systems - we will not be 
asking you to sign a NDA or anything like that, but we do want it to be a 
two way street - if we put our head in your guillotene, to be chopped 
off by the warlord and his minions, then we expect you to perform 
reciprocal actions.

We will be back in a couple of hours or so, to spell out what we have 
in mind.  I do not believe that you will find the terms 
to be onerous or objectionable. 

Thanks for your civility, unlike some of your comrades in arms, very big 
arms, Greatly appreciated!
