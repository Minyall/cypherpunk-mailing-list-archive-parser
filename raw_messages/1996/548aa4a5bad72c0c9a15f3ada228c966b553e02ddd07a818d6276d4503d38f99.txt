  Dmitri, 
 
 
  On 01 28 96 you say: 
 
    Heck, any message on the Internet is inherently porno- 
    graphic because it's just a bunch of 1's and 0's.  And 
    we all know that to Sen Exon a 1 looks like a penis and 
    a 0 looks like a vagina! :-)
 
 
  On C-Span, did I hear Senator Kennedy suggest the Senate Ethics 
  Committee delve into Senator Exon for unlawful carnal knowledge 
  of nuclear arithmetic? 
 
 
  Cordially, 
 
  Jim
