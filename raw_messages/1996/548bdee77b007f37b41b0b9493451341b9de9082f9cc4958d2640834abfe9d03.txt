To call simple lawbreaking by cowards working in secret "civil
disobedience" is to defame the name of Gandhi, King, and all the legitimate
protesters of modern history. Civil disobedience must be seen publicly, and
must be done by observable individuals. Masked men throwing stink bombs is
not civil disobedience--it's hooliganism.
