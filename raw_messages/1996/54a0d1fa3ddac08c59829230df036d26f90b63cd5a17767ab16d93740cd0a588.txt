Is that the same sort of "alerted" that would happen when a keyboard-sniffer-
detecter detects a keyboard-sniffer? Or is it the kind of alerted like
"The keyboard sniffer program was alerted by the OS that it could kiss
off if it wants access to the keyboard"

Or is it something entirely different, like "The government was alerted
that someone was buying a few too many plane tickets to [foreign coutry here]"
