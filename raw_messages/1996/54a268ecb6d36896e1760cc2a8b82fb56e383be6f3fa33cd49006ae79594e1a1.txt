Subject: Anti-Spam BOF Mail List

I've decided to take some initiative and set up a real mailing list for 
the discussion on spamming. I would like to see us take some sort of 
action at the next IETF and maybe get some rough ideas about what is 
and/or isn't possible in dealing with this problem. 

If you would like to join the mailing list send mail to

   majordomo@psc.edu

with

   subscribe spam-list [prefered address]

in the body. 

If you have any problems subscribing let me know. Also, this mailing list 
superceeds the one I set up and announced around an hour ago. Anyone who 
has alrteady sent requests to that mailing list will be added to this new 
one.
