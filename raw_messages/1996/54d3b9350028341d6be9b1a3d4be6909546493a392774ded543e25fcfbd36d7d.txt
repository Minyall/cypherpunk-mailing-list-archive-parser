I find it unfortunate that Mr. Freeh doesn't understand his job.  It
is to enforce the law.  This basic lack of understanding of his
responsibilities explains a lot, including filegate.  He was just
protecting America from Espionage, and the law be damned.

| But we are also mindful of our principal mission responsibilities:
| protecting America's public safety and national security in the myriad of
| criminal, terrorist, and espionage cases that confront us every day.
