	oh, I do not think so --I would answer you in private mail if you 
    were not afraid to state a Reply-To address.  history is a 
    fascinating study in continual revisionism --to the victor goes the

    is based on the same hysteria as has been found throughout history;
    and, see my other comments elsewhere.
