Given that Steve Schear has had civil discourse with me, including a
"nicely put" I just read minutes ago, I am not sure he has thought out his
position.

My forum is this list, and a few related places. It's a forum comparable,
modulo the times, to the forums other thinkers have had.

I worked very hard a number of years, not participating in politics or
activism, to accumulate enough money so as to now be able to live in peace,
not having to get up at 6 in the morning and fight the commuter traffic so
as to get to my assigned desk by 8 a.m.

I will express my thoughts, my theories, and will develop systems and ideas
as I see fit. However, I have no intention of putting my future at risk by
taking steps such as "civil disobedience" or "assassination politics" which
could very likely result in multimillion dollar fines (hint: such fines
would have great meaning for me) or seizure of my assets and jail time.

Your mileage may vary, but this "amateur anarchist" intends to keep on
doing what he's doing and is not interested in "crossing the line" to the
point where his assets will be seized.
