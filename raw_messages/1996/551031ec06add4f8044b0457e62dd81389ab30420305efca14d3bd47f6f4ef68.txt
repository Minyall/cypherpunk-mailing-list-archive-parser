Providing an open door does not mean that it is always open to everyone, 
Dave. It only means that it is open to all by default, but that policy
can be reversed for certain individuals. That is not to say that I agree
with Gilmore's the decision to kick Vulis out from cypherpunks, but John's
decision was neither dishonorable nor he was acting outside his powers,
in my opinion.
