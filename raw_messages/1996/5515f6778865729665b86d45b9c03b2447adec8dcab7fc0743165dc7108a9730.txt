Scott must have. Navigator is very picky about where a cookie comes
from and what is put in the domain field of the cookie.

Go read about the domain field in the Cookie spec. Then, write a CGI
to play with setting/deleting cookies yourself. You will find out that
it is actually almost an art to even get a cookie set.

Maybe this scott wyant guy works for doubleclick? ;)

No sh*t. The cookie spec says that as well.

There is no such thing as a "cookie request". It is up to the browser
to send the cookie and up to you to parse it out of the HTTP header.
There is no way that the browser is going to send the cookie unless
the domain and path matches. Go read the Cookie spec.

Whatever. What are you saying doesn't make any sense if you knew what
the heck you were talking about.

No duh. Navigator doesn't fflush() the cookie file until you quit. It
keeps it in memory for speed.

Who cares if you can't control them? They don't contain any
information that you don't already know about!

Navigator 3.0 has a preference.
