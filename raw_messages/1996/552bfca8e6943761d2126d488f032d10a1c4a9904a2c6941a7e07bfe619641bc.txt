	The first part (redirection at random) can be done via a CGI script;
this may be useful for those wishing to put in links to a mirror site without
having to choose a particular one or host it themselves. Incidentally, speaking
of mirror sites, I'd be interested in locating scripts to do the following:
	A. Automatically redirect someone to an appropriate mirror site based
		upon closeness to their originating IP address
	B. Automatically poll (via crontab or similar mechanisms) between
		mirror sites (and to the anonymizer) to see if they're up,
		using the first part to redirect accordingly.
