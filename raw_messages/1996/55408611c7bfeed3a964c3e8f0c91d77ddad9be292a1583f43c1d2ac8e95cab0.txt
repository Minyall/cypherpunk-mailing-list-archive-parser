http://www.aamva.net/AAMVAnet_New_Systems.html says:
    Coman said [police] officers can use "CDLISCheck" to access commercial
    driver license status, history and AKA information. She noted that
    the new service was developed in response to a Congressional mandate
    that requires access to commercial carrier and driver information by
    at least 100 roadside sites by 1996 and at least 200 locations by 1997.

There's a congressional mandate for nationwide online id???
