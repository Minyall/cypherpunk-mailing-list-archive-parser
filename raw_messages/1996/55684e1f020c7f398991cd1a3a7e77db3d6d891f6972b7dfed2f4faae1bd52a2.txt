	I just purchased Applied Cryptography yesterday, and it included
no disk. There was mention of a disk, and the author noted that the disk
couldn't be shipped overseas due to ITAR restrictions, so I assumed that
the disk wasn't included so that the book could be shipped overseas with
out difficulty.
