Somewhat ironic that the first material to be banned under the
law was by MacKinnon. Meanwhile Dworkin has no credebility at all,
in addition to her "anti-porn" crusading activities she has a line
writing sado-masochistic erotica.

There are equally bad cases in Texas. Two brothers who ran a hydroponics
equipment store got jailed on "conspiracy" charges. 


There are problems in Canada, no doubt. I was simply pointing out
that the Teal case is a bad example. The Zundel case is a much more
apprpriate one.
