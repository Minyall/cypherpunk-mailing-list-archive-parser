Hm.

Seems someone sent a message to my frienly-mailer filter using penet 
remailer.  So of course that person will get an anonymized reply, 
thus being able to know what my anon-id there is.

Fortunetly I don't use penet or rely on it for any form of security.

That's one situation where it would be nice to specify in a line 
somewhere *not* to anonymize mail sent through there (a command in 
header saying X-Do-Not-Anonymize maybe?)

Rob.
