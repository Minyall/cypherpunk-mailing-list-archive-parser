If I owned it, of course I would control it.  Many groups are moderated.
And no university is compelled to carry a group by any law or ethical
principal that I can think of.

You are simply exhibiting the symptoms of a spoiled brat because you have
been fortunate enough, thus far, to rely on the benevolance of whoever is
providing you your newsfeed.  The fact that control is not exercised, does
not mean it doesn't exist.  In reality control is exercised in many ways.

Thus your attempt to demonize me merely exposes your ire for the system as
it now exists, your fanciful dreams of how it should be aside.

Those bits which go to your list you clearly have the right to regulate.
Those that go to Mr. Gilmore's, likewise.

This is where you fail, with the basic inability to distinguish ownership
of intellectual content and the right to compell its broadcast by whomever
might control the medium.

I'm not sure what the above babble means.  I'm not sure you are either.

This is the uneducated man's excuse.
