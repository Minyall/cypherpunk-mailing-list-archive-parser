Cypherpunks interested in establishment scaremongering are invited
to take a look at the Organized Crime Home Page 
(http://www.alternatives.com/crime/index.html), sponsored by a group
called The Committee for a Safe Society, about the world-wide threat
of organized crime.  Apparently every evil known to post-Cold-War
society, even the bad weather in Chicago, is the responsibility of
organized crime.  Now you know why governments need GAK.

Alan-Bob says check it out.
