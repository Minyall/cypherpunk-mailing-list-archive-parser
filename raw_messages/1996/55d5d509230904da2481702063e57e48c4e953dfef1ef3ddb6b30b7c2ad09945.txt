See also _The End of Work_ by Rifkin. It chronicles changing work patterns
from agriculture through mass manufacturing and the service age on to an
uncertain future. Lots of interesting numbers and "look what is already
happening" statements. It also shows that the changes are inexorable, just
as the decline in agriculture based on human and animal labor was.
