Dr. Vulis has in fact been forcibly unsubscribed.  He's on my "who
cypherpunks" list as of 12 Oct 1996, but does not appear as of
04 Nov, 30 Nov, and 18 Dec, when I last asked for a list.

The fact that he still reads the list and does posts only adds to the
arguments against censorship, specifically John Gilmore's censorship.
(This has got to be embarrassing for Gilmore, hee hee.  I'll bet he
practices keeping a straight face in front of a mirror, in case anyone
brings it up in person.)

If, as has been said, assassination is the ultimate form of censorship,
then Dr. Vulis has been shot, stoned, beat on, and cement-booted, but
he still lives and is a thorn (no pun intended) in the side of would-
be censors on the Internet.
