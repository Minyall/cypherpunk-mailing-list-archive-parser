   "US squares up to cyberterrorists." 
 
      Until recently, the concept of "information warfare" has 
      been widely dismissed as alarmist rhetoric and viewed as 
      "post Cold War hysteria" generated by those with an 
      interest in maintaining the vast US intelligence 
      apparatus. But the potential use of computer networks to 
      undermine public confidence, disrupt essential services, 
      play havoc with the economy or damage military 
      capabilities is now being taken seriously in Washington. 
 
      Encryption may be just one of many battlegrounds -- 
      others include: proposals for mandatory reporting of 
      corporate computer intrusions and for exceptions to US 
      laws that prohibit intelligence agencies from snooping 
      on domestic communications; the forthcoming ruling by US 
      courts on free speech on the Internet, in response to 
      laws aimed at stopping distribution of pornographic 
      material; and possible limits on information that 
      marketers may gather and use about children who surf the 
      Internet. Also the Clinton administration is planning a 
      rapid-response team to take charge in the event of a 
      cyberterrorist attack.
