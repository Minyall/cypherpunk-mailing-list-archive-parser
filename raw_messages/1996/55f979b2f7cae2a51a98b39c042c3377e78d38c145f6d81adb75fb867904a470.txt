No, it does not.  Making art more palatable is simply the process of 
free trade between two uncoerced entities.  If the artist does not offer
what the corporate purchaser wants he will not sell.  He thus adapt his
style out to his customer.  Nobody is threatening to use force to
have the artist conform to the client.  Nobody is forcing the client 
to buy what he does not like.

The artist does not have to compromise, he simply have to refuse the 
contract.

Anybody using the term "censorship" to describe that is in the following
situation : he *wants* the advantages of the contract (money) without
respecting the customer, therefore.  He deplores the fact that somebody
(the customer) can act to his best judgment.  The fact that the artist
calls that censorship shows that he have the same thought process as
the true censorers, i.e. the conviction that the end justify the means,
and more specifically, the feeling that *his* ends justify *any* means.

The artist may not act on his feelings but nevertheless, they are, in
essence, of this nature.

And unfortunately, too many artists think that way.
