Hmm. Actually, what do Java dialog prompts look like? Is there any
indication that they come from Java, or can they be made to look like any
dialog from any program, or the OS itself? I suppose this is
implementation-dependent. 

One "neat" trick would be an applet that sleeps for several minutes and 
then suddenly pops up asking for your system password, or something. 
A heck of a lot of people fell for something much more primitive at AOL.
