:I spent part of my growing up years in Leroy West Virginia, pop. :about 15, give or take.  I know about hillbillies, and I know about :guns.

:If you had the impression I am a whiner, or that that defines me as a
:person, you're about as clueful as the other old farts who attack :people they don't know anything about.

Name one thing Dale has not experienced.
