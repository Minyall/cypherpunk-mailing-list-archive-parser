About a year or 2 ago I read some stuff in sci.crypt about
some people doing encryption stuff, I belive with DES, using
DSP chips, I am interested in finding the folks who were working
on it, or related code. If anyone out there has that sort of info
I would appreciate some pointers in their direction.

Thanks,
