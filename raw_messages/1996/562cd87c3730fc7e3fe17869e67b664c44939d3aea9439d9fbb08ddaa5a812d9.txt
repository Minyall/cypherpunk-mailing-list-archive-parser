From http://www.alt.net :

Altopia Corporation "We do news." 

Altopia Corporation provides Usenet news and email services to
individuals and organizations. At this time we are not taking 
any more customers until we have had a chance to refine our 
offerings. Please check back at this site periodically for 
details of future offerings. 

If you have any questions, please send email to info@alt.net.

Caputo mean by "refine our offerings"?
