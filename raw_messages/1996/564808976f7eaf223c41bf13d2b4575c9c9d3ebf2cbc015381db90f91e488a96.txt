I have been a client of the c2.org pre/re mailer on several occasions.   

What with all the discussion of remailers falling away (or being pushed), I am
concerned that the 10 cent fee I, and hopefully others, have been paying in
e-cash is not sufficient to keep c2.og's remailer in operation. I would be
willing to pay, say for discussions sake, the postal rate for the convenience
and security it offers.
