   "FBI, CIA Try to Set Turf Rules as Bureau Branches Out."

      The growing FBI overseas contingent is establishing
      liaison relationships with foreign police and
      intelligence groups that already have relationships with
      CIA personnel. The FBI agents abroad also try to develop
      their own clandestine informants, sometimes recruiting
      individuals who work for the CIA or have been fired by
      it. At a gathering Feb. 3-4 in Davos, Switzerland, FBI
      Director Freeh met with six presidents, seven prime
      ministers and three foreign ministers.
