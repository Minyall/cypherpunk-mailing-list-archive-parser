There is a story @

http://infolawalert.com/stories/051796a.html

describing how Phil Zimmermann is trying to
retrieve all the rights to PGP from ViaCrypt
in order to jump start his new venture, PGP, Inc.

He's taking a sell out or get sued approach with
ViaCrypt, which until recently has not had much
success marketing PGP.
