Yep. Regardless of whether the fabs are government property or not,
it's a sure thing that some contractors have appropriately SCIFfed
fabs and appropriately cleared staffs.

Agree. Keyboard controllers (and other peripheral components
of a system) are a much more tractable target than the CPU and
may be within the capbailities of such organizations. I'm more
inclined towards disk controller subversion myself. Of course,
there's also the apocryphal story of the so called "Iraqi
printer virus" that disabled the Iraqi air defense system.

Subverting the CPU is not simple even by NSA standards.
