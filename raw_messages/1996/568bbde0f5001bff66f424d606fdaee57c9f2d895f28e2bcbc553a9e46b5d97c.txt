Yes, but this is even more un-revealing than the OTP'd message, cause now
you have a list of messages that say

Nuke Siam.
Nuke Ohio.
Nuke Hell.
Nuke Shit.

and so on and so forth, and any of them could be right.
Its better just to rely on other techniques (physical key compromise, etc)
than to have the _complete_ list of possibilities on OTP...
