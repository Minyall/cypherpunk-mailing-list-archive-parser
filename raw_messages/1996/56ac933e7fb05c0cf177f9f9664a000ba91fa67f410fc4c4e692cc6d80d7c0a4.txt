Actually it's Computers and Security.  Complains about the PRNG.  Says if 
someone gets your randseed.bin they can infer the PRNG output sequence 
and your IDEA key.  Doesn't develop in any detail.  Says the IDEA key 
should be chosen from _truly_ random numbers.

And this is an expensive magazine.
