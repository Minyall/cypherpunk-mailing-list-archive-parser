It's not a felony without a felon.  Unless and until the feds prosecute
someone, they may claim it's a felony but they have yet to prove it in a
court of law.  It's just a matter of opinion.  If a law is overturned on
Constitutional grounds it is void ab initio.

was) on a sticker to the correspondent for the Independent (of London) at
CFP'95 in the presence of the NSA counsel, nothing happened.
