Maybe, but consider that they are unable to focus properly on any
activity.  Revolution requires long term focus & unusually good
organizational skills, both are weak in add types.

It's a serious question, no doubt about it.

Well, for the add child, they don't get a proper education by any
measure, no matter what their symptoms are, without some kind of
treatment.  This does not necessarily include drugs, of course, but
some appear to benefit from it.  For the class, a hyperactive student
-- ONE -- is more than sufficient to bring the house down & make it
impossible for the rest of the class to learn anything much of the
time.  As a taxpayer or parent with children in such a classroom
you may find this a matter of some concern.
