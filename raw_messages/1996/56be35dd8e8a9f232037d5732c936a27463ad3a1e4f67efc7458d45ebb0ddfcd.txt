I'd suggest that most/all of us 'mind' ads in papers, tv, etc.  The 
difference is that while we can do nothing about commercials on
TV (short of breaking federal law and jamming the signal) we can
do something about spam.  If there is enough concensus we can
develop/distribute/encourage the use of  new mailers that will help
defeat spam.  

 For example:  If mail comes into a server that has more than 25
recipients then it is only forwarded to those who have "signed up"
for that sender.  When we subscribe to Cypherpunks we also have
to register that with our network of mail servers.  Then if Mr. Spam
sends stuff out it's not been "signed up" for so it gets trashed.

I don't really like mail servers redirecting my mail, but perhaps we
could arrive at a reasonable criteria for filtering if we tried real hard.
