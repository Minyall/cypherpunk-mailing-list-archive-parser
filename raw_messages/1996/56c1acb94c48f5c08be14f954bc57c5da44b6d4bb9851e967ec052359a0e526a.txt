	True.  Yet, my estimate as to the number of 'malicious hackers' 
that would take interest in disturbing such a project (and have the 
ability to do so) is very low.  

	That number would increase though if you were the NSA or any other 
agency perceived as Big Brother, since the hackers would probably see 
your efforts as a threat.

	In every aspect of life we have to deal with the threat of 
someone working to counteract our efforts.  However, to continue 
functioning we rate these threats as probable or inprobable and deal with 
them accordingly.  I don't see skewed results, due to falsifying or 
tampering with records, as being a very probable threat in the present 
especially when you are dealing with volunteers.  That threat would 
increase in magnitude when you start paying people for computer time (as 
they typically have less of a loyalty bond to you than volunteers would) 
or if a person would benefit by corrupting the data (such as in the 
case of a competition).
