This is innacurate. No, methinks it's wrong.  From every history of 
telephones I have read and heard, it was never that way.

The original conception was of using the telephone for broadcasting. 
It's implementation in most countries was for point-to-point 
communication... it wasn't a matter of the users 'found they could 
use it' (at least not in the US).
