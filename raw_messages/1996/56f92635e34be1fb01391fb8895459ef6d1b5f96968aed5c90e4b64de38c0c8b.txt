Today's USA has a pair of front page stories: 
 
 
"Feds ready anti-terror cyberteam" and "Terrorism on the Net -- Post-Cold
War hysteria or a national threat?" 
 
 
They lay out the nightmares and the valiant TLA-daydreams to out-fund the
hackers and out-flummox the public. 
 
 
"You bring me a select group of hackers and within 90 days I'll bring this
country to its knees, " says Jim Settle, retired director of the FBI's
computer crime squad. 
 
 
"The threat is there, it's very real," says CIA General Counsel Jeffrey
Smith. "If we have a Unabomber who decides to launch an attack with a PC
instead of a bomb, (there could be) real damage."
