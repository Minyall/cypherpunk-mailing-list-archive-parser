John,
  I'm going to sit down and write a couple dozen 'generic' response
letters of varying descriptions and lengths, leading these people
on as if I'm interested in their tripe, but ending with a message
that tells them to 'piss off', in various forms.
  I will keep them in a handy directory for 'replying' to their
spamessages.
  The greater the number of letters, and the more varied they are,
then the more these fucks will have to spend their time and energy
sorting through them.  So if any CypherPunks wish to contribute to
my SpamReply Database of 'Interested in your offer....FUCKHEAD!'
offerings, send them to me by email.
  When I get it all set up, I'll make it available to any CypherPunk
who wants to use them.  I think if the CypherPunks all spent just
a few days replying to these spamessages thirty or forty times apiece,
that they would soon find other waters to cast their bread upon.

Toto
