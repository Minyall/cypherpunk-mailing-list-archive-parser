Hi,

S-Tools version 4 is now available from the following URL:

  ftp://idea.sec.dsi.unimi.it/pub/security/crypt/code/s-tools4.zip

You will need either Windows 95 or Windows NT (at least v3.51) to use
this, and all further releases of S-Tools (Win32s is not sufficient).

This latest release fixes all reported bugs in v3, and adds compression
before encryption before hiding, drag-and-drop operation and a multi-
threaded working model.  Further information can be found in the on-line
help.


Regards,

- Andy
