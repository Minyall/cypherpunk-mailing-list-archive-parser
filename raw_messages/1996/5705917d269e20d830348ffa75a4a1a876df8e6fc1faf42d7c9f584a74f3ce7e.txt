Wage earners - people who are the subjects of W-2 forms - are the class of
individuals who can't benefit from offshore maneuvers.

I believe the entry costs for a reliable offshore structure from a 
reliable vendor - ie, one who keeps up with court cases and the Code of 
Federal Regulations on a daily basis - is $50-100k.  Ok for guys who own 
a Dart Inmdustries, but not the unwashed masses.
