	All I got to say is that if a admin wanted to get your mail using
POP3 would be last thing one would try. Since the admin reign over the
machine he could just copy your mail file and do what he wishes at this
point. Besides most admins including myself really want to bother talking
to users most of the time let alone read there mail.
