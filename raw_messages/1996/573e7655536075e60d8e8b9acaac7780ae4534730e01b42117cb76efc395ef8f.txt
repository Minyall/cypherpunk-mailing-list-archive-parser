As Mr. Miszewski is clearly too busy to answer my question, perhaps
some of the lawyers on the list will be kind enough to help me out.

Under what conditions is it fraudulent to give the wrong social
security number?

It seems to me that in the case of an employee giving the wrong number
to his employer, the only person that suffers is the employee through
loss of future payments from the Social Security Administration.  The
employer certainly doesn't suffer.  Assume that the income tax is
paid.

What laws would an employee violate?  What are the chances of
conviction?  What are the likely penalties if convicted?
