Hi all.

I'm writing a paper for a class I'm in.  It has to answer the question
"What evidence is there that new information technology poses a threat
to out privacy?"

I was wondering if anyone knew of some really good online sources I
could access and use.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.
