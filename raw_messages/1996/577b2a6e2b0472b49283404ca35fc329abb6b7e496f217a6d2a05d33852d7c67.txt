A clever terrorist could get the CD and do the same thing :)  They're
clever, right?

That's a function of what information the State decides to make availble.
The fact that it's on the Net or not shoudln't be the issue.  If I can buy
it on a CD or march into a State office and get it, the same potential
harms exist.

I persoannly think this info is a privacy threat.  But if it's legal to
distribute in other forums, the Net should be no different, IMHO.  All Net
terrorist hype aside.
