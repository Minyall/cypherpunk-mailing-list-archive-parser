   There are hooks in 3.92 that can be used to add PGP support. The next
version of premail, 0.44, exploits these hooks. Unfortunately, there's a
bug in Pine 3.93 that prevents it from working correctly. In addition,
the hooks were not made to be MIME-aware, so it only handles vanilla PGP
messages, not PGP/MIME.
   Version 0.44 of premail will be released soon. I have a patch for
Pine, and there are alpha testers who are playing with the code now.

   It's fairly high on my list of priorities to get the integration with
Pine to be really smooth.
