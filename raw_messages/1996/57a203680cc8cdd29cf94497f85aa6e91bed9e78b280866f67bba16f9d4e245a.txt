Look at the bulletin board of your county courthouse. John Doe parties 
are not unusual at all.

Everyone is  deemed to have constructive  notice of notices on that board; 
furthermore, every jurisdiction I've ever seen, also provides for the 
_publication_ of process.  Ya know, that stuff in teensie-weensie print 
in the back of newspapers.

Most peoplke don't read that stuff. Some people do. It opens up a flavor 
of arbitraging.
