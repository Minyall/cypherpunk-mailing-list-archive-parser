Here's some questions I hope some of the Netscape staffers on the list can
help with.

1) Can we delete/rename or otherwise disable the MagicCookie file and still
   use Navigator?

2) Are there headers besides the standard HTTP/1.0 fields sent with our
   http transactions? What are they?

3) Can we go completely stealth inside of Netscape without a proxy server?

In a privacy seeking frame of mind,

Bill
