Hi, 

Lurking here for quite some time until now a real problem has come up and I
need help here.

I'm not in the US of A and the Netscape commerce server that my employer 
recently purchased has only 48bit key (as told by the salesman). My question is
whether it is possible to add-in my own security module (RSA) and secondly, how
difficult is it? The salesman cannot answer me.

Thanks a lot.
