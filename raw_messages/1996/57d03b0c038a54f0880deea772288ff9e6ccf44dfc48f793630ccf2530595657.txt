As long as a reviewer corrects errors, as SurfWatch seems to be willing to
do, I think they are relativly suit-proof.  If they don't, well - anyone
can be sued for anything.  I'll let the lawyers comment on the possibility
of success.

Does anyone know the protocol SurfWatch uses to communicate their ratings
to the software that runs in individual's PCs?  Does it allow monitoring
browsing patterns?
