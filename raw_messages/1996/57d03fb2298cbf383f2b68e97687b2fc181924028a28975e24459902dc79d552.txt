Actually, I've gotten several comments in e-mail to this effect, that if
I'm not actively defending myself, maybe I'm guilty. Most were written
roughly along the lines of:

"Yo, Tim! This Dimitri dewd is rilly, rilly makin' some heavy charges. So
how come your not, like, defending your self? Like, is he maybe like right?"

[spelling and grammatical errors deliberate, to provide the flavor of some
of the post-literate e-mail I get]

As to the ramblings of Dale Thorn about how John Gilmore has an obligation
to provide services on his machine, well, I gave up on Thorn a long time
ago. (In fact, I seem to recall a Dale Thorn I killfiled years ago on the
Extropians list...maybe I'm confusing his name with someone else, but it
sure rings a bell.)

I returned Sunday from several days away from my computer to find the
expected several hundred messages in my various IN baskets, but was
chagrinned to see just how many of them were pure garbage. Between the
"virtual Montgolfiering" of Don Wood and his critics, and the coprophilic
insults of Vulis, little of substance lay in between.

Just say "No" to "Big Brother Inside"
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
