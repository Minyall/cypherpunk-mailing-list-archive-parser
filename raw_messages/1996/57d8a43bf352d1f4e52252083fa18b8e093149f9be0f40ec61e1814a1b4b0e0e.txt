No wiggling involved. I think I refuted you decisively but recognize that
we've reached the point of diminishing returns for this group and that a
discussion focussing mostly on the interpretation of Constitutional
mechanics would be by and large off topic here. I was attempting to be
considerate, not evasive. I'll take it as far as you like (within the
bounds of civility) via e-mail.

Glad to explain it. I used "tell" in the sense of compel, not in the sense
of expressing one's opinion. "Joe told us what to do" is different from
"Joe expressed his opinion of what we should do" in the sense I used it.

Thanks for asking;
