1.  President Clinton declared CDA unconstitutional and directed 
the Justice department to refrain from enforcing it.

2.  The normal course of events, when a new medium starts 
competing against an old medium, is for the new medium to 
be censored to an utterly ludicrous degree, analogous to 
the law requiring a man with a red flag to walk in front 
of horseless carriages, while the old medium has censorship 
radically relaxed.  In the normal course of events one would 
expect a strict ban on pictures of women in clothes cut 
below the neck or above the ankles, and a ban on any 
unpleasant or disturbing subject.  (For example the comics 
code, and the TV rule that married couples had to have 
separate beds)

Instead alt.pictures.binaries.erotica.children is still 
going strong.
