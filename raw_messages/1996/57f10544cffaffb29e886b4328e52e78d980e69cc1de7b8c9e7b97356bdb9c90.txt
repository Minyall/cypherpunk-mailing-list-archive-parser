I used to think that ethnic flames were off-topic for cypherpunks, but seeing
how Timmy May and his friends sput off every day about "crazy Russians", I'm
beginning to think that it may be on-topic.

Surely the fact that Armenians have massacred more Jews and Moslems during

assassination politics.

You certainly write several times more on this subject than I do.

Spoken like a true Libertarian. They always threaten to sue for
libel whenever they disagree with someone.
