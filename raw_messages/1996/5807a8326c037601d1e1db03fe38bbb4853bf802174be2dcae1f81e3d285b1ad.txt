I have no objection to the salami approach in this case.  The way the Burns
proposal has been described, it seems all together better than the current
situation.  We can fight the next battle after people realize that the four
horseman are well and truly loose, and that the world hasn't ended.  When
the Burns proposal has been written up into a bill and introduced, I expect
I will be writing my congresscritters asking them to support it.
