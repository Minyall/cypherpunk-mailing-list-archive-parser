Well, well, well.  Let's see: 
Yes, we are familiar with anon.penet.fi... And all of the better
options available.
Yes, we have pseudonymous accounts.
No, we will not write for more info.  Why not?  Gee, maybe because you
are posting to a group that advocates strong privacy, something that
the US gov't has always frowned upon?  Maybe because you're asking us
to respond to a .mil site with an obviously contrived address?  Are
.mil sites not US military?  I think so.

Where do some people get off?

PS: If .mil sites are, in fact, some country code, please ignore this

send it to me directly.
