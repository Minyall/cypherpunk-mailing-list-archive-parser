Folks,

As this sounds like a previously solved problem, I wanted to find out about
using DES (or any block cipher) as a stream cipher, i.e., in a manner that
keeps input and output data length equal. I don't want to use a true stream
cipher, as I want to use the same key for multiple messages and stream
ciphers tend to place the bulk of their overhead in the re-key. Since stream
ciphers have "memory," I would have to "re-key" to the same key for each of
my messages. I would rather key something like DES once and run it in CBC
mode or use some other form of IV.

Help or pointers to help are greatly appreciated.

                                        Karl
