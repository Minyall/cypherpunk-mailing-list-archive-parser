You know, even though current ecash uses on-line clearing, it is
only necessary for the _payee_ to be on-line at that time.  Thus
it is entirely possible with current ecash for a payer to load 
his portable computer up at home with e-coins and then make a 
purchase a convenience store on the way to work _without_ having
a networkable computer.  Well-- I mean the computer needs to 
communicate with the convenience store, but it doesn't need 
full-scale Internet access.


Does anyone on cpunks or ecash have an Apple Newton?  I know
that they come with infrared-- what are the specs on that
communications device?  And about the Newton itself:  can it
compile ANSI C code?  How much RAM?  Permanent storage?  Speed
of crypto operations?


Thanks,

Bryce
