No, but a number of posters claimed they were Austrians, and among them was Timothy May. So if I can show that Timothy's statements contradict the economic theories he says he supports on the most fundamental level (the level of methodology), then I have a pretty solid case that he is a bit confused and that he should do his homework better before he continues arguing. Unless of course he can show the Austrians (or me) to be wrong; but he hasn't done this yet.

I don't blame you when you get the impression that Austrian methodology, compressed in a couple of sentences, is sophist gibberish. Without the proper background knowledge, this is probably unavoidable; methodology is a rather difficult subject. But if you are really interested and want to know more about it, you now know where to look...
