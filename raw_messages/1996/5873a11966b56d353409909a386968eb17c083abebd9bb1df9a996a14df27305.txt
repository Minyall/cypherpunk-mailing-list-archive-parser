I would not trust Slade Gordon as far as I can shoot him with a tree shreader.  
Gordon was the CO-SPONSOR of the CDA.  Exon got all the press, but Gordon
was just as responsible.  (Maybe the netfolk ought to make that fact well
known when he comes up for re-election. Hint! Hint!)

Where issues of freedom are involved, I doubt if he is on our side.
