	One wonders if an ISP (say, Prodigy or AOL) that used SurfWatch to
automatically filter everything could be liable if they filtered something
that wasn't against their policies (due to overly accepting SurfWatch's or
TimWatch's ratings) - non-provision of service? I'd guess they have some
clause or another in their normal contract w/users to try to prevent such, but
framing it so as to cover such without also basically making it a non-contract
(no agreement to provide anything) could be difficult.
