Tim May's razor sharp wit and excellent accurate analyses have added
much to this group. His early support of the cypherpunk concept has
helped advance the cause of cypherpunkdom. In short, Tim May is the top
of the top, the best of the pest. His impeccable tolerance with totally
unwarranted scurrilous attacks is truly mind boggling. I think we should
all pay Tim may tribute for his fine contributions!
