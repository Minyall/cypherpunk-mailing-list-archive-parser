Schneier has a few words to say about cellular automata in the first edition
of APPLIED CRYPTOGRAPHY (I don't have the 2nd, shame on me).

Howard Gutowitz published and patented in 1992 a symmetric block cipher
algorithm, based on cellular automata, called CA-1.1 .  There are a
couple of CA-based hash algorithms.  CA-based PRNGs have been shown to
be isomorphic to linear feedback shift register RNGs (not linear
congruential generators, despite what Tim says) and so are subject to
the same security woes as LFSRs.
