Ideally, I'm looking for a free space wiper, along the lines
of what Burn 2.4 on the Mac can do.
 
As in, create a file the size of available free space, and then
write garbage repeatedly to that file.

I've found "Real Deal", a TSR that intercepts the DEL command,
but that's a poor substitute, at least for my needs.

Anyway, thanks.
