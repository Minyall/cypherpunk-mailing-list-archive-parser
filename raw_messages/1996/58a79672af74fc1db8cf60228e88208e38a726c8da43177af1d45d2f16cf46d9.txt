   Donald Weingarten, IBM TJW Research Center, writes in
   February SciAm about the center's investigations of quark
   theory by the "GF11" parallel processing computer dedicated
   solely to quantum chromodynamics (QCD) -- a computer which
   uses 566 parallel processors.

   He describes building the hardware and software of this
   unique tool and what two years of continuous computations
   revealed.

   An aside explains a die-rolling shortcut method called
   Monte Carlo to circumvent the enormous amount of
   computation that lattice QCD would otherwise entail.
