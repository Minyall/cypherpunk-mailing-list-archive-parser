Someone else mentioned it, but consider...sending faxes of the printed
text.  Or scanning in a document to fax format and attaching the fax
document to an outgoing e-mail.  How would putting up a fax document for
FTP be considered?  (Much less PDF and/or Postscript)  The line is so
shaky, it's non-existent. 

The whole thing is so absurd and the intent so clear.  Lucky has predicted
that a pro-GAK bill will be introduced into Congress within the New Year.
Considering the language in this latest executive order, anyone have any
insights into how this bill might be worded and the provisions it might
contain?

The biggest question:  will GAK be mandated for import as well as export?
(What are the current regs on import of munitions, anyway?)
