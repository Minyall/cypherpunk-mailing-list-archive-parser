The trouble with sparbuchs is that they are legally available 
only to Austrians.  The answer to this given by promoters is that
since no ID can be required of Austrians and the passbook is in
essence a bearer instrument, the law cannot be enforced.  As far
as I can tell, though, one would really need to handle one's
business through an Austrian to keep from having to answer 
embarrassing questions.  In addition, I personally would not do
business with Mark Mage.
