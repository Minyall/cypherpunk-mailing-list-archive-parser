In practice though, two years seems to be the limit.  That was the duration
for Dr. Elizabeth Morgan and for the guy in SF in the mid 70's who won the
Irish Sweepstakes and refused to repatriate his winnings so they could be
taxed.  Is anyone aware of a contempt sentence longer than two years?  If no
examples exist, then two years is the limit.

There is always more bluff than reality in enforcement.  See the
Transactional Records Clearing House (http://www.trac.syr.edu/) for real
info on federal criminal referrals and filings.  Total tax fraud and evasion
filings were circa 1000 in 1994, for example.
