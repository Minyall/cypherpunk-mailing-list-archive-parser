Put your 2 brain cells together and think for a minute.
 
If you read the stuff - you can see that the bill talks about
key-escrow, BUT you can escrow the key with yourself if
you so desire.  It also does not put up any mandates for
key-escrow requirements in encryption systems.
The bill also will force relaxation of the export restrictions.
 
I hope - you could read and understand that 5 line "executive"
summary.
