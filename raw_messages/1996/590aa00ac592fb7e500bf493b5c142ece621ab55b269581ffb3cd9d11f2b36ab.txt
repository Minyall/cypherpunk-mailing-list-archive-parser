Take a look at the frontline piece on DeBeers, (there's also a good 
"Nova" on the subject) has some very interesting points which tend to 
support the view that the value of diamonds is almost entirely dependent

At one time I had some works which supported this view as well.  I'll try 
to find pointers to them again.
