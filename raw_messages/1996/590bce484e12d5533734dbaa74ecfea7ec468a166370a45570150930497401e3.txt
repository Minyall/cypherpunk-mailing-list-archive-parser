I've heard about such cases, and in fact North Carolina (where I am)
"requires" all drivers to have their card on their person while driving.
A friend of mine was pulled without his, and they gave him 30 days to
produce it, and finally agreed just to look it up on the computer when he
produced 2 other valid forms of ID.  But then again, in North Carolina the
family Bible is a valid form of ID (as well as a completed work
_application_, and other odities).

They seem to have learned the habit of cowering before authority even when
not actually threatened.  How very nice for authority.  I decided not to
learn this particular lesson.
