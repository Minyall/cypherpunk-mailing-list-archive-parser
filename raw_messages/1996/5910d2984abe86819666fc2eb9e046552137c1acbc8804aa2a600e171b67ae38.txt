This misses another point. The question was, how do *we* pay for this 
stuff (emphasis mine).

If someone develops a reasonably easy-to-use and reasonably secure digital
cash micropayment system, then I would be happy to pay to read the New
York Times on the Web. I would rather they were dependent on my money than
R.J. Reynold's.
