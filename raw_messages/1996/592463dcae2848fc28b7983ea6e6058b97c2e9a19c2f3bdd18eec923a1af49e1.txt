Well, it ain't _history_ only--it's also current. Some of us use RPN
(Reverse Polish Notation) calculators exclusively. (Even my screen
calculator I use on my Mac is an RPN one.)

The main split is between RPN and algebraic. Algebraic calculators use
parentheses to establish operator precedence and to alter precedence, RPN
calculators do not.

(Yes, purists will note, advanced RPN calculators have options for
parentheses, brackets, and other similar things, and can even process
algebraically. But not in the basic models, and the RPN computational
model, being stack-based, does not require them.)

To see how RPN works, visit any electronics store that carries
Hewlett-Packard calculators, especially the advanced ones like the H-P 48,
and read the first 5 pages of the instruction manual. It will all become
clear to you.
