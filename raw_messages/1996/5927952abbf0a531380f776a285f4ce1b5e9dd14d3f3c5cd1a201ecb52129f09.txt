Furthermore, one's ten years of required FICA contributions for 
eligibility to collect Social Security or Disability, are a statutory 
proviso, not an administgrative "favor" that the SS Administration grants us.

That is to say, even if their computer doesn't show you as having enough 
contributions to be eligible, you are still entitled to make your own 
independent showing of the fact that you made the payments. It is NOT 
required that they have been "credited" to your account all along.

There are many many many ways to document for posterity, payment of 
funds. We don't have to depend upon subversive foreign nationals who 
think they are hot shit because they work at building bigger and 
better computer surveillance-state systems.
