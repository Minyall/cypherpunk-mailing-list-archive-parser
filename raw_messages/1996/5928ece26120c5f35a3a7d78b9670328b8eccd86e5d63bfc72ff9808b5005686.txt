That's right. alt.sex.plushies is for people who have sex with plushy animals.
(My 4 cross-posts were actually a part of the thread about the censors who
forge cancels for articles in a.s.p that they consider off-topic. As you see,
the cypherpunks mailing list is not the only forum being censored.)
That was my only interest in a.s.p. Why, does Timmy May (fart) have sex with
plushy animals in addition to his two cats?  How disgusting.,

Mark, I found Misha Verbitsky'd writing about me very amusing.  As long as
one realizes that he's making it all up, it's very funny. He has more stuff
as his Harvard site, about Alex Thurston and Rabbi Shlomo Ruthenberh who he
claims are my tentacles. Check it out.

(But when someone is stupid enough to run around citing a work of fiction as
if it were true, the way Timmy May (fart) does, that person is clearly an idio
t.)
