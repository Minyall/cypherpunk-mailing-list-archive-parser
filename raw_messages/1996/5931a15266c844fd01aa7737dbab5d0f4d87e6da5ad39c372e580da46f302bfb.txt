Well as much as it pains me to take Dimitri's side I doubt that any damages can be
proved by his statements on this list. My reasoning for this opinion is as follows:

A.  Dimitri is a nut, kook, ...ect. Definitely suffering from dimished capacity.

B. Everyone on the list is aware of point A.

C. So with A & B true when Dimitri makes his nutty statements they are taken by the
list as just that, nutty statements. 

Under the above I find it hard to see any real damage caused by Dimitri's statements.
Granted Dimitri is an anoying pest, I don't think that a lawsuite will do anything to
slow him down as I don't see one as winable.
