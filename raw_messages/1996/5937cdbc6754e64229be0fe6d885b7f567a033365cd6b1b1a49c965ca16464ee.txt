HP has info on its new crypto stuff on the web now:

<http://www.hp.com/go/security> and
<http://www.hp.com/go/icf>.

It's apparently a crypto coprocessor embedded in a board or chip which
looks for a "policy token" (which is software/data, delivered via network
or smartcard) which is doled out by local "policy servers", "developed and
managed in conformance with national policy". 

Sounds to me like they want to be able to turn off strong crypto the way
they can turn off high-detail GPS during politically/militarily sensitive
events. 

As the press release notes,

"ICF is designed to run any current or future cryptographic algorithms.
Algorithms for key recovery also can be used. "Keys" are strings of
computer code that lock and unlock data. Key recovery is a method that
allows users to unscramble encrypted data if they lose their keys. Users
can decide whether to use key recovery, based on personal needs or domestic
-- or foreign -- government regulations. 

ICF cryptographic units, which can support keys of any length, are
exportable because they are disabled until a Policy Activation Token
activates them again. Policy Activation Tokens can be either a downloadable
software module or a smart card. Policy Activation Tokens trigger
particular algorithms for specific applications, based on needs.
Additionally, ICF adapts easily to current government encryption policies,
new encryption algorithms and changing key-recovery schemes. Customers who
use ICF-based products are offered long-term investment protection, with
rapid flexibility to meet changing needs." 

ICF is "International Cryptography Framework". 

The press release includes quotes from US and French government officials
indicating that the new system will meet their needs.
