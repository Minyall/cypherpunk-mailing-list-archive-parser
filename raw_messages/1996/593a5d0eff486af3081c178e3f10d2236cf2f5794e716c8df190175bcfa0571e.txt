   1-2-96. WaPo:

   "Undercover on the Dark Side of Cyberspace. On-Line FBI
   Agents Troll for Those Who Prey on Children."

      The FBI unit now has more than $1 million worth of
      equipment, including high-speed modems and large data
      storage devices. In cases where suspects' computers have
      been seized, the agents have run up against
      password-protected and encrypted files, which sometimes
      have taken FBI technicians hundreds of hours to decode.

   "Pobox and the magic cookie."

      Which company will have the greatest effect on the
      development of the Internet this year? My answer is
      neither Microsoft nor Netscape. It is a tiny new company
      called Pobox.com. Its product consists of a simple
      forwarding service that is an electronic equivalent of
      a post office box. This service allows people to give
      out an e-mail address that is independent of where they
      work or where they choose to buy Internet access.
