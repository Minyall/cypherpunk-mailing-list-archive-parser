Mr. Miszewski:

As an attorney, you may be acquainted with the concept of "reasonableness."

I can certainly express my personal freedom by passing wind at home (subject
only to the possibly vociferous objections of my family).

Were I to fart in church or in a board meeting, that would be a horse of a
different color, nicht wahr?
