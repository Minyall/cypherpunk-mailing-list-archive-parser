No, I wouldn't consider the fingerd exploit a data propogated virus in 
the same sense as data embedded in a purely passive activity (viewing an 
image file) which somehow launches a vicious nasty on your disk. However, 
you do bring up an interesting point in that example.

Netscape and programs of that ilk, IMO, yield antoher exploitable pathway 
into a system, should someone figure a method to shove a jam into the 
doorway to keep the door open long enough to allow a renegade proc to be 
started and executed outside the control of the local operator.
