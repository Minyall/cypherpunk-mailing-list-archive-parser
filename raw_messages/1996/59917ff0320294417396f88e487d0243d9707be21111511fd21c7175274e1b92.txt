   The New York Post, Jan 6, 1996. By Uri Dan from Jerusalem

   Palestinian police said Ayash [The Engineer] was killed 
   north of Gaza City when he answered a call on a cell 
   phone rigged with two ounces of explosives.

   Israeli sources said the phone had been secretly traded for
   Ayash's real phone -- and the explosion was triggered by
   remote control once it was determined he was on the line.

   No brand name given, however, another source writes that 
   Mot runs the IL cel net. So use that neat audio-vox 
   wire on MicroTAC Elites only with paid-up Shin Bet dues, 
   absent TS-immunization.
