After a conversation with a well-respected cypherpunk in private email,
I have been convinced to reveal publicly that at age 6 [first grade] I
had access to a .22 semiautomatic rifle and a 12GA shotgun, with good
safety instruction and accuracy in each (though the 12GA's kick took a
bit of getting-used-to). I was instructed to shoot any burglar, and I
feel lucky that we never had any. The thought of taking these (or any!)
guns to school _never_ entered my mind. I drove a car (on private land)
when I was only a bit older. There are certain 6 year olds who are quite
capable of taking proper responsibility with firearms, and there are also
certain 26 year olds who probably should reconsider gun ownership.
That's life. The reason I posted this non-cryptography stuff (sorry,
Perry!) here is that many non-US citizens may not understand the strong
"gun culture," (which is actually more a gun-safety culture, IMO) in
this country. Gun-grabber-hypocrites like syndicated columnist Carl
Rowan are provably the *least* safe gun owners, and the evidence also
proves beyond any doubt the good old bumper-sticker saying:
"Ted Kennedy's car has killed more people than my gun."
[Any replies to private e-mail, please.]
