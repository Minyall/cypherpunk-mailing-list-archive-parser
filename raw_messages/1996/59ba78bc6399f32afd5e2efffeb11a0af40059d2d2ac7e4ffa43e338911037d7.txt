Don't go Grubor on us now Tim. Slip over the border and get some downers to
handle the delusion of "some jurisdictions" that make it "illegal" to call
someone "black." 
 
Your gorge is also a lot more steady than you think, so I wouldn't worry
about it. If you can choke down nuclear bombings of civilians, surely you
can handle the new "private dictionaries" of a few radical feminists who
spell "adult female" w-i-m-m-i-n.

PS: I identify with that section of the women's liberation movement who
spell a different word b-y-t-c-h.
