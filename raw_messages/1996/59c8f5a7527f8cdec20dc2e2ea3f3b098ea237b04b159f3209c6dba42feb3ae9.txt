I know one lady get robbed several times by people scanning and
duplicating codes on the garage opener.  There are no garage openers
manufacturers who have a "real" crypto challenge/response system.  Most
just give the code number and the opener verifies that that 8-24 bit code
is correct -- real easy to scan or duplicate.

The key switches/emergency latches are very easy to bypass as well.  The
latch can be pried off and these code things can be pried off and
bypassed with a simple hot wiring.  They don't know anything about tamper
switches.
