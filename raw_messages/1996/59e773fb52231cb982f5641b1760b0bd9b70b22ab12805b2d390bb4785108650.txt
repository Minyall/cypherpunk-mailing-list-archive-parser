ROTFL!  Marvelous.  This from the folks who brought us SoftRam95,
arguably the most blatant fraud ever perpetuated on the software buying
public. For that, they recently got off with a remarkably soft slap on
the wrist from the FTC.  (See
http://ftp.uni-mannheim.de/info/OReilly/windows/win95.update/softram.htm
l for the story.)  I wouldn't buy a _screen saver_ from these folks, let
alone a mission critical piece like email encryption!
