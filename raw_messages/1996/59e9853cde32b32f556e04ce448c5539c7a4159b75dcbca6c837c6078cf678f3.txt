Not really. At the last OECD meeting in Paris a couple of weeks ago, 
there was no great love by quite a few countries for key escrow. The 
scandavian countries were pretty united against and all sorts of other 
raised objections. (tho some of those objections were to the US 
ramrodding key escrow through OECD).

BTW. Those wizards at Wired have gotten our favorite spook Stewart Baker 
to write an article for an upcome issue talking about how the rest of the 
world save Japan loves key escrow and those big bad Japanese are 
thwarting the rest of the worlds "consensus". Its quite a load of 
inaccurate shit but our effort to rebut it was rejected by wired (I guess 
it wasnt trite enough for them).
