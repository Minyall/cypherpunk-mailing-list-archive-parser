	I happen to run a mailing list, sdadmin, for folks to talk
about SDTI technologies.  Talk to majordomo@jabberwocky.bbnplanet.com.
There are a number of cards out there.  I've been looking at
CryptoCard & SNK recently, as well as V-One's smartmouse & virtual
smart card technologies. 

	I'd be very interested in seeing the algorithims come out,
especially F2.  I have a few attacks that look very nice on paper that
I'd like to try out.

	My understanding is that the guy who was going to give the
talk had nda difficulties.  Vin?  Did you make it out?  The talk was
going to be on race conditions, denial of service attacks, and the
like.

This should be interesting, if they can find people to make things
happen before 2000.
