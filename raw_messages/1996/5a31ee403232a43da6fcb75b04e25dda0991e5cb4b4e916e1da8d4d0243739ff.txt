There are no restrictions on the use of cryptography inside the
U.S. of any kind. There are restrictions on exporting cryptography,
and in some instances that can, technically, be giving a foreign
person information on cryptography. However, you are allowed to use
any crypto system your heart desires -- no regulations on it at all.
