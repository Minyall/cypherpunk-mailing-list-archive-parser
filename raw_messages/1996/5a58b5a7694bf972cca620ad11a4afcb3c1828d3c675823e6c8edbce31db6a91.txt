You're not very good with context, I see.  The above statement neither
endorses nor condemns the notion of cryptoanarchy.  

You claim that you want to debate Tim on the issue but that he won't put the
issues on the table.  It's all right there for you to attack or support.  

Here:
THESIS:The deconstruction of democracy enabled by the inevitable genesis of
cryptoanarchy will result in a more just (fair?) society.  

Go for it.   Please start a relevant and interesting debate.  But quit
whining that Tim May won't challenge your brilliant mind.  Pick a point and
dissect whether it's accurate or flawed.

Brutality amongst human beings has little to do with what type of
government (or lack thereof) we have established.  Nor is brutality
inevitable amongst human beings; governments have little or no affect on how
individuals think and behave.

Great.  But you said you wanted to debate the fundamental points raised by
May.

O.K.  The point in the original message was that these things are inevitable
if only one anonymous payment system is established.  

1) Do you agree that these things are an inevitable consequence of anonymous
untraceable payment systems?

2) Do you agree then that all it would take is just one?  Or could one alone
be stopped or controlled?  how?

3) How can these bad things be prevented with an anonymous untraceable 
payment system?

Pick any or all points and make your case.
