A collision with an unarmed missile would explain why they are not finding
much evidence of high explosives (the pitting, ruptured metal, and residue). 

If a missile going at supersonic speed hit a 747 in the underbelly, near a
fuel tank, I sure believe that it could take out the 747.  If it was
coming toward the 747, not catching up to it from behind, the collision
speed would be the addition of the two speeds.  In this case a soft
civilian airplane would not stand a chance.  Civilian airplanes are
designed to survive collisions with birds, but not supersonic missiles. 

If the Navy was firing missiles in this area, it really does seem like the
press should be checking out this angle.
