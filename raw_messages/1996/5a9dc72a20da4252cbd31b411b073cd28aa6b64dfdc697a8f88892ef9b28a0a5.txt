        I'm gonna stick my neck out here and ask a naive question: where
        can I find "the NAS report" mentioned in this thread?  Note that
        I'm new to this list (2 days) so please be kind if this paper is
        extremely well known (it's not known to me but it sounds like
        something I need to read).
