Perhaps what is needed is a non-profit, charitable 501c foundation to
encourage anonymous communication.  Those who support the idea could make
tax deductible contributions which would be used for grants, public
education etc. etc. to encourage anonymous communication.  It could be
called, "The Federalist Foundation" because the Federalist Papers were
published anonymously.
