Some annotations:

1. The easiest way to make such a distributeted data havens (DDH)
would be to use a distributed unix file system that
doesn't distribute files but chunks of bytes. (Striping)

Advantage: 
- All normal services would work: ftp,http,...
- Copying, deleting and modifing files.
- Easy to install and use.

Problems:
Because each side can supply all data (collecting on
the fly from other DDHs), the site holder
could be responsible for the data.
This could be prevented by collecting and
assembling data at the client side (e.g. using
JAVA).

2. When the DDHs are distributed around the world in
a lot of different states, it could be very
difficult for any government to get any evidence for
"illegal" data on one site.
