To which this card-carrying member of the media replies:

Companies cited in the PRESS RELEASE - that means public relations product,
not journalism product - were involved in signing off on what went into the
release. By definition, no member of the press was involved in producing
this document

It seems directing questions to the companies would be a good idea.
