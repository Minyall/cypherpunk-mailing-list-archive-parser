This isn't true. I don't believe in killfiles. Being on my twit list simply
means that you're entitled to a brief acknowledgement of every message you
send me. Skippy was added after he sent me the 3MB results from the
rec.music.white-power vote as a rather limp mailbombing attempt (free clue:
it takes a lot more than that to make a dent in our bandwidth or disk
space); see http://www.stanford.edu/~llurch/potw2/rec.music.white-powder for
that email.

The one that used to be running on darth.stanford.edu was pretty good. 
Since February 22nd, I've working on the assumption that everything I do
unencrypted is public. I would revoke my PGP key, but I never used it much
for receiving mail anyway, and I'm not sure that it was found.

Gee, what a great idea! Why hasn't anyone thought of that? hks.net, for
example. Unfortunately, there are too many copyright terrorists here.
There's a tradeoff between freedom and visibility. As astute readers are
aware, hks.net had to take down the archives after WSJ made a threat that
was a little too credible.
