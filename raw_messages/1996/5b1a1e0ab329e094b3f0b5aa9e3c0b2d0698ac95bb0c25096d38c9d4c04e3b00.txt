tsecret.zip     TOPSECRET!: Easily encrypts any file

TOPSECRET is a program to encrypt your sensitive files.  This program
does not use the RSA standard (which is restricted for export).  This
program uses the aid of a "Catalyst" file (which can be any file) to
encrypt another file (any file).  The Catalyst acts as a key to code and
decode your sensitive files.  Of course you can even make your own
catalyst by encrypting one file with another.  A periodically changing
Catalyst can be made by combining 1-Registered mail file 2-Courier file
3-Last message file; This would ensure high security for the transmission
of your sensitive files.I am sure you will come up with your own methods.
