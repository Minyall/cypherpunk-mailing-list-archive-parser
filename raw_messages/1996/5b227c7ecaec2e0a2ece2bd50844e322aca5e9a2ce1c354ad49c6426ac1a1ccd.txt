Sure, I bounce it back to them too, by quoting the whole post - but like
snow says, I try to consume their time by asking stupid questions.  I
feel it is important to show a little interest in their product or
service in order that they can't tell the genuine replies from the
anti-spam replies, which should (hopefully) mean they'll target their
spam a little more carefully in future.
