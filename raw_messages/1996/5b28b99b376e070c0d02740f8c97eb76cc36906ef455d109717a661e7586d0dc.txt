Have any on the list been following ballot measures aimed at term limits?
In Nevada, one of (I believe 45 states) with such initiatives on the
November ballot, the measure seeks to limit some state offices and requires
the state to call for a Consititutional Convention to limit terms of
Federal Senators and Reps.

If these pass we could be in for some wild times as every disaffected group
(e.g., pro-life) seeks to codify new Amendments in agreement with their pet
cause.
