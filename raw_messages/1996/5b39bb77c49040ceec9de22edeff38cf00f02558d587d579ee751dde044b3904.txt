I've got a question that I feel like I *should* know the answer to, but don't.

Say I configure Netscape to point through an open http proxy, and then connect t
an open NNTP server.  I don't know much about how proxies work.  Does the NNTP 
connection go through the proxy or directly from my machine?  As I understand it
if it does the first, then I don't have to worry about the NNTP server's log 
file, if any.  But if it does the second, I do.

Am I in the ballpark here?

ObCrypto: Not-readily-traceable posting with less hassle than a mail-to-news 
gateway seems to have some privacy relevance, even if it's not directly crypto.
