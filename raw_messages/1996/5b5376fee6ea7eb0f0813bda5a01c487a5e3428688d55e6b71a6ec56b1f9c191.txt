  I guess that is what I get for posting when too tired.  Certainly the
current SSL won't work for UDP based protocols.  Either we will have to
make a UDP version of SSL or use some existing protocol that gets the job
done.  Since our acquisition is not complete I haven't really had an
opportunity to talk to the streaming media guys yet...

  Here is a quote from a recent press release - "The Netscape LiveMedia
framework will be based on the Internet Realtime Transport Protocol (RTP),
RFC number 1889...".  The full release can be found at:

	http://home.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease81.html

I believe that the current product (which was developed by a company that we are
acquiring) will be migrated to RTP as soon as we can do it.
