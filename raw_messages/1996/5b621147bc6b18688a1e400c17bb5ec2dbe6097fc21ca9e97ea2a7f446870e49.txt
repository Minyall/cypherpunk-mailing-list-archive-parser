Pretty good summary of one position. I'd add that in addition, some groups
you mention blackmail society by being loud and in your face, and prey on
others' fear of being thought politically incorrect, to gain amounts of
public treasure and air time vastly disproportionate to their needs or
their problem in the heirarchy of needs and problems facing society.

Putting it a bit more directly, gays are a small percentage of society but
many are constantly demanding air time, infiltrating the media to create
exposure vastly disproportionate to their numbers, and demanding public
funds per capita way in excess of what the poor, the heart-disease or
cancer-ridden, or the heterosexuals get for _their_ needs. In their latest
attempt at public blackmail they're trying to get the nation to agree that
we should provide incentives for homosexual marriages (the marriage
benefits of Federal law are incentives to behavior society wants to
encourage, not an inherent "right" of marriage).
