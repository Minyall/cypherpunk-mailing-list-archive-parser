I have looked into UK line costs recently and I suspect that the 
suggested costs do sound perhaps a little high.  Although the set up 
cost is probably OK, I would suggest that the running costs (assuming 
that these comprise the circuit charge and payment to an ISP) could 
be less that half that quoted.  What you have been quoted may well 
depend on who you have spoken to.

Best wishes,
Matthew
