It's a clever piece of misdirection, "Tim", but it just won't work.

You know as well as I that that was no router failure at all, but an 
unavoidable side-effect of putting the man-in-the-middle connection that
directs all electronic communications to or from the real Tim May through
the Blue Cube at Onizuka Air Force Base.

Poor Tim - getting a sanitized, innocuous Internet feed.  Possibly none
the wiser for it.

I bet you're having fun, whoever you are, with the chance to make a
monkey out of Tim.  But we're on to you, and it's only a matter of time
before Tim is, too.
