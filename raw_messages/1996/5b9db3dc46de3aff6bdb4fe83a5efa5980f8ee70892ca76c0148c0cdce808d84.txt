Can someone please tell me how you can change the From: header
in the email? I know it's possible... my computer teacher used
to do it all the time... but how? (unfortunatelly his explanation
was to hard to comprehend for me at the time). Thanks a lot...
And in case it helps... I'm using a VAX.. regular text account.
If it makes any difference. Doesn't it have something to do woth
getting into the mail port? 

Roki
