I screwed up and mistyped the URL in my prior message
referencing Dorothy Denning's updated article on "The Future
of Cyptography."

The correct URL, pasted directly from my browser which is
now displaying the article, is...

http://guru.cosc.georgetown.edu/~denning/crypto/Future.html

Sorry about that.
