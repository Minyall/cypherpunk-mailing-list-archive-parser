    The mountain is not for the public . Not even mormon public. The
records are.The mountain merely contains dup0licates of everything so in
the event of a nuclear devastation the church could paste things together
again. People can submit whatever they wnat to the records including wills
and trusts and stuff ,but that has nothing to do with the gentile
community at large . i can only think of the microfilms containing a
gentile will if that gentile wanted one.
