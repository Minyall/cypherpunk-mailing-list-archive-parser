(See code relevance at end.)


For the curious, Fresh Kills is NYC's main waste archive, the 
largest built structure in the US (a favorite of Japanese 
techno-tourists exceeding 256 Great Pyramids of Egypt) and 
still heaping.


Archeologists are indeed excavating selected spots, under 
grants made after probes revealed that decomposition was not 
occurring as expected. Newspapers and such were perfectly 
preserved after years of burial. Due to sophisticated 
engineering of the mountain to prevent dispersal, air and 
moisture could not enter to lubricate return to mother earth.


However, very profitable methane gas retrieval has been taking 
place for many years -- which may be a suitable metaphor for 
mining electronic archives.


Now, then, code for this glop? Construction debris can be 
illegally dumped at Fresh Kills with the proper 
building-code-compliant green handily hooked to the side of the 
dumpster for the guard.
