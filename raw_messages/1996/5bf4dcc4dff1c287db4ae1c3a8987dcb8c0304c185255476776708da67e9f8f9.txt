	Is this so? Last I had heard, Congress was looking at eliminating 
the credit altogether. It's slightly misleading to call it "tax free", 
though; the way I understand it, it's not included in the IRS's 
estimation of your assets, but may play a factor in determining the final 
amount of $$$ you end up paying. Very rarely does it translate directly 
into a $70,000 break on your taxes, although it does help. At least 
that's the way it has been represented to me (albeit by an expatriate 
chapter of the American Businessmen's Association). There are no doubt 
rules and exceptions to what manner of income may be exempted, as well. 
	It would be wonderful if the amount were increased. It would be 
preferable if the requirement to pay taxes at all were eliminated, but 
that would be asking too much of today's deficit-hungry, anti-"corporate 
welfare" environment...
Not that it affects me anymore one way or the other, except insofar as it 
hinders the desireability of U.S. workers abroad. One wonders that 
whether the spread of such potential tax-avoidance schemes as 
ecash/data-havens may, er, restore U.S. competitiveness in a novel way.
