   "Air Force Halts Merger of SAIC and Aerospace. Feared
   Change Could Affect Spy Program."

      Aerospace has analyzed all aspects of the nation's
      super-secret satellite and rocket programs, as well as
      space companies' most sensitive proprietary data. The
      Air Force's clubby classified space office feared
      changing Aerospace's status could disrupt operations.
      Many defense contractors have complained about such
      feared contracts for insiders, begging: god, give us.
