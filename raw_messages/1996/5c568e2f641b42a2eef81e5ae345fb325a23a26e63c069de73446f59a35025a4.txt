Dear Cypherpunks,

   Due to really lousey circumstances, I have been unable to monitor my
mail for the last 3 months. Also, last 3 months mail currently unavailble
to me. I am interested in finding out if there have been any new soft-
ware offerings or software upgrades in that time. My particular interest
is Dos/Windows. Also, locations where software can be downloaded. Note
that a brief description of recent software developements maybe helpful
to other Cypherpunks with little time to monitor Cypherpunks list.

                                                   Beat State,
                                                   Gary Jeffers
