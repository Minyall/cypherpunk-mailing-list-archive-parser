The high-frequency harmonics from your computers are probably above the
cutoff frequency of the water-pipes when considered as circular waveguides.
The water filling will act as a dielectric, bringing F0 down.  So, it
is conceivable that extremely high frequency radiation (>3 Ghz) could
propagate well in a water pipe.
