The remailer capacity is quite underdone, there aren't really 
that many remailer servers out there.  Only TWO servers outside
the US.  Only ONE server making direct posts to netnews.  And
what, two or three nym servers?  Obviously this is severe 
undercapacity and we need to start up MUCH more servers and
FAST, ESPECIALLY in foriegn countries.

IMHO, trying to make it more user friendly to use remailers
is pointless considering the limited number of servers to use.

I'm CLUELESS about this stuff, I'd love to help, at least by
distributing code and exact intructions to make it as easy
as possible to encourage clueless types to start it up.

So what is the expense of setting up a full-featured server
like hacktic?  Mr. Graves should start up a new server, and
tcmay is rich, so he has no excuse.
