I've got a networking application upon which I'm working that requires 
high-speed DES capability that can be clocked up to around 20 
megabytes/second.  We're going to have to do circuit board level design, 
so I can't plug a stand-alone box on the ass-end of the network device - 
it's got to be planted into our network controller.  This thing is going 
to provide ATM/SONET communications.

Does anyone know of any chip sets that can run at this speed?  Input 
regarding either commercial or R&D sources would be appreciated.  I know 
that two years ago at the Internet Security meeting in San Diego we saw a 
parallel processor configuration of DES chips, but I can't remember which 
University in North Carolina was working on this.  If anyone knows if 
this research went anywhere, I'd appreciate hearing about that as well.

Thanks for the help!
