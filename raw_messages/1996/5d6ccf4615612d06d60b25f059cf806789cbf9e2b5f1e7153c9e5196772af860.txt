There is also a utilitie I use called mkpgp. It also envokes the 
alternate editor for encryption and decryption of signed mail. It also 
has an extensive readme and help files. To get it you can do the 
following: 

If you send blank e-mail to slutsky@lipschitz.sfasu.edu with
        Subject: mkpgp

They will mail you everything you need to get started. It took me about 
20 Minutes to get it up and running.
