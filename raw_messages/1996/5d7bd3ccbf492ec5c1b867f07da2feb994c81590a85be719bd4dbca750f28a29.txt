Are the Password Keystroke Snarfer programs anything like the Password
Keystroke Snipe Programs?
  Some Cypherpunks told me they'd explain the Snipe Programs to me if
I bought a case of beer, but I lost them on the way to their secret
meeting place in the woods, and I had to walk home.
   Gee, they were sure nice guys, though.
