   Yes, when Mr Anon travels to a beach in Jamaica or in Mombasa, he 
shouldn't complain when the taxi driver takes him, not to his requested 
destination, buit some dark alley where Mr Anon gets clunked over the 
head and his wallet removed. The locals need the money more than Mr 
rich-tourist-on-vacation Anon.  They're only doing socialist justice, 
after all.

Property is property. Theft is theft.
