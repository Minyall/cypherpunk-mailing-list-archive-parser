Mpls. Strib did a piece this morning, front page, about AltaVista,
Dejanews, etc. Well-worn territory to readers of this list. Your
words can come back to haunt you, all that stuff. One paragraph that
deserves rebuttal from those of you who are better-informed:

"Of course, technology is working on solutions to itself, but
   mechanisms that would hide the name of a message's author, such as
   cryptography and anonymous remailers, are convoluted and incomplete."

Author was Jonathan Gaw; no e-mail address given. Star Tribune Online
is at http://www.startribune.com.
