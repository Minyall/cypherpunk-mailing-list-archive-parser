Yes and no. Depends on the judge.  Some are hard-assed about granting 
waivers, others aren't.  Part of the problerm is that judges have too 
much discretion.  Another is in the constitution, w/regards to right 
to vote (it can be denied to felons... I know a couple of people 
convicted of DWIs that can no longer vote... they just don't care 
enough to go to a judge and get a waiver.)

Not that you would want to put faith in getting a waiver.  I'm just 
critical of Tim's assertion/speculation that gun-control is related 
to voting for the CDA.
