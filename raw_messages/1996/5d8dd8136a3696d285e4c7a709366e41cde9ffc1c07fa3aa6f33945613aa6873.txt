        It is _very_ confusing to follow though.

        Consider that Compuserve had a deal with SurfWatch, which was
incorporated in it "Internet" in a box, with a lot of Spry goodies. Now
Surfwatch has been purchased by Spyglass (a competitor or Spry). Also,
Compuserve offers RSACi services through CyberPatrols RSACi compliance (got
some weird derivitive and cross-liscencing works going on here!) and urges
its users and 3rd party people to use RSACi...
