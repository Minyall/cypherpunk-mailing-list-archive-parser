     I listened to him speak on Mr. Limbaugh's show the other day where
the round mound of sound all but blew him on the air. 

     He didn't come across as a jerk to me. More like a facist prick. 

     If he had made it to the Supreme Court, there is no doubt in my 
mind where he would fall on the crypto debate.
