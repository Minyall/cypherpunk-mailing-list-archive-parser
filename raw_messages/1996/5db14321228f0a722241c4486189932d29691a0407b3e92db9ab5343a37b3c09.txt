Anyone got a good IP spoofer that can spoof the whole domain?  The only
shit I can find is those shitty ones that spoof the first part of the
IDENTD which is possible to do in mIRC if you use it.  Oh yeah, it has to
be for Win95.  Yes I know that no one likes win95 but I dont have a
choice....I'll tell about that later.
