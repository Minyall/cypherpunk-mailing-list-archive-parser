I responded to Skippy's on-topic, more or less substantive questions about
remailers in Message-ID

This has absolutely nothing to do with crypto, but that's what I
subscribed to coderpunks for.

I grew up 15 minutes from Metzger and played soccer with one of his kids,
and he threatened some friends of mine.  I've talked to his sidekick Wyatt
Kaldenberg about other things, and defended their absolute right to free
speech on occasion. But other than that, I don't know much about Metzger.
Skippy seems to have this illusion that I'm some big bad anti-racist,
which I find amusing. 

Another WAR/CoS mal-analogy one could scrawl is that Metzger has paid
about as much of the judgement awarded to the murder victim's family as
CoS has paid to Wollersheim. But I wouldn't follow that line of reasoning
myself, since I'm no fan of the SPLC. Maybe they did a good thing in the
Seraw murder case, but their current suit agaist Pierce's neo-Nazi
National Alliance seems rather SLAPP-ish to me.  I'm sure Morty would try
to justify going after deep-pocket racists by saying that they deserve it
because the $4.5 million or so that The Order White Nationalist
Revolutionary [cough] Movement liberated from banks and convenience stores
has never been recovered, but he's wrong. Sure Bobby claimed to be doing
those robberies in the name of the Aryan Cause, but it looks like he
really spent the money on himself, just like any other "political" crook
(the Contras, the FMLN, Sendero, the Machateros, the US Congress, etc).

The SPLC probably has a web server somewhere with more details, but
there's a minimal amount of information about the case at:

 http://www.almanac.bc.ca/cgi-bin/ftp.pl?orgs/american/war

Tom Metzger's web page (sorry, it's actually John Metzger's web page,
which happens to carry all sorts of stuff from Tom -- you see, facing a 
$10 court judgement upheld by the Supreme Court, Tom has sworn an oath of
poverty to avoid giving the Zionist Occupational Government any more
blood money)  is at:
