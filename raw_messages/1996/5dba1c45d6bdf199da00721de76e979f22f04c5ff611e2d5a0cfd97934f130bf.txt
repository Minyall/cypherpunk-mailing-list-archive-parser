There's no particular mailing list, but there is a very active discussion
group at alt.religion.scientology.  There are numerous web pages, a good
place to start is http://www.cybercom.net/~rnewman/scientology/home.html.
It has pointers to many other pages.  Also, many of the critics (including
several who have been raided, sued, or threatened) show up on IRC channel
#scientology.  Be careful of what you post in alt.religion.scientology, or
the cult could start emailing threats to you too.
