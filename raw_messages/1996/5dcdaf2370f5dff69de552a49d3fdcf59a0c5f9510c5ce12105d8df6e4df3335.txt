I am nearing completion of the alpha version of my Win95 Blowfish 
implementation aka "Hootie" (I couldn't resist).  Both the 
pre-releases and final version of Hootie will be freeware.

But before I do so, I want to double check by information on the 
rights to the following algorithms.  I'm only interested in US 
patents, since I won't be able to export it anyway.

So correct me if any of the following statements are incorrect:

1. Blowfish is not patented and can be used without royalty.
2. SHA can be used without royalty.
3. MD5 can be used without royalty if the RSAREF library is used, 
and if the proper credit is given to RSA.

Also, can the MD5 algorithm be used outside the RSAREF library?  In 
other words, can I rewrite the code to take in effect MFC classes?

I'll post more information about Hootie later. It's not an 
earthshattering or groundbreaking program.  I wrote it largely as a 
learning excercise in MSVC++, but it's a functional program with a 
good user interface so I decided to release it.
