This is pretty stupid - I mean, even I know that it's all just data.  
Besides, it's irrelevent - if the FCC had jurisdiction over the net 
because it can carry digitized voice, then they could regulate what I 
scream out my back door.  Last time I looked, I didn't need a license to 
broadcast my voice out over the airwaves with my mouth...
