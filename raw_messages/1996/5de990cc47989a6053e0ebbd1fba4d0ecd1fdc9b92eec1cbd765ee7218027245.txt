Exactly!   I agree.  There is plenty of work that can be directed towards
the hardware arena, for example.  Better filters (AC, telephone, keyboard
cable), untamperable hardware (keyboards come to mind, for instance:  Design
one whose RF "signature" can't be read remotely), a push towards the use of
thin-film-type displays that don't radiate (much) in the RF spectrum,
automatic over-write of unused data areas in hard/floppy disks (including
the (unallocated) space at the ends of files), etc.
