One thing we need to remember is that life, not just school,
is full of boring, repetitive tasks, even for the hi & mity.
You have to figure out how to do them.  This is one very difficult
*lifetime* problem for those with add-like behaviors.  Also, add
people need credentials & good jobs like everyone else, so they
have to be able to perform well enuf in school to get good recs
& good marks in subjects that interest them.  They didn't make this
system, but they do have to adapt to it somewhat.
