I don't think I actually got "the breifing", if any such standard briefing 
actually exists.  What Sameer is probably thinking of is that the seven
authors of the "key length report" were invited down to DC to talk with a
bunch of high-level policy types, but they never showed us the bodies (or
the files on us, or whatever it is they show the people who they really want
to impress).
