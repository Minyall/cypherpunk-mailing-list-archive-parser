     I'll rephrase that then. It is a real bitch to swap out defective hardware
on a satellite. 

     I don't know much about sats, and I realize that most of them are built 
to specs that are insane compared to anything that runs dirtside, but (and I 
am sure that someone will correct me if I am wrong) most sats aren't expected 
to deal with the wide range of tasks that your average network server deals 
with, nor do they have anywhere NEAR the memory capacities that we are talking 
about.
