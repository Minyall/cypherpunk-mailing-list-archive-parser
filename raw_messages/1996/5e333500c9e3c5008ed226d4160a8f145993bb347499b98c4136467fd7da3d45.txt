We've prepared a list of 122 documents on electronic
surveillance selected from the late Office of Technology
Assessment's impressive online archive, 1972-96, with 
links for downloading:

The selection traces the ascendancy of information
technology over a 25-year period, paralleled by
governmental surveillance technology.
