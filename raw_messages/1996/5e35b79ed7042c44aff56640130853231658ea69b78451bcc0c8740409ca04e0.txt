Ugh.  Erle, you might want to check out the Diceware method for generating
passphrases.  It lets you generate a lengthy passphrase that is random and
that you might actually be able to remember :)

I don't have a URL handy, but if you go to Altavista and search for
"diceware" you should find it...  It might be indexed at Yahoo, too...

Actual short answer: yes :)

Look for the passphrase FAQ, for a better explanation than I can give...
