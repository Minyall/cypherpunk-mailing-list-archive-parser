	Send things like the contents of  alt.binary.pictures.something
	only use every other line of the encoded material in them.

	Intersperse that with your normal e-mail, and never have
	headers for anything.    

	And lets not forget that alt.binary.pictures.something is a
	great place to send/recieve encrypted messages that 99.99%
	of the viewers won't realize are encrypted messages.
