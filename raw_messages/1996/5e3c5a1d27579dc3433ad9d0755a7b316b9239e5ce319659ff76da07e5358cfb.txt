This seems complimentary to anonymous browsing (e.g., www.anonymizer.com).
I doubt that ciphering the site list can assure that the site can't
be found, as somebody could match incoming and outgoing requests.
A chain of "Anonymous Rewebbers" / Recloakers could help here.
An important thing here would be to make sure that the search engines can
still find the sites.  Other difficulties would be caching and getting
credits for ads.

Do you think it's worth doing?
