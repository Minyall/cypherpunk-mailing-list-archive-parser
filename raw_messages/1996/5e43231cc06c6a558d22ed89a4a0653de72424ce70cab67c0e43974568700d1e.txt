I've deleted most of Jim's meanderings above, mostly because I'm 
fascinated by the credentialism in the graf above.

He implies, without directly saying so, that "his lawyers" have weighed 
in on this dispute and agree with him. Of course this is hardly likely; 
he advances no coherent legal theory. (Except the "public forum" 
argument, which might apply to Usenet, but not cypherpunks.)

This is attempted proof by credentalism. I call him on it. 

Okay, Jim, what _do_ your lawyers say on this? Have you asked them? I,
too, have an attorney, a civil liberties specialist and a graduate from
Princeton law. So what?
