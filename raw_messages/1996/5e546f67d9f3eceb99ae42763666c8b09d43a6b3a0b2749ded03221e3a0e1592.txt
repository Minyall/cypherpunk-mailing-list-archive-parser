These are not allowed in California  (although the chance of getting
popped must be quite slim, by the number you see).

I remember seeing some water based spray paints in dun colors (such as
a nice mud tan) -  Gee, officer, its just mud, <wipe>.

(Why water colors should be in spray cans is beyond me, unless intended
for taggers).
