C'punks:

In case you've not seen the press release, it's at
http://www.viacrypt.com/lit/pgpinc.htm

This brings "back home" the license that Phil granted for the commercial
sales of PGP.  While PGP, Inc., has a web page (www.pgp.com) it, uh,
doesn't really have anything on it.  I guess they're busy doing a make on
PGPfone, or designing a new box for ViaCrypt software.  :)
