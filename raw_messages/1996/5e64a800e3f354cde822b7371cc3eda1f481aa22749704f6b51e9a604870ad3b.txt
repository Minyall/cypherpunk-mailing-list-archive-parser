I don't see why that's such a big deal, now. How much does a netcom or
c2.org account cost anyway? 

If you want to claim the right to use other people's equipment for 
personal purposes, then you're accepting that they will do the same 
thing. I don't think you want your CEO to have an endless array of 
perks, or your political representatives to abuse government resources 
for personal and political use (which is not to say that they don't, 
just that they shouldn't, and you shouldn't legitimize it).
