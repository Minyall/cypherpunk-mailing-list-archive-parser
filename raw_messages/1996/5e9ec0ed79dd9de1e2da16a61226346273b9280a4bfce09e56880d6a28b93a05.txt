The Orange County Register, a somewhat conservative daily for the
county just south of somewhat more liberal Los Angeles, provided a
short plug for crypto in today's editorial page.  Not that they're 
necessarily any better than the others, but positive publicity should 
be encouraged.

"The Clinton administration has been trying to control cryptography
completely.  It doesn't care that its export controls on cryptography
put U.S. companies at a disadvantage, unable to secure properly
exports of electronic information.  A new group has formed to fight
against this censorship:  the Internet Privacy Coalition.  Concerned
businesses and private citizens should check out its web site at: 
www.privacy.org/ipc/"

The register is at www.ocregister.com.
