	It's my understanding that this statement is now false. I
believe that Matt Blaze recently received "The Briefing" and he is
still on our side.
	(I personally think it was a mistake on their part to give him
said Briefing, as they should have realized he couldn't be
converted. Now that someone has "withstood the Briefing" it gives them
less credibility.)
