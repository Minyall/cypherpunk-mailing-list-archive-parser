Lucky:

Are you an elitist cypherpunk? It sounds like you've out grown the designation
of punk.

Punk:   1. worthless or unimportant person. 2. a petty hoodlum -adj, 3. poor
in quality.

You are hereby promoted.  You are now a cypher-corporal in the elite crypto
army.  God Speed my boy.

We'll keep a candle lite for you son if you someday choose to return to the
great un-washed masses.

Chow-baby,

Rocky J. Squirrel
