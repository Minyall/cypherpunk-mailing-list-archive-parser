I could read your answer three ways. Which is it?

1. I'm right, and you're making light of our public disagreement. Cool. As
   I keep telling you, I'm 95% behind 95% of what you're doing, and I hate
   to disagree publicly.

2. I'm right, but you don't care, because the propaganda advantage of
   leaving the idea of the FBI's snooping private email is good for the
   cause. Not cool -- you really don't strike me as a propagandist.

3. You're trying to say that I'm wrong, or you're saying, "I know you are,
   but what am I?" Inconclusive.
