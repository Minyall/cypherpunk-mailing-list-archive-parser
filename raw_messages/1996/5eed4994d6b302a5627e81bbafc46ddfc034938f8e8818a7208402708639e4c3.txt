        In fact, 3rd party services may have problems with large and dynamic
WEB sites (in which case they just might rate it high, and rate the whole
directory.) (I was thinking about this with regards to incorporating rating
systems into WEB site managements tools and apps...) If MICS and signatures
do become prevalent, an easy way I can defeat ratings I don't like (or to
keep from others rating me) is to repeatedly change my content in some
simple way, throwing off their MICS.
