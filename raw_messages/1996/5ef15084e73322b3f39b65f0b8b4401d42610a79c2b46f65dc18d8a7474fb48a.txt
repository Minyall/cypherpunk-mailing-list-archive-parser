That's an excellent idea! Store the SHA5 of the do-not-e-mail addresses
and have the scrubbing program compute SHA5 of the addresses on the
spammer's list and delete the ones that match. I guess, fold the case
and normalize the %-hacked addresses.

Not one of the spammers. Perhaps someone at an .edu site. Perhaps some
ISP, for free publicity.

I'd expect that the service would get a lot of e-mail traffic for the
first few weeks, while everyone who cares about it would get their
addresses on the list; and then it'll be just another FTP server.
