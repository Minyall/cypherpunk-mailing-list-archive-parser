Now I've gotcha!  If I, Dale Thorn, an ordinary person (not a commercial
mailer), realize somehow what your snail mail address is (an analogy),
and I send you a personal letter, are you saying I don't have the "right"
to do so?  Even if I am aware that you redistribute the letter, as, say,
a newspaper such as the L.A. Times would?

I'm guessing that what you're saying is something to do with the content
or size of such a mailing, yes?

But whatever the case, I'm not "doing something with" your mailbox if
I send you a snail mail letter, and I'm not "doing something with" your
computer if I send you a posting. It's you who know the result of opening
up your computer to the phone lines, and it's up to you to post *your*
"rules", and to date, I don't recall any postings from John Gilmore to
me or the list regarding such rules, just a few little tin-plated
dictators doing it in his name.
