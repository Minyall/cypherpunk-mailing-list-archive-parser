I had read it rather differently: "Do what we want and we'll give you 
food and maybe some other essentials."

One can argue about the government's right to do this, the source of the 
money, etc. But if private charity or industry had chosen to do this, 
we'd probably look on it rather differently.

It's still scary, though; sometimes smart cards are too smart.
