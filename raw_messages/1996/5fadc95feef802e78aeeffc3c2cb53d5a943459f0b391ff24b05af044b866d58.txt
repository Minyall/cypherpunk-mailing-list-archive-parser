hi, does anyone have that old cypherpunk enquirer that was
a brilliant satire using the Carroll Alice in Wonderland framework?

also, I wonder if anyone has a digitized image of the 
cpunk founders Hughes, TCM, Gilmore pictured in that old NYT article.
(or alternately the same from that old issue of wired)

please send either if you have them..

thanks;
