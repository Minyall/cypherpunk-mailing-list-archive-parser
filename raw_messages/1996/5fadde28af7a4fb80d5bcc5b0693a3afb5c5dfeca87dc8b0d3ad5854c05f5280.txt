This is misleading at best. Windows NT is certified C2 as a standalone
workstation only. It has not been tested or certified for networked
environments. The fact that NT lets you know when you have attempted a
login as a user does not exist, without asking for a password, would
clearly disqualify NT Server from a C2 rating in a network environment, 
at least when NetWare services are used. 

Real NetWare servers do qualify for a C2 rating.
