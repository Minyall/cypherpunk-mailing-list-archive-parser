Well, you're dealing with very different threats in the two cases AFAICS. 
With your passphrase and private key, someone can forge your signature, read
your encrypted incoming mail, etc. With your revocation certificate and 
private key, about all they can do is revoke your key and force you to
create a new one. I certainly find the latter prospect much less alarming --
by far the lesser of two evils. Heck, it's good to update keys periodically,
so they might even be doing me a favor of sorts ;)
