Multi-hop messages are probably more important than cover traffic.
If the average message does two hops, then dive your estimates by two, etc.
In a real privacy environment, almost nobody would send serious messages
by just one remailer hop.  On the other hand, for posting minor spam
and non-professionally-secure messages to mailing lists, one hop will do.

A first step at estimating this would be to check the fraction of mail
addresses to known remailers (since most remailers are more likely to
track destinations than sources.)  Most of pamphlet's bouncemail is
from other remailers, but that seems to be more of a configuration issue,
or people sending test mail to mixmasters or something.
