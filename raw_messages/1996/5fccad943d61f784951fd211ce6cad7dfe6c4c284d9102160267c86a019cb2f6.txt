     I'd have more trouble trusting the Loose Nut on the other end than the
software. 
 
     Security is more than the software, it is picking proper Pass Phrases
(which I am not too sure about), it is keeping the keys where it is less
than easy to get at, it is making sure the machine isn't compromised etc. 

     Also, I ask you once again, Could you please format your email to 
under 80 columns? You might have something valuable to say, but I can't 
stand to read any of your posts more than 2 or 3 lines because of the 
way the lines break. 

     Thank you.
