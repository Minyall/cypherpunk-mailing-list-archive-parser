  When I examine the headers from a PC running any POP client including
Netscape, (where the return path is smtp), they show up as originating
from the PC's address, whether direct net or dial-up PPP. Wouldn't that
indicate that the message is using SMTP not https over the link? (and
therefore in fact in the clear unless encrypted in body?) I think the
inclusion of the option of the Exchange client is a possible shift of the
onus of PEM to MS.  (frightening thought....)

 Where are MOSS and SMIME now?
