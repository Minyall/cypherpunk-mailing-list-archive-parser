GTE has announced, `Cybertrust` but I don't know if its operational or
not.  MCI Mall and AT&T also offer certificates.

The unfortunate fact is that at the moment, getting a certificate from
someone Netscape has decided to trust makes your customers life much
easier, because they never have to decide to trust your key.  Thus,
Verisign, MCI mall and AT&T have a large commercial advantage waiting
for Netscape to tell the world what criteria they use for selecting
KCA to trust.
