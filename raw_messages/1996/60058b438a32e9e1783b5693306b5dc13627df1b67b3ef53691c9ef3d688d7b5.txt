Excuse me?  That line is definitely .sig file fodder.

Of course it is.  What a silly question.  My feelings get hurt on
Usenet almost every day and you don't see me whining about it.

I'm so pleased to hear you have updated your laws with this new
progressive "hurt feelings" doctrine.  Obviously "PC" translates
quite well into the German language.

Much as the Third Reich took the view that anti-Nazi speech
wasn't protected.  Your country hasn't changed its authoritarian
perspective on freedom of personal expression.  All it has done
is put a different set of publicly supported items on the
official censorship list.

Didn't the Germans learn anything from World War II?
