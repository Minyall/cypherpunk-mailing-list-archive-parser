I am going out of my mind behind this one.  Please kill this topic.  
I left the Mormon church long ago, and I don't want a dose of LDS 
with my crypto-fix!

Yeah, I knew that.  I know plenty, and there are many pages for 
recovering Mormons.  Believe me, I've been there.  I could go on about 
my personal experiences of being on the "fast track" to church 
leadership, but that's the point.  I would rather not hear about it 
here.
