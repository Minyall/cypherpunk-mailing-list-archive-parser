C'punks,

I had dinner with another cypherpunk, Peter Cassidy, and he said that he
just finished something for the Sacremento Bee's "Forum" section, which
talks about the NSA's involvement in the Digital Telephony bill.

Those of you who get the Bee might want to fill us in on the details,
whenever the article. He said that the article might go to the wires, so we
might see it elsewhere...

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
