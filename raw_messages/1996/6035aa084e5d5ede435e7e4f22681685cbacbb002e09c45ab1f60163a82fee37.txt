It has been brought to my attention that I did not make this as
clear as it should be.

        I consider Mr. Bell to be a crank and a loon.

        He has no interest in any sort of honest discussion.

        He wishes to draw in others in the hope of "punishing
me".

- From now on, I am ignoring all of his posts and "killfiling"
him.

You may now go back to your scheduled and unscheduled lives.
