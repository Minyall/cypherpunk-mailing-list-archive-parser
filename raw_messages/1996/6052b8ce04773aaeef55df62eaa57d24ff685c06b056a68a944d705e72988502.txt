	Yes, there are strong arguments for the environment being the
determining factor... there are also strong arguments (such as interracial
adoption still leaving blacks below the average IQ of adopted siblings)
for it being genetics. We won't be able to find out which is which until
we know what the genetic determinants of intelligence are, which will take
some time. (Using current techniques, several hundred years at the minimum...
but I'm not prepared to predict how good techniques will get). As I previously
stated, I don't believe it is any part genetic.
