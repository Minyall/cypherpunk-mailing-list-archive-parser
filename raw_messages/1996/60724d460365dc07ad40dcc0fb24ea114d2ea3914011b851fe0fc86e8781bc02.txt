I think your analysis is absolutely correct.  Despite the fact that fiber 
bandwidth has none of the limitations  of "over the air" communications, the 
government will try to regulate it as if it were.  The underlying danger of 
the CDA, in addition to regulating CONTENT, is that the government is 
setting up precedents to regulate the communications AT ALL, which is 
dangerous to us.
