Just remember that an AC-driven bulk eraser will be far more effective than 
a permanent magnet at erasing data securely.  An oscillating magnet field 
re-magnetizes the floppy 120 times per second, as opposed to the single 
magnetization done by  the permanent magnet.  Each pass through the 
hysteresis curve brings down residual signals somewhat, maybe 10 db.  With 
the AC field, it's hard NOT to have a good erase.
