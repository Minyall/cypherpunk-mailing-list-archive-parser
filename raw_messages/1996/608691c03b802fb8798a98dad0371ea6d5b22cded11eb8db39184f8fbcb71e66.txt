Huh? Here on Planet Earth, that's the way it is everywhere, except 
"non-prime-time" or Centrex rates may be special. In most of the world, 
local analog voice calls are metered. The US is the exception.

Now, that *would* be unusual. Unless you mean a full-time dedicated port 
with a dedicated IP address, which I don't think schools need (their web 
server should be co-located at their ISP anyway). Dialup ISDN is much 
cheaper. We've got it down to about $75/month/user, all included.
