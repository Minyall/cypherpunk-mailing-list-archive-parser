My local paper (a Knight-Ridder rag) printed this story -- unquestioned --
as well.  Needless to say, I think a statement like this needs to be
responded to.  Letters to the editor, folks!  Wouldn't it be nice to have a
press that did a little more than print what the "authorities" have to say?

(This, of course, is the same paper that printed the recipe for a pipe bomb
on the front page after the explosion in Atlanta.  They included the
Elmer's glue and the all-important nails for best lethal effect -- you
might want to amend your sig again, Tim...:-)

Meanwhile, I have a question: as far as I know, no bombing has actually
been tied to the Internet in any way.  Does anybody know otherwise?  Even
though it's not really relevant to the principles of the debate here, it
seems worth pointing out.
