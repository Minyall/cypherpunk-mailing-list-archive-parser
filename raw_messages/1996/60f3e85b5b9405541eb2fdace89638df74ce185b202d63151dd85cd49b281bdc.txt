Oversimplified (this is why people *pay* lawyers...).  First, the
defintion of "publisher" for libel purposes (but NOT for 1st Am. purposes)
varies from state to state.  Variations increase when one considers non-US
jurisdictions.

Second, to take NY state as an example, a mailing list is almost certainly
NOT a "publisher" but a mere "distributor" and thus held to a MUCH lower
standard of care regarding responsibility for libel.  The "distributor",
like the book store owner, is not presumed to be on notice of the content
of the material, and must take action only if she is made specifically
aware of the libelous nature of the specific content.

Nothing new, alas.
