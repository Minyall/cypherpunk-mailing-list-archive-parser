Indeed, I added "Ross Wright" to my Eudora filter file after his "slap you
around" message several days ago, so I was mercifully spared from reading
whatever he sent to me (as he claims today). After seeing the messsages
from you, Blanc, and Sandy, who are _not_ filtered, I checked my Trash
folder before emptying it and saw Wright's posting of my private mail to
him.

His claim to "slap me around" means I'll treat him as a hostile agent.

As to why he got *plonked*, this is the price people pay for writing such
things as "maybe we need to slap him around." I have more than 20 in my
filter file now, though many of these are of people who are no longer
spewing on the CP list, for whatever reasons.

Oh, and posting private mail is not considered acceptable behavior.

Thanks, but I'm well-stocked on Golden Sabers, and even some Black Talons
(though they were overrated, from studies I've seen).
