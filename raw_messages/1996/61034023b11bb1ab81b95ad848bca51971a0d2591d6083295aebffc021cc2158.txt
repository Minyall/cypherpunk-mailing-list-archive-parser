It looks like Jim Bell is arranging a contract on Mr. Wallace (apparently
the operator of "abusebot@savetrees.com," and other obnoxious spambots
assocated with Cyberpromo).

Careful, Jim, you are coming _very_ close to crossing the line. You appear
to be volunteering to have Mr. Wallace (and perhaps his family?) killed.

Arguing theoretical implications of what you call "AP" is substantially
different from saying "You rang?" when your frequent posts about AP being
the solution make it clear you are referring to AP here.

I'm not a lawyer, but this is getting real close to the line. I doubt many
DAs would take it seriously, but I rather expect Mr. Wallace of
savetrees.com might discover this message and draw the reasonable inference
that his life is being threatened.
