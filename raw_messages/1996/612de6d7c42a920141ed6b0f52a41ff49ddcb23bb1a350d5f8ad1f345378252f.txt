Declan (the other one), you have misspelled "unsuscribe" and you have sent
your request to the wrong place.

To let others know that you have been told what to do, for the usual
game-theoretic reasons, I'm leaving the CP list copied on this reply.


How to subscribe to the Cypherpunks mailing list: send a message to
"majordomo@toad.com" with the body message "subscribe cypherpunks". To
unsubscribe, send the message "unsubscribe cypherpunks" to the same
address. For help, send "help cypherpunks".  Don't send these requests to
the Cypherpunks list itself. And be aware that the list generates between
40 and 100 messages a day.
