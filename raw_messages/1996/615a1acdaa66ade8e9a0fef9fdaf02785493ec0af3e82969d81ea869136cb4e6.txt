	Is RSA now saying that the original Diffie-Hellman patent
(#4,200,770) is not valid?  I'm curious, because in the past, as I
understand things, RSA has said that the DH patent covers El Gamal.
If RSA no longer considers DH to be a valid patent, that would mean El
Gamal is not patent encumbered.
