I've got the markov3 binary and source at:

ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/qu/qut/bin/markov3
ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/qu/qut/src/markov3.6/

I downloaded it from a url that was posted here recently.

But I can't find instructions on how to run it.
Can that URL be posted again or instructions on
how to use markov3?
