"Howdy.  Since I just met you in this bar and really like you I wanted to
tell you about this Russian sailor I met.  His ship is in port for only a
few more hours and he has all these Russian gold coins that he wants to
sell.  Now you know he can't sell the coins in those commie countries so
he's so desperate for cash that he'll sell them for just $100 an ounce.
I've got $5,000 right here in this envelope why don't you take $5,000 out of
your bank and we'll meet him and make some fast dough."

I think that sailor has a great new secret algorithm as well.
