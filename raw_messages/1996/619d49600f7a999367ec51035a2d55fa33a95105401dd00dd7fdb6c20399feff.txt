I wonder if MS would stand for competition on signing crypto modules.
They say (I think?) currently that they will not charge for the
service?  (Do I have this right?)

If they start charging for the service, they won't want competition.

What about patches of windows, are there non-reverse engineering terms
in the license?

Lots of windows apps do modifications of windows, 3rd party memory
managers, uninstall applications.  Or are these all working within
published microsoft APIs?

What exactly is microsoft certifying when they sign a CAPI module?

That it is quality crypto?  Has no obvious bugs?  That it won't crash
your system?

(I'm sure people have already exported signatures about the quality of
crypto: PGP signed list traffic by (US) people that looked at PGP
source, and found no flaws, etc).
