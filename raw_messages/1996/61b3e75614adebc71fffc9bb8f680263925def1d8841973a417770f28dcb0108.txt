There is something called a Rosetta Stone, i.e. a key to unlock the
mysteries.  In Chomsky's milieu, it's the JFK assassination.

In Chomsky's words, "I can see no forces who would have wanted Kennedy
dead" (quote approximate).

Chomsky is funded by the military (I forget which branch, Navy perhaps).
Since Kennedy, in the best opinion, was executed by the military, it
kinda makes sense....
