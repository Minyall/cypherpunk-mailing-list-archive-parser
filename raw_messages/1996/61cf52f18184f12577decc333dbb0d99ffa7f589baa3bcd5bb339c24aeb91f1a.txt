	I think you're talking about Lynx. If you are, they'd need a shell
account to access it. Most ISP's like AOL, CompuServe, Prodigy, and others
don't offer that. They'd also have to set it up through a communications
program in DOS. Anyways, if you're NOT talking about Lynx, what DOS-based
Web browser is there?
