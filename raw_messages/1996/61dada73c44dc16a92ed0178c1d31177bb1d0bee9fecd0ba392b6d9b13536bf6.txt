Is this not slightly better translated as "who watches the watchers?"?
This is the way I have heard it stated, and it is _WAY_ too long since
I have studied Latin.  One of my great dissapointments is that,
despite having spent my entire school career (less university: I'm
only 20) in private schools, I couldn't take latin or greek except one
year of latin, after which the course was dropped.  Sigh.
