That's what happened, or didn't you notice that ITAR is based on laws
passed by an elected Congress? Didn't you notice that thus far when people
with one position on the matter have tried to persuade Congress to modify
ITAR, they have failed? This is a (as far as it goes) a democracy, not a
'Llewyellyn and those who agree with him' dictatorship.
