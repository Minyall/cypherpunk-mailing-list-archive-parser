I find that MSNBC is now working OK without cookies. I tried off and on
during the day today (Friday) and last night and it didn't work, but it
is working OK now.  I can get in with lynx or with my cookie-blocked
Netscape.  I sent them a nasty letter this afternoon complaining about it
so either that may have helped or it is obsolete.  Maybe it was just a
glitch?

I think that's probably what it was  --  they also had some initial problems with the cable broadcast.
