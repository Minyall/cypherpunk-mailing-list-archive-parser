Fortunately one does not have to be prosecuted to test the
constitutionality of the ITAR as they apply to cryptography: the
Bernstein and Karn cases have already been brought and at least one
other is in the pipeline.  But no one seems to be setting up a Legal
Attack Fund to support such litigation.  Perhaps some of those active on
the cypherpunks list would be interested in creating and supporting such
a fund.  One would hope that those corporate interests who keep
complaining about how the ITAR cut into their potential profits would be
willing to contribute.
