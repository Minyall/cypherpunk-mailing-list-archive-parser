So how would the courts prosecute if me and (n) number of other persons
distribute separate pieces of a "binary", i.e., encrypted or otherwise?

There has been some prior discussion here of splitting files in creative
ways then sending the pieces through multiple channels (and at different
times?)....

Would the courts then insist that every data transmission I ever make
would have to be proved to be meaningful (viewable) text, or in the case
of a binary, have a court-approved checksum?

Is there a presumption that only NSA will be able to forge the
checksums, to get around this problem (for themselves)?
