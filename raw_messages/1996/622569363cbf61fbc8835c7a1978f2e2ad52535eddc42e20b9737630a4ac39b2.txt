Is Rabin encryption patented?  I have never heard of any patent covering Rabin
encryption, but I have also heard that Diffie-Hellman will be the first PK
algorithm that is patent-free when the patent expires in '97.  I know that
until recently, ElGamal was considered to be covered under the DH patent.  I
wonder if the same is also true for Rabin.
