Uh huh.

Actually, from my infrequent and cursory reading of a.r.s, it is
my impression that the antis are discussing their own views of
Scientology, not trying to prevent anyone else from discussing
theirs.  I would think all opinions related to Scientology would
be on-topic for a.r.s., both positive and negative.

Well, perhaps.  It certainly isn't very nice to post copyrighted
works via anon remailers.  At least not more than constitutes
"fair use" for the purpose of critical review (or hilarious
laughter, as the case may be).

Nothing wrong here.  Flames are the thread from which the fabric
of Usenet is woven.

It should be noted that said Scientologist posts consist of
thousands of distinct little snippets from the Scientologist
Handbook and other similar tracts, posted as separate articles
from multiple accounts simultaneously.  This is clearly an
attempt to flood everything else off servers while staying clear
of the current definitions of Spam and Velveeta.

While Usenet tends to frown on content-based cancels, I find it
difficult to understand why the cancellation of thousands of
gratuitous posts duplicated amongst a large number of accounts
should be considered "content-based." Does participation in
a.r.s. ever legitimately require this level of posting?  It
shouldn't be too difficult to find non-content-based criteria for
cancelling this crap.
