Alan apparrently forwarded my message from technomads to cypherpunks,
but since I'm on cypherpunks too, I got this message.  Anyway, yes it
does have a simple replay attack prevention mechanism.  It keeps track
of the most recent time and date stamp from the PGP signature info and
refuses to executed any message that doesn't have a stamp more recent
than previously executed script.  This simple mechanism can cause
unwanted rejection if scripts are received out of order, but multiple
scripts can be batched into a single message to help overcome this.
