Thank you.

This excellent new feature is more important than you know.

The FTC is threatening to regulate the net, and is using as
its excuse the claim that advertisers will or are threatening
to send junk email to be people who browse their web pages.  

To protect the internet from this terrible threat they wish
to regulate every computer that puts up a web page in a
similar fashion to their regulation of TV and radio.

This simple technical fix deprives the FTC of that excuse.  
It will have to concoct a new excuse.  Unless someone 
deliberately configures their netscape browser to provide
the information, no one can send them junk mail.
