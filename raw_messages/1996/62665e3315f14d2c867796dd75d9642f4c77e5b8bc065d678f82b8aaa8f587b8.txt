When printing was introduced in the west, the big print crackdown 
was successful, but there was great resistance, and the crackdown 
on the printed word required great and continuing violence over 
a long period, and was never entirely effective.

A net crackdown will be substantially less effective than the print 
crackdown was, and the level of violence is likely to be greater.

There is of course a tradeoff:  An highly ineffectual net crackdown 
will not provoke large scale resistance.  They can probably force
the stuff on alt.pictures.erotica.children to be published in a 
more discreet manner.
