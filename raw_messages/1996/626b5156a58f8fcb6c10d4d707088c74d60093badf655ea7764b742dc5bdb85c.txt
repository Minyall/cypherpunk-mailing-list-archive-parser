"US Court: Communities Can Judge Cyber-Porn"
[Combined News Services]

  Memphis, Tenn. - In a court ruling that could have a wide impact on 
  cyberspace, a federal appeals court has decided that every community 
  can judge for itself the obscenity of material downloaded from 
  computer bulletin boards - no matter where those boards are based.

  That opinion, unless overturned by the US Supreme Courtm coult mean 
  that bulletin board material that might have been at the far edge 
  of  acceptable in New York or California could be judged by perhaps
  more conservative standards if downloaded in Tennessee or Iowa.
