Quite surprising. This proves (to me) that cypherpunks is nothing more
than lipservice, covertly contributing to the death of the human
spirit which most people seem to want. 

"Unless we as a group mend our ways", indeed. By whose standard of
"mending"? If they construct the proper standard can they not
control you by that choice? Is your goal in life to be controlled
by the press and the government?

The very existance of the "profane" keeps the "sacred" in existance
as well. If you cannot see that, then John Grubor's lesson is wasted
on you.
