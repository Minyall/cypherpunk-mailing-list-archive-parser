A bunch of us heard about this a while back, and I was in on an
exchange between several people including Phil Karn and Dorothy
Denning. The gist of it is that Denning et al believe they have
something -- and they are smart people -- but all the smart people who
understand both GPS and crypto think its total bunk and not at all
hard to fake being anywhere at all. I would say that I go with the
latter.
