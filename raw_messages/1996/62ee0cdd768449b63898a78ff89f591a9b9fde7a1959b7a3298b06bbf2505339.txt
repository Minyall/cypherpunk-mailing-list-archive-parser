Your impression was wrong.

Let us just run through the sequence of events.

A bunch of leftover commies publish some boring commie crap in Germany,
which probably most people would have ignored.

Thugs with truncheons shut them up, making large numbers of "preventative"
arrests.  (A "preventative" arrest is when you have done nothing illegal,
let alone wrong, but they arrest you anyway.)

Result: big publicity on the internet, dead silence in the 
"free" german press.

Germany tries to shut up the internet.

Result:  Even bigger publicity.

Sounds like a defeat for Germany to me.
