Perry, 

I will not waste anymore of your time, or mine -
Since you seem to know everything about everything, 
there is no need in talking in circles - You may think that you know 
everything there is to know about encryption, but believe me, there is 
a lot more for you to learn - I do not now what KDC's are, I presume 
some sort o Key Delivery Codes. or Systems, but? I would like to find out 
though - send us some literature and we will send you a free demo system- that 
is the differece between you and us - we know very little and want to 
know more you know everythinh there is to know - and do not need to 
know anymore - 

Incidentally crypto wheel systems are stillemployed in 1996 at some of 
the highest levels of usage - some called then rotors at one time - they 
are still used because the produce non repeatable sequeces - the fact 
that ROMs are userd insteaed of rotors does not change the basic nature 
of such systems, they depend upon the generation of random, nonrepeatable 
sequences, which they can do, much faster and much more securely ythan 
RSA systems, I like RSA systems, they have application - but they are not 
the begin all and end all of encryption technology - good luck
