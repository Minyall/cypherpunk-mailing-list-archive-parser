Of course, if someone patches the program to incorrectly encrypt the 28 
bits for the government, it will be transparent until some nasty TLA
tries decrypting the key.  

This was the same problem that existed with the Clipper LEAF, if I
recall correctly, in that systems with hacked LEAF fields interoperated 
perfectly with unmodified ones.
