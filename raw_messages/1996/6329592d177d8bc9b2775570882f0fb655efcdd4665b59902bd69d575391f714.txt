Ridicule is what John Gilmore and EFF deserve, and more.

I suspect John Gilmore is opposed to the spread of cryptography and privacy
technology. He _opposed my efforts to template NPOs for running the anonymous
remailers, because he believes in "identity escrow" - the ability of the
remailer operators to track down and silence whoever "abuses" their network to
say things "homophobic" and otherwise politically incorrect. John Gilmore and
his pack of 'punks would rather see no crypto deployed than widely available
weak crypto with hooks that permit easy replacement by stronger crypto.
Is John Gilmore an NSA plant, an "agent provocateur"?
