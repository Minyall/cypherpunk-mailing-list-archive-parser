John has the right to practice censorship on his mailing list, and he's just
exercised his right. He also has the right to burn all the books he owns.

Someone mentioned the speech codes at private universities as examples of 
censorship. Again, they have the right to do that, and they may or may not
jeopardise their credibility. As Alan Derschowitz pointed out, when Harvard
claims to be a bastiod of academic freedom while at the same time outlawing
"politically correct" speech, it's neither a criminal act nor a tort, they
simply lose their credibility. Likewise Brigham Young University claims to
follow the teachings of ASmith & Young, not John Stuart Mills. They would
damage their credibility if they did _not restrict certain kinds of speech
and activities, such as gay-and-lesbian organizations paid for with student
activity fees.

BYU's words and actions are consistent, while John Gilmore's are not.
