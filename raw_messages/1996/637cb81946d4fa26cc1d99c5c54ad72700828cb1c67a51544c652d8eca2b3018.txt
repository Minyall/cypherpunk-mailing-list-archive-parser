"Created by Richard Garfield??!!  Not bloody likely!

Netrunner is Wizards of the Coast's licensed adaptation of an existing
paper-and-dice roleplaying game, Cyberpunk(TM), created by Mike Pondsmith
and published by R. Talsorian Games.  The game was inspired by the
cyberpunk literary movement in general and the writing of Walter Jon
Williams (author of HARDWIRED) in particular.  (RTG's Cyberpunk(TM) game
should not be confused with Steve Jackson Games' GURPS Cyberpunk module
for Jackson's GURPS role-playing system, which was published later.)
