Toad.com filled itself up with email due to the spam attack in the
last few days.  While I was on holiday, Hugh took down the list to
stop the mail loop and restore some sanity.  It worked.  He left it in
a slightly broken state which I'm working to clean up.

If you sent something useful to the list during that time and received
a bounce message, see if your posting comes through by Monday morning.
I'll be excavating and forwarding the posts that I can find.  If I
miss yours, please re-send it (once)!
