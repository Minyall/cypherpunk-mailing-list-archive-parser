Do you have any information to back this up?  It sounds like an urban myth.
Also, AFAIK the ATF isn't the agency that controls arms exports.

Maybe.  But I doubt that the above story is true.

And how exactly is this done?  Unless data is tagged with a header, encrypted
traffic is indistinguishable from random data.

Same as above.

Several years ago, the cost of building a DES cracking machine was $100 million
dollars.  this value is now much smaller.

The Feds dropped the Zimmerman case because there wasn't any evidence to
support the accusation that PRZ had exported PGP or broken any laws.  Also,
if someone was ever tried for ITAR violations, it would most likely be found
unconstitutional.

This is why there is steganography.
