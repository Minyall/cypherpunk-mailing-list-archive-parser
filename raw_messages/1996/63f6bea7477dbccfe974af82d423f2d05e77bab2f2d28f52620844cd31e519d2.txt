Ok... I want everybody to go buy a box of diskettes, and put copies of PGP
on them.  Then we'll save our boxes of PGP for when everything but GAK is
illegal, and the thought police are stealing hard drives.  BTW, I really
like that thermite on the HD thing. A possibly better idea could be
something that eats the platters.... little container of nitric acid.
Anyway.. that's off topic. 

If I'm understanding correctly, In the year 2000 (whatever) when we use
crypt(3) it's just a call to the NSAcryptoGAK chip on the board. and
that's supposed to be good enough for everyone.  What's next? A processor
that detects an unGAK'd software crypto program running and phones the NSA
or whoever?

One more thing... what's this about MD5 being broken... references,
webpages, whatever would be nice.
