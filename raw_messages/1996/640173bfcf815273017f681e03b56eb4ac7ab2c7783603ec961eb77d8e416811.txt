If the number of tokens given to each subscriber per day is limited (5 to 7
is probably reasonable), then this will limit the amount of abusive anonymous
messages posted.  This scheme might not prevent people from anonymously
posting abusive messages, but it will prevent spam.

Limiting the number of abusive anonymous messages one can post is an
interesting idea, but this only allows pseudonymity and not anonymity.  The
pseudonymity-anonymity issue seems to be a trade-off between more privacy and
less noise.
