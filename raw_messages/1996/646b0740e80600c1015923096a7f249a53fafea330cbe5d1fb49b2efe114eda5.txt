Looks like the Nazis forged newgroup messages for rec.fag-bashing,
rec.org.kkk, and 100 RFD'd groups in order to get their little messages
across.

How entertaining. What a marvelous new form of net.vandalism they've
discovered. Or is this not new?

The clearly forged Date: header and the cover newsgroups are pretty
transparent, if you ask me.
