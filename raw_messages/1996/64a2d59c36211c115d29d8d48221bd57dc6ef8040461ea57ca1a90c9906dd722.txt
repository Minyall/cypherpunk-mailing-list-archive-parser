You doubt but are you sure?  Potential investors are unsure as well.  The
executive order has a "chilling effect" on such investments, and could
affect their actual stock value.

The idea strikes me as an attempt to slow strong crypto development so
U.S.-sponsored escrow alternatives can be put into wide deployment.

It may also be a "trial-balloon" to see if the USG can get away with deny
individuals and corporations the right to invest in "non-approved"
technologies.  The current administration is hell-bent on imposing any
limitations it can.

All this makes me wonder why there is any doubt that this country has
devolved into a near police-state.  Compromise away your rights and you get
what you deserve.
