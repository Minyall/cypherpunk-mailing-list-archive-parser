I recently enrolled my kid in school. On a form they asked what her SSn was. I just 
left the form blank. Later when they asked me about it, I asked if it was =required=, 
prepared to have them provide me with stautory citations. They said it was not 
required, but that they needed a way to keep records. I suggested they use her name. 
Since that wouldn't work with their computer, I suggested they make one up that fit 
the program.
