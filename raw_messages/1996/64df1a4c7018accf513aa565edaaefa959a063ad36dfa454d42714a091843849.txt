A indian reservation sure beats moving to the Turks and Caicos. 
Well maybe not the weather part, but anyway in recent times I 
believe that several local governments have challenged the indian 
gaming enterprises. I recall a report on NPR about a challenge in 
Deleware or New Hampshire by a group of townspeople that was on the 
edge of a reservation. The indians won the case and were allowed to 
continue. Because of the new wealth generated by the bingo parlors 
and poker tables, the various tribes have gotten lobbying power in 
Congress.
 So I think that indian reservation sovernignty has grown in recent 
years, and would be very intresting course to pursue.
