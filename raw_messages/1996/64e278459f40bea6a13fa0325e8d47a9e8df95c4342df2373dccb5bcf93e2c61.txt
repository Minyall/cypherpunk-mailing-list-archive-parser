Actually, yes. 

Canada has a single payer system and we spend about two thirds as much as the
U.S. on health care as a percentage of G.N.P. We manage to insure all Canadians
while about 35% of people in the U.S. have *no* health insurance.

Yes, the insurance premium is not optional. Yes, it *is* cheaper.
