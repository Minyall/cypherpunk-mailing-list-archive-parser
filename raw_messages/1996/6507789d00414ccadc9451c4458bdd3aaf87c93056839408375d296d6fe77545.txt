	I think WebStar/SSL does SSL, but I don't know if it does
client auth. I doubt it though. Netscape Navigator 3.0b4 does client
auth, if you need a client that runs on a mac.

	Yeah, my package (and XCert Sentry) has stuff to let your
build your own CA, for your own company, or whatever.

	Xcert Sentry is a seperate product, sold by a seperate
company. http://www.xcert.com/

	Not yet. http;//www.us.apache-ssl.com/ for now.
