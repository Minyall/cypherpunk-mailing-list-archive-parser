What about pirate attacks, acts of war from hostile countries etc.?
Actually, also being a sovereign state won't help much if you are small,
and I'm not referring to obvious dope-smuggling fronts like Noriega's

plans of opening a casino after Italy sealed its border (the only border
San Marino has).
