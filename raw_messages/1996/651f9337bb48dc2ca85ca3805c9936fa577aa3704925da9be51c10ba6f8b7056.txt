"No dogs and foreigners allowed"?

If the ITAR/Bernstein/Junger set of cases gets interpreted in a certain way
(exposure of non-U.S. persons to "U.S. strategic information" is a felony),
then Barnes and Noble and Supercrown may have to post signs forbidding
foreigners from entering certain areas, or the entire store, or checking
official papers before the computer science section may be entered.

("Pappieren, bitte?")

As Cindy Cohn pointed out at the Bernstein hearing, the Junger case may
raise some substantial "Title 14" (I think it is) issues. If a university
or bookstore  excludes foreign-looking persons, other laws say this is
discrimination. And yet the ITARs may make it a crime to let a damned
furriner into a public library that has a copy of--gasp--"Applied
Cryptography."

Realistically, no one has been prosecuted for such a thing. But the ITARs
are worded in such a way that prosecution _could_ happen. Hence the
Bernstein and Junger cases.
