Se7en,

I am curious. Did you write this, or is this a forwarded article?

If you wrote this, it is very typical of journalistic treatments, and is
well-written. You have a career in journalism ahead of you (or perhaps you
currently are a journalist, under another name, in which case you should
still indicate what your actual journalistic name is, as I doubt you write
under the name "se7en."

If you did not write this, then you need to start including indications
about who did write it, and where it appeared, and that it's a forwarded
article.
