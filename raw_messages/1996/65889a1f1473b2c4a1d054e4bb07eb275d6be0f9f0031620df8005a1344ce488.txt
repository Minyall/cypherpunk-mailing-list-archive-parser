  I don't like the fact that your proposal ties the size of the
bulk encryption key to the size of the public modulus.  There
are legitimate reasons why someone might choose to have a 512
bit modulus even though they prefer longer bulk encryption keys.
Your heuristic would be a good fallback in the absence of more
reliable information.  

  There is another method that does not require verisign or other
CAs to add key size extensions to their certs.  We can define
a new authenticated attribute that gets included in Signed-Data
and Signed-And-Enveloped-Data messages that indicates the
user's key size and algorithm preference.  This has the advantage
that the preference is selected and signed by the user.  This
method was discussed at the S/MIME meeting in January at the
RSA Crypto conference.  I'm a bit surprised that it never
got into the Implementation Guide.  I'll make sure that
we bring it up on the smime list again.

  What we finally implement will probably be a combination of
the three methods, with the user's selection taking precedence
over the CAs selection, which takes precedence over the
heuristic based on modulus size.
