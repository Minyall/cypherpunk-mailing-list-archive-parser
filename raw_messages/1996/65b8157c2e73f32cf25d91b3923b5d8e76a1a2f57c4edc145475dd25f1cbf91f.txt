With the current releases of the NT 4.0 betas, I would assume some of
you have had the chance to look at the API more closely.  I am getting
ready to hack my first crypto enabled app and wondered if this was
worth using or if Crypto C++ is the way to go. 

I would think that if their implementation is solid, and some of the
*real* crypto gods write stronger CSP's than the M$ RSA Base CSP, this
would be a good approach to get more enabled apps accepted for regular
usage.

Any thoughts?
