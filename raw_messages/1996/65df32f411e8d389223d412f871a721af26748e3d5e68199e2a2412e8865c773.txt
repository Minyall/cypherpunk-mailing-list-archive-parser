Thanks to John Young, who scanned the snailmail document sent out by NIS&T,
I have made the available on my NIST meeting web the document that NIS&T says
is:
"The enclosed document is an unofficial summary of the December 5, 1995
meeting held at the National Institute of Standards and Technology to
discuss the 64-bit software key escrow encryption exportability initiative."

Nothing really new here, the author recorded essentially what I wrote up
and posted back in December. But this author has a different viewpoint.
