Sounds like a case of "political testicles in a vise." This smells like
an election-year maneuver so the Clinton administration can maintain its
fa¬çade. (After all, who wants to be called "soft on the protection of
children"?) By the time it's finally settled, the Congresscritters will
have been re-elected and can go merrily back to perverting the
Constitution.

So how'd we wind up having to choose between *these* two yahoos for 
President? :-)
