Has the asshole censor John Gilmore (spit) "unsuscripted" Dale yet?

Does John Gilmore (spit) masturbate every time he "unsubsides" someone
from his private mailing list for posting content he doesn't like?

Does John Gilmore (spit) keep a bowl of condoms next to toad.com, or does
he practice Unsafe Sex with himself?

Inquiring minds want to know.
