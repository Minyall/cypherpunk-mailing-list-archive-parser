This isn't Libernet-d or something similar. This isn't where we
discuss violations of search and seizure laws or thing of that
kind. The world is full of injustice -- but this isn't the place to
discuss it. Mitnick's case has very little (certainly at this point)
to do with security, and never had anything to do with cryptography.

When there are one or two small items posted on a topic thats no big
deal. When its a lot of stuff, it becomes an enormous pain. Multiply
the few seconds to read and digest enough of a message to know you
should delete it by dozens of messages per mailing list per day and by
a dozen mailing lists and you suddenly have an untenable waste of your
time.
