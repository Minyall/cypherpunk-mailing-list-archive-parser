Only if the agents involved are attached to the FBI and report directly to
the FBI during the investigation.  Note that they were permitted about
this same amount of autonomy under 50 U.S.C. 102(d)(3).

The above paragraph is a bit light on facts.

Actually, today to do domestic black ops you just let E-Systems handle it.
No need to use agency personal when 7/8 of E-System's employees are former
agency.  The CIA doesn't bother to do local black ops anymore.  Look to
other organizations.
