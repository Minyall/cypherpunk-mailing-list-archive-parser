With the right to speak freely comes the right to decline to speak. John, 
as the owner of the computer maintaining the cypherpunks list, has the 
right to decline to speak and to kick off a user who violates the 
covenant of the mailing list.

The kicked-off user has the right to start his own mailing list with
different standards. If he likes, he can establish the rules as a type of
contract to which participants must agree. And observers can criticize
either or both of them. 

Is this censorship, double standards, and hypocrisy? I think not.

I say this as someone who has no animus towards Vulis. I've communicated
with him cordially in private email.
