Don't forget there are security vulnerabilities in X.509v3.  Ross
Anderson's 'Robustness Principles' paper discusses the weakness of
sign after encrypting.  In the Crypto '95 proceedings, or on his web
site.

| Fact is, identity certification (which is what X.509 gives) is neither
| necessary nor sufficient for providing secure services -- and there's
| nothing magic about X.509.
