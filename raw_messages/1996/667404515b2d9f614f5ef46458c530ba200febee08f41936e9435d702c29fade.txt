It may just be me but ...

i)	This in-fighting and bickering doesn't seem very productive

ii)	What are we gonna do about the CDA?
	The bikers fought the helmet law and won (in places)
	We should do the same.

	"It is better to have tried and failed than never have tried at all"

	Our strength is in our numbers and our abilities we should use them
	to ensure our freedom.  Science fiction has become our reality and 	their 
paranoia.  

	All we have to lose is our freedom.
