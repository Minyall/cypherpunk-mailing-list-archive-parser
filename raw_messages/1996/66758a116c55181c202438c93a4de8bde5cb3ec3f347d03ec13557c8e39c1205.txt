The quip about peeking under the hood may apply OK to an automobile, but to a program
which encrypts?  Granted that most messages (99+ % ??), if read by NSA et al, won't
put the sender in any great danger, but when the application is really serious, as it
always is sooner or later, you must realize that people could be taking great risks
with PGP encryption, and "pretty sure" isn't good enough when it's really, really
vital to have bulletproof security.
