Something like that.

No doubt, someone is subscribed to the cypherpunks list with an
anonymous account on anon.penet.fi - of the an???? variant.  When you
posted to the cypherpunks list, your posting was sent to this
account.

Now, an???? accounts are supposed to be anonymized both ways, which
means that when anon.penet.fi recieved your message, it anonymized it
and assigned you an anon id.

The nasty consequence is that the receiver can easily find the
correspondence between your real and anon id, even if it wasn't
generated just now.

I thought there was some kind of mechanism on anon.penet.fi to prevent
this, but it seems not.
