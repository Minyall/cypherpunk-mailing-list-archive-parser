Why not just use a sound sample? "Please blow into the microphone"...
You've got the randomness of the sound itself, along with the minute
errors produced by the analog/digital converter. Should be able to get
plenty of entropy. Maybe even just use background noise.

Even if you don't have a sound card, you could probably fix something up 
that plugs into a port.

Seems like a good idea, but I'm no expert on entropy.
