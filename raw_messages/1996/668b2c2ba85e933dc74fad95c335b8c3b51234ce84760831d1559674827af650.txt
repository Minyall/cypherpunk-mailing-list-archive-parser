Sounds like my office.  Of course, I usually force myself to get
things done on time, and to be polite to the clients, but the
hand grenade description is perfectly accurate.

This is really a telling statement, isn't it?  After all, we
rarely hear people saying their greatest wish is to find out that
they have liver disease, or cancer, or heart trouble.

The problem here is that we live in a society that won't cut any
slack for normal human diversity unless you have some sort of
official disease defined by the medical profession.  So there is
constant pressure to "medicalize" all sorts of odd things, so
that the people who exhibit certain characteristics don't get
lumped in with the rest of the supposedly unproductive
malcontents.

When you get to the point where, all other things being equal, a
diagnosis makes your life bearable again, it is time to make some
serious changes in your environment.

"Albert, you're doing very well on your Ritalin.  Your attendance
has been perfect since you started taking it, and you've finished
every task we've given you on time.  I think you're ready to be
promoted to SENIOR clerk-typist, with a $1 an hour raise in pay.

"Keep taking the medication your doctor prescribes, and you won't
have any more problems dreaming all day about non positive
definite 4-manifolds and null geodesics."

Right. :)
