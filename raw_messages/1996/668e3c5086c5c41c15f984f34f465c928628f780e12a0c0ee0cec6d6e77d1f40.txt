Regarding the 'paradoxical' effect of speed on children:

It seems that age might not be the deciding factor. Scanning abstracts
of Medline articles on the subjects of methylfenidate AND <variants of
ADHD>, 469 hits in English, I found the one below. Perhaps the Swedish
speed epidemia in the 60-70's, now having sort of a comeback, was/is
partly self-medication. Note that this is about ADULTS and that the
research was made in 'The Peoples Republic of Massachusetts' (as someone
just called it). That these guys calm down on a drug that makes most
people the other way around suggests a structural difference; that some
of us are suffering from 'Ritalin deficiency'.

A double-blind, crossover comparison of methylphenidate and placebo in
adults with childhood-onset attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.

Abstract

BACKGROUND: There are few controlled studies of methylphenidate
hydrochloride in adults with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD), and their results have been equivocal. The discrepancies among
these studies may be related to low doses, diagnostic uncertainties,
and lack of attention to comorbid disorders.
METHODS: We conducted a randomized, 7-week, placebo-controlled,
crossover study of methylphenidate in 23 adult patients with DSM-III-R
ADHD using standardized instruments for diagnosis, separate assessments
of ADHD and depressive and anxiety symptoms, and a robust daily dose of
methylphenidate hydrochloride, 1.0 mg/kg per day.
RESULTS: We found a marked therapeutic response for methylphenidate
treatment of ADHD symptoms that exceeded the placebo response (78% vs
4% P < .0001). Response to methylphenidate was independent of gender,
psychiatric comorbidity with anxiety or moderate depression, or family
history of psychiatric disorders.
CONCLUSION: Robust doses of methylphenidate are effective in the
treatment of adult ADHD.
