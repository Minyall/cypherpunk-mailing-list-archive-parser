Hello Everyone,

	WOW! It was apparently an exciting weekend while I was gone. I'm
sorry the shinobi remailer announced it's retirement but the exciting
thing seems to be this mysterious "middle-man" remailer. If it works as
the maintainer says, we can have a whole new avenue for setting up
undetectable remailers. Anyway, I've updated the type2.list/pubring.mix
combination on jpunix.com to reflect the retirement of shinobi and the
creation of the middle-man remailer. The lists are available by anon FTP
as well as http://www.jpunix.com.
