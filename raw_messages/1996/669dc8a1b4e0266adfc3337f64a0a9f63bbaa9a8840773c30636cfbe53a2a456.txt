Actually Tim, the Aum Supreme truth cult was using a Russian
formula for it's production of sarin, and was spending vast amounts
of time and money trying to obtain Russian NBC expertise. They
supposedly had an estimated 30,000 followers in the former Soviet
union.

I recently finished an excellent book "The cult at the end of the
world" about all this and highly recommend it to my fellow
cypherpunks.
