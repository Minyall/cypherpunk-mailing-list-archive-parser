Thanks for the reference.  However, I was very unimpressed with their price 
of $295 dollars.  I don't doubt that there are certain organizations 
(banks?) which would have no problem affording them, but that's well out of 
the range of ordinary consumer items.    I just bought a 10x CDROM drive for 
$100; somehow I think that a hardware RNG should cost less than that.  
Volume is a big issue, I suppose.
