I was actually thinking of linking to a page that is basically a CGI
version of the "travesty" Perl script. I'll have it take some
crypto-related words from a local online file, then when the user hits
a button, it'll create a one paragraph marketing-sounding blurb about
crypto.

The test, of course, is to see if the marketing material of a given
product sounds too much like pseudorandom gibberish :-)
