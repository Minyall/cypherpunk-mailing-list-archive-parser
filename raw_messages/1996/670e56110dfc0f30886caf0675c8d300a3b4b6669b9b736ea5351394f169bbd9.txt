I originally read that ISP's were exempt from a Wired article in the February
'96 issue.  I did some searching on EFF's web site and found the text of the
1994 draft of DT.  The bill says that information services and private networks
are exempt from the requirements of subsection (a).  I have no idea what
subsection a is, but a seperate analysis by the EFF does say that the bill
does not apply to Internet Service Providers.  Maybe there is some section
of the bill that does cover ISP's, but I don't think it is anything relating
to facilitating wiretapping.

I found this information at
