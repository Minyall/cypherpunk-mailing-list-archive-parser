I guess that wu-ftp never was distributed with security holes.  Never 
heard of anyone distributing maliscious lookalike packages.  How many 
folks do you think downloaded the linux-JDK and use it without checking 
it out first.  That takes care of the compiler.  And distributing bad 
netscape or other browsers is childs play.  So I guess your newborn is 
relevant.

Stick to your belief that Java is secure because, darn it, it just would 
be hard for anyone to do bad things with it.  Please.
