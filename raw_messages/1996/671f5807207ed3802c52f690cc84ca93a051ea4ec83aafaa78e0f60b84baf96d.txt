It's easy, and I gather Netscape has done it in 2.x - let the _user_ decide
what CAs
to trust.  For convenient verification, you can have the user sign the
keys for each of the CAs, and then the chain-following software only needs
to compare each certificate's signer with the user's own pubkey, rather than
comparing with Verisign's.  If you want to be automatic about it, you _could_
have the user sign Verisign's key when first generating keys, or you could
ask the user the first time.  

You've got to pull the wool over your _own_ eyes, here :-)
