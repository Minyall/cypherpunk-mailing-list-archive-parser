Only problem is that the Vulis^H^H^H^H^Hspammer could still mail flood 
the gateway dudes.  The gateway dudes should be ready for such attacks 
and should be able to handle them.

Such a flood could result in a denyal of post since if you flood someone 
with ten thousand random spams, then the posts worth delivering will get 
lost among those.  So the gateway dudes should be competent enough to 
deal with this sort of thing.

I wouldn't mind running such a gateway if it will fly and I have the time 
since I already provide this sort of filtering anyway.
