Hmm, I kind of went the other way. I have a gif of a baby carriage in the
standard red circle and slash. Anyone who wants it, feel free to use it.
Resize it, reshape it, share it with your friends. (I feel much better
about buying all that clip art now.)

It's at:

Other suggestions? Feel free to e-mail me. I'll dig up what I can. (Next
up: the "PGP-friendly" logo. . .)
