It is clearly not for everyone.  However, someone running a
business over the net should really think about how much they pay
in taxes to see if forming an offshore corporation and getting an
offshore web-site makes sense. 

Basically if a net business is paying more in taxes than the extra
costs to operate an offshore corporation it can pay to relocate. 
The operating costs are the web-site/email $1,200/year and about
$500/year to maintain a corporation (~$1,000 first year).  So even
a small business can justify the move.
