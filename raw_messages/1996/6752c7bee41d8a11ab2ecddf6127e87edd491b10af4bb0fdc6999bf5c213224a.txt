In a note to cypherpunks, Hal Finney comments on the new crypto
initiative:

I'm not sure if I can answer this but, at last week's SF cypherpunks
meeting, an Intel engineer asked whether there might be any interest
in a computer chip with some sort of encryption mechanism built
into the chip. As I understand it, this chip would process an
encrypted instruction stream. I.e., it could not execute a program
unless the "key" for that program was first loaded into the chip.

An interesting idea: does anyone have more information?
