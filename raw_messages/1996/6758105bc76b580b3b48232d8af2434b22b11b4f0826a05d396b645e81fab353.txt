You can act through a corportion; if you are using it as a true "alter 
ego", it will be put aside by the courts and you will be assessed back 
taxes, interest, and penalties. The employer will also.

If the person who pays you, has the _right_ (exercised or not) to tell 
you how to do the work.... you are his employee. This is a summary, but a 
good one.
