   Well done. Very well done. I'm not sure why Brock is constructing
this hard-drinking bad-boy persona (perhaps he's trying to become the
Trent Reznor of crypto journalism), but the piece was great.

   This work sends a very clear message (which is obvious to
cypherpunks, but not to the pro-censorship side): that in practice, what
exactly gets censored has a lot more to do with politics, and a lot less
to do with the original good intentions of the pro-censorship forces,
than appears on the surface. There's no reason to believe that
government-sponsored censorship would be any more carefully done than
the privately available software packages of today. In fact, there is
ample evidence to believe the contrary; these programs are subject to
the discipline of the marketplace.

   Sorry for the mini-rant. Keep up the good work.

Raph
