I too would like to see an open discussion on this.  Microsoft uses this for their new Exchange Server client/server email product....

  Can anyone tell me anything about a product called "Entrust", by Nortel
(Northern Telecom). The notes talk about the software using DES ("which
employs a 56-bit key") so I guess it's single DES, not triple DES. It also
mentions a proprietary algorithm called CAST. 

  Is this worthy of further investigation, or is it suspect ? What is 
CAST, and would it be classed as snake oil ?
