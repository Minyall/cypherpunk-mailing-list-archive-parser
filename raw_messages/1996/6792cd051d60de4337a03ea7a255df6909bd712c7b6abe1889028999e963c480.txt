This is interesting.

My theory is that they know they can't win a fair and open debate, so they
force us to fight straw men and try to bamboozle politicians with
ritualistic secret briefings.  The secrecy adds credibility to weak
arguments and heads off those of us who would try to point up the flaws in
them.  You can't critique what you haven't seen.

I think that one of the planks of the pro-crypto platform ought to be a 
call for the NSA to explain and defend their position publicly, and to 
engage in a dialogue on a moderated mail list.
