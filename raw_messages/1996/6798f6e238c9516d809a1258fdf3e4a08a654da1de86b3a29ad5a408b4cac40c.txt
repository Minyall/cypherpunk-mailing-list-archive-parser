This is one of the strangest pieces of mail I have recieved in a while.  I
know it is not nice to publish private mail, but this has got to be the most
clueless response i have gotten yet on the portland Cypherpunks meeting.

Either this guy has lost total connection to his clue-server or he left his
terminal logged in...  Either way it is pretty funny.  (At least he did not
make any references to the "tentacles" of Tim May... ]:> )
