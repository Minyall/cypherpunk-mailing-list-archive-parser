For those of you who are privacy-cypherpunks - there is
another list (run by big-brother) out there on the issue.

>From the list-of-lists:

PRIVACY
  Subscription Address: PRIVACY-REQUEST@FTC.GOV
  Owner: John Audette <ja@mmgco.com>
  Last Update: 12/28/95
  Description:
   A mailing list created bt the US Federal Trade Commission to allow
   interested parties to discuss the issues surrounding the privacy
   interests of consumers visiting web sites.  It is part of the FTC's
   "Privacy Initiative" to investigate whether the information
   collected at websites (either that affirmatively submitted by a
   visitor via a form or information collected based upon a visitor's
   selection of pages at a site to reflect personal interests) should
   be the subject of regulation by the FTC.
