C'punks,

At 01:55 PM 5/28/96 -0700, Timothy C. May wrote a thoughtful
disquisition on privacy laws and concluded:

>Cypherpunks should not, in my strong belief, support "data 
>fairness laws" or "anti-gossip laws."

To which I would add:  Cypherpunks has never been about laws
at all, except in the subversive sense.  It has been the oft
stated goal of Cypherpunks to protect privacy through the 
use of techonology, *irrespective* of what laws say.

Cypherpunks who don't want powerful corporations to invade
their privacy should be working on better privacy technology
instead of trying to dance with the devil.
