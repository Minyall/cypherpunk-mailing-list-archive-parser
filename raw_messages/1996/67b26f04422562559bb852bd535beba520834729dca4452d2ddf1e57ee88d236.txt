     Uri Geller offers $1 million to spoon benders on World Wide Web

     Starting February 29, professed psychic Uri Geller will be offering $1
million to anyone who can bend a spoon on the World Wide Web.  The spoon will
be sealed in a transparent safe and shown by live video feed on his Web page
at http://www.urigeller.com.  He says he's tired of skeptics constantly asking
him to proove his mental abilities, which he can't do on command, so he's
looking for someone who -can- perform on command.  You won't be able to just
hit the page and stare at the spoon for free, though...  This golden
opportunity will cost $4.50 a glare.
