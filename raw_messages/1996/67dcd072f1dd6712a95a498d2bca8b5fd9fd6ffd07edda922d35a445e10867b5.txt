Carl is right.  They want to GAK all keys including signature keys.  Now
think, to whom in your life are you willing to grant unlimited power of
attorney?  Your spouse?  Your lawyer?  Your banker?  Your employer?  Your
government?

Giving away your signature key is worse.  Not only can any key holder act
FOR you, he can act AS you.  "We've got you cold perp.  You signed this
child porn that was posted to alt.binary.etc.  You can make your calls from
jail."  Who needs entrapment.
