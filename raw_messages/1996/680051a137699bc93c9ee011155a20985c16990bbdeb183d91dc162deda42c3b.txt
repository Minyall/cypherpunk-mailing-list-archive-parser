Could you please remove yourself from cypherpunks to a place where conspiracy 
theories are wanted.  This list is for discussion of cryptography and the only 
conspiracy theories we are interested involve the NSA, MI5 or the Stay-Puffed 
Marshmellowman.


There is plenty of material to fuel whatever conspiracy theories you like. 
Please consult Noam Chomsky for details. 


Just please take the gun.nut conversation somewhere else. After allits in your 
own best interests, it doesn't take much to realise that the government is 
monitoring cypherpunks very carefully and that it when they come round 
collecting the guns in October they will know where to look first. So if the 
most important thing in your life is lethal weaponry best not take any risks eh?
