	heh, Hook, line, AND sinker.

This is what happens when your link is down for 4 days and you
try to get through c'punks back-mail at a fast pace, thinking
that the stuff you're looking at is 3-4 days old.

On the other hand, everyone in my family uses email, and my sister
(the english major in the bunch) has asked about stuff like using pgp
to send intimate mail to her boyfriend. And one of my brothers,
(the cattle farmer) has asked 'if there's an easy way that I can mail
some financial stuff without worrying about people reading it. Like
useing that codes stuff you talk about'.

They both just like privacy. Even my mom has said things like "go watch 
TV or something while I'm doing my mail". 

So the mother & sister part didn't really raise any flags. I've gotten
over the culture shock of everyone (and their mother) wanting to be
on the 'net awhile back. Course looking back at it I'm going "waitaminute"

In any case I'm sitting here laughing about it. Being taken in now and
then by a good joke is an ok thing. It's going to force me to plot
something devious for next April fools day. ;)
