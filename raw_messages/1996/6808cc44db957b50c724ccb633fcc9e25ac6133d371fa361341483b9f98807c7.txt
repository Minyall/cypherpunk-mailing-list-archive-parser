Another explanation is the USG's obvious interest in "infowar".  The
idea here would be that the US makes the best security tools and by
withholding them from the rest of the world, the US holds the
strongest hand in an "infowar".

Countries which the US wants to reward will receive "military
technology" to protect their networks, just as it does now with actual
weapons.

Just because this is totally insane doesn't mean they aren't thinking
about it.

However, all they will succeed in doing is greatly harming the U.S.
computer security business.  A few decades from now people will look
back on these policies in disbelief.
