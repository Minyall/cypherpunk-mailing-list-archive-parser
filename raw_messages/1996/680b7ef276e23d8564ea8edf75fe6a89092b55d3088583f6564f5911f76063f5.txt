If the master file (or say master directory with one keyfile for each
encrypted file) is encrypted with public key encryption, than anyone with the
master public key can add a new encrypted file key but only the person with
the master private key can remove one of those keys.

Now that I think about it, this is like having each user encrypt their file
with a conventional key and sending a PGP encrypted message with the key they
used to the maintainer of the master file.  Of course if you don't trust the
users to give up a copy of the key, you would need to automate the procedure.
