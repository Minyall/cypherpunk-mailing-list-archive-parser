I doubt it. When first granted access to classified, you must sign a
civil contract not to publish anything without clearing same. That
restricts your actions. 

But if you are writing a book, and the New York Times learns details
by other than you telling them [To use a favorite of this group; one
I scoff at as it's made to "look easy" -- let's say the NYT used
Tempest techniques..], then can the USG go after the NYT and engage
prior restraint? No, in my understanding.

I hedge cuz this came about as a result of Phillip Agee [sp] but I
do not recall exactly when.
