I had heard through the grapevine about a year ago that US West (the
local Phone Monopoly) was required to turn over a list of all phones
that called a certain local number. I don't recall what the details,
but it implies that records of calls (from, to, possibly duration) are
kept at least for a time.

Interesting thought, but it fails when it gets to my scale. It would
be trivial to exclude a file or set of files from normal backup, but
it would be problematic to exclude files from filesystem dumps, etc.
The scale I deal with (40,000 users, 12gb of /home directory files and
about the same in the mail spool) would make it almost impossible to
provide this service with accuracy to my users.

I've been concerned about system logging on remailers, and what kind of
traffic details they could leave. If a remailer operator doesn't control
the machine that the remailer runs on, there can be no guarantee that 
traffic information is unavailable to someone with a warrant or a gun.
It wouldn't be to much of a stretch to imagine a coordinated raid of
all remailers, to "capture a terrorist ring" or some other likely
excuse.
