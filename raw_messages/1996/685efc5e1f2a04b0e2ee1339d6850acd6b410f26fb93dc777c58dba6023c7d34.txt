This kind of report is often confusing and more often misleading.
Most of the internet still runs on "the infrastructure provided by 
the giants of the telecommunications industry, who according to the report 
would cease to exist after some time". 

Bigbells and Babybells provide cheap [flat rate local calls] and 
expensive long-distance calls. They make most of their money on the
later. This money goes into development and maintainance of their
infrastructure. Once they loose these profits 1. They won't be able
to provide cheap local-calls and/or 2. They would go bankrupt and shut the
entire network which is used by many to connect to the internet.

This is complex problem and the only solution I see to it is a
different pricing policy. [Prolly a differential pricing system might fit
the scenario but I don't have much idea about that] 

First flat rates would have to go out.
If Alice uses her phone for 5 hrs in month and pay _x_ dollars and Bob uses
his for 100 hrs and pays _x_ dollars, then Alice is subsidising Bob, which
is not really ethical. Everyone should pay for the amount of bandwith 
one is using.  

Another criteria for pricing can be content. Which would also imply that
a guy sitting in Delhi, India (like me) pays more for reaching a Server based 
in US, as compared to a local server.
