	anyone who believes the FBI and a host of other U.S. agencies even 
    less scrupulous does not wiretap without permits, has been standing behind 
    the door. generally, it does not matter if the information learned is 
    admissable in court  --they never admit wiretapping in the first place as  
    the agency themselves, in many cases, *did*not*wiretap*  --but the agency 
    does buy info from usually unsavory "contractors" who do wiretap.

	as for the NSA/CIA spying on US citizens --they dont, they spy on 
    British citizens with facilities provided by M5 and M6.  in return, 
    British M5/6 agents spy on U.S. citizens from Langely or Gaithersberg, or 
    wherever.  The fact they just happen to share information is an 
    "accident."  

	so, why legalize it? --if it aint broke, don't fix it.

	when the great sleeping, well-fed dog awakes in slavery, they will 
    look for the "false"-prophets who have long since been purged by the 
    adversary government   --and fools like Baker-Halle will be in power 
    (temporarily).
