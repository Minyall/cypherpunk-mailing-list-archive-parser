We _had_  economic cryptoanarchy several centuries ago, with respect to 
unpredictable, but expected risks in merchant shipping.

A bunch of them thar crypro-anarchists were the ones who invented modern 
insurance, in the manifestation of Lloyds of London.

If you want to convince the masses - or even fashion elites such as myself
- to forego recourse to voluntary risk sharing.... you have your work cut
out for you.
