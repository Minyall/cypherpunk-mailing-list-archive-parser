At Usenix 96 in San Diego it was pointed out that applets are an abberation.
This is a complete language designed to displace C++, Visual Basic and
other OO languages.  Thinking of Java as simpy a Web enhancement tool
is short sighted.

Personally it is more attractive than C++ for product development and
we are trying to get it on FreeBSD, SCO UnixWare and SCO OSR5.  Using 
Java for applets _only_ is like fucking your mother... Most of us are
not into it.
