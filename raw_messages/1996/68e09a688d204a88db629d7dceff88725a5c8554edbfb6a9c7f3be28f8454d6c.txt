C'punks,

Good idea, Phill.  But wait; when I wrote:

Phill adroitly responded:

[Nice try, Phill.]  The moral cowardice to which I was referring 
had nothing to do with obeying or disobeying a silly law.  It had 
to do with Phill's citing of same as a craven excuse to neither 
admit he was wrong nor to risk anything on the validity of his 
pronouncement.
 
> I don't argue against breaking laws which are immoral, indeed

Then his only stated objection to taking the bet has been removed.
Why do I doubt he will have the 'nads to take my generous wager?

> You sound like an 18th century fop challenging someone to a duel.

No, I am challenging Phill to benefit or lose based on his beliefs.
 
> I do not believe that Aristotle listed "challenging to a bet"
> as one of his modes of reason.

Phill invokes the classic straw man arguement.  What the bet does 
do is to test the courage of one's convictions.  I think it is 
obvious to all where Phill fits into this equation.  

Phill, can I assume then, that your answer to my proposed wager
is "no thank you"?
