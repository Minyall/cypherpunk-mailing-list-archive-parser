I can verify that Security First Internet Bank uses 40-bit SSL +
Username/Password. Their HTTP server also supports 128-bit SSL, however they do
not suggest one over the other. I took it upon myself after opening an account
with SFNB to purchase my own copy of 128-bit Netscape Navigator. You can make
transactions over the net and SFNB does not limit you to 128-bit. Is it really
that easy to break 40-bit? Don't you need access to a "fair amount of cpu
power"
to brute force crack 40bit? As far as I know client authentication is strictly
username & password. What other authentication system exists??
