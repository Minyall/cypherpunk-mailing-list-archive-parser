"Macintosh, the Surveillance System for the Rest of Us."

(Why Apple would go along with this, while Microsoft and Netscape are
apparently not playing ball, is incomprehensible to me. Apple risks
alienating its remaining core user base, who often characterize Microsoft
as "the Borg." So, Apple capitulates, while MS does not. I guess the
"Macintosh Crypto Forum" didn't do a lot of good, did it?)
