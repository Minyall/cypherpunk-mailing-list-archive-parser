To be precise, Congress repealed the laws which had pressured states into the
55/65 MPH speed limits.  Once this happened, a number of states either took
advantage of it immediately to raise speed limits, or are considering it...
Other states don't intend to raise the limits.  In Montana, you can now drive
at *any* speed legally, in the daytime.  So if you want to go 100 MPH, head to
Montana...  :-)
