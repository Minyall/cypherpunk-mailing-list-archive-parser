This pattern that Mr. Hatcher is showing, demonize an act then show shock
when no one else responds to the propaganda; followup by demonizing those
not shocked by the demonized act, is a fairly classic tactic.  See
e.g., Atwood, Orwell, Cambodia.

But Mr. Metzger, that requires _effort_ and decision making.  We must save
the people from _effort_ and decision making because only _we_ the elite, 
know what is good for them.

You mean telling other people the only way to solve their problems as if
they are unable to do so themselves, or as if other solutions having
nothing to do with yours do not exist.

By the way, who said we want to call ourselves an emerging 'community' ?

Readers will note a familiar tactic.  "Parade of horrors."  The advocate
will pass a series of examples intended to shock and frighten the reader
into accepting the next convenient solution to these problems, which is
coincidently provided by the advocate.

Readers who have any kind of tie to the real world will note that all
these horrors aren't even particularly disturbing and that this betrays
poor advocacy skills.
