They won't sweat over it long. Blowfish was broken.

Why? Why exactly would it be hard to produce a crypto package based on
any given algorithm? Its not exactly like Blowfish wasn't out and
available already or anything.

They won't let you export DES and we know how good that is. Heck, they
won't let you export 41 bit RC4 or better and we all know how good 41
bit RC4 would be.
