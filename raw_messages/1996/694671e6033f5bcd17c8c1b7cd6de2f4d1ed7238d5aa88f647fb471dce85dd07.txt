Sheesh.

You know you're doing good when both Dmitri Vulis and Attila both
badmouth you.  (For the record, Attila's badmouthing consisted of
stating via private email that I was "the same air head
pseudo-intellectual who has poisoned her own life with hatred and
ignorance in so many other venues.") 

Some people are just terribly threatened, I guess.
