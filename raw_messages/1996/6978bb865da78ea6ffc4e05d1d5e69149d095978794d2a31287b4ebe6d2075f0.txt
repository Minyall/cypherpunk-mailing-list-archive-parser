Actually, my original suggestion was to include 'n' in the value encrypted
in the bank's public key.  The less we have to _rely_ on ecash-enabled
apps having to do their own encryption (like SSL), the better.
Of course, extra encryption is OK, too.

I wonder if Dave and I will get Digicash's reward for this one...
I still haven't seen anything from them (though various individuals keep
promising), or from Netscape either, for that matter... [emoticon elided]
