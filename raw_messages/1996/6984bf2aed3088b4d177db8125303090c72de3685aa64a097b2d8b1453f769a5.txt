this particular paragraph certainly brought some ideas to my head: 

	Among other uses, Mr. Zimmerman says his setup could create
	a "personal area network" over one's body to link the
	various electronic devices a person carries. For instance,
	it could allow a pager attached to one's belt to transmit
	a phone number it receives to a cellular phone carried in
	a pocket. The researcher even imagines a version of the
	small computers that could be built into shoes, with the
	electricity to power them being generated by a person's
	steps.

talk about an opportunity for sniffing data off someone or just
pouring your data own into their 'personal network'.  this is the
'denial of existence' attack - the computer cannot talk to you - you
don't exist...
