http://bell.com/ (Alliance for Competitive Communications) has updated 
Telecom Bill info including "A concise resource guide to the House Senate
Conference on H.R. 1555/S. 652.", 12/22/95 draft of the Telecommunications 
Conference Bill, and a statement by VP Gore.  (Beware of editorial bias
at this site, as these people are not a disinterested party).

Our beloved Vice President said: "We are very gratified that the bill
contains the provisions for the V-chip that will enable families to
control the contract of television programming that comes into their homes
and that it contains a provision to make advanced telecommunications
services available at low cost to schools, libraries and hospitals"
