Now I have the "Department of INJUSTICE" Web page on my personal 
Web page, http://www.algebra.com/~ichudov (follow the links).

A tarred and gsipped content is available for download and mirroring.

I personally find the web page very well and artistically done, and
extremely funny. The guy who did it had a good taste.
