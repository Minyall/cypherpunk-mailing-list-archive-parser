Thank you, John, for being so brave and protecting our freedom of
on-topic speech. You are a true cypherpunk.

Thank you, Timothy C May, for advancing cryptography by posting 100%
crypto-relevant messages about loans to other countries and your
collection of assault weapons.

John and Timothy just made the cypherpunks list better.
