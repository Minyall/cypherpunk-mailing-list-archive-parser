One of the great friends of free speech on this list sent a forged cancel
message to the listbot to try to cancel my subscription.

The listbot, being reasonably well designed, ignored him and told me about
it, though I have no doubt less of a dunce could bring it off.

What a piece of slime! What do others think of this practice?
