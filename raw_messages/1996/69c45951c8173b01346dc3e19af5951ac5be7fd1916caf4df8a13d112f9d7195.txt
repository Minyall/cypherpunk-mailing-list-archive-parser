I think what we should worry about is the second-order effects of
Java; how will the world look like when Java is everywhere?

We should also not discount the "social" effects; what will people
do to try to circumvent the "stupid" safeguards that Java will be
distributed with.

I have earlier heard the opinion from the Java team (I believe) that
this is not "Java's fault", and I can understand that standpoint.
My opinion is still that the net result (pun intended!) is even weaker 
security, because of these two reasons above. 

(In my darker moments, I feel that the whole field of computer security
is in a major crisis. Ever heard of the Emperor's New Clothes? ;-))
