     Don't worry about TRS-80, if you are lucky, you will never need to know,
and if you are unlucky, well, let the horror wait until that point. 
     GAK is Government Access to Keys. 
     As for DES and the rest, try the standard primer Applied Cryptography, 
Protocols, Algorithms and Source Code in C by Bruse Schneier.
