Any approach to "cryotrography" [sic] which includes absolute statements
about unbreakability (like your quote above) betrays such ignorance about
the nature of the science as to render it a literal glowing neon brand on
your forehead reading :DO NOT PURCHASE CRYPTO FROM THIS MAN: and
accompanied by a loud speaker repeating same at 100dB.

Using cow feces to encrypt messages is also a brand new approach which no
one else has thought about doing.  That hardly means it is worth more than
the feces itself.

It means I consider your product dirt.  Cryptography is about economics.
I'm not going to spend time teaching you the tenants of the science
itself though it is clear you need such a lecture.  Try reading "Applied
Cryptography" for starters.

Calling a given cypher "uncrackable" is simple fiction or ignorance.

I might add that I am an attorney licensed to practice in the District of
Columbia, among other jurisdictions.  Having looked at your web page and
the comparisons you make to PGP I can tell you without much qualification
at all that it is at worst defamation and fraud.  I would not at all be
surprised to find that each sale of product you make constitutes a count
of wire fraud (18 U.S.C.A. sections 1341, 1343) and a count of mail fraud
if the product is shipped via the mails.  I also believe that ViaCrypt and
whoever else may have claim to the rights to market PGP commercially has a
clear action of defamation, tortious interference with contract and
depending on the state, unlawful sales interference.  The fraud element
would activate punative damages provisions.

Should any of these parties come to me asking for advice I would direct
them immediately to the nearest courthouse.

Tell me, is your "corporation" licensed to do business in any state?  Is
it licensed as a corporation?  Limited Liabiltiy? Many states impose
sanctions, including administrative disolution and fines, for the use of
misleading corporate forms or names while conducting interstate commerce
(which you are clearly doing).

Mr. Estridge, were I your attorney, and I thank my lucky stars that I am
not, I would suggest that you post a retraction immediately, and forward a
very polite letter of apology to ViaCrypt and perhaps Mr. Zimmerman.

Maybe they are too busy to sue you, report you to the better business
bureau, the FTC, or the state attorney general and the postmaster.
