    Please tell your user (Alex Strasheim <cp@proust.suba.com>) to be 
more careful in responding to messages to ensure that they are received 
by the correct site postmaster.  *I* was not the one requesting off the 
list.  I was merely the person the original poster happened to reply to
with their plea to remove *them* from the cypherpunks mailing list.
