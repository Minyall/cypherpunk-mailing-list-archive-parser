Where will you keep your secret key?  Remember, when they go through your
house they bring 20 young graduates from MIT who are just dying to show
how clever they are and save the world at the same time.

The concept of noise is not all that well defined, however.  There is no
way to look at a signal and say "this is all noise."  Sometimes physical
theories may lead you to believe that it is all noise.  That is fine
for many applications, but when becomes less convinced of things if
the consequences are severe.

Can you elaborate on this?  I am curious to know exactly what you are going
to keep in your head and what goes on the disk.  Please post the Perl
code that you would type in from scratch every time.
