Of course Lotus gave something up for it. The voluntarily made sure that
even the supposedly non-GAK domestic version provides relatively easy
access for the authorities. Sixty-four bits are an inconvenience, but
nothing more. If Lotus had wanted to make the domestic version GAK free,
they would have used 128 bit. In the end Lotus caved in twice: they
released a 'super easy' GAK international version and a not 'quite so easy'
GAK domestic version. Sixty-four bits is GAK. Period.
