A WaPo review today of a new book on military intelligence 
during the Civil War, cites the author's background in NSA 
and as director of the agency's National Cryptologic School
Press.

Are the publications of this press public? Anyone have 
an address? Access to a catalogue. Any other info?

There's another, on-line, review of the book at:
