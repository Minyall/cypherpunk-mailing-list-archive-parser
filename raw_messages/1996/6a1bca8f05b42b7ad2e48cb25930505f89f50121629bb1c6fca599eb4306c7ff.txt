I agree with Vlad/Larry's points, and this is in one of the other
recommendations for the NASDAQ, that it be even further
electronic-mediated, with more information made available on bid/ask
spreads.

The rise of discount brokers, who provide essentially no advice to
customers, is part of this "disintermediation." Ditto for electronic
trading systems, such as Accu-Trade.

Agreed, and this is already happening.

I emphatically agree! There is little need for regulation in this new
environment, and "reputations matter." And regulation is becoming
problematic.

(To cite one example. Some are calling for registration and regulation of
"investment advice," which is largely unregulated in the U.S. today. That
is, I can self-publish a newsletter, "Tim's Stock Picks," and the First
Amendment says this can't be restricted (Caveat: But I can't sell "Tim's
Legal Advice," "Tim's Earthquake Safety Advice," or "Tim's Medical Advice"
to clients...go figure). Some want investment newsletter writers "held
accountable." Great, so I'll move my newsletter to Anguilla or Monaco. What
do they do then? Stop U.S. subscribers from getting them? Set up postal
stings, where illegal investment or medical advice is treated as illegal
child porn from Denmark? Use key escrow to monitor received Net traffic?)

Again, I agree. I won't quote anymore of Vlad/Larry's piece, as I agree
with it all.

(Vznuri should probably "reclaim" his Detweiler personna, so that such good
messages as these accrue to his True Name's reputation.)
