Uh, wait a second.  Libraries and Librarians are not acting in loco 
parentis.  The purpose of a librarian is to aid patrons in locating 
materials and to maintain the order of the library.  The Library Bill of 
Rights (which, of course, legally means nothing) guarantees access to any 
materials by any patron.  If little eight year old Johnny Doe comes and 
asks for _The Joy of Gay Sex_, a librarian is supposed to do nothing more 
that point Johnny to the "J" section.

Now, I am generalizing as SOME librarian do refuse to check materials some
might feel inappropriate, but that is not a librarian policy.  The Library
Establishment (ALA, basicly) believes in the idea that it is the parents
that should be responsible for what Little Johnny reads, not the
librarian.
