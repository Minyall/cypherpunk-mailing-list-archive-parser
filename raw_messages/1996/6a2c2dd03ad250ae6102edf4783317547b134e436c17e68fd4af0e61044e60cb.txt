It would be nice to have a list of actual products which are deemed
potential snake-oil. Such a list could be maintained anonymously
through a nym to avoid all the annoying legal problems with commenting
on another's product. Though truth is the best defense against libel
charges, it would be very annoying to be sued or some such by some
hairbrained snake-oil peddler.
