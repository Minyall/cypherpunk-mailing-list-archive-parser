Today's Federal Register contains a notice from the Department of
State, Bureau of Political Military Affairs, announcing final rule of
an amendment to the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR)
allowing U.S. persons to temporarily export cryptographic products for
personal use without the need for an export license.  The product must
not be intended for copying, demonstration, marketing, sale, re-export,
or transfer of ownership or control.  It must remain in the possession
of the exporting person, which includes being locked in a hotel room or
safe.  While in transit, it must be with the person's accompanying
baggage.  Exports to certain countries are prohibited -- currently
Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria.  The exporter
must maintain records of each temporary export for five years.  See
Federal Register, Vol. 61, No. 33, Friday, February 16, 1996, Public
Notice 2294, pp. 6111-6113.
