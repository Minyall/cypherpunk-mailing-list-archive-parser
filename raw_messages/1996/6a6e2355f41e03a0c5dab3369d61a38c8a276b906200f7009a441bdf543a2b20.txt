Actually, the report said that the NSA had made chips with a virus on 
them, and that it supposedly knocked out some of their computers.  I 
think it was U.S. World & News that ran the story as fact, and stood by 
it even when it was proven to be false.  Makes you wonder if the media 
bothers to do any fact-checking when reporting, especially when reporting 
on computer topics these days.
