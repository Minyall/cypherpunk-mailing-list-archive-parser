Why stop there?

Make biometric ID implants the condition for welfare and financial aid, so
we can track them in case they spend it on (gasp!) donations to the Libertarian
party.

Government scholarships for education and research?  Better wiretap their
phones & emails, in case the recipients use the scholarships to work on strong
non-GAKed cryptography.

Hell, folks are also taking advantage of government money every time they
step foot on a park or government road: might as well require citizen-units
to escrow their identity and confiscate their guns as a condition of usage.
