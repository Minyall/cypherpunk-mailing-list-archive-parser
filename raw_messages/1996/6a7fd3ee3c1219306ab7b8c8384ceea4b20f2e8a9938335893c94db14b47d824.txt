Forgive me, but this risk is blindingly obvious and completely
nonspecific to credit-card commerce:  the same considerations
apply to any sensitive data resident on a host.  The tone of
the article strikes me as alarmist (and self-serving, as it
candidly points out).

Of course, host security is important, but what is the rationale
for panic, given the tools available?  Heavens.

Never speak it either.  Walls (and audio peripherals) have ears.
