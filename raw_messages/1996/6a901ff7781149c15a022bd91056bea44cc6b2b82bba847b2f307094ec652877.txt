I guess you've seen Zbig Fiedorowicz's unofficial SHA-1 patch.  Yet I
am not sure that what Zbig has will remain compatible with PGP3.  The
RFC document says that hashes can be added.  Zbig just chose the next
integer, which seems likely.  The padding to use in RSA signatures
seems less likely that it will be compatible.  Zbigs SHA-1 padding is
described in his docs as being:

encrypted key rings are a Good Idea.  I think PGP3 does this, so I
guess you are interested in doing it in a compatible way.  (premail
provides a `secrets' file.  I think it would be useful to generalise
this facility so that other programs could use this facility.)

ps I also picked apart the weird IDEA cfb, (using the code, and not the
docs), for this:

$n=($m=4**8)+1;sub M{$_[0]%=$m}sub N{$_[0]=(($z=($K[$o++]||$m)*($_[0]||$m))-$n*
int$z/$n)%$m}sub A{N$A;M$B+=$K[$o++];M$C+=$K[$o++];N$D}sub I{use integer;($x=
pop)<2?$x:0+($v=$n/$x,$y=$n%$x,$u=1,do{$q=$x/$y,$x%=$y,$u+=$q*$v,$q=$y/$x,$y%=
$x,$v+=$q*$u while$y>1&&$x>1},$x<2?$u:$n-$v)}$x=unpack"B*",pack H32,$k;@K=
unpack n52,pack"B*"x7,map{substr$x x7,$_*25,128}0..6;sub E{($A,$B,$C,$D,$o)=
unpack n4,$_[0];map{A;$c=$C;$C^=$A;$b=$B;$B^=$D;M$B+=N$C;M$C+=N$B;$A^=$B;$D^=$C
;$B^=$c;$C^=$b}1..8;A$B^=$C^=$B^=$C;pack n4,$A,$B,$C,$D}$_=<>;if($d){
s/..(.{8})//,$i=$1}else{$i=pack H16,$i;$j=substr$i,6,2;print$i^=E,substr$j^=E(
$i),0,2;$i=~s/../$'$j/}print substr$d?E($i)^($i=$&):($i=E($i)^$&),0,length$&
while s/.{8}|.+//s

(what is it?  PGP compatible CFB mode IDEA, which I (and another perl
hacker) were playing with a while ago, the idea being to do a PGP
compatible minimal script, not very small so far though :-( Combine
that with the already existing 2 lines of RSA in perl/dc (or perhaps 4
lines of RSA in pure perl), another 7 lines of MD5, a bit of keyring
access glue (maybe borrowed from Mark Shoulsen's pgpacket.pl), and
you'd have the ability to access PGP keyrings, with encrypted keys,
and do RSA/IDEA encryption.  You wouldn't be far off RSA signatures
either.  Maybe it would all come out under 2048 characters (a
precondition for a perl most interesting obfuscation contest).  Not
got around to finishing it yet though.)
