   Two TWP reports on the future of US intelligence and
   use of nonofficial cover (NOC):

   "Don't Hobble Intelligence Gathering," 2-15-96.

      An op-ed by Richard Haass, principal author of a just
      released report on the future of intelligence by the
      Council on Foreign Affairs, which, among other things,
      proposes lifting the ban on use of journalists and
      clergy as cover. [We expect to get this report shortly
      and will offer it here; CoFA says the first printing was
      snapped up so there should be more news reports.]

   "Loophole Revealed in Prohibition on CIA Use of
   Journalistic Cover," 2-16-96.

      Which reports that by special waiver the CIA continues
      to use journalists as covert agents despite the 1977 
      ban. Ex-National Security Council staffer Haass and 
      an ex-DCI panelist of the CoFA study claim they were 
      unaware of the loophole OKable only by the DCI. Hmm.
