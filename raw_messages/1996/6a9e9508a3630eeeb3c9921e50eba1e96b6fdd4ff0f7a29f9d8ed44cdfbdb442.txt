Perhaps I'm missing something, but it seems to me that first person in 
line (#1) would say propose that the first 11 people in line each receive 
a split of 1/11 of the 20 million and that since this doesn't come out 
exactly even, that he (#1) would make up the few cents difference out of 
his share (a small price to pay to keep alive).

This would probably get the votes of the first 11 people.  
Results:
o First 11 people split the money (last 9 get zip)
o All live.
