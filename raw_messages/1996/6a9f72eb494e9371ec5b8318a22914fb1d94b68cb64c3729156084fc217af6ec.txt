If you need to worry about something showing up on your machine that's
capable of creating fake input dialogs on your screen, I claim you
have some serious problems.

But if by being used to such windows people understand that they're
not necessarily to be trusted, I don't see why that'd be an attractive
way of slipping in a trojan horse.  I mean, if you want to give
somebody a trojan horse, you don't hang a sign around its neck reading
"I am a trojan horse".
