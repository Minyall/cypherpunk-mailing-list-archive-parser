I read an article on various Internet pricing schemes a while ago and one
of the ideas was a pretty clever solution.  Internet services would be
classified according to their bandwidth requirement and need for
interactivity.  The cost per byte of e-mail might be very cheap whereas the
cost per byte for videoconferencing might be more.  There's no real way to
rip off this scheme, because if you try to send an e-mail and classify it
as "high priority" it is more expensive.
