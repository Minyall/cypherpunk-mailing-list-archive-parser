Five thousand top level domain names is quite manageable, no big problem 
provided that their servers are reasonably stable -- and if the unstable 
ones do not work well, big deal.

A hundred thousand would be a problem.

Assume a top level domain typically lasts forever, and a top level server 
typically lasts ten years.  Assume two new top level domain names appear 
each day, and that it typically takes a several of months of reliable service
to be added to the most generally accepted lists.  This does not seem to
constitute an intolerable burden to most domain name server administrators.
