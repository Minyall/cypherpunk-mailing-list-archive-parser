	One idea I've had is dermabrasion of the fingertips. There could be
some problems with this, however, in that dermabrasion works best on areas
well-supplied with blood vessels and various other healing-promoting
characteristics; thus, it is customarily used only on the face. It would be
interesting to see if angiogenesis (blood vessel growing) and other growth
factors could be used in order to have dermabrasion on other parts of the
body without scarring (the normal consequence of using it in other areas);
this would have cosmetic as well as identity-related applications. I haven't
found any research on this subject on Medline.
