What I posted is what I received.  They were the ONLY explanation(s) I
received of a cause for the problem.  My understanding of RFC822 and
descendants is not good enough to offer a critique, but I do know that my,
and a number of my friends toad.com feed was constipated for a week until
the Exlax came thru.  If you have a better explanation of what happened, I
would be delighted to receive it.  (BTW - I have notes from a number of
non-Netcom subscribers who report no problems during the effected time.)
