The confirmation message is sent to the address
requesting an update. This could be anyone. To take
a real example, my dxm.org domain was modified by
hostmaster@best.com - neither the existing admins,
nor root@dxm.org received any confirmation, as the request
was sent from another address. The InterNIC does NOT
require domain update requests to be sent by admins - 
that is, in fact, the simplest level of authentication
that will be introduced by the InterNIC Guardian Object.
