I've always wondered why large companies just don't write some type of
standards document for crypto to interoperate, and then have each
foreign branch write (or contract out) their own version.  I don't see how
this violates export laws in any way.

Surely this has to be easier than some of the contortions large companies
are going through now to safeguard communications between branchs in
different countries.
