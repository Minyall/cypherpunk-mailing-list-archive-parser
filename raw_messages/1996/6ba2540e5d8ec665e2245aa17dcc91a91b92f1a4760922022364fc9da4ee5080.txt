Speaking as someone who seldom agrees with Phyllis Schlafly...and not
meaning to be overly ignorant or paranoid or disrespectful, but is there any
link between her column and Roger Schlafly, as in:

Schlafly v. Public Key Partners & RSA Data Security, Case C-94-20512 SW PVT

or is it mere coincidence.

Reminds me of the Doonesbury cartoon of conspiracy theorists, circa O.J.
case: "Wait a minute, Hertz has an office in Dallas."
"Coincidence?"
"I don't think so."
