Both of you are correct if you look carefully at the assumptions.  Rich 
assumes that you have a 'malicious compiler'.  Godmar is right that Java 
does not utilize pointers in the byte code.  What would make the entire 
scenario work is a malicious interpreter or a 'NotJava Browser'(TM) that 
allowed malicious code to be executed.  Couple a bad compiler and a bad 
interpreter and you are in buisness (nasty business that is).
