FYI  - AT&T Wireless had announced they would begin passing through 
CLID information on cellular phones in the Austin, Texas area
effective June 15, 1996.  I don't know how this affects ANI or what
other areas are doing, but I wouldn't  assume your cellular phone # is
not being passed through.
