Or, as Adam Smith put it:

"but after twelve or thirteen years of age, provided the master does his
duty, force or restraint can scarce ever be necessary to carry on any part
of education."

and

"No discipline is ever requisite to force attendance upon lectures which
are really worth the attending, as is well known wherever such lectures are
given."
