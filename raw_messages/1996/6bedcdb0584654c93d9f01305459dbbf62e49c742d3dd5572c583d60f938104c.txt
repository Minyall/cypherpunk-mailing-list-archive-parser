Simple enough to solve:

1. all E-mail messages must be crypto-signed by the author's private key.

2. the list exploder verifies the key against the list membership, and only
forwards the message to the distribution list if the signature matches a
member of the list.

3. New members are added through invitation or introduction (hand wave).

Q.E.D.

There are, of course, some technology integration and ease-of-use issues
here, given that no commonly used commercial E-mail software will do #1.
