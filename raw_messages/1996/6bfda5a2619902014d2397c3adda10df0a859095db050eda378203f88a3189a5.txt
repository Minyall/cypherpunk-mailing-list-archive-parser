Ever since most of the hard crypto content moved to coderpunks, there have 
been a lot of totally non-crypto political postings that make my skin 
crawl. In general, the only thing that cypherpunks have in common is a 
belief that privacy is a good thing, strong cryptography is a good way 
to improve privacy, and that cryptography with _manadatory_ key escrow is 
not strong. Stuff on the CDA yes. Stuff on the CBA no. Use of crypto for
on-line tax filing yes. Generic Tax Evadance stuff not really.

I kinda miss the Perrygrams :)
