    I see nothing in any of these messages about the murder or even 
slightest physical attack against Mr. Wallace.  Instead "putting some 
teeth into this" looks like it implies taking further actions 
on collecting a debt.  I suppose one extreme way of interpreting that 
would be to kill the debtor.
