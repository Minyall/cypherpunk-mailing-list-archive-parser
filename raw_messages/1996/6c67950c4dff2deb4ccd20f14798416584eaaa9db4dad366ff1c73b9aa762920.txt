1. Do the nym servers lie about the times of being sent?
2. Do they automatically latantize messages? I get an very quick response
from a nym server, and a very quick response from the remailer, but a
message to the nym identity (which goes through both) takes a long time

*. For the purpose of mitigating traffic analysis, has anyone considered
creating a "delete-me" redirect, hence I could send a few messages to a nym
server that I know won't go anywhere, but I can hide my traffic in that
stream. Also, nym servers could ping each other and send delete-me redirects
admist all the jumble of the normal redirects. An easy solution is to send
incorrectly encrypted messages which are thrown away regardless.
