This is true. Without realizing it (until I took a look a the alleged
Detweiler web pages), I've been Detweiling on a number of Neo-Nazi lists
for a while. This type of psychological warfare is pretty interesting.

It's not an art. It's just being an asshole, and there's nothing new 
about it. the alleged Detweiler had a few interesting observations, but 
most of them were cypherpunk-specific.

I do see a real tension between the norms of anonymity and full
disclosure, though, which I'll have to think about a bit more before
committing it to Tim May's eternal data haven with my name atached.

I should have a good example of this on the Stormfront list shortly.

I'm not so sure. I'd say that these types are more concentrated in
political activism (where I would place many political cypherpunks) nad
in mid-level politics and bureaucracies, not in high-level power
structures. The people who come to power, and stay in power, have learned
to transcend ego and paranoia. Nixon, who had been very good at this,
lost it. Clinton seems to be holding up quite well. (This is not to say
anything about their politics or characters, just their temperaments.)

Read Milan Kundera's _The Joke_ for an interesting twist on this. Or 
maybe _Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead_.
