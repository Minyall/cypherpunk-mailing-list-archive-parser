   "Leading the pro-family movement to victories since 1972." Basic
   membership includes a subscription to The Phyllis Schlafly Report and
   costs $15.00. Mrs. Schlafly, whose husband Fred used to head the World
   Anti-Communist League, is the person considered most responsible for
   the defeat of the ERA. Her book A Choice Not an Echo, published in
   1964 to support the presidential aspirations of Barry Goldwater, is
   one of the seminal texts of contemporary American conservative
   politics.
