Too bad you didn't support this with a logical argument.  The wording was 
clearly intended to be an exception to a rule.  What the wording doesn't 
include is the "exception to the exception," most likely because they 
weren't thinking in too great a detail when they wrote the regulations.  But 
if the regulation is "wrong," the fault of that is those who wrote the 
regulation.  (and we, the public, are entitled to assume that the regulation 
is "right" in its literal meaning.)

It appears that the government left a loophole so large that  you could 
drive a truck...er...shoot a rocket through it.
