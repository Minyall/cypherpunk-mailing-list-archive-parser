As M$IE 3.0 is now available for download from www.microsoft.com, I did
notice there is also a 128-bit version there, which requires you to first
fill in data about you. Unfortunately microsoft.com is so slow right now,
that I did not have a chance to try to download 128-bit version by filling
in my favourite US politicians name. 

I believe the 128-bit M$IE 3.0 should be allowed to stored on some
european crypto sites like hacktic, as it is free to everyone - with
Netscape Navigator you would be breaking the copyright, with M$IE only
ITAR.
