     Several other countries have very similiar laws.  However, I had 
heard a somewhat unproven rumor that a U.S. state had actually made the 
writing of programs with malicious purposes illegal.  Basically meaning 
that if you write a virus you have committed a crime.  Like I said 
though, this was just a statement in a message so I can't vouch for the 
accuracy.
