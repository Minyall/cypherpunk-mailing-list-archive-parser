A GAO report to congress "MONEY LAUNDERING- Progress Report on
Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network"(GAO/GGD-94-30) is
available  by snail mail free of charge for the first copy. All one
needs to do is cut-and-paste the form below and send it to the address 
provided. 

The report gives a general overview complete with a few details
describing methodologies. Of particular interest is the "Source
Database" which  "is designed to facilitate coordiation and cooperation
among agencies that might be investigating the same suspects. The
database serves as a central repository for information on suspects
requested from FinCEN as well as ..."
No doubt this will be part of the FAA/Airlines/Law enforcement data
matching scheme when it is eventually implemented. 

The second report(GAO/GGD -95-156) supposedly details changes that the
FinCEN people have suggested as needed improvements in the reporting
system. I just recently requested the second report and haven't read it. 

Aloha,
