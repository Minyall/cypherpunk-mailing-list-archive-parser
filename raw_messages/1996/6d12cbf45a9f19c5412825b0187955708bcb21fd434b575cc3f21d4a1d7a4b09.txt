Robin and Nick have even more faith in bets as a tool, but Sandy has, at
least on our list, been more of a user of such bets.

My problem has always been that they rarely work...in fact, of the last N
such bets which were offered (e.g., by Sandy) I can't recall a single one
which was ever even accepted, let alone which was settled. (And I recall
"bets" offered to Phill Hallam-Baker, Dimitri Vulis, etc.)

So, the thesis that pontifications are lessened is wiped out by the fact
that no such bets have ever, in my memory, been accepted. If anything,
those challenged to "put their money where their mouth is" almost uniformly
write _more_, not less.

While I accept the basic prinicple (and my income depends to a large extent
on my investments, which is surely an example of putting my money where my
mouth is, to a large extent), I question the usefullness in forums like
ours. For obvious reasons.
