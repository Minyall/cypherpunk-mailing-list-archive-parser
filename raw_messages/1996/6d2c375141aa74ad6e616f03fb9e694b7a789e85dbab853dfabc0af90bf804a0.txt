Not quite what I'm looking for I'm afraid.  What I want is a big 
partition that's encrypted, but accessible from Windows NT, 95, and 
Linux.  In other words, I need an encrypted drive device driver for all 
of the above operating systems that's compatible across them.

So when I'm running NT, I can use the drive, when I'm running 95 I can 
use the drive, when I'm running Linux I can use the drive.  Now linux has 
a nice UMS which lets me access DOS drives.  If that were merged with - 
say SecureDrive, and if SecureDrive were rewritten as a 32 bit VxD 
minidriver for 95, and if there were a version of the same for NT, >THAT< 
would be cool. :)
