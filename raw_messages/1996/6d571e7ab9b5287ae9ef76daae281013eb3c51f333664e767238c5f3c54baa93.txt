[remaining text and technical-related discussion deleted]

This post is a perfect example of why you'd need a comprehensive 
definition of how to use the "[CRYPTO]" string in subject headers.

Could I suggest:

1. [CRYPTO] at the extreme left for actual technical discussion (with
   examples and math, probably).
2. [CRYPTO] elsewhere in the subject line, to indicate crypto
   technically-related discussion without examples and math, as in the
   end of the Project Electric Potatoes posting.
3. [CRYPTO] nowhere in the subject line for all else.
