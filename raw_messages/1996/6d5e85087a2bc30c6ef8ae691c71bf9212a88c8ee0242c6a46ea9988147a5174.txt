   "Proposed IETF standard to ease a variety of remote 
   access concerns ." 
 
      The scheme, called Remote Authentication Dial-In User 
      Service (RADIUS), provides a centralized and secure 
      method for authenticating remote dial-in users, 
      authorizing appropriate enterprise resources and 
      gathering accounting details. RADIUS also provides a 
      way to integrate the security administration of 
      dial-in users with that of the resident enterprise 
      population.
