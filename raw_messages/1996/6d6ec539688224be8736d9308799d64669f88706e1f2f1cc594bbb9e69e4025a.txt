Very true...what I am saying is that, as far as my reading goes, LEGAL
aliens are going to be required to pay social security "taxes" while not
having any "entitlement" in return. They pay income taxes and get certain
things, like law and order, in return. They will be paying soc sec money to
the government without getting anything in return. This sounds not only
unfair but wrong, part of an isolationist, "we killed the natives so this
land is our land and the rest of you f@*k-off" revival that includes the
recent posting about requiring proof of citizenship before issuing drivers
licenses.
