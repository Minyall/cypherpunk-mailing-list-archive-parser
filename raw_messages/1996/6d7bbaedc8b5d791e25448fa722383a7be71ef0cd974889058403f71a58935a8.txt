These number should be qualified with the date on which the estimate was  
determined.  New factoring techniques increase the number of RSA key bits  
required to make factoring work equivalent to a given brute-force search.

Also, I would think that the NFS makes 512 bit RSA key factoring easier than  
brute-forcing 64-bits of key space...
