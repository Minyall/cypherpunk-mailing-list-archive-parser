Or that your tone and method of delivery combined with your knowledge of 
the subject matter at hand is consistantly lacking.

I believe my concern was with your review of legislation and the impact 
of cases without any legal background.

Revise your statement to:

"doesn't want anyone who hasn't spent a few years in law school to pass 
judgement on pending legislation and the effect of supreme court decision 
thereon..."

and you'd be right on the money.

And I confirm again that I'm an elitist legal snob.  At least I know what 
I'm talking about.
