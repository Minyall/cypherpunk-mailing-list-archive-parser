While I'm not an expert at this, I think you're misrepresented the Chudnovsky result.  They formulated an equation that allowed "you" to continue the calculation past "N" digits as long as you had the result that far.  As far as I know, they DID NOT generate any formula for the generation of isolated digits of pi, the more recent news. 

I'm signing this message after having turned off word-wrap in Eudora.  I'm told this my help my clearsigning process.  Could somebody verify this?
