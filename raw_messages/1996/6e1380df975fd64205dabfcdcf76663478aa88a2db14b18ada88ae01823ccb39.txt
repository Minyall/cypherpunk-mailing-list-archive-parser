Many still do.  Even ski hire shops in France require a passport, credit
card
or drivers licence to be _left_ with the shop (even hire car companies
don't
do this! - I suppose they've figured out you need your driving licence
...)

I was recently at a hotel in the Netherlands, and they required me to
fill
out a form asking for date and place of birth, passport number etc. etc.
I asked "What do you want this for?" and they replied "Oh, don't worry,
it's not for us, it's for the government"!!!  I look around me at the
dozen
or so people happily giving away these details, including my girlfriend
who later has to be given a lesson on misinformation ... (am I the only
one who fills out every form as Alexei Sayle with bad handwriting?)
