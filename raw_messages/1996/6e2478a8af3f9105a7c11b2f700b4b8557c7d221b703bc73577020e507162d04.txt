	true, too true.

	unfortunately, the point is corrrect: the pacifist do tolerate actions that 
    others would not thereby encouraging further aggression. 

	after the pacifists have been attacked, they can be particularly violent  
    --and incarcertated, they are defiant.  Or, as I prefer to put it: 

	    there is nothing worse than a liberal whose ass has been bit.
