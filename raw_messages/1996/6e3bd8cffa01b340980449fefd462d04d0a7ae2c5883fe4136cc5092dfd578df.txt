Well, then don't read what we have to say. Unsubscribe from the list or use
filters. That you are happy just to use your computer for work and e-mail
and occasional jaunts into the Internet and that discussions of other
topics bother you should be a clear indication you're probably on the wrong
list.

Having a "navy.mil" domain probably is another reason, unless you are only
hear to monitor our discussions of using cryptography to undermine the
state, to liberate military secrets with BlackNet and the Information
Liberation Front, and to punish the millions of those in the
military-industrial complex who have so richly earned their eventual
punishments.

Smash the State.

We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
