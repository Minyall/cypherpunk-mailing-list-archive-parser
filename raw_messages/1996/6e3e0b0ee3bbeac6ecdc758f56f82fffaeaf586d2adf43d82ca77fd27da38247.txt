[Joe, this may be yet another area where we disagree. It represents a
power grab by law enforcement; the infrastructure is prone to failure
and can be compromised; it's more government meddling and coercion and
more restrictions on free speech; the Fed bureaucrats controlling this
are vulnerable to special-interest lobbying; the Constitution gives
the Federal government no right to impose such restrictions; the FBI
has demonstrated that we can't trust the Feds with our most personal
information; it violates an absolute right to privacy; and it's
technically impractical for a good number of applications. --Declan]

	Declan's most recent piece makes much more sense than the earlier
one.  He is quite correct in emphasizing the future vulnerability of the
encryption logarithms rather than centering on whether or not terrorists
might use them.  By making them impossible to crack without the key, and
permitting the key to be available to appropriate law enforcement
authorities when absolutely necessary, everyone's real needs are 
satisfied, I think.  I enjoyed this report a lot.
