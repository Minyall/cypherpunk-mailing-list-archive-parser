        good, solid statement of purpose which too few of us practice. 
    it is general human nature to be protective (usually in a jealous 
    sense) of our nurtured opinions. However, that is not an excuse to 
    be abusive of another.  

        It is one thing to be vituperatively demonstrative, another to 
    criticize anothers view point by epithetical allegorations, and 
    another, with careful consideration, to disagree with _civilized_
    clinically definable examples which delineate your viewport.

        ...but I always make an exception for sarcasm!

    or, as I have said before:

    "Profanity is a crutch for inarticulate motherfuckers.
      but profanity is occasionally condonable as enlightened punctuation."
