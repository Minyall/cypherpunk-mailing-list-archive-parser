Actually, it's really a question more of information than transportation.
The, heh, solution to diaherrea-induced dehydration -- like the kind you
get from Cholera -- is a very simple mixture of sugar, salt, and water.
This (and, of course, the proper construction of the sanatation facilities
which caused the Cholera to begin with) is just the kind of information
which the internet can carry.

All we need is a few more cycles of Moore's law and a bunch of
microsattelite-based internet routers...

And, of course, the microcurrency system to pay for it all. :-).

It would certainly be cheaper than "Peace" Corps ecotourism...
