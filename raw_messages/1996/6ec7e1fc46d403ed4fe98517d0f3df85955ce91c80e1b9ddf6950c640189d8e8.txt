I have about 100MB (compressed) of crypto archives, papers, source code, etc
etc, reasonably well organised with descriptions of each file.  I've got a
friend to put it on CD, but only for my own use.  If there's someone who can
get them done in bulk outside the US you could probably use this as a crypto CD
(I don't think there's anyone in NZ who could do it, and I don't really want
the hassle of organising the whole thing).
