It's not a way of saying I don't understand. Instead, I find your
viewpoint incomprehensible and internally inconsistent.

In fact, you Freedom Knight folks seem to be closet censors yourself. Why
do you support not carrying newsgroups like alt.config?

Yes, ownership gives you a license to censor. I'm going to have a party in
my home a few weeks from now. If I don't like what someone is doing, I'll
kick 'em out. I won't do it lightly, but I will fight for my right to do
so.

Oh, and I plan to subscribe to the freedom-knights mailing list and infest
it the way Vulis did cypherpunks. Every hour, on the hour, a crontab
script will flood it with rants about Dave (fart) Hayes.

What will you do then?
