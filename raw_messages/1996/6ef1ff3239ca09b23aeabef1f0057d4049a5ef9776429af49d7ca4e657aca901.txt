	Yes. For instance, I am a member of the Extropy Institute - but I'm
_not_ an anarcho-capitalist, even though that's one of the things that the
Institute stands for.

	However, one reference in this report to Weaver's calling for a meeting
to oppose the "Zionist Occupation Government" does provide an argument for
calling him a racist of the anti-Semitic variety. On the other hand, the only
person claiming this is the FBI's informant; the truth of his statements has
been called into doubt.
	So far as I can tell, it's uncertain.
