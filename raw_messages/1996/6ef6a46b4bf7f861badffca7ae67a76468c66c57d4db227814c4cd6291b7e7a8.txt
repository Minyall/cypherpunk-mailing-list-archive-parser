But, on the other hand, it wouldn't be to hard to have the user set both
keys (yeah, so that didn't actually say anything, so what...), and then do
an every-other-byte type thing (although that would be slow... every other
block would be more efficient), and have 2 EFS's in one file, and make it
so that on the "duress" one the extra space appears to be "free".

One could make it a real file system, and add a fake disk error to prevent
over-writing of the "non-duress" filesystem.

This will sound odd, but did you know that "dockmaster" was the name of
the NSA's first unclassified computer? just wondering.... ;)
