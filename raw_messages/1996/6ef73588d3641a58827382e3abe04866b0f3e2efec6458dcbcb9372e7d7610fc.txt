Don't cash the check yet.  It's security by obscurity using the
highest quality "unpublished algorithms" and up to a 48 byte
key phrase.  

He's only willing to send out the free version by return snail 
mail - no Net access.  Any crack you submit must also decrypt
other messages they will feed it, must be completely documented,
and any prize awards are at their sole descretion. 

He's also selling the high performance "9600 Baud" version for
$100.
