Sure, the Netscape extensions are nice. And it's nice to have an operating
system (M$-DOG) pre-installed on every hard drive. But Net$cape, like M$,
was trying to esablish a dominant "follow-us-or-die" position in the 
industry. 

Yes, the Net$cape extensions allow people to do stuff that they wouldn't 
otherwise be able to do. But, the extensions *could have* been 
implemented in such a way that using them wouldn't be detrimental to 
non-Net$cape browsers. Instead, they've altered the World Wide Web in 
such a way that it can only be viewed "correctly" with Net$cape.

The rest of your post was quite interesting. I *do* think it would be 
good to have multiple, interchangeable formats like we do for graphics. 
What we really need to make that happen are DETAILED SPECIFICATIONS.
