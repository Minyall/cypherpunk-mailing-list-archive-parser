Exploration of the internals are critical for any crypto
implementation.  Unfortunately, this is beyond the scope of my skills,
and requires me to rely upon the talents of you guys, ( Thanks! :) 

Of some relevance: (not intended to branch off topic)
I work at a large corporation who has a strong relationship with MS.
We had a MS Internet Architecture guru in here trying to sell us on an
NT Internet server solution as opposed to Sun which we use now.

We expressed our concerns about the security of NT  versus Unix in
regards to hackability, to which he responded. 

(paraprhased) 
NT is more secure than Unix since NT is newer, few people know anthing
about it, where Unix has known, documented holes in security. 
(Albeit plugged ones. ed.) 

With this *security through obscurity* outlook, I think exploration is
definatley in order.

Now that's a scary thought!  I need to look further into how they
implement authentication of CSPs.
