I can confirm it.  I never gave them the cookie.  Had one hell of a
job backing out.  I don't know what would have happened if I had set
my cookies file to be read only.

It's a nuisance, but I suppose there is no reason that a commercial
service can't do such a thing.  But what happens when one tries to
access it with Lynx?

I too am using Navigator 3.0 (the new beta with strong crypto)--I
wonder if people who use MS's explorer or whatever it is called are
faced with the same problems?
