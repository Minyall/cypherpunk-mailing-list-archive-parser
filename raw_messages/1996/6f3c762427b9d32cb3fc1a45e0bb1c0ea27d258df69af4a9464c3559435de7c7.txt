In response to Tim's message wherein he described trading in Intel
stock while an employee there, you wrote (in message

Sorry if I misinterpreted this.

OK.  The only point I want to make is that thousands of us do this to
some extent every year and the risk apparently isn't terribly high.
Each person who works for a large corporation has *some* "non-public
information" which helps them decide whether to participate in the
stock purchase plan next year.  (Obviously if I think the company's
going to tank, I won't buy any more shares.)  I haven't seen anyone
attempt to define "material" but I'll concede that it's vague enough
to be dangerous to anyone whose trades are large enough to attract
attention.
