I was recently speaking with a newly-made aquaintence, and we were 
discussing the merits of various encryption systems.  Now, I had heard
about all the people who claimed the reason versions later than 2.3 
wouldn't work with 2.3 was because of a backdoor for the government.  I 
personally thought they were being paranoid.  However, this guy tells me 
that he met Phil at defcon and phil told him that he co-operated with 
the government and gave them information that would enable them to crack 
key's for versions later than 2.3.   I don't know whether to believe him 
or not, as I said earlier he is not a long-time friend or anything, so he 
could just be lying to me.  If anyone has any information on this I would 
appreciate it.
