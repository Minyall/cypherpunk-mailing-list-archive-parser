This is the double spending problem.

Given that untraceability of tradable cards is less of an issue than
with e-cash, why not have a central registry of the owners of the cards
(which would consist of the card details paired with the public key
of the owner)?  Admittedly this means the players must be on line,
but then we all know how difficult off line detection of double
spenders is.

For anyone who is _serious_ about starting work on such a game
system, I have a few pieces of Perl and Java code that would really
get you on your way - let me know if you are interested.
