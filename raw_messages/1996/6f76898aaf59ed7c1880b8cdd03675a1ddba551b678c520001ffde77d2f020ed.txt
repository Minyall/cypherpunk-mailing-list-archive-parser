You know, it is cases like this that I consider evolution in action.

What was the fool doing growing pot in a house, anyway?

Any smart pot grower knows that you grow pot in grow rooms underground.
With a large septic tank above it. Through the septic tank, you bubble both
the exhaust of the diesel generator used to power the high pressure sodium
lights, as well as the exhaust of the grow room cooling fan. That
neutralizes the exhaust smell and provides an obvious explanation to the IR
scanners overhead, since septic tanks are naturally hot due to the
bacterial activity taking place within.

Amateurs.
