Subject: Have you had your privacy invaded?

Hi--
I am looking for someone who lost a feeling of privacy--
I need a "victim" to tell a story about how he or she had
her privacy invaded and how he/she felt about it.

The Oprah Show is looking for a real-life example of
someone whose name got on a strange list, or whose unlisted
phone number was given out, or whose medical records were
made known to insurance companies--anything like that.

The show is next Wed. and they will pay to get you
there if you have a good story to tell (and it had better
be a true story!!)

Call Dana Newton of the Show if you have story to tell...
