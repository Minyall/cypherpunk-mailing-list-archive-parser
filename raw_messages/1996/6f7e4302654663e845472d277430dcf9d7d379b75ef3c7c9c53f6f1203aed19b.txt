And it is this sort of scratch space which the user does not want
to have on the unencrypted partition.  Unless the _system_ requires
writable area on the startup volume there is no disadvantage to locking
that volume.  Once the system is up and running use alias folders in the
system folder for those apps which are inconsiderate enough not to
ask you where they will be creating temp space.
