The proof is intuitive, if there is equal or greater entropy in the 
pad as there is in the message and the pad is used in a proper OPT 
fashion (never repeating) there is no way to determine the correct 
decryption, as simple as that doctor fuckup.
 
As for when I said brute force, fault admitted, I was probably 
thinking about a stream cipher or something, as you know as well as 
me (or probably don`t as you know nothing about cryptography) there 
is no concept of a brute force attack on an OTP as there are many 
correct decryptions for different pads.
