I've been tracking offshore banks with Internet presences for more than a
year...I figure only those with Net savvy are worth looking at.

An Alta Vista query of "offshore AND banking" just revealed 2000 hits,
suggesting a lot of activity. Some of these hits are for banks, some for
services catering to offshore bankers, some are reviews of what's out
there, and some are of course just plain accidental hits. But you get the
point.
