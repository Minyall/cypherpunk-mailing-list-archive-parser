	Yes, I would hope so.

	Well there are certain applications which personal users don't
really want to use. SSL webservers for example. Most individuals don't
have a need for an SSL webserver. RSA-in-hardware is also not needed
for most individuals, but high-traffic server applications which do
RSA operations really should start using RSA in hardware.
	Encrypted database applications (something I'm working on with
a friend) are another application which personal users don't really
care about, but corporate IS finds valuable. (Well, I hope they find
it valuable, otherwise our product won't sell.. the database guy says
he knows them well enough that they'll buy it though.)
