Teleport has been having the same problems.  They have a modification to
majordomo that sends a confirm message to the intended
victim^H^H^H^H^H^Hrecipient asking if he/she/it really wanted to subscribe
and request that they send back a passphrase to confirm the subscription.

This has two benificial effects...  It keeps the unwilling from being
subscribed to lists that they do not want.  It also keeps the incredibly
clueless from subscribing in the first place since they can never figure how
to get the confirm message back to majordomo without botching it.

I will find from the "powers that be" at teleport if the patch is publically
released for use.
