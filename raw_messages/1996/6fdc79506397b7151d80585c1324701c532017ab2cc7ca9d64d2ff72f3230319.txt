Can send PGP encrypted E-Mail from inside Netscape now - highlight/cut/punch 
Enclyptor "crypt" button/paste. This is difficult ? Read is same except
punch "Dec" and notepad pops up with cleartext. Have even read encrypted 
mail on the VAX with Telnet that way (no, Virginia, the cleartext does
not pass on the net).

Could do that now with a commerce server - didn't say "encrypted" email,
said "secure". Prolly just sends it to port 443 on the secure channel and
the server does the SMTP to the internal net.
