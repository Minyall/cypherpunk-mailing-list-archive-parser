It's a copyright work. There is no need to be explicit--redistribution of
copyright intellectual property (except for fair use excerpts) is an
infringement without explicit permission of the copyright owner, isn't it?
Next you'll be telling us that one can Xerox best-sellers without
permission and send them to Patagonia unless there's an explicit sale
prohibition against it.

Tthe license terms would have to allow redistribution explicitly for any
flavor of it to be non-infringing--they don't have to prohibit some flavors
specifically, yes?
