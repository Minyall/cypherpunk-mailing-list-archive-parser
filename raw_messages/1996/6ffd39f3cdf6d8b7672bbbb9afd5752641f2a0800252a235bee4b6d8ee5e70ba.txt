Are you familiar with the Jefferson Bible?  It's an excerpt and
rearrangement of the gospels to produce a more liberal effect.
It shows that Thomas Jefferson was into interpretation rather
than doctrinaire discipline.

And rather than "dispensing drugs in clinics," why not simply
scrap the drug laws entirely?  People have a *right* to do as
they please with their bodies.
