On second thought, this is so *obviously* a troll that it *must* be
intended to be obvious. Of course there are a lot of really stooooopid
Nazis out there, but this last round is too much. Did you see the one
about Smart Cards being the Mark of the Beast? Follow the URL that message
gave -- it's even loonier than it looks. 

Only nobody@replay.com knows...

Possibilities:

1. Some anti-Nazi (such as Tallpaul -- note this is *not* an accusation!)
   trying to make the Nazis look bad.
2. Some really, really stupid Nazi who doesn't realize that he looks bad
   (if you don't believe sich people exist, look up just about any Usenet 
   post from Les Griswold or A HUBER).
3. Some Detweiler tentacle/clone trolling just for kicks.
4. Declan, trying to troll me.
5. Me, trying to troll Declan, or myself.

In any case, the person doing it is an asshole, and there is little call
for substantive replies. Don't feed the animals.
