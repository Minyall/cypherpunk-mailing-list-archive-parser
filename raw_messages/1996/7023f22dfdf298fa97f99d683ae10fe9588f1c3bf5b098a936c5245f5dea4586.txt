SEOUL, South Korea (Jun 15, 1996 00:41 a.m. EDT) -- For a Canadian
university student, creating an Internet site on North Korea was simply
opening a small library on the  reclusive nation. For South Korean
authorities, it was threat to national security.

Last week, South Korea declared David Burgess' World Wide Web site
subversive and ordered 14 local computer networks with Internet links to
block public access to it.

The government also said it would punish anyone accessing North Korean web
sites, taking its ideological war with its Marxist enemy into cyberspace.
