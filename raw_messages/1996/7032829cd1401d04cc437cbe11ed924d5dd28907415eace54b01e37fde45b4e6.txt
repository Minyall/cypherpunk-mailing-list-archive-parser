This is wrong, and easily disproven.  There was no way to put a trap
door in PGP because the source code was made publically available.
Modifying every C compiler in the world is just not realistic.

However, the situation has become considerably different with PGPfone.
Source code to PGPfone is kept extremely secret.  A few outsiders may
be given the source to review, but they will not be allowed to compile
and distribute it.  Only binaries of PGPfone compiled by the authors
will be available.  Some interesting portions of the program have even
been intentionally obfuscated to make them extremely difficult to
disassemble and analyze.

With PGPfone, a back would be considerably easier to install...
