Tell ya' something you might find amusing:  During the 1992 campaign,
when I worked for awhile for Perot The Populist, I also sent personal
letters to every right- and left-wing organization I could find out
about (a couple thousand orgs and individuals), and I kept track of the
responses.

My records indicated that the orgs and individuals identified closely
with the *Right* were twice as responsive as those on the *Left*, and
easily ten times as friendly.  There's something to be said about the
down-home sincerity of those folks in small-town America, as opposed to
the ruthless, cynical people who mostly populate the left-wing positions
of influence today in big cities.

Of course, if the Right were to seize power from the Left today (i.e.,
take over newpapers, TV, and so on), what I've described might shift
a bit.
