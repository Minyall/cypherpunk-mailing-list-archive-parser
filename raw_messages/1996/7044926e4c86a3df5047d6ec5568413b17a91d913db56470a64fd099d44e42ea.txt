Looking for:

"Electromagnetic Radiation from Video Display Units: An Eavesdropping
Risk?" by Wim Van Eck, published in "Computers & Security,"  1985, Vol 4

and

"Protective Measures Against Compromising Electromagnetic Radiation Emitted
by Video Display Terminals" by Professor Erhard Moller, Aachen University,
1990 (no source citation)

Haven't found an electronic version of either of these yet, and will visit
the good old "paper-based" library next week if no pointers show up.

Thanks in advance...

Joel
