Hi Dale,

The Kennedy motherfucker deserved to die. Whoever shot him did the right thing.

Joe Kennedy was a murderous bootlegger gangster who bought the presidency for
his kid. The French did a great job exterminating their aristos during the
Revolution. So did the Russians. That's what this country needs.

Who cares who shot Kennedy as long as he aimed well. :-)
