They forgot "Change the entry for any person or business in the US from a
throwaway AOL trial account, or using an anonymous web proxy and
pseudonymous remailer." Hope this helps.

It's from the Database America CD-ROM, which is one of the cheaper and less
complete ones. It's all publicly available information, or was. There are
probably tens of thousands of numbers that have been changed or unlisted
recently.

Unlike the original CD-ROM, Switchboard does not provide a (easy) way to
build large mailing lists or do reverse address lookups (like "who lives at
this address on Pennsylvannia Avenue" or "who might be on vacation in a
building with line of sight to this place").
