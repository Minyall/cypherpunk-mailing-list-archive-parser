Am I remembering correctly that the NRO slush came to light, becasue the 
bigwigs were caught building a Taj Mahal of a headquarters building with 
the extra money? Oh, the banality of it!

They should have been been surveilling Amercian's listening habits to see 
who's a fan of Frank Zappa, it would have made for more sensational 
reading on the CP list.
