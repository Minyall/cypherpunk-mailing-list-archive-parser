You could try breaking in to the room the firewall is in. Once in the 
room, simply rewire the network to bypass the firewall. 

Be sure that you arrive in the room well equipped. You might want to 
have a spare router or two, some cables, tools, and hubs, and perhaps 
something to do address translation.
