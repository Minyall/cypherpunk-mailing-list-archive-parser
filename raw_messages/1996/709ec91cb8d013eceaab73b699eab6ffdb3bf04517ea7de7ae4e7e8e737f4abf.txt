In NYC a very high percentage of drivers don't have licences, have suspended
licences, etc. Generally no one has the time to bother with them unless they
want to nail them for something else. A couple of years ago we were involved in
a minor car accident with a Chassidic Jew who tried to leave the scene of the
accident. My wife chased him and stopped him. :-) The cops came and discovered
that he had no papers (including no driver's licence, no insurance, etc). They
gave him about $500 worth of tickets for driving without a licence, leaving the
scene of an accident, etc (which I rather doubt he was planning to pay) and let
him drive on (still without the licence).
