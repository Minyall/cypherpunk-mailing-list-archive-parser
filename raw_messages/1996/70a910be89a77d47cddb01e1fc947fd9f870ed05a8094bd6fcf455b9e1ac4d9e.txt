commit murder is quite close to the one necessary to coerce
poeples to pay rent.

! You did not answer my question:  When our local Mohawks accuse the 
! white peoples to have stolen their land, I ask "when did I do that?  
! I can't remember..."  I refuse to be held responsible for things that 
! were done several hundred years ago.  Period.  As I said, I *never*, 
! not even in my early years, believed in original sin.  

Then you hold irresponsible refusals.

! I am sorry, but I do not accept that as a valid argument.  What if

! There are instances, as you seem to agree, when killing is justified. 
! What is meant by the sentence is: Thou shalt not initiate lethal 
! violence.  

Racism.

! > Taxation is theft, I fail to see your point. Well, depends.  

Anti-racism is theft.
