I never said or even (should you be a telepath) thought that he
didn't.  Heck, I've PGP-signed documents which I've then had to FAX to
people.  :)  OCR is your friend, eh?

No, I was responding to the person who was distrustful of the law's
requirement for certified signatures.  DON'T WAIT FOR THE GUVMINT TO
CREATE A CERTIFYING AGENCY -- start your own and get some momentum.
Makes it much harder for them to claim that PGP won't work because
there's no central signature registry.  PGP doesn't require a central
registry, but then again it doesn't disallow it either.
