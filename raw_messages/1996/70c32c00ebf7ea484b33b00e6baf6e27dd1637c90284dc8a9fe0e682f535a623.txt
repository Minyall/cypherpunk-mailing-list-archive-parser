That's "Lubavicher". (A number of my close relatives are.)

> Hitler started with the gays.

That's a pretty ambiguous statement. Are you saying that disproportionately
many of Hitler's supporters were homosexual, and that homosexuality permeated
Nazi ideology (the facts that the "politically correct" historians are trying
to suppress, as documented in the book _The Pink Swastika_)?

This religious war thread, started by Timmy May, has nothing to do with
cryptography. Take it (and Timmy) elsewhere, please.
