          L exis-Nexis, one of the nation's leading private
          information brokers, has discontinued a new online
          offering that provided access to
          millions of individuals' Social Security numbers, after an
          onslaught of complaints from customers and the credit
          information bureau that originally supplied the data. 

          The service, which was offered by the company for 10 days
          before it was discontinued Monday, was one feature of the
          new "Lexis-Nexis P-Trak Person Locator" that Lexis-Nexis had
          developed to attract new business from law firms and
          law-enforcement agencies.
