Yes, part of that "higher standard" is to keep your fucking mouth 
shut about that piece in your sholder holster.  Those that brag that 
they are packing and won't hesitate to use it are usually those that 
freeze under fire or snap at the workplace.

A true shooter shut's the fuck up and if needs be, let's the weapon 
do the talking when the time is right.

That mutually assured destruction shit only works for governments.  
In this day and age you better think EVERYONE'S packing, and if you 
shoot your mouth off about your little pea shooter you just make 
yourself a target for the first shot fired.
