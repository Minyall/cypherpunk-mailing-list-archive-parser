There are provisions for exporting DES for banking purposes. 
Generally it is a hardware card that "can't" be reused outside 
of the banking transfer machine.  I don't know the details
of how such licenses are applied for, but I have a friend you 
used to work in that area.

On 128-bit DH - No-where near big enough.
