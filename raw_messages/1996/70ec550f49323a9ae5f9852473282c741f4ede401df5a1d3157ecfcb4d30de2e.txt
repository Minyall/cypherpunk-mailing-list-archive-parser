Perry, if someone is so clueless as to post a general programming
question to cypherpunks, do you think they're going to "get it"?  You
need to explain it in very   small   words.

This mailing list, cypherpunks, is about encryption.  It's not about
reminiscing about old personal computers (however much fun it is to
do) and showing off our respective ages.  Yes, you may consider this a
Russ-o-gram.
