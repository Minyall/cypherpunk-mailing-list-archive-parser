Oh, Come now!  Islam may in its present form be a religion deeply hostile 
to liberty.  But since "nuking" the whole Islamic world would not be 
itself much of a defence of freedom, the only long term answer is to 
promote within Islam the same kind of Reformation as eventually made 
Christianity half decent.  And Tim's comments do not contribute to that.  
I don't know how many internet servers there are in the Middle East.  
But, if I were an intelligent fundamentalist, I'd be copying it all over 
the place.  "Look", I'd be saying, "these people really do mean another 
crusade to destroy us and our faith".

I can understand Tim's disgust with these people.  But I do question his 
manner of expressing it.
