  Yes--crossbreeding has it's advantages.

  That's not even close to the truth.

  What a simple mind--coming from an Ann Rand fan though that's really
no surprise.

  Because I'm on the Freedom Knights list you assume I am speaking
on their behalf?  And because Adam is on the cypherpunks list you
assume him to be speaking on their behalf?  That's rather simple
minded.  My tie to Freedom Knights has to do with the belief that
one may freely speek their mind on the net--period.  My beliefs
regarding the redistribution of income may or may not be shared
by different members of the FK list. Personally I don't believe
in the right to accumulate excess wealth and certainly don't 
believe in the 'right' to pass it down through the generations.
