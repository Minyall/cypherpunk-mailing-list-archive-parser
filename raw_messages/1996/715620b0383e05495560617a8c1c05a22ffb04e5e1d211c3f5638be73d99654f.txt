Hi!

If I were going to start an e-bank, what would you suggest?

1. What type of e-cash system?
2. What services to offer?
3. Where would I get information?
4. Where is there a need in the marketplace?

A friend of mine has the means and desire to do this, and he wanted me to
ask and then forward the answers to him.

Thank you in advance.
