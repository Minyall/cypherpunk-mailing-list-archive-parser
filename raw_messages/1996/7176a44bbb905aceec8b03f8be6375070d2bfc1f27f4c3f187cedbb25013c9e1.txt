I just heard that Perry and Tim were picked up last night for public 
intoxication, after a hard night of partying and crypto-brainstorming.

OBCrypto: The arresting officer found in Perry's jacket pocket, a 
matchbook with what looked like mathematical symbols on it.  He didn't 
know what the symbols were, so he turned it over to the DP department.  I 
hear a couple of hours later, two "suits" showed up at the jail, asked to 
see the matchbook, took one look, turned pale, and spirited Perry and Tim 
out the back door of the jail.  The police profess no knowledge of the 
whereabouts of Tim or Perry - they say they never heard of them.  The 
arrest report has also apparantly disappeared.

The last thing one of the "suits" said was something like "they know 
about the hole in RSA we found with the quantum computer" - or that's 
what was reportedly said.  Something like that.
