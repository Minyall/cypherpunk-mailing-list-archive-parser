In fact, before FDR, wage income was taxed; however, it was one large 
check at the end of the yeraar (or the beginning of the next, really).

The high cost of WW II made it a necessity for the gvm't to have more 
money at a particular moment, and not wait for year-end.

I can't remember when the amendment constitutionalizing (is that a word) 
the income tax was passed; however, the income tax (and wage income was 
most certainly taxed) was AFAIK implemented by the end of the 19th century.

I might be wrong on dates here; the general principle still stands...
