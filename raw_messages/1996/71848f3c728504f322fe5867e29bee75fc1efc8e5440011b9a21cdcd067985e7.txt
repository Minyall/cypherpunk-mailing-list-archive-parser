Blah, blah, blah.

This situation has nothing to do with the Leahy bill.  As you mentioned,
crypto is not the issue here. It's whether we get to have remailers,
period -- encrypted or not.

Why must you persist in bringing the bill up, constantly, whether it
applies to the situation being discussed or not?  Your gonna hurt your
arm, reaching around to pat yourself on the back like that ;)
