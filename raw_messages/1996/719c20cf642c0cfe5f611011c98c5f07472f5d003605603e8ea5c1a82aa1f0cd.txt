	Incidentally, the strategy of simply rating one's page all 9's, if one
is required through some means of rating it at all, has the distinct advantage
of making any system using such filters more annoying to use. (One would, of
course, except any page making a political statement or other material that one
wanted to get out to as wide a number of people as possible).

	A configurable search engine on this basis could be very nice.
