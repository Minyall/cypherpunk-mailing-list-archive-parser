How would this work in my case?
I have a Pipeline 25 ISDN router in my house.
I have several computers, used by myself, my wife, and my kids, connected
via Ethernet to the p25. The router talks to my provider. I have _one_
account at my provider.

Multiple IP #s, multiple machines, multiple users, ONE account.
Which router will insert the "suggested" flag, and how will it decide which
packets to tag?

I suspect the people who thought this up haven't thought it through. :-)
They are confusing "ISP accounts" with "e-mail" addresses, maybe?

My setup may be unusual, but it's certainly not unique.
