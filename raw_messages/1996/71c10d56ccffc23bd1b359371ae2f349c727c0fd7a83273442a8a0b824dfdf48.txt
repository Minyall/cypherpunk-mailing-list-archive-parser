There is a protocol for anonymous message broadcast which supposedly
detects disruption, can someone tell me how it works? Applied Cryptography
lists a reference to "Advances in Cryptology, Crypto '89 Preceedings"
(page 690) but I dont have a copy of it, I'd appreciate it if someone
could fill me in on what it says.

Thanks!
