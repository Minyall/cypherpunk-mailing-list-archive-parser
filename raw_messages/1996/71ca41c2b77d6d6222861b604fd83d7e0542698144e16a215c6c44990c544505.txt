About what I expected: "We're only exploring, we're not trying to
damage anything, etc." -- I didn't tape it so I can't give you
more than that impression.

Since I've been in this business for well over thirty years and,
about ten years ago, had one of my systems infested by Kevin
Mitnick, I'm not particularly sympathetic to the "we're just
trying to learn" mentality -- if you want to learn, buy a PC
and a Linux CD, write some code, give it away, and make a real
contribution to the community.

Martin.
