BB would follow the signal and pop another person with conspiracy.

I have been researching this for a while yet, and have a pretty alpha
reference implementation as well as a mailing list exactly on this topic.

The problem with a RAID 5 data haven is that something needs to be the
controller, to put together and store/retrieve the data.  This controller
is in one point, and can be found out.

What BB could do is smash the controller of the RAID array, then press
charges against several of the "hard drive" owners for conspiracy.

I am working on a list for this topic (dh-l@lists.io.com, subscribe on
majordomo@lists.io.com), but I have had problems with getting a the reply
block correct, most likely due to me being very new to majordomo type
lists.

Another problem with this way of a data haven is the way network traffic
gets transfered around.  To have it more anonymous, DC net technology can
be used, but this very hard to implement.

As of now, I am looking for someone who can help me implement a redundant
controller system, so when the DH is contacted, even if the first one if
smashed, the "RAID" stays operable.

Currently, the data haven program just wakes up on input from a .forward
file into its stdin and acts on it.
