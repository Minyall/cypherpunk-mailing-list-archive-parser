For those interested, there is an article in the latest Scientific American
about copyright laws and how they will be applied to the Internet.  It used
the banned French book about the former president as an example of just how
difficult it is to regulate information.  It also addresses whether routers
(or analogously anonymous remailers) should be held liable for any copyright
violations that may pass through them.
