What's the use ? It makes it only nominally more difficult to access
an US crypto site, one needs first to esthablish an US beachhead ie.
open an US account, and ftp the eleet crypto warez using the newly
created US account as an intermediary. 

So the next step will be a tag that a user is an 'alien' ?
