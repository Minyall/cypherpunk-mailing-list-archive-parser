	It is more the MAD theory brought down to the personal level. The
government has the power and authority to kill anyone of us, AP brings out
into the open the fact that WE ALL HAVE THAT POWER. KIlling people is
(physically) very easy, AP turns the THREAT back on those who hold the
power. Note: I don't necessarily think that AP is a good idea. I think
that people should do their own dirty work.

	How about this:

	Goverments, and the people in them are corrupt. This corruption,
caused by acts of these people, lead to oppression and death. By THEIR
MORALITY oppression and killing are ok, so it is ok to use their tools
agaisnt them.

	Putting people in cages is wrong.
	Stealing is wrong.
	Is putting people in cages for stealing wrong?

	I might be wrong here, but I don't think that Mr. Bell actually
wants anyone actually shot, well, maybe he does, but what he wants is to
have the same power over members of governments than they have over him.
