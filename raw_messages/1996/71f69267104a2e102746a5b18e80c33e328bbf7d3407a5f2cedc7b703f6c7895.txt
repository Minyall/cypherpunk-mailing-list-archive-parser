Very good point, phreaking's getting tricky. First of all, forget blue 
boxes, they're worthless, especially to an amateur, which you (HeLiuM) 
obviouisly are. Get a red box. Go to Radio Shack and buy a digital 
recorder pocket memo thing. They're about ten bucks and it's alot easier 
than getting a handheld DTMF dialer (which is annoying to solder because 
RS doesn't make them very well). Get BlueBeep or something 
(ftp.fc.net/pub/defcon/BLUEBEEP) and record some quarter tones. Go to a 
Bell payphone (CoCoTs and USWest phones do not work) and dial 
"1+area+npa+number", like a normal call. Then play the tones. For a local 
call, dial "10288+area+npa+number", which makes AT&T think it's along 
distance call.
