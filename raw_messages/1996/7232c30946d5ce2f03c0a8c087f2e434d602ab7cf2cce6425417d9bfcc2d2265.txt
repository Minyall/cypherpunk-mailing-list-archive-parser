Its my experience that at full feed sites, there isn't enough cpu to
do this.  A p-90 can get ovewhelmed pretty easily trying to keep up
with the load.  Trying to look into the body of an article means at
least a few hundred more ops per article.  You could do this on a leaf
node.  However, you cut the reliability of the system by adding things
to go wrong.  Better to have a scanner that checks specific moderated
groups after INN has deposited the articles.
