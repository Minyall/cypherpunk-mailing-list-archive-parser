   "In this new game, you'll never play with a full deck."

      Sometime next month a game will be played on the
      Internet, challenging surfers to leap between sites,
      solving puzzles and cracking codes that will give them
      access to secret data hidden behind firewalls and
      software barriers. The new game is Netrunner, set in the
      "dark techno-future" in which "ruthless corporations
      scheme to accomplish secret agendas as they build
      elaborate fortresses of data." In opposition to such
      plots, "anarchistic netrunners hack the system,
      infiltrating data forts to liberate information." It was
      created by Richard Garfield, who applied his doctoral
      training in combinatorial mathematics -- a field that
      studies the interaction of objects in complex systems.


   " 'Magic' Casts a Spell on Players."

      Magic was invented by Richard Garfield, who revels in
      his shoelessness. "I like to wear socks or slippers
      indoors," he said, padding around the Puck Building in
      thick. off-white socks. Developing the game took Mr.
      Garfield, who has a doctorate in combinational
      mathematics, all of a week.
