This was in the Daily Brief on 11/05:

* A federal Judge ruled yesterday that America Online can block
  junk e-mail from Cyber Promotions Inc.
    - said neither the First Amendment nor the constitutions of
      Pennsylvania or Virginia allow Cyber to send unsolicited
      computer ads to AOL members.

Does anybody know where I can find a full article on this?  It sounds like
it might set some precedent for other cases dealing with the Internet.

Thanks,
