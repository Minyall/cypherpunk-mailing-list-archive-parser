BlackNet-type pools eliminate the chain. There is no "first step in the
chain," only a message pool or Usenet group which is propagated to tens of
thousands of sites around the world (and even available via one's satellite
dish and local cable, a la DirectPC, @Home, etc.).

Remailers, message pools, and untraceable cash are much more robust against
these sorts of attacks than you are portraying here.

Hollywood is too naive. I was interviewed by a screenwriter who came to a
Cypherpunks meeting, circa early 1994. She took copious notes and seemed
very interested in these sorts of things. From the plot she was tentatively
working on, I think the eventual outcome was "The Net," but it's possible
her script never got made, or was used for background, or whatever. In any
case, "The Net" (and "Hackers") had essentially nothing very sophisticated
in it.
