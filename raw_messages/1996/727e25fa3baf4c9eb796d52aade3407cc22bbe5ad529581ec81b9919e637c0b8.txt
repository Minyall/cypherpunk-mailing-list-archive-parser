Yup - You've got it right.  A bank's responsibility is to make the SSN 
match on tape with what the IRS has - thats it.  It was part of the big 
stink in the 80's when congress first said that all banks had to withhold 
on all interest, the banks yelled, and then the SSN match program was 
instituted.

There are significant fines for banks that do not follow up on 
mis-matches, or do not begin "back-up" withholding.  One person is no big 
deal, but they add up fast!

The IRS's job is to collect income so if the number matches with a filing 
then a-okay!

Yo.
