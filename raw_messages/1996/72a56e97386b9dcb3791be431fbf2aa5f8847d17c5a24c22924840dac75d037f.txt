Subject: How to get test messages to test your mail filters

Sending test messages to mailing lists of 500-1000 people 
just to test your mail filters is rude, and it's been happening a lot lately.
On the other hand, building interesting mail filters is a 
reasonable cypherpunk topic - issues like reputation servers,
email privacy, etc. are relevant technology, though this isn't mailpunx.
So if you want to send us all a test message, it'd be nice
if there were some description of the cool stuff you're implementing :-)

On the other hand, if you just need someone other than yourself to
send you mail, one useful technique is to send email to
bogususer@wellknownmachine.com, for some value of wellknownmachine.
Since most machines don't have a user named "bogususer", it'll bounce,
unless of course it's running OS/2, which assumes that email for any
address on the machine is targeted at the real user (or unless it's
running an email system that doesn't implement bouncing...)
