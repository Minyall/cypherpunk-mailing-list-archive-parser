C'punks,

For the second (and last) time, the Bay Area Cypherpunks meeting
will be held at the offices of Simple Access, fourth floor, 388 
Market Street, San Francisco.  The meeting will be from noon to
6pm (or so) on Saturday, 9 March.  As of this notice, there is
no agenda.  (Funny, we never seem to be at a loss for words.)

transit.  If anyone wants BART, CalTrain or bus information, let
me know.  Otherewise, here are driving instructions:
