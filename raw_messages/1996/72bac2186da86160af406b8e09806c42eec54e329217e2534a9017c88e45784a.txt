Au contraire, the UK is as obnoxious in exporting its laws as the
US. The Prime Minister of Greece when (accurately) accused of corruption
in the Greek press sued them in the UK courts and won $200K

In recent years many Tory Grandees have benefited from the libel
lottery. Amongst them Lord Aldington who was accused of being involved
in war crimes during WWII and 'won" 1.75 million which the European
Court of Human rights rejected as being "disproportionate". Lord
Archer recently won $1 million after a couple of newspapers alledged
that he might have been sleeping with the prostitute he was photographed
giving 5000GBP to (and afterwards claimed not to have met).

With the exception of the suicide act its probabky the stupidest and
most damaging law that ever got passed in the English system.
