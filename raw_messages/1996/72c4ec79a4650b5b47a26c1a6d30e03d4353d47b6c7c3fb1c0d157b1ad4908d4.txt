Any sysadmin using POP3 to snoop through your mail would have to be a complete
moron.  It's much easier to just "cat /usr/spool/mail/user" which is
undetectable.  The sysadmin could then use touch to set the "last read" value
to the previous value.  Anyone with complete access to the POP3 server would
be able to snoop through anyone's mail undetected.  My guess is that you are
getting that error from a stale lockfile.  If any sysadmin is snooping through
your mail, you wouldn't know it.
