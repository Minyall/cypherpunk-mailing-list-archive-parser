Yes, I successfully d/l'ed the Sun version.  I think it was about 7MB
and took forever, but it unpacked and ran cleanly with no glitches
whatever.  It's a temporary version -- it'll expire on about 17 Sep...
which is fine for me, since I didn't want to wait until our Purchasing
dept got through with their song and dance.
