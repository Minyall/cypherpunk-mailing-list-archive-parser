	And will remain as long as it still is. E-cash is a great idea,
and I hope to see it _really_ working soon, but it will not be anonymous
anytime in the forseable future.

	Also, people won't trust it. Not the people that read this list, I
trust some of the people here, and if they say it works, I trust that. Not
just one, but _all_ of the group I trust. No, people like my parents and
other relatives. People smart enough to read the papers, and smart enough
not to trust everything the "experts" say. 

	Cash is easy, cash is plentiful, you can hold cash in your hand
and KNOW that you have it.
