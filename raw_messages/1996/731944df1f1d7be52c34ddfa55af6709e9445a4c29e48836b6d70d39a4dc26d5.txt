In a brief NPR report on the Leary case (he is alleged to have firebombed 
the NYC subway) there is a decision due on whether prosecutors can force 
him to give up passwords for his personal computer files (he was a 
computer professional). His attorney is claiming 5th amendment privilige.

According to the newscaster, the NY state court decision should be a 
first in this type of case. Prosecutors argue it is no different from
being forced to turn over a diary.

The report does not say what type of protection was used.
