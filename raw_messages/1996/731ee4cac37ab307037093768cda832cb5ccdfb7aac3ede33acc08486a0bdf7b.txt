I agree.  I hope that my own statements have influence in spite of
my mouldy reputation.

Well, on the net nobody knows if you're mouldy, but only if your ideas are

You've presented some quite insightful explanations for why Ms. Denning's

if not outright contempt.  As they say, YMMV, depending on how educated you 
are on the subject of encryption, privacy, and crimes against humanity.
