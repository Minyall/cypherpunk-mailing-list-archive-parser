Another annoying feature in JavaScript and Netscape. Have a look at 
<http://www.popco.com/grabtest.html>

The page uses JavaScript to steal your e-mail address and sends a test 
e-mail message to the address it grabbed. It works with Netscape, which 
is probably only browser supporting JavaScript.

Probably there will soon be thousands of pages which include this code, 
and people using Netscape 2.0 will be spammed with commercial messages. 
So just put some false e-mail address in your Netscape browser to disable 
this feature.

The script was developed and announced by Glenn Fleishman, moderator of 
the Internet Marketing mailing list. Thanks for letting people know.
