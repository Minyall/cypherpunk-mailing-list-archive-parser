	Don't screw with the system, and I can bet how the policy
review will come out.

	We just had a policy review; the National Academy of Sciences
had a very prestigious group do a review of our Cryptographic Policy.
It suggested liberalization.

	Clearly, someone didn't like that, so the Powers That Be are
doing another policy review in the hopes of getting a review that they
like.  If they don't get something they like, there will be another
policy review, chaired by Loius Freeh, and taking testimony from such
prestigious cryptographers as Dr. Denning.
