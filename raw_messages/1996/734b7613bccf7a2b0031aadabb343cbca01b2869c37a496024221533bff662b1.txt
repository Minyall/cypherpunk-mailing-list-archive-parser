On the other hand, the "algorithm" as presented is so hopelessly 
obfuscated by the strange terminology and loose descriptions used
to present it that there's no way I (or anybody else) could seriously
evaluate it.  Either publish an algorithm in some accepted format
(a real C program, or even Knuth notation) or cut back your expectations
for public analysis.
