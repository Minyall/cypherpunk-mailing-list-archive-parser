	A better way to set up a prize is to find a few big companies
willing to sponsor such a demonstration.  AT&T, Nortel, RSA, Netscape,
Microsoft, Qualcomm, and many other companies have an interest in
seeing stronger than DES crypto exportable.  Perhaps one of them could
set up a prize, similar to netscape's Bugs Bounty, or the RSA-129
challenge.
