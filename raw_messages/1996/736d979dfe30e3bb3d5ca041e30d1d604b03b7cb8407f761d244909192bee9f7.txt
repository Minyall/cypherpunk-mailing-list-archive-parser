The distinction you seem to be looking for is civil v. criminal.

I agree.  This is one reason multi-jurisdictional services are going to
have to be formed.  At some point it is going to come down to, quite
simply, a law v. technology issue.  Crypto is simply too difficult, to
slippery to regulate.  See e.g., Clipper, France, ITAR, and other
sillys.  At some point remailers will be too.

Recognize that crypto and anonymous information distribution technologies
are alike in this fashion.
