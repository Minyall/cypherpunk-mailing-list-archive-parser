Highly dubious.  The court has full jurisdiction over all non-ambassadors
in its jurisidiction.  Whatever passport they may hold.  The cited text
relates to the immunity of foreign states and their ambassadors and their
political subdvisions.  It is not an exemption for all tourists, foreign
workers or the like.
