Granted, but neither is it a requirement to suffer fools.

(a) I have it on good authority, that "authoritarian" does not
    mean what Paul apparently thinks it does.  Look it up, Paul,
    and then let us know if that's what you actually meant.  
    (Hint:  No one has suggested unquestioning obedience.  A
    better accusation--though still incorrect in the instant 
    case--would be of "paternalism.")

(b) I assure you, that was NOT my implication.  My position is 
    that (1) keeping that sort of noise down is a good thing,
    and (2) it's John's machine and John's call, not ours.
