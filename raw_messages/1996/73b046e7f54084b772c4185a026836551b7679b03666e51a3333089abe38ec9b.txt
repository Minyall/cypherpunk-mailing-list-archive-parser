I've pointed out (primarily to Sternlight) that the whole concept of 
referring to it as a "cryptography _policy_" biases the discussion.  
"Policies," in this usage, are the functions of governments.  Countries 
don't necessarily have any need to have a "policy" on cryptography.  In 
fact, one could argue that in a country where freedom of speech is in 
effect, no sort of restrictive "policy" has any place.
