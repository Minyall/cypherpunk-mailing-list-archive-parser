Subject: sector cleaning utility anywhere?

Hi.

I am using secdrive and also PCTools win 2.0

In the disk defragmenter of PCTools, I can choose DOD wipe to clear up free
sectors.

But I wondered if it wipes the trailing bits and sectors(?) at the end of a 
file in the end cluster?

Is there a standalone utility that would do this end-of-sector cleanup
like secure drive does, but that could do it on it's own without the need 
of any deletion?
