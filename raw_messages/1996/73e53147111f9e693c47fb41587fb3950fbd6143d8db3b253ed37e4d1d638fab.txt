	Creating watermarks that can't be removed without degrading
image quality is not especially difficult.  The two tricky bits are
durability and collusion protection.

	Durability involves ensuring enough of a watermark remains
after the image is converted to a JPEG.  Colusion protection is making
sure that users can't compare images and remove the watermark without
a large number of users being involved.
