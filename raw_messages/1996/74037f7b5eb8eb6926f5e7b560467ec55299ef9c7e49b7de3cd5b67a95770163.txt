DES CRACKING SCREENSAVER

Sorry for writing twice, beside wanting to add that I might be able to do some
programming for a worthy cause, I just got a rather good idea to make a
screensaver unique and interesting ( making people want to burn cycles )
Picture this: the user upon installing the program points at his/her location on
a world map. This location is send to the keyserver, which sends back highly
compressed information about where other people are running their
"screensavers", the screensaver itself can simply display a rotating globe,
where the different densities of global usage is given in colour shades, showing
an inverse sunclock of sorts. I think such a concept might give the DES-cracking
screensaver a critical mass.
