CCW holders don't have a legal right to conceal their possession of 
weapon, from the police.

I believe that use of this device would be unconstitutional in a 
jurisdiction which doesn't license concealed carry - to wit, Vermont ONLY.
If you are a licensee, you exercise your privilege at the pleasure of the 
Sovereign.
