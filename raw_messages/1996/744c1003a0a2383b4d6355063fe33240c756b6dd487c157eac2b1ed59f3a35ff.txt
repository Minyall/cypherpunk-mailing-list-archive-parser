Actually, at least in Oklahoma, corporal punishment is still quite legal,
it's just considered risky.  Many parents actually believe that "thier
little angel can do no wrong", incapable of believing that the actions that
thier little hooligans propagated.  It is these parents who might sue, but
that doesn't change the fact that at least in Oklahoma, corporal punishment
can still be used in the schools.
