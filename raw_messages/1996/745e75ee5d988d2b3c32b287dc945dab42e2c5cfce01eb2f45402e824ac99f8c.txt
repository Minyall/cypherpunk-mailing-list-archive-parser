No, you're not a censor.  You are merely determining what *you* choose to 
read.  That's perfectly acceptable - probably a lot of people on this 
list also filter their messages to some extent.  Now, if you tried to 
force the rest of us to abide by the standards that you set for yourself, 
then you would be trying to censor us.  There is a big difference here.
