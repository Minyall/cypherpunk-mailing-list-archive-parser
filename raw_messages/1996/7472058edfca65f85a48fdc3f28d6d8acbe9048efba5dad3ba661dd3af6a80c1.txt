    I've been on this list for around a year, and nothing that I've 
seen (on here) has given you enough reason for the type of senseless 
garbage flowing freely from your fingers.  While Tim (along with the 
rest of us) is no angel your problems with him should be sent directly
to him and not the Cypherpunks list where it appears to the rest of us 
that you are having a one-sided, drug-induced ranting fest.

    I simply can't comprehend why someone with your alleged credentials 
and knowledge would want to make their peers see them as a foul-mouthed, 
ignorant teenager.  So, explain yourself.
