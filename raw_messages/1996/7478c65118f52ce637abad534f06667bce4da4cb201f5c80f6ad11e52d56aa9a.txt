Several Western European countries had such split currencies after WW II.
Belgium's two francs have almost been phased out. Spain is the only major
country with two currencies (ESP and ESB). They actually fetch slightly
different interest rates.

Chile introduced 'unidad de fomento' a while back, and many other minor
players do something similar.
