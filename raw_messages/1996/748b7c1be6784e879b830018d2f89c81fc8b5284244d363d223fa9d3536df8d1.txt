- From the node of Timothy C. May:
: 
: P.S. I am persuaded that the importation of rare tropical birds into the
: U.S. is a GOOD THING, and that the attempts to ban such imports are
: misguided eco-fundie efforts. Diversity will be enhanced by having the
: birds in the U.S., and if left in their native jungles, most will die
: anyway. Better a pampered tropical bird in a gilded cage than lunch for
: some predator, or starvation as the jungles are cleared by slash-and-burn
: farmers.

Aside from the amusing belief that caged life is preferrable, let me point
out that importation of species can be pretty nasty.  Zebra mussels in the
Great Lakes, Mongooses in Hawaii, those nasty snakes from Guam ... etc, etc.


: 
: The same data transparency of borders, where truckloads of stuff come in
: easily, means that truckloads of birds, eggs, embryos, babies, etc. can
: also make it in. Most such shipments are only caught when surveillance
: yields a shipping schedule...such surveillance is becoming more and more
: difficult because of the technologies we push.

All right!  Horseman #5 ... the bird smuggler ;)



PS -- Going to consolidate posts here.  Can someone recommend a good 
text for an intro to Number Theory?
