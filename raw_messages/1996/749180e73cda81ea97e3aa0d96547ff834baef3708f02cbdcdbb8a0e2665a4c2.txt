The Weisenthal brown shirts aren't *feeling* useless. They are scared 
shitless that they might have to go out and get a real job.

Do-gooder organizations are in the same bind as breakfast cereals. It's so
easy to enter the game that there's cut-throat competition. You've got to
keep your name in front of the public, or else people will relegate you to
the Flat-Earth Society status you actually deserve. So, you've got to hire
skilled flacks who know how to position a press release on a slow news
day. Imagine if the Simeonistas' press release hit the fax machines on the
same day that the blizzard shut down the East - it would have gotten lost. 

There's an association of Association Executives. You should see their 
training programs.
