We are not currently revealing all the details of our system because of 
patents in process, and other relat6ed matters. We are offering the 
software. You should be able to readily decompile it and determine the 
algorithms used andf how they are used to generate random number sequences 
for very long files.  For short messages, a true OTP is used directly. 

If you are aware of encrtypting technology, you recognize that hardware 
prime number cycle wheels for the basis of some of the most secured 
hardware systems employed for encryption. We simply expand that technogy 
using software to set an intial setting, an adder, and a limit for 64 
such wheels, using large random prime numbers for each of those settings. 
The total number of possibilities is over 10 to the 1690th power and can 
be much larger. 

Thus we can eliminate the need to have the length of the OTP to be equal 
to the length of the file - if you do not belive that it works, try it 
and see - it takes inly a few hours to set such a trial up. We generated 
over 790 gigabytes of charcaters, on multiple backups, and tested. Our 
standard deviations, chi squares, Delta ICs for bits, characters, sets, 
and the entire set were random. The sets are random, and you can take 
that to the bank. 

Someone, will decompile it and discover that it is truly random, at least 
from the practical usage basis. But we need that time to file patents, 
cvopyrights and the like. 

The IPG system solves the key management problem and produces a truly 
unbreakabkle system. We make no apologies for not currently revealing all 
of the methodologies andf algorithms, but they will be revealed with 
time, by us or others, and you will discover that it is indeed a simple, 
easy to use, easy to install, truly unbreakable system.
