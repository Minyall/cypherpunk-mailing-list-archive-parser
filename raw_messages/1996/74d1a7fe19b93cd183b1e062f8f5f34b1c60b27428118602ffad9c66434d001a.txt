Pronto Secure, currently in beta 6.16, is shaping up as a fine 
all-inclusive mail package that supports PGP.  You might want to take a 
look at it at:

Beta Testers residing in the USA are invited to download the beta from:

        http://www.commtouch.com/secus/secus1.htm

Non US residents should download from:

        http://www.commtouch.com/secnon/secintl1.htm

I have been with it since beta 1 and it definately has come a long way.  
Platforms supported are the MS GUI.  It is a 16-bit app.  I currently run 
it under NT 3.51 w/ 32-bit PGP executables.

Take a look.

Lou Z.
