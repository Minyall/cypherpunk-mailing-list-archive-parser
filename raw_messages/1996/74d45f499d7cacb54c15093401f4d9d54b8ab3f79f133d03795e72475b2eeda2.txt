Hm.  I think the best we could hope for is along the lines of 
"The suspect subscribed to the 'Cypherpunks' discussion group on 
the Internet, but his violent views were rejected by the members
of the group."


It is important that the reporter manages to _not_ use the word
"member" to indicate that Bell is a "member" of Cypherpunks.


I think that conversing with Bell, or publically replying to him
at all, even to insult him, makes him more of a "member" and 
makes his pet topic more a part of cypherpunks, both in appearance
and in substance.  So don't do it.  That means you, too,
Black Unicorn.  At _least_ you can take it to private e-mail in
order to prevent the reporters from getting the wrong idea, and
in order to spare the rest of us the tedium of deleting the
messages.


This is assuming that the statement "his violent views were
rejected by the members of the group" is actually true!  If 
there _is_ anyone else here who shares Bell's evil enthusiasms, 
I strongly encourage you to begin a new list dedicated to that 
topic.


Regards,

Bryce
