Exceedingly unlikely.  A variety of practical problems.  If you came up 
to a U.S. Attorney to show him your picture on the cover of The Zaire Daily 
News as mercenary of the week and spit in his face, you'd get prosecuted.

For spitting in the prosecutor's face.

On a slightly more serious note:  you'd only get prosecuted in someone at 
Main Justice (i.e. in Washington) wanted you prosecuted.
