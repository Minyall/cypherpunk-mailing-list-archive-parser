"Is the timing attack a real threat to security? 'Oh, God, 
yes!' exclaims Bruce Schneier. 'You can't belittle the realness 
of it. It's not only a theoretical attack -- you can do this!'

And a current IBM ad exclaims! that one of its scientists can 
dematerialize objects for transmission over the Internet with 
rematerialization at the other end! And that this technology 
will transform the world of information!
