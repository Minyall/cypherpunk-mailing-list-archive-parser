Well, I of course don't hold an 8-year-old very responsible for making such
a stupid decision. I was really talking about the stupidity of the entire
"stunt," which is what it was,  Her parents were pieces of newage, the news
media were willing co-involvants (it's called "manufacturing the news"),
and the pilot had little experience in icy conditions in thin air.

Even in jest, parental licensing would have done little. Jessica's dingbat
newage parents are just the type of granolaheads so favored in California
as being nurturing, gender-role-bending parental-units. They would surely
have received their Breeding Permit.
