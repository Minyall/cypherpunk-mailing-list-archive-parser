You can temporarily modify router tables, spoof IPs and idents,
and leave few traces behind once the data has been transferred,
particularly if the origin is some obscure foreign location.

Correct.  But I was mentioning DC-Nets only in the context of a
mechanism for permitting the dispersed parts of such a system to
communicate with each other, without identification of a
particular node as being responsible for a particular action.

The idea here was to have a large number of nodes, each capable
of injecting data into the Net in a manner which cannot be easily
traced back to an individual.  These nodes would talk to each
other using a mechanism which obscured both eavesdropping and
traffic analysis of their communications, a DC-Net being one
possible way of doing this.

You could get the same effect with an instant anonymous account
that could be purchased with Ecash.  You would buy it on the
spot, send your mail, and forget about it.  For all practical
purposes, it would serve the same function as a remailer, and
steps could be taken to obscure the identity of whoever had
telnetted to it.

Another possible approach is the "remailing packets" one.  You
could set up a packet remailer which could be used as a universal
proxy server in some untouchable foreign location.  If we had a
"packet remailer in a box", these things could pop up all over
the place, live a short time, and be nuked.  Since the
communication would be real-time, concerns over reliability and
delivery would not exist in the same way they do for the current
system of remailers.

I don't think most people are going to pay to remail.  Or, to put
it another way, the types of traffic people will pay to remail
are those no remailer operator will want to touch with a barge
pole.

Perhaps.  Time will tell.
