It was the Zimmermann Telegram, actually, and it was a dispatch from
the Germans to the Mexicans trying to promise them most of the
southwest in exchange for being allies against the U.S. (which wasn't
yet in the war). The Brits intercepted and decoded it and released it,
which forced the U.S. into World War I.
