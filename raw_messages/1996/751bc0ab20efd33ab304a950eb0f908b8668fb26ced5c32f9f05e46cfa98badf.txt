Succeeded the last two times it was tried.

But it was not merely "screaming" about what the "natural" rights ought to be -

it was presenting a more definite and clear picture of them to the mind of the beholders (who hardly had any such ideas in their mind), as well as backing up the description of these rights with the intent to secure them through physical force, if necessary (as one might expect).

Screaming aloud about having "natural" rights and then sitting back and waiting for them to be recognized stands little or no chance of success with those who are obviously unsympathetic and are in a position of power over others.  Knowing what one is talking about, being able to convey it with the conviction of certainty, and being prepared to act to secure what it is "rightful" to have, is more likely to achieve the noble cause.

It's also more impressive (than whining).
