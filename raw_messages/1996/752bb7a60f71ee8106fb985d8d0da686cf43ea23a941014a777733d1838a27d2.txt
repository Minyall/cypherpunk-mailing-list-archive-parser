As I said, I spent considerable time there, and typed in considerable
data.  I used the help facilities, and I corresponded with the persons
who do support.  Firefly was not able to make a single correlation or
suggestion for me, which BTW, Alexander Chislenko acknowledged as a
weakness of the (current/old) Firefly system.  Perhaps you should ask him
what the problem is, if you have a curiosity about it.
