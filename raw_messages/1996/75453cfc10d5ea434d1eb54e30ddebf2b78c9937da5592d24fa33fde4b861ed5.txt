  I do agree extending commonly used mailers would be helpful.

  Emacs + mailcrypt (with or without MH & mh-e) already provide the
means to chain one's message through type 1 or mixmaster type 2
remailers. mailcrypt will even choose arbitrary remailer routing for
you based on information gathered from Raph Levien's remailer
list. Unforunately this is not a turnkey solution and requires more
configuration than most users probably want.
