Interesting threat model... What can one do in the total absense of
physical security?  We've talked about mental cryptography before, but I
think we agreed that it isn't very practical.  Perhaps security through
obscurity is a better solution here, since many parents are less computer
literate than their children.

Perhaps in the future kids will get non-removable tamperproof
microchip implants behind their parents' backs. :)
