Sean,

Women's place in Islam is just fine. The problem is that _Arabs_ like to 
define their ages-old cultural suppression of woman as Islamic. Which it is
not.

YOu in England are dealing with an unrepresentative sample of the Islamic 
world. May I suggest a few weeks of traveling through Java and Mindanao, 
to see another side of the coin.

The crusaders liked to define their thuggery and thievery in the Balkans 
and middle East as being driven by Christian imperatives. Should we say 
that the Crusader's *actions* were a good definition of "christian 
principles"?
