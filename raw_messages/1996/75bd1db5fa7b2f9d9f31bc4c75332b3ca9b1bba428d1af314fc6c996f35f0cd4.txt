>If the intent is to motivate others to kill or otherwise harm others simply
because you don't agree with them or their actions is reprehensible and
moraly or ethicaly undefensible.

	So you don't believe in self-defense, or the defense of another? While
I'm not as sure as Jim whether such a system would just be used by the good

I can see the death penalty as being appropriate.
