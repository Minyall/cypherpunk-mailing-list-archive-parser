     If you trust me, I'll hold the cash under the following stipulations: 

     1) The exact terms of the bet are spelled out in writing and digitally
        signed by both parties. 
 
     2) That an agreement on the term "nationally TV show" is reached.

     3) That the payment is in the form of a cashiers check made out to the 
        me, and that each person send a SASE with their cashiers check so 
        that I can send the winner their check, without having to deal with 
        it.
