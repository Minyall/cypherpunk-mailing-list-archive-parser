I realized that I'd simply dismissed Bart without explaining why his
contention is so silly.

I failed to note obvious counterexamples. Well known authors get giant
advances for books written with manual typewriters. Minimum wage
workers routinely operate expensive equipment. Workers doing the same
job in different places using identical equipment that cost identical
sums earn different salaries.

Clearly, wages are defined by supply and demand -- not by "capital
investment".
