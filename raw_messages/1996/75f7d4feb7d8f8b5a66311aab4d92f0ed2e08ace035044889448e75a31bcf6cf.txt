(Redirected to the list.)
Any British citizen, irrespective of s/he thinks about the IRA, has
benefited economically from the 800 years of pillaging and genocide
in Ireland.  I see no problem if they pay with their lives for
these crimes. Likewise I see no problem if U.S. civilians pay with
their lives for their government's crimes in Iraq, even if they
happen to disapprove of these crimes.
