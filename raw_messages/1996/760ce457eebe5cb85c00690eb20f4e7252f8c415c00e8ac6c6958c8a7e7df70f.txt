Yo.

I especially enjoyed this sentence: "Individuals would be allowed to
develop their own encryption systems for personal or educational use
without obtaining licenses, though they could not distribute them to
others."

It's unclear whether it's OK to share books, algorithms, and source code; 
or if it is, what's the point?

Outlaw cryptography, and only cryptographers and outlaws will have 
cryptography.
