I think the "challenges" thing has gotten too ridiculous. Didn't some guys
try to recently walk across Antarctica? Ended up eating some of their dogs
before the Norwegian Coast Guard bailed out their ass, if I recall
correctly? 

Why does the news media think I care if someone has succeeded in 
ballooning across the Atlantic Ocean?  

I there any assinine project that some fool won't attempt?
