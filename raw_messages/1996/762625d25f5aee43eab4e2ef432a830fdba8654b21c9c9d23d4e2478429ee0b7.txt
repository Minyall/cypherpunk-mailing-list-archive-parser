I think that's user-settable, but there is no ideal approach.
Cypherpunks tried several different approaches to addresses, 
and settled on this one as causing the least overall problems.
The big advantage is that replies go to the original sender by default 
rather than to the list (which reduces the amount of personal mail going
to the list, winning both on noise-reduction and embarassment-reduction);
the disadvantage is that bouncemail goes to the original sender, rather
than the list or the list-manager (bouncemail to the sender is annoying, 
but minor; bouncemail to the list is extremely annoying, as well as 
potentially causing mail loops, which are an extreme lossage.  Bouncemail
to the list-manager is ideal (not that the list-manager usually reads it),
but it's hard to get without reducing replies directly to originators,
as well as increasing replies accidentally going to the list-manager.
