I wonder what exactly the FCC means by the term "Internet Phone."  Does this
just mean that software like IPhone will be regulated, or will this also apply
to RealAudio and sending uuencoded .WAV files through e-mail.  Also, will
this regulation apply to video and audio software like CuSeeMe and Mbone
software?
