C'punk,

That's L25, not 25L.  I though Phil was a UK "subject," thus
I proposed a wager of 25 Pounds Sterling.  Clear enough?

If Phil wants to do it all in US dollars then I will bet US$50
against his US$45.

Yes, I know how it is when the mayors of cities with major league
ball clubs in the World Series make public wagers on the outcome 
of the game--hard time in Levenworth.

If Phil really believes he and I are at any credible legal risk 
for a making such a personal wager, he is a fool.  If he really
knows better (my best guess), then he is intellectually dishonest 
and a moral coward.

I again invite Phil to put up or shut up.
