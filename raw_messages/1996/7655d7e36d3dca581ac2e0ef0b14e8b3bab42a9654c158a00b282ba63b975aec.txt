Black Unicorn <unicorn@schloss.li> comments on the responsiblity
of prudent persons (in, I presume, the context of threating e-mail
sent through an anonymous remailier).

I'm still perplexed: what can a "prudent" remailer operator do if a
threatening e-mail was sent through a remailer under one or more of
the following conditions:

-- The remailer operator is legally enjoined from reading messages
   transversing his system. (For example, the remailer is subject to
   data privacy laws.)

-- The message was encrypted using the intended recipient's public key.
   (This means that, without access to the private key, the operator
   has no mechanism to examine the e-mail.)

Confused in Cupertino.
