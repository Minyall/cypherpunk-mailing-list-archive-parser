Stay with one nym long enough and the opposite may become true.  I've used
this nym for so long -- though not in these circles -- that I elected to
associate my true name with it.  The nym had far more built-up repuation
that my true name ever would.  (Of course, that's all meaningless here.)

Besides, I *like* the nym.  There is that psychological component of playing
with an alter-ego.  A lot can be said and done behind the veil of a nym that
might not be otherwise.  While many see this a threatening condition I have
always viewed it as an advantage.  Furthermore, it is a somewhat ironic
avenue to truth.  Politeness is not always conducive to getting to the heart
of an issue; nyms have little need for politeness or sugarcoating.

And I would assume another nym in such a circumstance.
