Ah.  Then we are in agreement here.  My "Rule" in the House
Rules etc. simply stated the obvious fact, for the benefit of 
those who need it stated, of Gilmore's sole authority over the 
physical substrate.  I vaguely recall some subscribers implying
or stating otherwise during the vanish Vulis fracas.  It would
not at all surprise me if some people disagreed with this
simple premise--  they habitually do so with regard to "public"
establishments like bars and restaurants, and it isn't much of
a stretch to start thinking of cypherpunks as a similarly
"public" institution.
