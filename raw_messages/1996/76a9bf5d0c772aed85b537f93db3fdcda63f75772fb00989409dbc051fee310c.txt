How does this idea sound: a forwarding service/remailer that accepts 
encrypted and forwards it to someone else (specified in the message), 
encrypting the message to that person.

Such a service can be set up at a site with *lots* of keys given to 
it.  This way if one wants to spontaneously send a message to someone 
that she doesn't have a key for, she can use the service.  (Perhaps 
the service would only accept or forward mail from/to people who 
submitted their keys, and possibly eca$h... it could also bounce 
messages back, re-encrypted, if there's a failure...)

This could be used like anonymous remailers to foil traffic analysis, 
but also for people who, in certain situations, don't want/need 
anonymitiy with the person they are corresponding with, and who don't 
necessarily have keys handy.

Comments?

Rob.
