Just in case you start to feel sympathetic towards the government, the
upside-down cross is *not* the premier symbol of real satanic worship.

I got it from the horse's mouth, so to speak:  The most supreme symbol
of satanic worship is an upside-down five-pointed star (symbolizing
the goat's head) with a circle around it.

User's of this symbol include:  Freemasons (on city signboards, bumper
stickers, etc.) for one, and the U.S. Congressional Medal of Honor for
another.  These are *serious* people, so tread carefully.
