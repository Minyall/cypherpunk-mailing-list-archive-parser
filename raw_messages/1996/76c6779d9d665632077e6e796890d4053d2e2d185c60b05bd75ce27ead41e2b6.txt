I would use it to show the judge that she is obstructing and concealing her 
conduct and motion for all manner of annoying and intrusive discovery 
procedures as well as use it to show malice of intent.  Because I asked 
'nicely' the first time, her conduct is that much more offensive in that 
she merely used my good faith as a delay to more effectively conceal her 
conduct.  It doesn't take much creativity to get really obnoxious.  
Judges get sympathetic to this kind of thing to.  Paint the picture.  
Plaintiff tries to avoid litigation, sends correspondence, but defendant 
forces plaintiff's hand.

This all assumes it ever gets to court, but Co$ is quick to sue.

I'm just pointing out that she just gave them more ammo, and, I might 
add, that it will be sitting on an archive for quite awhile.
