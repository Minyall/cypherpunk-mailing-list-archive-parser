Wrong. It also costs your TIME. Junk e-mail takes TIME to recognize and
delete. TIME (even Tim's time) costs more than 42c.

I had an interesting conversation with a New York Daily News telemarketer
a while ago. (Note that 1) I speak with a noteceable accent, 2) NYDN is a
left-wing tabloid, generally marketed toward blue-collar/minorities.)

RRing.
DLV: Hello?
NYDN: blah blah would you like to subscribe to New York Daily News?
DLV: No thank you, I don't read your newspaper.
NYDN: Well, you could at least look at the pictures <click>.
(Hung up on me before I did. :-)
A few minutes later:
RRing.
DLV: Hello?
NYDN: blah blah would you like to subscribe to New York Daily News?
DLV: Someone just called a few minutes ago and I said I wasn't interested.
 Please don't call this number anymore.
NYDN: I call every number in the exchange. We don't use a list for this.
 We don't do blocking.
(Fortunately, they haven't called me since.)

As you yourself point out, their charging you for each incoming call during
business hours is unacceptable. Why don't they bill the 42c / minute to
whomever is calling YOU, as they do with LD and 900 numbers?
