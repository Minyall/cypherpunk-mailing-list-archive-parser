Though not a new issue, this reminds me of some hypothetical issues:

* No records are kept of book purchases, of course, and Joe Blow can simply
plunk down $49 (plus tax), never register the software (if such a thing is
even asked for), and take it with him to some foreign country and make tens
of thousands of copies.

(Obviously possible with net-borne releases as well, but the book + cash
makes the example very easy to understand.)

* If the "Not for Export" label is removed, how will Customs ever detect
export? (Not that U.S. Customs checks outgoing luggage very often...as we
have discussed, nearly none of us have ever been inspected on the way of
the country, and very rarely on the way back in.)

* What if I buy the book, remove the label, and sell it to someone else?
Can he then be prosecuted for exporting that which he had no idea was "Not
for Export"?

(Ignorance of the law is no excuse, and all.)

* If this book can be printed and sold with a "Not for Export" sticker,
maybe we'll see a version of Schneier with a similar CD-ROM in it, also
marked "Not for Export."
