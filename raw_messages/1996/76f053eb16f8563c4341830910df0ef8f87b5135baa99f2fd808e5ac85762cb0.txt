   Bzzt, wrong anser. Thanks for playing.  A state and it's political 
subdivisions does have the power to enact an ordinance DEFINING what 
constitutes a public nuisance. They need merely protect 
constitutionally-protected rights.


The City of Seattle may not define the act of disseminating anonymous 
pamphlets as a nuisance. They may define the act of dissemination by 
throwing them out the window of a moving vehicle, as a nuisance.

YOu are disconnected from reality. I am not going to waste further 
keystrokes on this topic. My side already controls the electoral college 
on this one. It's not my problem.
