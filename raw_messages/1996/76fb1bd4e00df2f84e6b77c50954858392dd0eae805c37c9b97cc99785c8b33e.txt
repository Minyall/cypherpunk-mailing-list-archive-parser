With a tightly focused beam (light is easy, I don't know about lower
frequencies), you can prevent interception except by very obvious physical
devices.  (e.g. Someone in a cherry picker truck.)  You may be able to
avoid the need to encrypt the link (and all the paranoia about key
management, advances in factoring etc. that that implies.)
