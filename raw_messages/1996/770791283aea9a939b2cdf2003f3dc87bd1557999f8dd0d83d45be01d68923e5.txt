Signed Diffie-Hellman key exchanges have the property known as
"Perfect Forward Secrecy". Even if the opponent gets your public keys
it still will not decrypt any traffic for him at all -- it just lets
him pretend to be you. Thats one reason why protocols like Photuris
and Oakley use the technique.
