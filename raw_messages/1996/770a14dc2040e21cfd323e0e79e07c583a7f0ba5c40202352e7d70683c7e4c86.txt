I found it interesting that the "explanation" web page,
	http://xxx.lanl.gov/RobotsBeware.html
contains an image of StarTrek's "Data." Since this likely to be
a copyrighted image, I certainly hope that xxx.lanl.gov has a license
from the StarTrek organization for republication.

It would be a terrible thing indeed if such a well-respected government
organization were to violate the law.

Cheers.
