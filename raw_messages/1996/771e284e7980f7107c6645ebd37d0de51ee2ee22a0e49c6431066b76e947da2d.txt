        Oh, come on, Dale. loosen up and recognize satire when you see it.

        satire is a far cry from sarcasm, and although it may appear to 
    have a victim, it is more of a social comment in general.

        good sarcasm can even tell stories which are bald faced lies and 
    still not be dishonest --caveat emptor.

  I'll get a life when it is proven
    and substantiated to be better
      than what I am currently experiencing.
