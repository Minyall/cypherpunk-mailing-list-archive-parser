   "Click here to become an International Arms Trafficker"

Offshore Information Services Ltd. has set up a web page to make it really
easy for people to become International Arms Traffickers.  All they have to
do is fill in their name and email address and then click.  Check out:

   http://online.offshore.com.ai/arms-trafficker/

If you think this is half as funny as I do, please make a link from
one of your pages to this one.
