The domain in the server's certificate will not match the domain on the url,
i.e. the certificate will say www.eve.com and the url will be
www.megafoobarcorp.com.  Netscape does and should complain about this,
and that particular warning cannot be turned off.  Now it is quite possible
that the user will ignore the warning or not fully understand it, and 
proceed, but if the user pays attention to those sort of warnings, the
switch will be detected.

Now maybe if you got a certificate for a very similar domain name, the user
might be more likely to ignore the warning.

   Ken Thompson has an automobile which he helped design.  Unlike most
   automobiles, it has neither speedometer, nor gas gage, nor any of the
   numerous idiot lights which plague the modern driver.  Rather, if the
   driver makes any mistake, a giant "?" lights up in the center of the
   dashboard.  "The experienced driver", he says, "will usually know
   what's wrong."
