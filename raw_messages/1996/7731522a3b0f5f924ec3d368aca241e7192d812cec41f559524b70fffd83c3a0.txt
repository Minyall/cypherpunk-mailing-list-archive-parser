"Parents effectively lose their right to direct the upbringing of their
children when they drop them off at school, according to one federal
court judge.  Earlier this year, Judge Melinda Harmon, appointed by
President Bush, ruled that Katy Independent School District in TX did
not violate parents' rights by allowing Child Protective Services to interrogate a student without notifying his parents, nor by instructing him
to lie to his parents about the incident."
