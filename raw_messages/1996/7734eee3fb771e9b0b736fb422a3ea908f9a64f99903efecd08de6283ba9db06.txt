Illinois already has such a law, in fact you must have an SSN to  
even get a DL.  Fortunately, the law allows a citizen-unit to choose  
if they want their SSN on their DL (imagine that, a choice!) - the  
flip side is that you have to specifically ask them not to print  
them - they won't ask you.

One would hope that CA's law might provide a similar out...
