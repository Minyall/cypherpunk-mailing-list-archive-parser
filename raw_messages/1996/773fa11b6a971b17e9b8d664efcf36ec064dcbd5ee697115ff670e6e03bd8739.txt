You don't have to falsely identify yourself to do spam canceling -
in addition to the header saying
        From: Spammer <president@whitehouse.gov>
you can put in a header with your real name
        Really-From: Mario Greymist <mario@luigi.com>
or put your real name in the body, or a nym you use (e.g. Cancelpoodle)
with an explanation that you're cancelling the spam posted by the
spammer.

>>Spamming aside, this strikes at my privacy and choice of anonymity. 
Well, of course - it's an offensively bogus law for a variety of reasons :-)
