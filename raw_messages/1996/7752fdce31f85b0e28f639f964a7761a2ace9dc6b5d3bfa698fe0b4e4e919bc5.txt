By the way, this is a wonderful story to tell about the stupidity of
government, but, alas, most of it is urban legend. The Tennessee or
Kentucky (I forget which) state legislature did not actually pass such a
law....it was merely _proposed_ by some particular legislator, and then
never acted upon.

(I suspect an Alta Vista search might turn something up on this.)

As to the Texas court order...all sorts of restrictions are often imposed
in divorce custody cases (which this is). Sometimes it's that a child shall
not be exposed to second-hand smoke from one of the spouses (this has
happened here in California, such restrictions, that is), sometimes it's
other things.

Enforcement is by testimony of the child and reporting of violations to the
court. Child Protective Services probably has no involvement.
