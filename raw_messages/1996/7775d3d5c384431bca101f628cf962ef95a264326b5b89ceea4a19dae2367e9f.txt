In the last Indian war (the Modoc war), the Indian leaders were hanged as
common criminals when the war was over.  The current law allows small sins
on the reservation.  I suspect that if you tried to sell porn from a
reservation or thru the mail you would find out the limits of Indian
nationhood.
