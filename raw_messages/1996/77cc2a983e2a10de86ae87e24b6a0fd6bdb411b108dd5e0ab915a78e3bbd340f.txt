This was not intended to suggest how "you" might behave, I don't
know you that well, it would have been less confusing for me to
have used the pronoun "one."

There are surely alternatives to the extremes of unilateral
disarmament and an arms race? For instance, slowing down  the
race? More often than not, it is the US that has upped the ante.
They consistently had more nuclear warheads than the Soviet
Union, new technologies that disrupted the status quo came
generally from the West.
