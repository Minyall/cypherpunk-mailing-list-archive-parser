I wake of the latest find announcement, some people maybe wondering what the
heck is this?!!

A mercenne number is of the type:

M(p) = 2**p -1 results in a prime when p is a prime.

Hopefully this will lead the way to see the pattern of prime numbers and
being able to compute prime numbers in a far more efficient manner (after all
a function that when given a prime number results in a prime number would be
quite a kicker now wouldn't it!)

The other Mersenne primes include:

2,3,5,7,13,17,19,31,127,61,89, and 107.

The numbers 67 and 257 are not primes....

Have fun in them prime number databases....
