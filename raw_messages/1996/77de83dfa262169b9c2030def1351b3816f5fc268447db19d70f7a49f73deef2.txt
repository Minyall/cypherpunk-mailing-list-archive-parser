"Scamizdat" has never used anon.penet.fi, and his (their?) identity is still
unknown.
>>If A.R.S. is archived by one of those services, than all of those 
Scamidat postings are still available. Or is the CO$  going to sue them too?
 Can they retrieve any data from the cypherpunk/mixmaster remailers?
