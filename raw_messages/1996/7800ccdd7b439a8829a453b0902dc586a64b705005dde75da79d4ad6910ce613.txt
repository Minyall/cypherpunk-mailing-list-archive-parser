I agree with Dale here...requiring PGP in order to post would probably 
deter low-level, idiot spammers, but it would also keep those people off 
the list who, for one reason or another, don't like/want/use PGP.  Also, 
what about people who post to and read the list from someplace other than 
their home computer, like school or work?  I have access to this account 
from my college, but I'm sure not going to leave my keys lying around 
my account just so I can post to a mailing list.

If you need to know how to set up a mail filter or defend against 
emailbombs, send me a message with the words "get helpfile" (without the 
" marks) in the SUBJECT: header, *NOT THE BODY OF THE MESSAGE!*  I have 
several useful FAQs and documents available.
