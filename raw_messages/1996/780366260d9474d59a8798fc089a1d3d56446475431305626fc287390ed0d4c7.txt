I have had guns, bad dreams and guests in my house all at the 
same time, many times.  So far, I've managed to avoid shooting
anyone.

Not pretty but fortunately very unlikely.  I can imagine 
everything you said except forgetting someone is in my house.  
When I have someone under the mantle of my protection, my senses 
and my awareness are *hightened* not reduced. 
 
Okay, so this is my excuse to tell my L.Neil Smith gun story.
On my way driving to the East Coast, I stopped over for a night
with Smith.  If you are familiar with his writing you might
imagine that his house is no stranger to firearms.  That night
I got up to (guess what) go to the bathroom.  On my way back
to the couch where I was sleeping, I was attacked by...
Neil's cat.  It reached out from under a table and scratched my
foot.  I was afraid he would go for my face or something once I
was asleep again, so I went to Neil's room to ask him to put the
cat someplace.  Neil, wearing nothing but his shorts and a BIG
.44 automag came out to see what I wanted.  I told him and he
put the cat in the basement.  I thanked him and said the gun
wasn't necessary as I didn't want him to shoot the cat.  His
response was, "I wasn't planning on shooting the cat."  Gulp!
And yet I live.  I'll trust a gunnie over a jackbooted ninja
any time and any place.
