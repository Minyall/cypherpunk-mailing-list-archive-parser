For what it's worth, this is what I've heard several knowledgeable lawyers
say is the case, that merely sending the crypto experts abroad is no
solution, that the entire product (or some large fraction of it) must be
foreign-originated.

The usual issue: That if a foreign-originated product even appears to be a
standard (so far, none have been), and includes strong crypto, then the NSA
and other agencies will simply change the rules. Thus, if extremely strong
crypto from "Netscape-Zurich" starts to have a significant market presense
in the U.S., then some law will be passed to restrict it.
