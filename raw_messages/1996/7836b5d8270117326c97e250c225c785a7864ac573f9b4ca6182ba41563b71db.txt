It has been this way since the advent of electronic switching, and it will
always be this way.  800/888/900 numbers get ANI, which is, basicly, the
same way 911 knows who you are.  While not exactly identical to E911, they
are strikingly similar.  I beleive that somebody else has, correctly,
suggested that if you wish to know more about this sort of thing, read the
alt.2600 FAQ.
