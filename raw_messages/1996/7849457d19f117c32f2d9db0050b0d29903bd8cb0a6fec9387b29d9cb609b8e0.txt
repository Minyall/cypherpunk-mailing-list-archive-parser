 The Houghton-Mifflin Publishing Co.. is giving books to children's 
 hospitals; how many books they give depends on how many emails they 
 receive from people around the world.  For every 25 emails they 
 receive, they give one book -- it seems like a great way to 
 help a good cause. All you have to do is mail:     share@hmco.com. 
 Hope you can spare some time to write and then let your friends know.

 Hey cypherpunks, just thought this might be of interest, forgive the 
 spam, but remember, knowledge begins with reading.  And no, don't go  
 e-mail and ask what books the Co. is donating (i.e.. gov't supportive, 
 procrypto controls etc etc) Its the Holidays, have some heart.  And 
 hey - if the number of books is related to the number of e-mails, i 
 wonder if maybe we can enlist those "i'm sorry" spammers to fill those 
 e-mail boxes <grin>.  Happy <whatever-you-happen-to-celebrate>.

 Don't confuse my views with those of the DoD or the United States Navy
