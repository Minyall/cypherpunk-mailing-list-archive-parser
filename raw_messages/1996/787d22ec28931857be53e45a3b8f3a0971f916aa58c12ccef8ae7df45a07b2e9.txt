No, you can't.  It's impossible to prove an algorithim unbreakable.
You can only say that it hasn't been broken yet, but you can't
predict the advances in cryptoanalysis.

If, in two or three years, no one's broken it then maybe it'll seem
like a reasonably-secure algorithim.  Of course when someone does break
it you'll just say "oh, that wasn't the real algorithim" like you did
last time.

Why not?  Not giving it to individuals will keep a number of people
from examining it.  If it's as secure as you say then you wouldn't
care who or how many people look at it, would you?
You could always make the demo time-limited.
