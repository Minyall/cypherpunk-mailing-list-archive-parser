 IDG: Get real.  Publish the stuff like the rest of the world does.  The
only ones who don't are just not players in the game.  If you want to try to
snow consumer-types then go ahead.  But if you want validation from the
crypto community you'll have to just publish it. 

And if you don't, and just continue the marketing fluff, then people from
this list, and others in the community, will be all over you and the
publications (lists, press, etc) with the theoretical and inferred
weaknesses of your system. 

I would say the onus is on you to put up or shut up and don't try to
orchestrate or control the parameters of the disclosure.  It's really in
your own interests, I would think.
