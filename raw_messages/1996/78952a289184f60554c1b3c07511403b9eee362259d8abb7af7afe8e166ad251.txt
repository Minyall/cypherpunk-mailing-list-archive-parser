I'm still rather amused by the terms of your bet, $50 vs 25L.
At current exchange rates 25 Lire is more like 2 cents.

I thought I had already given my 2 cents.


Given that this is a public newsgroup, and the one most
likely to be read by spooks and the FBI I would have to be 
almost as stupid as Rush to accept any bets on it. Its called
illegal interstate gambling.
