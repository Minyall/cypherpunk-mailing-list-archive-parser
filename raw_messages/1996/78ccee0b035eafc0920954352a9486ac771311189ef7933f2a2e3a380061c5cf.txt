Require it?  Of whom?  

What will all these people do the day somebody implements a new
web-like internet protocol and makes a daemon available for free
anonymous download?  There seems to be some kind of wierd idea
floating around that all we need to do is to "rate those web pages".

Anyway, I don't know what more needs to be said about a rating system
other than that it's a rating system.
