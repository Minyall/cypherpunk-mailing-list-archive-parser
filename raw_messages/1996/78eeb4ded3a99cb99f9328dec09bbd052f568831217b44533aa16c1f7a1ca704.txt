What is the frequency on the back of your pager?  Some people would like to 
monitor this type of information.

My pager delivers me selected miniaturized Reuters news stories.

I just got one that reads:

   REDWOOD CITY, CA - Netscape Communications Corp. and Verifone
   Inc. will devise a system to make electronic payments on the internet
   more secure.

Anyone know anything about this? I'm away from my normal sources of
such things (like Bloomberg terminals)...
