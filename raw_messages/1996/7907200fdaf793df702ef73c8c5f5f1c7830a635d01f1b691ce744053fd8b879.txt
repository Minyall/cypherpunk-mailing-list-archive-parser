I didn't realize that so many people would be interested in big
integer support in C++.  But since I have received several requests
already, I will just post to the whole list.

I will be setting up a small web site tonight or tomorrow, so that
anyone who desires may view the code for supporting large integers in
C++.  Do not expect bulletproof optimized code.  I will post the URL
when it is ready.
