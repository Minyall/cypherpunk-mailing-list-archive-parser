PROTECT YOUR FAMILY

My LIFECARD does exactly that.  You or any member of your famil will have
instant worldwide access to a wide range of potentially life saving medical
and personal information in case of an emergency.

SAFETY

                                  PEACE OF MIND

MYLIFECARD was the first TRUE medical emergency information card and is STILL
the state of the art.  You spend THOUSANDS
of dollars a year to protect your family's health.  You owe it to your family
to spend a few pennies a day for MYLIFECARD.
