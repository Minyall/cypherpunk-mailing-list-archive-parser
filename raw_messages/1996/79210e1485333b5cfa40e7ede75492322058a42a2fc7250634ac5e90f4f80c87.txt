In my last article, I slightly screwed up.

A signed 32 bit fixed point number, with two places of precision (less
than you need when calculating things like interest and what have you,
but lets be generous) has a maximum representation of even less than I
off the cuffed -- a mere 21,474,836.48. This is hardly sufficient for
accounting. However, floating point is even less useful.
