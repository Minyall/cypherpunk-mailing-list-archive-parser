Alright, but since quite a few people have quite a few present enemies,
the depopulation may be severe enough. The only hope is that the assassin
market will become tight.

Sorry, how is the book called?

I think that it is entirely possible. For example, consider usenet: some
groups elect to create a "government" - that is, they elect to become
moderated newsgroups. They elect moderators. For all practical 
purposes these moderators are anonymous - after all, who knows who
hides behind an email address? This anonymity does not prevent
elections. 

Another problem, as we know very well, is that cyberspace elections are
easy to rig and it is easy to create identities that do not correspond
to real-life people.

Maybe we should return to the practices of XVII century and give
cybervotes only to those who pay cybertaxes. Of course, the weight
of the vote must be equal to the amount of cybertax.

Well, let's think. What are the requirements?
