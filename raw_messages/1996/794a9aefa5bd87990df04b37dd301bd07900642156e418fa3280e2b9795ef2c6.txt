Subject: Berkeley ftp site moved again?

I've been unable to get through to ftp.csua.berkeley.edu
and www.csua.berkeley.edu for the past two days.

Does anyone know if the site (and the cpunk archives with it)
has moved or if it's just down? (I'd mail root, but what's the
point if the machine's down?)

Sorry if I've missed this being mentioned before.
