Saw Jamie(?) Gorelick, Dep. Attny Gen. on CSPAN2 talking about needs 
for key escrow. Emphasized the what if people lose their keys, or 
someone dies, or if an employee steals company secrets & encrypts 
them... rather than the usual what if terrorists use crypto line 
(though she did mention that too).

Guess they're taking a new tack to sell it to the public.  A lot of 
bunkum... (project left to the reader how these can be handled in a 
non-GAK manner).
