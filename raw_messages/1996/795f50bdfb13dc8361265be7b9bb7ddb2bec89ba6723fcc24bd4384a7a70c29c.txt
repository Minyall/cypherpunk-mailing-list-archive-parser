Were they Java, or JavaScript?  Much different.  Among other things,
JavaScript runs on Win3.1, and Netscape doesn't let you turn it off.
I've had at least one event of JavaScript crashing Netscape; the part
of the script I noticed was scrolling lots of stuff along the bottom
(Hail Eris!  All Hail Discordia!  Etc. Etc.) but maybe there was more.
