Libertarians are fucking statists, as I keep pointing out.

U.S. public school system is darwinian evolution in action. Parents who can
afford to send their kids to private schools, do so. Parents who send their
kids to public schools deserve to have their offsprings fucked up, mentally
and phsyically, to improve the species' gene pool.

There are plenty of excellent private elementary and secondary schools in the
U.S. Children who deserve better schooling (by virtue of having parents who
have better genes and are therefore economically successful) get it.
