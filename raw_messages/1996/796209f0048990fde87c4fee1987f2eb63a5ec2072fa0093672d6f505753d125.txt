Just heard from a reliable source: Mike Nelson of the White House Office
of Science and Technology Policy has moved on from the position of
civilian co-chair of the Interagency Key Escrow Alternatives committee
(I think I got that right) and will be replaced by Bruce McConnell,
deputy to Sally Katzen at OMB/OIRA.
