If I see one more ad for some dumb ass politician running for
president I'm going to puke.

<bright idea!>

Say, why not pick our own candidate?

Why not form our own Party?

The Internet party........

It would be the ultimate write in campaign.

Now all we need is a candidate who stands for free speech, personal
privacy and the right to encrypt.......

"I nominate John Perry Barlow. Who will second the nomination?"

No, I'm not kidding.....
