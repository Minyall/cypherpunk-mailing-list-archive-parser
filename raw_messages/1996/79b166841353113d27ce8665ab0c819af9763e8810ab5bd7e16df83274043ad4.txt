Note "units of the coinage's base value".  The coinage's base
value could be 0.000000007 Lira if the bank so desired.
Unfortunately since the largest EC_Amount in the API is 2^31,
you wouldn't be able to buy much with coins of that type.  :-)
It is more likely that the coinage's base value will be 0.01
U.S. Dollars or 0.0001 U.S. Dollars or something on that order.


If a need arises for a greater range of values, the Ecash(tm)
API can be easily extended by using a larger int for EC_Amount.
