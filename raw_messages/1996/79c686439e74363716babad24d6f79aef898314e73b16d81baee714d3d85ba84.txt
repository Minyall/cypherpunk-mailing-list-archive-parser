The certificate should be able to stand on its own. Anyone can already feed
arbitrary certificate data to you via the keyserver, just by submitting it to
the keyserver in the usual way. 

However, a MITM can mount some denial-of-service
attacks by removing sigs. from a cert., or substituting some certs. for
others, or stopping the delivery of some certs. If the keyserver signs
responses by default, then an ordinary active attacker (non-MITM) couldn't
do DoS at finer granularity than the scope of each signed piece.
