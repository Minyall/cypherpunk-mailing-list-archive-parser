Well, Paul, obviously you do. Otherwise why try to justify some thinly
disguised pseudo-scientific mumbo jumbo as "a commentary on the sad state of
scientific practice."

As Alan said, "I suggest you take your beliefs to talk.origins."

BTW, what DOES this have to do with crypto, or privacy, or personal
freedoms, or MORMONS for that matter?
