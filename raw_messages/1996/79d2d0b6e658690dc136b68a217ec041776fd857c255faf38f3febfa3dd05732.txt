The fact that one judge says his ruling only applies to one person is
irrelevant ; his decision can, and probably will, be used as precedent in
other cases, which is the good that it really serves in the first place.
More power to Mr. Bernstein and all, but in reality this case has almost
nothing to do with him in particular.  The real usefullness of this case
is so that other judges can see that at least one judge believes that the
law _can_ be wrong, even if only in specific cases.
