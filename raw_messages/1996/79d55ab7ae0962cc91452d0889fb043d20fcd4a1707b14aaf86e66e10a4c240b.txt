I really like this idea. How about instead of a full-scale remailer being
the final jump of the message, you have a _very_ simple remailer set up
along the lines of anon.penet.fi. No encryption, just strip off the headers
and send the message to its final destination. Sorry for being clueless in
how this works(I'm learning as fast as I can), but wouldn't this kind of
system be incredibly easy to start up and fold? You could have a host of
such final emanation points winking in and out of existence while the actual
encrypting remailers remain relatively safe.
