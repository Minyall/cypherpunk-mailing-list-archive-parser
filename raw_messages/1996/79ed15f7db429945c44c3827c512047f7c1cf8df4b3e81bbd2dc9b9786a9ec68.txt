Freedom of Speech includes freedom FROM speech.  IOW, if it starts 
infringing on your rights, then it stops.  Spam is unsolicited, 
commercial email, and it could possibly be argued that just as the 
spammer has the right to say whatever it is that he wants, we also 
have the right not to get his email.  This can also get very 
convoluted.

Besides that, it's just impolite.
