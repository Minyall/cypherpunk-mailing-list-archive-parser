I did some (very perfunctory searching in some engines and it seems that
_von_ Bernhardt is an extremely unlikely name. I did find a guy named
Rudolf Bernhardt who writes in international law, and a lawyer named
Stephen Bernhardt in Hamburg (?I forgot I already :-). It sounds like
another pseudonym.
