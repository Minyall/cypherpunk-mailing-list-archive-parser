As of today, some basic information on "Microsoft CrytoAPI" is 
available at http://www.microsoft.com/intdev/inttech/cryptapi.htm.
It looks like this page has an overview, a 25-page Programmer's 
Guide, and 5 sample apps which use the API.

In general, http://www.microsoft.com/intdev/ is the best place to 
check for any new for Internet developer-related stuff from MSFT.
