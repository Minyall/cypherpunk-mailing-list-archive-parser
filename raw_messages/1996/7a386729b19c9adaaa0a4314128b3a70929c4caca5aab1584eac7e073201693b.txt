Yep. This is the real thing. Qualcomm seems quite serious about making
sure that real encryption is widely available in the Eudora world,
without adversely affecting their ability to export Eudora itself.

I've exchanged PGP/MIME messages with the people at Qualcomm who
developed a plug-in for this API. It worked great the first try. I was
impressed. The PGP/MIME plugin is based on Apple Events communicating
with MacPGP, which isn't perfect, but it's probably the best that's
possible until either PGP 3.0 gets its act together or someone else
implements PGP message formats.
