Once lost, trade secret can never be regained.  The person(s) responsible
can be sued so they never work again :), but it's unclear if RSA can
stop anyone using unpublished trade-secret source.

At any rate, I'll stop my comparison of the distributed RC2 and the 
licensed RC2 since RSA's done it for us. :)
