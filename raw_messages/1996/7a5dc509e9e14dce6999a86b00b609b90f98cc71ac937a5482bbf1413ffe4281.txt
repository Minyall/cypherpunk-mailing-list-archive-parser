Izzat so?  So explain to me what the difference between the PICS type
ratings and security classifications is.  If something is labelled "Top
Secret" with some compartments, it means "do not deliver this to a
principal which hasn't been authorized to receive it".  If something is
labelled "Not suitable for minors", it means "do not deliver this to a
minor".  "Age of majority" is really no different than a security
clearance to receive certain information in the CDA context.

Clearly the IETF believed that the network layer was an appropriate
place for general classification when they developed IPv4.  I haven't
verified it, but I suspect that IPv6 has (or will have) an appropriate
mechanism for indicating security classification.  The identical
mechanism may be used for packet labelling, with the broad
classification indicating the distinctions between "G", "PG", "PG-13",
"R", and "NC-17", and the compartments available for such things as
"violence", "nudity", "adult language", "sexual content",
"advertising", and so forth.

Of course, putting it at the application layer is like requiring that
every driver create his own license plate and hold it out the window
while driving.
