You guys wouldn't believe what a mogolian clusterfuck Worldnet is.  When is
the physical C'punks meeting at SGI?  I'll be in the bay in a few hours and
around the EFF office and the SAFE conference at Stanford Monday.  Worldnet
software is invasive as hell.  Installations on boxes running Win95 with a 
PCI bus, plug and play BIOS and the I/O on the motherboard have IRQ's and
interupts overwritten to the point the box locks and won't even boot anymore.
Speaking of SGI, TCI, (John Malone), just bought $25,000,000.00 worth of
their boxes...
