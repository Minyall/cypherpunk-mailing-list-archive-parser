Actually, there hasn't really been any discussion on cypherpunks, which I
find a little surprising. I'd have thought that a remailer going down
because of political/legal pressure would raise more of a ruckus. People
seem jaded, but I'm not sure why.

I posted a half dozen articles to comp.org.eff.talk, more to stimulate
discussion than to argue a position. We trolled up a statement from Hal
Finney to the effect that remailers might need to be restricted in order
to save them -- which I found to be rather provocative, but nobody said
anything. Anybody?
