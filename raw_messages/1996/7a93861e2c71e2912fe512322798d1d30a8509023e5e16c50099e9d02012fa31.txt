   I'm confused. Instead of you alone getting a copy of every reply, you'd
   prefer the scenario where you get a copy of every reply, and so does 
   everyone else on the cypherpunks list, because _you_ get too much mail ?
   How does this scheme reduce the amount of email you get ?  Are you not in
   fact subscribed to cypherpunks ?

I suspect that he (like me) reads cypherpunks in News.  Here at
Caltech anyway the mailing list is gated into our NNTP news service.
This is a big improvement over having mailing list stuff in your normal
mail box.
