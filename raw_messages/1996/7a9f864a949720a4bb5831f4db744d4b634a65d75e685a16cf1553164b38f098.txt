  I'm not sure I understand what you are saying, so I will try to
re-state what we are doing.  By default for anonymous FTP we will
send the string "mozilla@" for the anon password.  This is similar
to Mosaic and Internet Explorer, which send "webuser@".  If the
user wants to send their real address, or anything else, they can
type an ftp URL that will allow them to enter the password.  I hope
to add an option so that the user can decide for themselves to send
or not send their identity.  Note that we do not currently send the HTTP
'From:' header.  Some users would like an option to turn it on.

  I would like to add a way to turn it off, but it won't happen in 2.0.

  Thanks.  I just wish I had been able to attend yesterdays cypherpunk
gathering rather than having to fix this bug.  Sigh.

  I think that there are several.  The one at CMU can be reached
at http://anonymizer.cs.cmu.edu:8080/open.html.  I thought that
Sameer had one at c2.org, but a quick look at his web site didn't
turn up anything.
