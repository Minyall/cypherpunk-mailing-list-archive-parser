I thought that DHP is mostly Canadian.  I know that Panzer deals w/ 
them & he is running from Pitt. but I think that the others are 
mostly from Canada.  I work w/ a few of them, but they are not here 
to ask about this (at the moment.  They just went out for dinner).  I 
don't think that DHP (Data Haven Project) is really an ISP per se...
