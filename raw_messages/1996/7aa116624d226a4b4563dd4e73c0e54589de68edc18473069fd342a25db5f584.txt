These days City College has a miniature version of CU's higher-rent bubble
effect.  At any rate within a few blocks of either school is rather a bit
better off than the surrounding areas.  111th is much more within CU's
sphere of influence, and prices at markets like Westside and UFM drop as
they compete for the student crowd.  That neighborhood has a pocket of
slightly more variety as well, for the same reasons.  As you walk north,
the number of liquor stores rises even as the number of businesses
drops...
