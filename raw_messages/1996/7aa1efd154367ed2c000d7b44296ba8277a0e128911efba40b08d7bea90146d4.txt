This has been true for years. On 800 numbers, the receiver gets ANI, not
CID. Check newsgroups like alt.dcom.telecom, comp.dcom.telecom, etc.:
there's always somebody talking about CID and ANI.

In the back of my mind, I remember hearing about an anonymizer for
800-number calls. Maybe at WilTel. Check the search engine of your choice.

Personally, I like Caller ID, because it gives individuals a service
that formerly only governments and corporations could get.
