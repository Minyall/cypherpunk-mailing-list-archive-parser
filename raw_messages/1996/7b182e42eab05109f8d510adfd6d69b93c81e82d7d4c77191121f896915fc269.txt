That's an _easy_ judgment to make (and i definitely have to stop 
adding anecdotes from my life in these things!), but you missed the 
point - the freedoms the Cpunks diligently try to preserve (or seem to 
want to create...) are protected _by_ the military.  who was it that 
said:       "law, without force, is impotent"  -?  

keep in mind that even "bad" laws have to be enforced.  you can scream 
all you want about "good, strong" cryptostuffs, but if the phone lines 
are slashed, the satellite links are down, the elcerticity is off and 
you've got a foreign soldier waving a .45 around -  just how are you 
going to boot up that pretty little computer and make it encode 
information for you, much less get it anywhere?  anarchy implies 
ruthlessness - you going to practice cryptostuffs from a prison cell?

was i assuming that you've read the book and/or seen the broadway 
play, "Hair"?  OHHHHH - i'm sorry - you saw the _movie!_ shame on me.

a calculated risk based on the possible consequence of an action
is better than a haphazard one based on poor judgment or ignorance

Don't confuse my views with those of the DoD or the United States Navy
