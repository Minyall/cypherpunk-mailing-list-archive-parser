Yes, but you're the one talking about bombings, mass killings, Sarin gas
attacks, and other such examples of "terrorism." You cite the presence of
these things as why the Constitution will effectively be suspended and why
neighbors will cheerfully conduct vigilante raids on their suspected
terrorists.

Crypto anarchy is not the same thing as terrorism. Calling terrorism
"crypto anarchy" does not make it so.
