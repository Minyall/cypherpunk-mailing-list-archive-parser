Nathaniel, go away.  You botha us.

Any useful information in your anouncement is already well-known.   
The rest of it is alarmist and self-serving.  There have been  
several excellent posts pointing out the flaws in your arguments.

BTW, I took a look at the FV web page.  While checking out the  
information section I had a bad flashback to one of those late night  
infomercials on "buying and selling."  Looks cut from the same  
mold.  Truly sad.

Until I actually see an advisory from CERT, I'll just have to  
assume they told FV to go take a flying leap.  I certainly hope they  
have enough integrity to ignore this.

Hmm..  Did I just hear the sound of Nathaniel Borenstein and  
*@*.fv.com being added to ZILLIONS :-) of killfiles and filter  
lists?

KLUNK

I thought I did.
