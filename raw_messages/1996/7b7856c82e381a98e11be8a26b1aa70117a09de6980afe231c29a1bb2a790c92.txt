Thanks to Steve Schear we've put a 1990 article on
eavesdropping on RS-232 cable emanations which
parallels van Eck's work on VDUs.

"The Threat of Information Theft by Reception of
Electromagnetic Radiation from RS-232 Cables"

By Peter Smulders, Dept of EE, Eindhoven University of
Technology

Smulders notes that this type of emanation can disclose
information, such as passwords, that does not appear
on VDUs. And that cable shielding does not always
prevent snooping.
