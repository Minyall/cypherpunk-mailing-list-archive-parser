Hi Dimitri,
     depends on whether the binder in the glue is sticking or just
plain simply mud, if the documents are NOT fragile antiquities and
instead are modern photocopy paper and modern photographic papers
experiment in a very small area of the doc with freon tape cleaner
(it evaporates very rapidly) to try and free the areas of stickage
try other solvents also(this is how I cleaned a stack of crypto proceedings
that had been cat peed and stuck together), hope its going better for you..

   cheers
   kelly
