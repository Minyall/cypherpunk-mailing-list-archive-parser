Or using the method someone (Duncan?) suggested a few years ago: recruit a
bunch of derelicts and winos and other such "invisibles" to apply for
Official Permissions in their own True Names, pay them off with the bottle
of Thunderbird promised them, and, voila!, one has a unique Official
Permission (policy card, for example).

Absent biometric identification or other complicated verification (such as
geographic methods...I'm dubious), I can't see how this wouldn't work.

(And I think there will be dozens of other ways to subvert the H-P/Intel
system.)
