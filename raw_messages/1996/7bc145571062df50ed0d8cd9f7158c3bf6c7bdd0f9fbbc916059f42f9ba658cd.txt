A semiparanoid thought struck me:

Maybe the NSA doesn't these extra 20K people, they just don't want them to
go out into the industry and build crypto for the outside world. So they
continue to pay them salaries and have them do nothing useful.

This would be kind of analogous to how when Russia no longer needed so many
nuclear scientists, the U.S. helped create "make work" jobs for them, just
so they wouldn't go to work for the likes of Iraq.
