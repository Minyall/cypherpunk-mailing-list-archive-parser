   4-27-96 NYT op-ed claims:

      On April 21, two Russian laser-guided missiles
      reportedly zeroed in on the cellular phone of Dzhokhar
      M. Dudayev, leader of the Chechen rebels, and killed
      him.

      According to the Russian newspaper Izvestia, Mr. Dudayev
      died while phoning an aide to King Hassan II of Morocco,
      who had been asked by President Yeltsin to help mediate
      an end to the war. Will any leader ever again be so
      gullible?
