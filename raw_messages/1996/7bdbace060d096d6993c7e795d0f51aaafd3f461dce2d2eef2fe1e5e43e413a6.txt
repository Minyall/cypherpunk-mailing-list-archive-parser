It is false that Java applications "can't" save files to disk.  Java
has no I/O facilities, exactly like C and C++ have none.  Any I/O
capability must be provided in external functions.  The applet
environment doesn't include file I/O functions, but it can be easily
added in a reasonably safe way (filesystem object only allocates a fixed
region of real disk space, applets are charged to use it, after the
"rent" is gone, the blocks are freed, etc.)

Java applications may also send checkpoint data or intermediate results
back "home", even in the current environment.
