	It also depends on the remailer being able to tell that the messages
in question came from a particular address. If the messages are encrypted with
the keys of the other remailers in the chain (as should be the case for proper
privacy, etcetera), then there's no real way to tell for many cases. About the
only exception would be recognizable spam, all being sent along the same
remailer path (notice that lots and lots of mail is being sent from an address,
and is going out to the same other remailer).

	This is a version of the final remailer blocking mail to a particular
address, at least using the possible means (see above).
