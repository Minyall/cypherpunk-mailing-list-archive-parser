Dale,

I am sorry if I sound rather harsh, but this is a typical example how
real statistical research is replaced by politicized bullshit.

How to test a null hypothesis that differences in IQ between whites
and blacks are at least partially a result of genetic differences and
are not explained by "environment" solely?

All this "environment" stuff is rather easy to test and control for: take
two groups of children -- one from one race, another from another race,
who live in essentially the same conditions. Then compare the average IQs 
and check statistical validity of your samples.

There was one study. They took a number of white adopted children and a 
number of black adopted children, and made sure that they controlled for
other conditions such as adopted parents' income, etc.

Guess what was the result of IQ tests of children?
