What the heck: I'm bored tonight...

Well, not that bored.  Don't need another 'tear snake-oil to bits or 
is this a damned troll' thread.  Why does "M. Wagoner" sound 
familiar?

Uh oh. I checked the page.  Claimed Public Key, Sigs, Error 
Correction, Compression, lots of nice stuff.   They kind of got the 
vocabulary down. Only in a fuzzy way. Hypes "INTERNET Compatible" is 
if that means anything, a "22 character public key" (no, it's not a 
type.  twenty-two character public key, in several places said that), 
proprietary algorithm, etc. etc.

Yawn,

Rob.
