Again, no argument was offered only a wager.  (Phill's respect
for my "mode of arguing" is certainly irrelevant to me as I
imagine it is to the bulk of readers of this list.)

This straw man was previously addressed.  No one but Phill has
suggested that wagers are a form of proof.  (If you can quote me
as suggesting otherwise, Phill, I'd be happy to explain to you
where you've gotten it wrong.)

Apparently, Phill has lost track of which member of his enemies
list made which statements.  I, of course, never mentioned Rush's
wealth one way or the other.

Rush is not my hero. I never said he was.  Phill should check his 
facts.

True, but without meaning to, Phill has proven quite a lot about
himself right here in front of god and everybody.  It ain't a
pretty picture is it?
