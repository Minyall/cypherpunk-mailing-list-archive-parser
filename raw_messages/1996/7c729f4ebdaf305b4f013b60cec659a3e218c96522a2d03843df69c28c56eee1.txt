1. Cypherpunks is not on usenet.

2. Faggots created and run Usenet, and there's nothing a pathetic,
   powerless little boy like you can do about it.

3. I enjoy your pathetic little displays of despair about not having
   any control over usenet.  Please keep whining to the mailing lists
   to remind us all of what a pitiful little loser you are.
