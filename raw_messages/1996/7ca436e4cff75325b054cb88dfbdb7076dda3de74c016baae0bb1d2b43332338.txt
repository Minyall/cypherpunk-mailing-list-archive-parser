If you use procmail to filter out whatever I say, then it may seem to you that
I've gone away. But that's not what the "libertarians" want - e.g. the lying
shyster from Florida, with the Harry Browne plug in his signature, wrote that
he already killfiled me, but wants me silenced so others can't read me either.

Evidently Timmy May would like very much to continue posting lies about me
and his other "enemies" on this list without our being able to refute them.

You sure come down hard on John Gilmore. :-)

You may know something that I don't know for a fact, and I would appreciate
an explanation from you:

First, John tried to ban me from the list in a sneaky manner, as befits a
small-time petty blonde bitch. He did not tell me that deleted my address
from the mailing list and instructed majordomo to "play dead" in response
to any requests from me. I just assumed that toad.com was down; it took me
a little while to figure out John's sneaky games, at which point I posted
a note about that to c-punks. Timmy May immediately posted a denial. John
Gilmore's public admission of his censorship only came days later.

Second, how do you know that I was the only person so censored? I may well
be the only person tenacious enough to stick around afterwards and to expose
John Gilmore's hypocricy and total lack of credibility, but I recall a few
incidents when other high-profile posters suddenly disappeared right in the
middle of conversation without even saying goodbye. Names like Fred Cohen,
"high crime" and David Sternlight come to mind... Did John Gilmore silence
them or others whose writings he didn't like the way to tried to silence me?

You're definitely wrong about the "announcing" bit, but I'd appreciate any
evidence that I was the "only" person censored on this list as you claim.

Yes, and how do you know how many times John Gilmore exercised his right?
I sure don't, and would like to know.
