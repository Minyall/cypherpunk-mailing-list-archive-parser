If you think the Mexican government would sit still while whatever
the rebels are called this week escalated their violence, you'd be
crazy. With the sort of stuff being suggested, the retaliation
wouldn't just get SubCommander Marcos, but the whole submarine
and the rest of the fleet ;-).

Vulnerability works both ways.
