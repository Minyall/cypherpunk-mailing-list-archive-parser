Just off the top of my head, the chips could come connected to a battery
to maintain an internal clock and be configured to stop functioning if it
is ever disconnected.  Since the life expectancy of one generation of a
cpu is so short now, limiting the life of a chip to that of a battery is
not much of a problem.  Also, if these are given away as was suggested,
the fact that a dead battery would kill your computer is no big deal.

It seems to me that this is where this scheme would be broken.  Have
intellectual property laws been (successfully) used in this way?  And even
if so, would they be enforced in all the countries where the chips might
be fabricated?
