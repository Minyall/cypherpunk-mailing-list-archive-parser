    BTW: When is this list/listserver going to convert the reply-to fields to 
         point to cypherpunks@toad.com?

Hopefully never.  It's the wrong way for a distribution list to work.

If you personally want replies to just go to the list, then you can
add a reply-to field in your message.  I prefer when people do a
standard `reply all' to reply to me and CC the recipients of my
message.  In that way, I can file messages to a list in a folder while
treating those that are explicitly specially -- I might want to see
them sooner so as to reply sooner.

The distribution list should just distribute messages.  The sender
should determine the addressing.
