I hate to butt in (and if you believe that....), but, you'll notice (as in anti-gun and
other people-protecting legislation) that it didn't accomplish much, since "Doctor" 
Vulis gets his stuff out to the list anyway.

Ironic how the list championed flooding Germany(?) with material in response to their
suppression of certain "objectionable" material, then gets into this sticky wicket.

But there's probably a logical reason for taking this "action", although it can
apparently be easily circumvented, even though many of us don't understand what
that logic could be.
