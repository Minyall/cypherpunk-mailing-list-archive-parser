1) Thanks to Phil Zimmerman the world already has "Pretty Good
   Privacy."

2) Only an idiot, much less one of the 4 Horsemen would get caught
   using GAK from KRAP.

3) As the FOIA obtained documents from the Clipper I era indicated,
   the gubmint knows the only way to make this work is to ban other
   forms of encryption.

4) That and that alone would be "The Shot Heard 'Round the Net."
