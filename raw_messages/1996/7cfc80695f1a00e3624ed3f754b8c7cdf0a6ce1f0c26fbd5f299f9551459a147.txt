I'm with Duncan and Lucky on this one. Nations with a "Privacy Ombudsman"
are almost always nations with extensive files on individuals, their
habits, and their political activities.

Having a "Privacy Ombudsman" is a bone thrown to the proles. I suspect a
police state like Singapore has such a person.

And related to the "photo I.D." discussion, most of these nations demand
that passports be left at hotel desks when checking in. (At least they did
when I spent 6 weeks travelling through Europe in 1983.) Perhaps the theory
is that this stops people from running out on their bills, though credit
cards do the same thing (*). However, the police reportedly inspect these
passports and enter them into data bases to track movements.

(* As the credit card companies increase their cooperation with law
enforcement, a la the links between FinCEN and the Big Three credit
reporters,  the passports will no longer be necessary, and the process of
tracking movements can be done just with the credit cards. Those without
credit cards...well, they'll think of something.)

Question (a la "Wired"): "When will the United States introduce an internal
passport?"

May: "2005, but they won't call it that."
