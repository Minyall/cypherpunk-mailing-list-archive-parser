Well, you can count me as the second.

I also consider myself a hard-line libertarian, and I'm not going to second
guess Truman on the use of the bomb.  His duty was to save American and
allied lives.  He had no duty whatsoever to limit the destruction that
was visited upon the japanese mainland, particularly in view of the 
fact that Japan's war against the United States of America began in an
unprovoked, suprise attack.

Japan suffered for allowing their government to run amok.  So did Germany.
Germans who were paying attention during the thirties fled their country,
and those who were unfortunate enough to be trapped, and yet still loved
freedom, became members of an anti-NAZI underground.

Japan, Germany, Italy, and other countries like Iraq, where people place
obedience to their leaders above their own moral responsiblity, will
suffer mass destruction.  Think of it as evolution in action.
