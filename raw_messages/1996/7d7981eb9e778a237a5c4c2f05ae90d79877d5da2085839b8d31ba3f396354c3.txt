You are incorrect.  Keys can always be obtained, and signatures can be
verified at any time.  But an unsigned message can _never_ be verified
as to its origin.

You may not have my key, but I still sign this message (as I have signed
all my net traffic for over 3 years).  I do this to protect the
reputation capital I've built up.

Sheesh, yourself, Nathaniel (if that _is_ your True Name).  You're
showing a real attitude here, as though your reputation alone should be
enough to convince us of your messages' validity.  A malicious attacker
would be likely to bluster this way to deflect discovery of hir ruse.
We're all nyms on the net.  And yours wears no armor.
