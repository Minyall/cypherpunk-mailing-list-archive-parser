LOL. ROTF. While the poster of the message to which you are responding may
not have read your posts, I have. Hundreds of them. Your USENET posts
routinely lead to some of the longest flame wars I have ever seen.

While starting flame wars may not be your intention, it most certainly is
often the result of your posts. Consequently, you are one of only two
people in my global USENET kill file. Not because I hate you, but because I
don't enjoy reading the endless flame fests that seem to be the inevitable
result of your posts.

Deliberate or incidental, you *are* starting flame wars.

No offense,
