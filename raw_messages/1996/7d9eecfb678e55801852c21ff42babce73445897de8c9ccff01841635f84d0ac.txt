	Hi. As you can see from the above, I've set up an Excite Live!
page up with the email address of cypherpunks@toad.com. It has top priority
on things related to cypherpunks, including technology news, political news,
international news, etcetera, plus some build-in links and searches to
appropriate places. I'd advise using the anonymizer to access the above
link (http://www.anonymizer.com:8080/http://live.excite.com/?uid=).
	-Allen
