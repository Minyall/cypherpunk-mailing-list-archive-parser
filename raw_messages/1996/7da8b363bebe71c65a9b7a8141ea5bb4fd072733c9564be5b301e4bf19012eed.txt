This somewhat misrepresents what I said, back at that Cypherpunks meeting
in 1993-4.

The Netscape "random number generator" that was the basis of the Goldberg
and Wagner attack was not even remotely a _physical_ random number
generator, as it relied on various Unix clock readings and not on any
physical sources of entropy (such as mouse tracks, Johnson noise,
radioactivity, etc.). It was a classic case of living in a state of sin.
