Per suggestions received for this project, I've added code to "pad" 8th bits in a
"7-bit" text file, i.e., to "normalize" the ratio of zero-bits and one-bits somewhat.

Bit-padding prior to encryption does not change the central imperative of the program,
which is to never change any bits in a file, since bit-padding is a separate option.

Attached are:  CCRP.H   ('C'-language header)
               CCRP.C   ('C'-language code)
               CCRP.DOC (instructions)
               CCRP.FAQ (f.a.q.)

Suggested procedure:  Start with any file; if "7-bit" ASCII, try bit-padding first.
                      Next, perform encryption at least half a dozen times, with
                      different pass-phrases.
                      To decrypt, perform all steps in reverse, per documentation.

Comments and questions are welcome.
