DSS uses SHA, which isn't affected by the Dobbertin finding. I believe that
you would have to solve the discrete logarithm problem to break DSS; this
would imply being able to break Diffie-Hellman and a number of other crypto
algorithms. (However, I'm not certain that it's been shown that breaking
DSS is equivalent to breaking discrete logarithms.)
