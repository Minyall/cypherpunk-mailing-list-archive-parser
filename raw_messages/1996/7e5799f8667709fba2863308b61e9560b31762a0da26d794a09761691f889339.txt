Amazing how people forget that Sweden is, in fact, a monarchy. The king 
doesn't exercise his absolute power of life and death over his subject - 
he has appointed that to his government.

There is no liberty in Sweden. Merely googood humour on the part of the 
Sovereign.

In the USA, we have a system that ensures that the burden of proof is on 
the accuser.
