I agree that alt.anonymous.messages is not perfect. But if you
download all articles and don't post to alt.anonymous.messages
without using a remailer, the only real threat are denial of
service attacks with cancel messages etc.

I think a DC+ net would achieve the same degree of anonymity more
efficiently. (It's not trivial to estimate the traffic caused by
a remailer net as proposed by Ian, so I may be wrong there.)
