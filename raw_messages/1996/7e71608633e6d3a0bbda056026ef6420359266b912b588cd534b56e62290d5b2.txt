      Not accusing you specifically, only really mentioning it in passing.
If I was accusing you of it, I would have said so.

     I was no expert, and I am (IMO) still a lousy marksman. I just don't
have the money to practice _at all_ so I don't keep my guns here in Chicago.

     Are you telling me that I give your kid more credit than you? There 
is a difference between knowing and caring.

    There is a difference between teaching a 6 year old proper gun saftey and 
letting the kid carry. 

     If it was you, you said that you were going to let your kid have a gun 
until he was old enough te get it himself. How do you expect him/her to 
know how to use it if you don't teach them? Would you give a kid the keys 
to a car at 16 if they have never been taught how to drive?
