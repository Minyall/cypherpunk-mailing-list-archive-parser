One of my students has written a paper that may answer some of your 
questions,  Online Stings: High Tech Entrapment or Innovative Law 
Enforcement?, by  Jeffrey D. Weinstock
http://www.law.miami.edu/~froomkin/seminar/papers/weinstock.htm

other student papers on Internet topics can be found at:

Note:  these are *student* papers.  Not everything in them is exactly right.
And no, I won't tell you their grades.
