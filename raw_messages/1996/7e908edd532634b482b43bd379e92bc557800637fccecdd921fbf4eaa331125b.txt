In the UK they now use cameras to deter speeding; the cameras are 
triggered by vehicles passing by which exceed the speed-limit, so in 
theory it's only naughty people who get photographed. Interestingly 
enough, there are far more places with camera warning signs than there 
are actual cameras; the actual cameras are moved around at random. Even 
though most of the time there isn't a camera there, almost everbody 
seemed to slow down in the marked areas; probably because there's almost 
100% chance of being caught if there is a camera there.
