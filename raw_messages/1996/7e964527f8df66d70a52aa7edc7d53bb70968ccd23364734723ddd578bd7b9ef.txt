You know, Igor...


(It has been a few months since I was hot on this idea, but
hearing about your practical PGP successes has gotten me
interested again...)


If you have a moderation bot for a Usenet group (and could it be
pressed into service as a mailing list handler I wonder?), this
would be a nice tool to start with in order to implement
full-fledged content/author ratings.  Anybody wanna hack a perl
script or two to produce/consume content/author ratings for
cypherpunks (it could surely use some!).  We can use my dormant
mailing list, c2punks@c2.net, as a parallel channel to transmit
cypherpunk (and maybe other) ratings.


Let me know.  We _could_ adopt the ridiculously simple NoCeM
protocol, or the ever-mutating public key certificates being
designed in a nearby mailing list, or some protocol of our own.
(Shouldn't be too hard to come up with an implementable, useful
protocol.)


(And of course we can mix Ecash(tm) in...)

P.S.  Look for demo in a second.
