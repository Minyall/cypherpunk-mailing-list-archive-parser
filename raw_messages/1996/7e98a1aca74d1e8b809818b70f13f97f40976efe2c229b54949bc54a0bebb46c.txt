	Markoff shouyld know better than this.  There is a long
history of business use of codes & ciphers, going back hundereds of
years, and durring the heyday of the telegraph, there were fair size
companies that created codebooks with (locally configurable)
superencipherment systems for the market.

|    Data-coding, or encryption, technology is based on 
|    mathematical formulas that rely on the immense computing

|    banks. As electronic mail and commerce have become 
|    increasingly accessible, however, the technology has become 
|    more controversial.
