The Unabomber used his intended victim's address for the return address on 
several if his mail bombs, and then used insufficient postage on them to ensure 
that they would be "returned to sender." It would seem that the same tactic 
could be used now, if packages over 16oz are "sent back."  How are we any safer 
now?
