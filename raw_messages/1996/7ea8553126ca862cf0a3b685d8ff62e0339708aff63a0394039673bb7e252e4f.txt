     As I indicated (or at least tried to) I am not satisfied with the
way that schools are run. I _don't_ think that this seperation into classes
by age is a good idea, I don't believe that self esteem is more important
than learning. 

     However I DO believe that socialization is necessary. I do believe that
the torture we all endured (and I as much or more than most) from our 
fellow students helps us later in life. If nothing else it teaches us that
our fellow "humans" are not "humane". 

     I think a more more market oriented model would be a good idea, assuming
that you mean a model designed to produce a product--well educated young 
adults--and not simply "worker factories".
