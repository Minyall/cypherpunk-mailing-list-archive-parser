Matt,

Are you honestly arguing that a system of communication
acknoledged and taught in a public school is satisfying
a 'need or desire to communicate in a private way"?

Or that Ebonics has anything to do with communicating
in the presence of a police officer?

Or that either of the above has anything to do with crypto?

If so, then I think you've said more than enough.

-j, who would like to note that nothing about my viewpoint on
Ebonics has been stated in this message.
