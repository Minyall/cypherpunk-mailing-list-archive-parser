I should clarify:  I won't use it if I don't have to, and I could make
a list of reasons if need be.  I think the requirement to use PGP could
be an excellent way to shake off a lot of subscribers/posters, many of
whom heavy users of the list would like to see go away anyway.

All I'm really pointing up is the exclusion of a class of subscribers.
