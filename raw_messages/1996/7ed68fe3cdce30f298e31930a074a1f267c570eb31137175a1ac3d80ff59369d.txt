His admission that he used the notebook.  Recovering the notebook and
finding the software.  Interviewing the Customs agent working at the time.

Considering the headaches required for airline travel today, it's not like
there aren't serious records abound.

For crying outloud, he admitted to the world that he took the software
out.  I put that in front of a jury and it looks just like the typical
stupid bragging criminal.  Any defense about "I was just kidding" or "The
message was forged" might be interesting, but it will sound like
technical-mumbo-jumbo to a jury.  Yes, it would convince >ME< that was a
reasonable doubt, but a jury is very unlikely to buy it.  Juries almost
never buy things they don't understand.  Technical talk makes them sleepy.
