There are at least two reasons for wanting payee anonymity
- general privacy
- criminal activities, e.g. ransom, where payee doesn't trust payer.

In the latter case, the facts that collaboration is required,
special software is needed, and licenses are violated are not really
a problem - the Bad Guy can give the payer the code along with the 
ransom note, and doesn't care about the license.  Traffic analysis
is a concern, but you're probably not going to collect ransom from
the same person on a regular basis, and for blackmail, you can
keep changing the payment address, and you're a bit less worried
about the payer's location being noticed than if you were collaborating
in something like tax evasion.
