    P.S. I have an alpha version of a program which may be of interest to
    technomads: it automatically executes scripts received by email from a
    remote machine and then mails back the results.  The scripts (shell
    scripts, perl scripts, or whatever) are encrypted and signed with PGP
    before being sent to provide security and prevent unauthorized users
    from executing scripts on your machine.  The program runs on unix
    systems, and submissions can be from anything that runs PGP and is able
    to send email.  See:

Does your mechanism do anything to prevent replay attacks?
