Thanks for the explanation -- in all my discussion with RSA and
explanation to our lawyers I was thinking strictly API.  Your
quote of the RSAREF license says they won't refuse anythign reasonable,
and one would be hard-pressed to say that changing keysize for something
already not exportable isn't reasonable.

I'll have to read our license when I get to work tomorrow.
