Correct. It's just a formal way of saying you're unwelcome, really. 
Shoo.

I agree with your objections, probably because you're attacking straw 
men.

Yes, this gets to my point. Private censorship tells more about the 
censor than about the censored. In this case, John acted properly, and 
his credibility has only been enhanced. You are of course free to rant 
and rave about his hypocrisy, but expecially since you'll always be able 
to post to the list, at least under a nym (the only thing he's prevented 
is your reading the list under your own name), you're only proving 
yourself to be an idiot.
