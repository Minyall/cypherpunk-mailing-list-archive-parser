	Prior publication or timestamping. Admittedly, you could have come up
with the same stuff independently (and will probably have modified some
unimportant respects so that the code is different, even if you didn't). But
that problem is there in any copyrighting/anti-plagarism scheme. For instance,
I recently had an idea on genetic algorithms (I've been researching coding
techniques for them.) I then came across a version of it in a journal, so I
have to cite that journal when I give the idea - even though I came up with it
independently.
