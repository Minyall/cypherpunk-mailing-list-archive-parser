PICS, or something like it, is the absolutely right response to calls
for true Internet censorship.  People agreeing to a language, a way
of communicating, is a good thing.

Did you object to HTML?  TCP/IP?  Other agreements that limited the way
that people communicate?

I don't think that PICS will be mandated any more than those two standards
are mandated, perhaps I'm naive, but I think that the social conventions
will work in this case.

I suppose the a better solution would have been to have many competing
private rating services, but PICS will work well, not put much load on
the net, and is transparent and simple.  I like it.
