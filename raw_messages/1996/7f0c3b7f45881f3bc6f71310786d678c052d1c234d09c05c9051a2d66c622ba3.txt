    Obviously this will depend on what type of computer(s) you are using 
among other things.  That was what I'm curious about.  Is there some type 
of rough formula where you could just plug in the different variables 
(computer speed, speed of each attempt, key length, etc.) and come up 
with some type of answer.  I was also curious to find out if anyone knew 
where he had come up with these figures.
