What the German goverement threatned to do was inexcusable, but 
something can be done about it.

The way that mail and postings are handeld, it is possible to trash 
mail and posting coming or going to a certin destination.  This is 
censorship, but maybe the members of the goverment have justified 
such an action.

If they can censor others, should others not be able to censor them?  
That's one of the beauties of the electronic age, the only thing that 
matters is intelligence, numbers or political power have negligable 
effects.

Are the german authorities worthy of such an reaction? Have they 
crossed the line?

If they have, maybe they can serve as the example of what happens 
when a group of people attempt to force their will on others.
