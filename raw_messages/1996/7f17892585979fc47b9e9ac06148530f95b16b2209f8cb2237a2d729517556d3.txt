Would it be possible to get a copy of the terms of the written
permission that I gather Netscape has received from the government?
Or is this another area where the government insists on obscurity?

(I do want to thank Netscape--and especially Tom Weinstein who tried
to give me a lot of assistance--for making the downloading possible.
On the other hand, I certainly don't think that we owe any thanks to
the government agencies that made all this rigamarole necessary.)
