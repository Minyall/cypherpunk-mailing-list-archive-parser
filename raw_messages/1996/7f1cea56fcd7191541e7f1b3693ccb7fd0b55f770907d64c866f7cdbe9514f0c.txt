You can refuse, and the service or permit applied for will be witheld. 
Not very productive.

I know of no such instance (other than some informal "fingerprint the 
kiddies for safety" schtick) where it's a do-it--yourself operation. 

While the methods listed are clever, they and many other finaglings are 
the main reason it's done in the "light of day" by a tech.

Doesn't always work. Partials can be extrapolated to yield a relative match.

Wont work. The hands are checked first for signs of tampering.

Pineapple juice and other weak acidic subtances ruin the ridges on the 
finger tips causing them to smear or not show at all. Unfortunately, this 
takes a period of time and constant handling of such items.

There may be a book or to on the subject. The local library may carry 
refernce or other materials on police, detective and forensics. You 
can also try Revolution Books in Seattle WA. They deal in the esoteric.
