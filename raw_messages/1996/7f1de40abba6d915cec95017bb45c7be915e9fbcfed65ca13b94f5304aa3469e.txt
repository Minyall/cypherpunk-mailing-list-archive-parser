You mean, the anti-scientologists aren't massively forging cancels
for scientologits' posts on alt.religion.scientology using my cancelbot?

Or the anti-scientologists haven't caused most of the problems cypherpunks
remailers face through posting CO$ copyrighted material through them?

Then how come anyone who posts to a.r.s in support of the cult gets
harrassed by your acquaintances (flamed, mailbombed, etc)?

(Note: I'm not a Co$ affiliate and have exactly as much disdain for it as
for any other cult.)
