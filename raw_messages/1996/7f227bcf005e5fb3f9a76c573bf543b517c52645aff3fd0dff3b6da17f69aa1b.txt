I haven't looked through the code very hard yet, but I do wonder how the
passphrase and such is stored. If I run losetup and setup
/root/stego_file.au as a filesystem on /dev/loop0, does that get stored
anywhere that isn't secure from non-root processes, or that is kept after
the filesystem is unmounted? I figure the passphrase definately is removed
as soon as the filesystem is unmounted, and that this is stored in
protected kernel memory.
