I just caught this show last night.  And enjoyed it.  I 
personally thought that Steve Jobs quoting Picasso with the "True 
artists steal" line in regards to copying others work for personal 
gain was interesting. 

Since I live 10 blocks away from the main MS Campus, I hear 
everything there is to hear about Bill Gates.  So, it was really 
unnecessary for me to watch the hour and a hlaf devoted strictly to 
who Bill stole what from.  **GRIN**

Having started my "prefessional" Internet career at SPRY in 1993, I 
agree that the best of the Internet is yet to come.  Bill Gates said 
in the show last night that it is almost impossible to judge where 
the market will be in a year because things are changing so fast.  
Right now everything is a buzzword.  JAVA, etc...they are all infant 
technologies that if marketed correctly could lead to the next 
revolution.

I was 2 until August of 1973.   **GRIN**  I didn't even know that the 
pictures on the TV weren't real yet.

I do wish they'd picked a better title though.
