Libertarianism means that you oppose *government* censorship -- not
that you feel obligated to listen to every idiot who comes down the
street.

In other words -- I defend to the death the right of David Sternlight
to say anything he likes. However, thats very different from feeling
that anyone is required to listen, or saying that a privately run
forum must tolerate him.
