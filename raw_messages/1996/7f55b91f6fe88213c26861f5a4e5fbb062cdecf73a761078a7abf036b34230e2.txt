It seems like it could be done by writing a plug-in that passed the
encrypted page to pgp (or had it internally) and used that to decrypt it.
The plug-in could store  the pass-phrase locally and clear when the user
disconnected.

It *might* also be possible to do this with java. I don't know enough java
to say for sure, but couldn't you build an interface that took the
encrypted data passed it though whatever and then displayed it on the local
screen. The applet could produce a viewer with a 'sigoff' button telling
the applet to forget the pass-phrase. Comments?
