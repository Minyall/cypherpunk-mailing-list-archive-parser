Somehow I don't think that would be appropriate for a Cypherpunks 
meeting.  (Not to mention the fact that it has no crypto-relevance :).  
How about you and Tim sit down and *NICELY* talk about your differences?  
It would make a nice change from your one-sided rants to the list, and 
would probably be a lot more civil, too.
