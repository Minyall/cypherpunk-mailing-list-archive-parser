Methinks, you underestimate the stupidity of the average American. :-)

Well - I definitely would not trust such a scheme and wouldn't take part in it.
I suppose if a scheme like this were actually implemented, some people would
be dumb enough to take is seriously and lose some (digital) money; therefore
someone would gain whatever money they've lost, as it happens in all zero-sum
games. However I've been talking about designing a scheme, not implementing it.
If there are students on this mailing list in need of an interesting crypto
project, this is one good idea, IMO.
