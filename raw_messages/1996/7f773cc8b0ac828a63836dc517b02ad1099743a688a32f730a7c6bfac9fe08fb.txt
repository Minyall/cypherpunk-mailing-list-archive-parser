     Please point out to me an "uninhabitated island" that meets the 
following qualifications (Necessary IMO to supporting a "country"):

     1) Is not claimed by _any_ other country. 
     2) Is always at least 1 foot above the water line (necessary IIRC
        for the UN definition of "Country")
     3) Is large enough to provide ariable land for at least 3 people. 
        So that this "Country" can be minimally self sustaining. 

    I ask this question to point out that starting ones "own country" 
is not really within the realm of possibility at this point in time, 
and I would be willing to be that if such an island were found, and
inhabitated by more than 2 people, it would promptly be claimed by another
country, the people would be run off, and the UN would back this up.
