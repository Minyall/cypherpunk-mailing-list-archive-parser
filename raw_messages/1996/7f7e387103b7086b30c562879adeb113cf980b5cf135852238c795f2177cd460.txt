Logically, it seems the best thing for the NSA to do (given the political
character of the group) is to send strong-but-not-that-strong crypto out. 
 
In other words, they would want the various offically-USA recognized
"dissidents" (as opposed to officially-USA recognized "terrorists") to have
crypto strong enough so that the various defined-as-repressive governments
cannot decrypt it while not-strong-enough to prevent NASA from reading it.
