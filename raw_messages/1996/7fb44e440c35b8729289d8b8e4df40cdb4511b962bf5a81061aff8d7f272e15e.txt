This week's c|net digital dispatch had the following top ten list.  For
number 8, did they mean DES or is the EDS something I'm not aware of.  I
figure it has to be because what does DES have to do with chat rooms?

>PLACE ON THE WEB
>
>10. Kemp would fight with Dole over who gets to
>    "quarterback" the keyboard.
>9. Oops: Gore plugged information superhighway cable
>   into White House central vacuum system.
>8. Perot's crack team of EDS hackers would get him
>   in somehow.
