While rummaging around in my cookie jar, I found this message--along with some cookies.

:Netscape HTTP Cookie File
:# http://www.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html
:# This is a generated file!  Do not edit.

Rather than bring down my system by experimenting, I thought I'd ask the list, "What happens if I delete this file?" and "What happens if I delete (edit) the cookies?"

This may have been discussed before, but until now I never checked for cookies.

Thanks for your consideration of this matter.
