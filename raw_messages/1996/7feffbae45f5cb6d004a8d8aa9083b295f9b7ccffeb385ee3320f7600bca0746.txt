I thought Alan was implying that Oil Change might be licensed by other
software vendors, and then supplied as a "service" without warnings.
For instance, one might purchase the NiftyKeen Win95 graphics editor, 
and find in a footnote on page 58 of the manual that the product will
automatically update itself unless the user explicitly refuses the 
Customer Convenience Package during installation.

In any case, I don't think it's a bad idea to point out the potential
problems -- some people just don't notice these things unless the
implications are spelled out in at least as much detail as the glowing
marketer fluff.
