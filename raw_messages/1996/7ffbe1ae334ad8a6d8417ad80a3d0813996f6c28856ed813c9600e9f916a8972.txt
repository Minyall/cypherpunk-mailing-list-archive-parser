must pass through John's house.  Every string has two ends.

By George, I think he's got it!  Yes, the machine privately 
owned by John sits in John's private home, uses electricity and
net connection paid for by John.  (other then than, I guess I
havenpt made any other demonstration that it's private.  Duh.)
