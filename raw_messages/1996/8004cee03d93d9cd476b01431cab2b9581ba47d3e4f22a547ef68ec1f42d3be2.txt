The short answer is, No.  More specifically, we constantly have
a stream of new readers sampling Cypherpunks.  Some are 
technically sophisticated; some are not.  In either case, new
readers do not have the historical perspective not to fall for
Dimitri's big lies.  Nor do they have any way of know what an
abberation his sort of behavior is on this list.  "So this is
what Cypherpunks are like," would be a sad, but understandable
misinterpretation of what we're all about.  What John did was 
appropriate.
