No, and it's not clear to me why you think my question had anything to
do with my wanting "aga" to look like a fool.  That was not my intent.
I simply question the claim by "aga" that somehow Mr. Gilmore is 
obligated to provide his services and capital to support the "public
property" that the cypherpunks list has allegedly become, as opposed
to treating it like the ephemeral by-product of software running on a
computer he owns.

I presume that you and aga already think I'm a fool, or worse, but
I don't trouble myself with understanding the fancies of inscrutable 
intellects.
