A friend of mine who's an occasional hunter, and I were watching one of 
those nature-shows, and as I recall they showed a deer escaping from some 
sort of predator.  The show's voice-over said that with the coming winter, 
the deer escaped "and would die a natural death."  My friend indignantly 
pointed out that in NATURE, getting eaten by a predator IS A NATURAL DEATH!

In a sense, for example, being in an airplane crash is "a natural death," 
because gravity is entirely natural!
