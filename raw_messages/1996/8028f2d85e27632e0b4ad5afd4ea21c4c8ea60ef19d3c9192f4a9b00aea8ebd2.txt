That question was about commercial ads, and I said "As long as I am not
mailbombed I don't care about how you post.".  I did *not* say I would
pull the plug (full exchange below).  From your other questions it looked
like there was no chance of you being a customer so I did not fully
explain. 

I have been mailbombed around a dozen times in the last year and never cut
anyone off.  Details below (I too have the exact quote)... 

Dimitri:

Vince:

First, yes, that 100 groups is off the wall.

What I meant was you can send out commercial ads and I don't care at all. 
If you get mailbombed, that is another issue.  

If mailbombed then it goes toward your traffic.  You get 100 MB/month of
traffic with a domain name, and if you go over that amount of traffic the
cost is $1/MB.  If you have prepaid by check, and I don't know who you
are, and your account goes below $0, I would cut you off till more money
came in. 

Sorry for not explaining that.
