- From State dept about China:

It is this kind of double talk, "self-censorship", that makes
possible the US govt. to do the exact same as China's one does.

There is no such thing as "self-censorship".  Either you stick to 
your values, and then it is *not* censorship, or then you do not,
and then, it is neither.

The *only* ultimate tool of censorship is a gun.
