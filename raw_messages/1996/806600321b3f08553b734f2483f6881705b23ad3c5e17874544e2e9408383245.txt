An debatable but valid assumption.

How is a non-heap defined? 1 grain? 0 grains? If (2) is to be true, it 
can't be 0, since you assumed (1), so a non-heap must be 1 grain.

Huh? How do you draw that conclusion? (1) and (2) are not contradictory in
any way. You said 1 grain is not a heap, but >1 is. Fine. Valid way of
defining a heap/non-heap of sand. Nothing to do with (3).

Very debatable.

Rubbish. If the government removes all liberties at once, that's 
oppressive, but if they do it one at a time, it's not?

More Rubbish. Not only are your assumptions flawed, but the heap
argument and the oppression argument are entirely unrelated.

Nothing personal, mind you. :)
