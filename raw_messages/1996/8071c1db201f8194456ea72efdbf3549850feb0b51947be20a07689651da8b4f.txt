	There is another small company (used to be called Pagesat and
now called NCIT) that provides a 115.2 kb compressed (gzip) forward
error corrected feed of the entire USENET in near real time over a Ku band
satellite - not big ugly 8-10 foot dish C band, but a 1 meter VSAT style
fixed offset fed Ku dish (bigger than DSS - more the size of Primestar).
(Satellite is K2 and soon will be GE-1).

	Pagesat/NCIT markets this service primarily to medium and small
size ISPs, but it is available to individuals willing to pay $400/yr
for the service and about $600-$1000 for the hardware.
