	Scenario update:  Replace all instances of Bart's computer and internet
connections with Playboy or Penthouse (or worse - Hustler!) magazines found in
a drawer in the house.  You then discover this to be the shear and utter

	BTW...  You will also discover that the new senario is orders of
magnitude MORE likey than the former.
