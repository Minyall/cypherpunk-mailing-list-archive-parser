Very well then, Mr. May.  I did not request YOUR mail EITHER, so I demand 
that you send ME $250 for receipt of this message, and $250 for each 
additional message I receive from you.  I also demand that you send me 
$10,000 for taking up my valuable time with this message, and $5,000 for 
network access fees.

Have a nice day!

Even if you are serious about this, the fact that you signed up to a 
mailing list entitles you to all of the messages that go over this list, 
plus people's replies to your posts.  The point of my original message 
was that mail from a non-commercial individual, such as yourself or other 
people on this list is welcomed, but mail from people trying to sell me 
something is not.  Perhaps I should have made that more clear in my 
original post.
