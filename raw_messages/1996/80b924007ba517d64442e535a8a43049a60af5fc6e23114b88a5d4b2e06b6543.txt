This has been bugging me since I read it.  I'm not sure I understand the 
plan;  it only makes sense to me if "anonymous" X.509 certs are issued 
for user authentication only, not for server authentication.  Is that 
what this is about?

(If anonymous certs are issued for servers, why should such a cert be 
treated any differently than one I generate on my own, which causes 
warning screens about an unknown CA to pop up?)
