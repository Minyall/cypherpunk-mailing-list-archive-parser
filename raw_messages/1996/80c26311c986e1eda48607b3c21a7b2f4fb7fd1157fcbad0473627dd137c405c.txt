I don't think its all that uncommon....

The Options Clearing Corporation does all of their clearing in 64  
bit floats, for one.
Most market making firms (read not a huge bank, clearing risk of  
less than say 50 mil) tend to do their accounting (both in house,  
and inventory (derivative instrument inventory) )in packages written  
in dos which mostly do 32 bit floats -
Swiss Bank/O'connor, NationsBank/CRT, Fannie Mae, Merril Lynch use  
NeXT's as their trading platform so you can rest assured that they  
are using 64's

The Federal Reserve Bank, European Ecomonic Community, England,  
France, Germany, Japan, Canada, etc store their historical data in a  
time series database called FAME, which does 64 bit representation  
of floating point data....

Once you get down into the 10000th's of a us penny it really  
doesn't matter anymore...
