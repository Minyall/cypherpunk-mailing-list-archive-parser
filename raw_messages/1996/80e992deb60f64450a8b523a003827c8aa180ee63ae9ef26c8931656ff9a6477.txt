-     However, I suspect that the ideal would be like cryptography:
- Assume the enemy knows everything about your system but the keys.
- Thus, your gifs need to look like normal gifs in the lsb.  Your audio
- needs to have normal levels of hiss in it.  Etc.

    the problem with many current stego programs (jsteg/stools) is 
that given a data stream, they will tell you if there is data steg'ed 
(by the same program, of course) it in. jsteg goes out of it's way to 
hide it's content-length header, but jsteg can still detect jsteg 
headers...
