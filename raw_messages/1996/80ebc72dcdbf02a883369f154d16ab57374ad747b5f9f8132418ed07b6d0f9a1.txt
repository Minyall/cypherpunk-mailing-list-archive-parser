I didn't say I like the State. I said that there isn't, relatively 
speaking, much *political* content to the police-state that is the border.

Remember when those Sandanista sympathizers made the news, quite a number 
of years ago, for getting detained /FBI-interogated/harrassed when they 
crossed back into the USA?  It made the news because that sort of thing 
*is out of the ordinary* for the USA.

And, while I will certainly entertain the suggestion that their actions 
had a political underpinning, the Feds didn't lack for allegations of 
violation of United States Statutes to justify the harrasment.

If these  do-gooders had been doing something that comported with the 
sympathys of the (then) Administration, if they were in step with the 
Emperor's current "party line", then any such criminal violations would 
have been ignored. We all know that. So what?  Welcome to realpolitic.
