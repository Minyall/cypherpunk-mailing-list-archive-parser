Nathaniel,

I took your posting in the spirit it was intended, I think, since it was
obviously not directed at a c'punk audience. You may remember, BTW, that I
did some information-gathering on keystroke sniffers early in 94. I, too,
did not feel comfortable spreading the info too widely, however, though
now, to a select audience, it might be timely.

Thanks for pointing out a very valid set of attack parameters, BTW.

I do not doubt it for an instant. I even know some Eastern Eudopeans who
might be at it as we speak.
