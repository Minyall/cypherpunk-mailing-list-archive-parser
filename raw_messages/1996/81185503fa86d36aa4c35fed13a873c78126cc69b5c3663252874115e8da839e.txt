You tell the stated purpose, the NSA's own lawyers have told PRZ and others
(off the record, of course) that there is a domestic (and therefore a Constitutionally impermissible) purpose. Read the Bill of Rights.

Hell, they can pay Netscape anonymously. David, if you try double standards
around here any more, I will make fun of you more, EVERY TIME.

I will not stop. I note that you have the common [but not necessarily fucking]
statist flaw of needing to get in the last word in every argument, rather than
just agreeing to disagree. Chill out. For the health of the list, please try 
to tone down the volume and number of your posts to something more closely
approaching reasonable.
