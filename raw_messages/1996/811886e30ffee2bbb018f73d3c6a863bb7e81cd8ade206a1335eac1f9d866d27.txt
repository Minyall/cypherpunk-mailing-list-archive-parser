In SolidOak, the verification is more or less free of charge, as it runs
the signature code in a separate low priority thread, which often gets to
complete during network induced latencies when fetching sub-classes, which
can be initiated on class download before the code is instantiated.It also
allows multiple classes to verified with just one PKOP, so the cpu cost 
is amortised over a lot of stuff
