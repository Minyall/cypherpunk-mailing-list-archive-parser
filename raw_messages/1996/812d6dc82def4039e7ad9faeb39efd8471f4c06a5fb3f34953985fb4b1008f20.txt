I understand that some versions of MSIE support SSL level 3. SSL3 includes a
capability to switch 'cipher suites' in mid-session, or pick one at the start of the
session. One of the standard cipher suites performs authentication, but not 
encryption. This is consistant with your description.

Please ensure that the server you are connecting to is not configured for
authenticate-only. It would be a pity to raise a big ruckus over what may be
just a mis-configured server.
