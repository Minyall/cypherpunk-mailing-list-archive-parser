As you should know, blue boxes are (with some exceptions), not operable 
in the US. If you do not live in the US, they still should not work for 
you as most foreign countries use NACTS or another standard instead of 
ACTS. In the USA, blue boxes will not work under 5ESS or several other 
recent versions of the switching system as they utilize multi-band 
signalling, meaning that if you use a blue box to drop a trunk, the line 
goes dead since the signalling is on another frequency that you cannot 
hear. It is still possible to blue box, but it requires going through 
primitive switching software like step-by-step, crossbar, or 1ESS (I 
think). It is really not worth it, a red-box is a much better bet, or 
code fraud (calling, credit, or 950/PBXes), along with op-diverting.

Still, plans can be found in almost any hacker ftp site. Try ftping to 
ftp.winternet.com in the directory /user/nitehwk/phreak.

For a list of some telnettable boards, grab the alt.2600/#hack FAQ from 
the same directory. It has a few, although no really good ones (you'll 
have to find them yourself).
