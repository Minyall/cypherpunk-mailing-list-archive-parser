If someone can dig up a selection of banking protocols (some of these
things must be standardised), perhaps we can simulate the same thing
without the legal implications.

Of course you'd need the person constructing the challenge to be
trustworthy to the tune of $10k, or whatever the prize fund pans out
to be.  For that matter the NSA, or anyone else with a hardware
breaker would be able to cheat, but then they help our cause, which is
to demonstrate how weak DES is :-)

So start digging for banking protocols!  Personal contacts, web
searches, obtaining standard documents, dumpster diving, whatever it
takes.
