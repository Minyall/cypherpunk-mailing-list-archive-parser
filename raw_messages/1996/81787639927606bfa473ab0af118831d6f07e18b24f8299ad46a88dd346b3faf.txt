Exactly. Yes, it will at least have to have a config screen. It will
probably have to prompt for a passphrase on the fly, unless you want to
store it. It can ask to encrypt or not, or it can have a header in the
message. The important thing is I don't care about the user interface
of the mail program. This has been the big barrier so far.
