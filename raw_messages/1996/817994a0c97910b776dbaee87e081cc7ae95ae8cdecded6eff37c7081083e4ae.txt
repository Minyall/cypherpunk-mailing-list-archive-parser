        is that what you really meant?  pretty liberal is it not?

        this gives in to the notion that if I'm standing on the street
    corner with a friend discussing anarchistic libertarian theory,
    and the proverbial fat lady waiting to cross the street has
    her 'common sense' offended and sings...

        this is what that big government liberal philosophy (and not
    just tax and spend) --regulation, and more regulation. they have
    already 'revised' in the name of political correctness even 
    history.  

        not withstanding that 'to the victor goes the spoils and the 
    rewriting of history,' the Feds have already brainwashed the last
    generation of school children, using the very element of society
    who disdained the government --the 60s liberal.

        I dunno, declan,  I did not really perceive you as a brain-
    washed, brain dead liberal.  if what you stated above is true, it
    is totally opposite to your stand on freedom of speech and the
    CDA.

        care to mitigate that statement or defend it in terms of free
    speech?
