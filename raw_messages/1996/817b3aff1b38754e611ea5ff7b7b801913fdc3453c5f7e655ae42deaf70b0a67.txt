When I met with the head of payment systems for the German federal bank
late last year, he seemed pretty with it and knowledgable about the
relevant issues.

At the risk of providing redundant information, the Deutsche Bank is a
commercial bank that has nothing to do with the Deutsche Bundesbank,
which is the central bank.

Personally, I don't think too much should be read into the
announcement. It contains no fundamentally new information and is
simply a public articulation of on otherwise obvious state of affairs.
(Or did anyone really think that the central banks weren't paying close
attention to these goings on?)
