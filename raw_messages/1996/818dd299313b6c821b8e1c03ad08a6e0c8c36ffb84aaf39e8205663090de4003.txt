  I don't really know any details about this deal, but it looks like
they are just using our normal software (Navigator, HTTP server, NNTP
server, etc.)  I don't know how many of compuserve's customers are
outside the US & Canada, but any that are will be subject to normal
export restrictions (limited to 40-bit RC4).  US and Canadian
customers should be able to use US versions that have 3DES and 128-bit
RC4.
