You could also maintain a list of remailers to suggest that DO have this
feature, rig a random number generator to decide which of these the post
should be sent to, up to the number specified, if the sender doesn't
explicitly state which to send it to.
Also, if you can strip it, and flag that it has been stripped, you can
append a new one, but only to posts that you stripped them off of.
