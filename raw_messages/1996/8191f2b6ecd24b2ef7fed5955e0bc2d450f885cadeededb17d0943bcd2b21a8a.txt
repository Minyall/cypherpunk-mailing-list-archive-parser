Thanks for posting this URL Peter.  Of particular note is the heading:

> 43.       Other goods as follows:

An anonymous opinion from inside the Defence Dept holds that electronic
bits on a wire do not constitute goods, and as a result if you ship
electronically, you are not subject to the regulations.  If you ship a
CD or floppy or other physical media containing software, you violate the
regulations.

I'll add this to the SSLeay legality FAQ - standard disclaimers apply
of course, obtain professional legal advice before exporting SSLeay.
