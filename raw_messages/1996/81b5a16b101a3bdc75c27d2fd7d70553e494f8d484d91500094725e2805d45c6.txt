In 2.0, what we do is maintain a database of certificates that have
various trust attributes.  We ship this database with a number of CAs
that we feel confident in, but the user can add and delete CAs if he
wants.

When the Navigator is presented with a certificate that it can't
verify (the CA isn't in the database), the user is prompted as to
whether or not to trust the site and whether to trust it permanently, or
just for this session.

The Navigator can also download certificates as one of the following
mime types:

application/x-x509-ca-cert
application/x-x509-server-cert
application/x-x509-user-cert

When the Navigator sees one of these, it presents the user with a
series of dialog boxes that take him through the process of approving
the certificate and adding it to the database.
