The easiest and fastest solution is to set up toad.com to charge a
dollar per message.  (Proceeds to be spent by John Gilmore as he
sees fit.)

We can then leverage off the existing e-cash infrastructure which
already provides blinding software for free on all major platforms.

What I like about this scheme is that well-financed attackers will
be welcomed.  A spam attack just means that John can buy more sushi!

(I volunteer to modify majordomo to accept e-cash if there is enough
interest in this proposal.)
