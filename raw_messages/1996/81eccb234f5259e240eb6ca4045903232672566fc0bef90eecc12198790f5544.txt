There's no particular need for tax fraud, except by little guys. The big 
guys have lots of legal techniques. A prime example was the notorious 
$1000->$100,000 cattle futures transaction that Hillary Rodham Clinto 
did, just before entering the White House. Clearly, it wasn't an 
investment: it was a scheme to let some rich Arkansas guy pay a bribe - 
legally.  A cooperative broker sets up a "short" position and a "long" 
position on a trade - then the positions get assigned, after the market 
has made its move, such that the guy "loses" the $100k  and Hillary "has 
a profit".
