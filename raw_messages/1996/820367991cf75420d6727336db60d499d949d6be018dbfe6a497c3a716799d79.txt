It's extremely trivial to prevent someone from posting to a mailing list.  The
fact that John Gilmore has not done this probably means that he doesn't want to
rather than an inability to do the above.

Anyone can read cypherpunks and there's not much anyone can do to prevent
someone from receiving list traffic.  However, this doesn't really matter.  An
ISP that pulls the plug on a spammer doesn't try to prevent that person from
reading or posting to that newsgroup.  That person won't be able to do it
using the ISP's resources.
