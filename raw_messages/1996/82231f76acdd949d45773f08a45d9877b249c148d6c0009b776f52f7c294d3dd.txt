I've been participating in this discussion for a considerable period of time
before being attacked by Tim May for no apparent reason (other than his hatred
for Jews and for immigrants). I tried unsuccessfully to convince him off-list
that his attacks are off-topic and false (he attributed to me various bizarre
stuff that I never said). Since he insists on continuing his attacks on my
character, I will point out that he's a liar and a racist.
