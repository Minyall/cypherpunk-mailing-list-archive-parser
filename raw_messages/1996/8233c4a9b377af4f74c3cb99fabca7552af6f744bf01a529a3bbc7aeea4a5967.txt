Note the words "marketing gimmicks".  The $100 reward isn't a gimmick
in the same way as "we'll give you our company" or "we'll give you 
five free copies of our software".  But yes, that sentence could be 
reworded differently.

Oddly enough, RSA's RC2/RC4 is also an exception to the proprietary 
algorithm warning, (some would dispute that), so that section 
needs some minor rewriting.

*sigh*

I'll work on it.
