  that pilots should consider this incident when deciding to use the code.

Actually, that is an urban legend which grew out
of a real incident. What actually happened was
that they thought the private pilot couldn't
really have been hijacked, so when he landed *he*
was arrested for creating a public nuisance or
something. It wasn't till later, when they found
the shotgun-toting druggie, that they believed
him...

Greg Travis was the pilot's name, I imagine
AltaVista might find his original posting.
