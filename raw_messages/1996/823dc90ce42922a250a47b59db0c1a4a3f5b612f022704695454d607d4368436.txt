At CFP today, we heard about a new crypto bill being introduced
tomorrow, which will be similar to Leahy's bill with the
crypto-being-used-in-furtherance-of-crime portion removed and an
explicit no-government-mandated-escrow provision added.

John Gilmore asked wonderful questions after the moot Supreme Court session.

We have put our "List of Shame" numbers on our nametags.
