pgp263ia is more recent, and has more bug fixes.  pgp263ui more recent
still, and has the same bug fixes plus some additional functionality,
minus some other functionality.

Chronologically:

mit pgp262
pgp263i
pgp263ia
pgp263ui

You won't be getting your hands on a prerelease version unless you're
one of their commercial licensors.

Sure is.  That part I think was a practical joke.  Much like
suggesting someone connect to ftp site `127.0.0.1' for kewl war3z.

Cohen was actively harrassing people (email to postmaster, employee,
etc) who so much as pinged his site, for some unfathomable reason he
viewed this as a malicious attack on the security of his machine.
