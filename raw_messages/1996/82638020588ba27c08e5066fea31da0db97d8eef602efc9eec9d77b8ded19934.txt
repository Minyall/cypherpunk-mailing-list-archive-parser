	And what's wrong with being a statist on _some_ issues? A strict party
line will do nobody any good. In other words, politics makes strange
bedfellows, such as libertarians with (non-PC) liberals on many free-speech
issues, libertarians with militia types (including the neo-Nazis) on freedom
of association, etcetera.
