Forth is close enough to Java to suffer from the same problem: the hacks you
describe don't know when they look at your bytecode what a C compiler knows
when it looks at a C program. They emit native machine language instructions
that emulate the Java machine at run time and repeatedly resolve the
references that a C compiler has resolved once at compile time.

The great Russian-Scottish poet Mikhail Yur'evich Lermotov said the following
about the likes of Ray "Arsen" Arachelian:  "Ty trus, ty rab, ry armyanin."
