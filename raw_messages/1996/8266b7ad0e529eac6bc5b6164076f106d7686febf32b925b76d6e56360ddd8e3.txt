If people break into my house with the element of surprise wearing
all black in the middle of the night, they have the element of surprise
FIRMLY on their side.. I'd have to believe that reaching for a gun
was the most stupid thing I could do in the entire world in this sort
of circumstance.

 If you don't reach for a gun, at least you have the 'chance' for
restitution on your side. If you're dead, you have no options.
