This seems to me a task of crucial importance, as I listen to the
conversations of relatively net-clueless folks. Their first reaction, upon
learning about net abuse, is to demand that abusers be tracked down and
punished. Privacy-enhancing tools make this more difficult. It seems to me
that if we're to avoid a wholescale crusade against net privacy, we _really_
need to have a credible alternative to offer: both the software and the
wetware :-) to let individuals screen out offending drek. Having canned
solutions is especially important, since many of the people most susceptible
to anti-privacy propaganda are precisely those who don't know and likely
aren't going to know how to construct their own filters.

I see this as a matter of enlightened self-interest, therefore.

I can't write code worth squat, but I can write other things. I'm starting
in on a Web-based guide to privacy tools, with screen shots and the like. If
anyone has useful info to contribute about screening out crud for novices,
write me! I need to hear from you!
