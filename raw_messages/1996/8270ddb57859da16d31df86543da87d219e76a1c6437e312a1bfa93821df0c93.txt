Since they can't bill you for LD numbers you call without reporting the
calls on your bill, they can't charge 800 (or pay 900) number owners without
reporting which numbers called them.

I suppose you could just trust them (like the UK) and not demand a list of
numbers you called and then the 800/900 businesses might do the same.  Likely?
