1. Damn! Another remailer bites the dust. I've removed ncognito from the
type2.list/pubring.mix combo on jpunix.com. The updated lists are
available by web (www.jpunix.com) and by anon FTP (ftp.jpunix.com). 

2. I wonder if we are going to see more "middleman" remailers now that the
code has been released? Anyone have any thoughts or ideas on the subject? 

3. Since remailers are dropping like flies, I've decided to bite the
bullet and wake up nymrod. I no longer have the obligations that I had in
the recent past that caused me to question running a nym server. I can now
do so with a clear, unfettered conscience. Nymrod is now awake and active,
ready to accept your nyms on nym.jpunix.com. The two names that that nym
server will answer to are: 

nymrod@nym.jpunix.com (preferred)
alias@nym.jpunix.com (to support some nym packages)
