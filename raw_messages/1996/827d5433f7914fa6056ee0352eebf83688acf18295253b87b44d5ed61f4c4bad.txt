not sure if this is the right place.
I agree with allen, about the issues of 'nym. But looking at other aspects
of these cyberangels I'm unsure how to feel. On one hand they seem resonable,
protecting only the children. "Acts bewteen consenting adults are okay" say 
they. But the protect the children was what the CDA hid under.
