Woops. Guess that I should elided the "After Austria and Germany" clause.

Ob C-punks issues, I recall that Remo Pini, one of the Swiss on the list,
was preparing a CD-ROM crypto compilation disc. He hasn't posted in some
time, so perhaps the authorities have decided that such a project was in
fact "their business."

Seriously, I hope that Remo is able to give some information on the state of
the current Swiss crypto regs.
