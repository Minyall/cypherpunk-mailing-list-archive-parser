Y'all:

Effective immediately, winsock@c2.org is down until I find a new home
for it.  The account expired today, so it is an opportune time to find
a new location.  It will probably end up at Cyberpass, as soon as I 
have time to read the User Agreement from Hell (tm).  I expect to have
it back up at a different location in less than a week.

I'd like to thank Sameer at C2NET who has hosted the WinSock Remailer
during its painful birth and childhood.  I now need time to grow the
remailer into adulthood (read Windows NT and 95), so that remailers 
can spread widely.

Regards,

Joey Grasty
WinSock Remailer Operator
