One example of a topic that most people (including very intelligent, 
"technical" people) steer clear of:

Why is it that 95-plus percent of all people stay with their parents' 
religion (more-or-less) when they grow up, instead of abandoning it, or 
finding one on their own?  Simple.  The uncountable zillions of "bytes" 
of information that go into your brain before you become more-or-less 
conscious, so controls your mind by the time you are conscious, that 
very few people can overcome this programming to any significant extent.
