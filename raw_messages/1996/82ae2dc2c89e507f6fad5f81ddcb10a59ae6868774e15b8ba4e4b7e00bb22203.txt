Hi,
	yesterday I've read about so called "magic password" in AWARD BIOS. It
was a surprise for me and I wasn't very happy that the way how to bypass
this is so easy. But nevermind, I heve two questions about it. 	First,
is there any way how to disabled "magic password" 589589 in AWARD BIOS?
	Second, does anobody know another "magic passwords" to various BIOSes? 

		Thanks for your answers!
