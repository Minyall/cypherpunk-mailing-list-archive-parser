We will probably have a guest speaker from Intel at Saturday's meeting,
talking about:
>  Common Data Security Architecture (CDSA) a security infrastructure for 
>  managing crypto, certs, trust, etc.   Netscape chose 
>  CDSA about 2 weeks ago as the security infrastructure for Netscape 
>  communicator and suitespot servers. The press release can be found at 
>      http://www.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease268.html
