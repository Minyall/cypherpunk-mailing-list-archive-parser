It may be considerably more than 100 meters if you have the ill fortune 
to get caught in one of the GPS jamming tests the Air Force is currently 
conducting. AOPA Pilot reports in their September issue that only now the 
Air Force has at least agreed to clasify their GPS-ECM (Electronic 
Countermeasures) as distance notams, meaning they'll warn pilots in advance.

Anyway, encryption has nothing to do with these ECM.
