Tim May, among others, often reminds that the list is wide open to all
comers, from whatever domain. I'm happy to see the diverse range of
domains, especially those I snoop for good alt.sex.bestiality pix, er,

Beloved IRS is still a bit touchy about snooping its vast sewer of
exon-oddities, though, so don't leave a mess when you've finished ogling
Tim's.
