Your wish is my command, but--who are they?

Actually Rich it took me a while to remember you. The Zundel affair didn't
loom large in my life (because I wasn't part of it, I guess). I assumed
you had long since moved on to more important matters.  I have no idea
whether you are a net.loon. But I am sorry if I misspelled your name in my
book, and indeed as soon as I get offline here, I'm going to do a word
search. We're making the text into pages right now, so the time is right. 

Which Donna did I misspell? Donna Hoffman?
