	"Accidentally" I would find hard to believe.  "Maliciously" is
much more likely.

	I didn't catch the original message so maybe there is more to
the matter that what appear from the one line quote.  There is a problem
right now with jerks maliciously subscribing people to lists they've never
heard of.

	I'm associated with several lists over at iss.net and I don't
know how many times we've seen Newt Gingrich subcribed to all of our lists.
I don't think its and accident and I don't think Newt is really all that
interrested in everything we offer.  A very high percentage of our
unsubscribe requests include a message saying "How did I get on this list".

	I'm also seeing some indication that this may be extending to some
of the downstream remailers and exploders.  How would one get unsubscribed
from a list if they can't even determine where they're subscribed at?

	Many mailing lists are now requiring request confirmations before
they will add or remove someone's subscription.  We're still considering
it.  It may prove to be the only viable solution to deal with the plague.
