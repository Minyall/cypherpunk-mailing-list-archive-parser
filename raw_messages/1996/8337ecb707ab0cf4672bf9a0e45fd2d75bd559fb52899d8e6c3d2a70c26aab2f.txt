	Whoops. I didn't mean to send that one to the list (re: ethics of
assasination). Sorry. I am still trying to decide on whether other discussions
of the non-Crypto aspects of Assasination Politics are appropriate; I would
appreciate mail back from Perry in response to my email to him.
	Sorry again,
