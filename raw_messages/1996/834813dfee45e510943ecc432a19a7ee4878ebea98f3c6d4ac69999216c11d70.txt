Would you count the fingerd exploit used in the Internet Worm as a data
propogating virus?  If a poorly written mail program doesn't do bounds
checking, it could conceivably allow for a Good Times-like virus.  However,
highly unlikely, since mail programs are too diverse and it would be very
doubtful that a brain-dead mail program would become very widespread.  I would
be much more worried about other non-email programs that fail to do bounds
checking (like Netscape v1.1).
