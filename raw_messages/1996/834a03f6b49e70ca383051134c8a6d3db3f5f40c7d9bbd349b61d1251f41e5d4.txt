Normally I would snip a bit to save bandwidth, but your comments, 
abreviated, would not be as effective.

My cousin is attached to one of the Ranger companies that went to 
Somalia, among other "friendly" vacation spots. He told me that just 
prior to moving out to rescue 6 men pinned down at 900 m by sniper fire, 
his CO instructed them that these snipers were muslim and considered it 
an honor to die for their religion. His last words to them were: "Tell 
them 'Go with God', then fire!"

As far as John was concerned it was a win-win situation...

...Paul

BTW, Attila, this was one of the companies Eric had to help pull out of 
the fire, created courtesy of the UN and the Pakistani CO for that 
attachment. But that's an interesting story for another time.
