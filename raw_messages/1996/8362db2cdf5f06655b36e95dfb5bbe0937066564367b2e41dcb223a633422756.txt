It's not necessarily because you are paying with $100 bills.  The IRS
requires banks and other businesses to report all cash transactions
exceeding $10,000 by means of a Currency Transaction Report (CTR).  This
is a way for the IRS to track money laundering.  There happens to be two
lines on the form asking for the number of $50 and $100 bills, but those
lines are optional.
