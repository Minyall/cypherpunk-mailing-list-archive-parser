Same in Pacific Bell land.  We get two options- "partial blocking"
which really means tht you have to use *67 to block CID to
non-800/900 numbers, and "complete blocking" which blocks CID
to non-800/900 numbers.

When I called the Pac Bell customer service droids to get my "complete"
blocking I asked them why they won't block CID to 800 numbers.
Their answer: "that's just the way it works".

Caller ID isn't for people, it's for businesses who want to
track callers.  They're willing to pay for that service, enough
to make it worth the while of the phone companies to spend many
millions on a campaign of lies (excuse me, "PR") to convince us
that we need CID for "safety".
