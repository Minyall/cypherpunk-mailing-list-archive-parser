Due to the fact that I have been threatened by the Church of Scientology
with legal action if I do not cease and desist posting encheferated
parodies of their secret scripture (per a letter I received from Cult
attorneys via Federal Express today) I am in search of OS/2 disk
encryption programs.

If you can help, please respond asap with suggestions.

Thank you,
Deana M. Holmes
