You're living in a dream world, Vladimir. There's no more going to be a
revolution about this than there was under Stalin, and for similar
reasons--when the government says the security of the State is at risk, and
the public sees explosions and deaths, they are going to go along.

All this will accomplish is ruin it for most everyone else. It reveals the
"monkeywrenchers" for the fascists they are.
