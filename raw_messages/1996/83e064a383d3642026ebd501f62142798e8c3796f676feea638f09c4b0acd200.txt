I have not been a CompuServe subscriber for years.  But I do remember how 
things worked.

It is my _assumption_ that the Usenet gateway operates by importing all 
Usenet news into the CompuServe system, at which point users can access it.

CompuServe is not location-dependant.  The network operates exactly the 
same regardless of calling location (indeed, the system doesn't even know 
where you're calling from I believe).  It is a worldwide CompuServe 
Network that people use to access it.  This network just allows dialups 
and then gets the users connected to the CompuServe computers.  The main 
computers handle all traffic.  They don't are location-independant, 
making it impossible to block access based on location.
