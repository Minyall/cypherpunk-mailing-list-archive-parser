No, he's correct; cryptanalytic schemes like those you mention rely
on statistical toeholds *in the context of a deterministic cipher
algorithm*.  For one-time pads that are "cooked" or "screened" (and
I agree that it's a silly thing to do), the toehold is much weaker,
infinitesimal in fact.

For example, suppose we take 1024-bit blocks from a physical RNG
(which we'll agree is "good", has entropy close to 1024 bits,
whatever that means).  There are 2^1024 such blocks.  Obtain one
and apply the magical test---if the block fails, toss it in the
bit bucket. Suppose, conservatively, that half the sequences fail.
The cryptanalyst now knows that the plaintext cannot be
( failed_pad xor ciphertext ) for any of the 2^1023 failed_pads.
Thus, it must be one of the other 2^1023.  This is the *only*
toehold he gets.
