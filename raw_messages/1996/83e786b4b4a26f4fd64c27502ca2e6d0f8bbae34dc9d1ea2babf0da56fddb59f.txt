Easy! Either you do not get on the net or you start your own ISP service.

It might cost money. i.e. requires work, but it is feasible.

No one, neither company nor individual, owes you to provide you with a link simply
because you *wish* it.  If it were otherwise, anybody with the ability to produce would
become slaves to the ones who don't.  Enslavement of Ables for the sole benefit of the
Not-Able.  It would be punishment for being good.

Principles must take precedence over a temporary wish.
