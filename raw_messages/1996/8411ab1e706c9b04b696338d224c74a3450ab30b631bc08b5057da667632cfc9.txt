Unfortunately the 80-20 rule is hitting the PGP development team
really hard.  We had 80% of the code done about 6 months ago, and it's
been taking a LONG time to get the other 20% up to speed.  This is a
COMPLETE re-write of the whole system, from scratch, from the bottom
up (and top down).  It was NOT a small feat, and it takes time.  As it
is I feel rushed to get it out the door.

I know that I need to make the API document available, and I'm working
to do that.  But I have to offset the time I spend coding to the time
I spend working on the API document(s) to the time I spend jumping
through hoops to make the PGPlib project happen.  The more time I
spend working on one part, the longer it takes for the other parts to
happen.

So, would you rather see a document right away, or code released
sooner?  Take your pick and let me know. :)
