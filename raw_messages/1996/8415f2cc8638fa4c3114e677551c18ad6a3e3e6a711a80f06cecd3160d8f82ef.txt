C'punks,

Friends of mine are working on projects that would call for 
C'punk types.  If anything sounds interesting, let me know and
I will pass your name (and resume) along.

1.	Design, build and maintain an ISP in Costa Rica.
	Later, you would design and program a financial
	application (I can say no more).  Knowledge of
	crypto, networks, databases, etc. required.

2.	Design, build and maintain a LAN with high
	bandwidth connection to the Internet in Hawaii.
	This would be in a high-tech, high-security
	residential enclave for wealthy telecommuting
	entrepreneurs, writers, semi-retired CEOs and
	other information professionals.

3.	Design, build and maintain an international
	Internet gambling-related service business
	probably located outside of the US (Saipan?).

In each of the above businesses, developement money is readily
available, but the principals are currently finishing up other
projects.


 S a n d y

P.S.	Bay Area C'punks can get the inside skinny from
	me at my party on Saturday.  Have YOU RSVPed yet?
