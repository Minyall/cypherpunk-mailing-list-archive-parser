Ah.  If you can exploit\\\\\\\ provide arbitrage services for these folks,
go ahead.  You'd probably need to offer them $7-8 to deal with
the difference in reputation between you and Ladbroke's, 
but assuming you can get customers and nobody breaks your legs, you do win.
One reason the market isn't more efficient is that it's only being 
played once, and the odds are pretty lopsided, since Dole really has no chance.
What's more interesting is that Ladbroke's aren't doing this themselves -
if they're not.  In a repeated game, or a closer one, the odds would probably
tend to be the same at both houses.

  Imagine if three million people voted for somebody they _knew_,
  and the politicians had to count them all.
