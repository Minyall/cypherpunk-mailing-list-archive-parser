You could easily have saved the time with a german dictionary.
Schloss means castle, or fort.  I didn't select the domain name.

Schloss was originally set up for use out of Vaduz, but plans changed and 
I returned to the D.C area.  Since I'm in the U.S. it points to mindport
now, when I move back overseas, it will follow.
