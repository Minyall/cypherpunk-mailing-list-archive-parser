If floating point is implemented properly in *both* hardware and 
software, then the claim is valid. I have seen too many instances of 
floating point support and/or emulation from people like MS and Borland 
that would scare the bejeebers out of most competent programmers

Again, exact integer artimetic derived from floating point is dependant 
on how well the floating point "behaves". Mainframes dont suffer the same 
fate as some of the uP's do.
