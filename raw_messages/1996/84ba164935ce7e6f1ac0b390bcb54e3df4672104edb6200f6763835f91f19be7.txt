This AT&T Orca or FPGA chip or whatever the name is, is it freely
available device and how easy would it be to get one? I am not sure I
understand what it is, but even in case you would have to write the code
to crack RC4 and program the chip yourself, that does not seem very hard
thing to do. What I am asking is if this cracking device would be
available to anyone with 400$ and some computer knowledge?
