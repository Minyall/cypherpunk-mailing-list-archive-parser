I'm curious if anyone knows anything about the status of the following type
I remailers.

NOT HEARD FROM IN MY JANUARY OR FEBRUARY TESTS

amnesia@chardos.connix.com

NOT HEARD FROM IN MY FEBRUARY TESTS

pamphlet@idiom.com
remail@c2.org
remailer@bi-node.zerberus.de
robo@c2.org

And as long as I'm asking questions :-), I see that some remailers
(hfinney@shell.portal.com, hal@alumni.caltech.edu, homer@rahul.net) preserve
subject lines while others do not. Is this a readily settable option? If so,
I'd like to commend it to other remailer operators. If not, I'd be
interested in getting some sense of how difficult a hack it is.
