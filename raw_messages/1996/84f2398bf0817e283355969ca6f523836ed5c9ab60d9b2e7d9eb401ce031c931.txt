The 64-bit domestic limit really has no connection to the 40-bit intl. limit.
It would be just as easy to build the intl. version of Notes with 128-bit+spy
keys, with 40 bits of truly protected key and 88 bits of espionage-enabled 
key, and then use straight 128 bits in the domestic version. They simply 
appear not to want people in the U.S. to have >64 bits of security, 
regardless of export issues.
