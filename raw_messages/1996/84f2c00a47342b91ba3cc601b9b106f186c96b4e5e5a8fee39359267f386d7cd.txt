One technical approach is described in:

"A Revocable Backup System", dabo@cs.princeton.edu (Dan Boneh) and
rjl@cs.princeton.edu (Richard J. Lipton) in The 6th USENIX Security
Symposium Proceedings.

Basically the idea is to encrypt the file on the backup (tape) and then
lose the encryption key when you want to "forget" the file.
