	Does the fence painting include plane tickets? :)

	I've been playing with Pronto, and it seems to be pretty darn
good.  I stopped using Eudora, since pronto offers the features I
want.  (Except procmail.  Hey Geoff, how about procmail support?)  I
haven't, and probably won't, delve deep into its crypto features
beyond using them; my real keys I keep on a machine with per process
memory management and at least a semblance of security.

PS: When I say procmail, I mean procmail.  I've used a lot of mail
processors, and am really impressed by procmail.  You can slap a happy
windows front end on it, but make it available to your power users.
