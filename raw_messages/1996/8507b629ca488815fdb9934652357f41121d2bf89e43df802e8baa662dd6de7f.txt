Well, clearly the goal is to "de-legitimize" non-GAK crypto for business
use.  In the Nytimes article (--sorry about the lack of URL) an official
mentions that banks and other large institutions will use "legitimate" types
of crypto while students and clever terrorists will continue to use other
types of crypto.

Notice that the issue of digital signatures and authentication has never
been adressed by government crypto policy.  A next step for the government's
cause is to begin recognizing digital signatures with the force of law
provided the signatures are made with "legitimate" (GAKked) crypto.

Signatures created with non-GAKked crypto will not be recognized by the law.
Contracts and agreements signed with non-GAKked crypto will not be
enforceable by the courts.

That is one sure way to "de-legitimize" "rogue" cryptography.

And undoubtedly IBM and other corporations who participate in the
"key-recovery" program will spend tons of money promoting there scheme.
And I suspect our tax dollars will also suppport the publicity campaign as
well as the creation of this system.
