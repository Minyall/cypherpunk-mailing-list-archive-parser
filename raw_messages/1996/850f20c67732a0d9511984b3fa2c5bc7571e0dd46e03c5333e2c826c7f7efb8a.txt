Ok then, if they're *not* antithetical, why do we need a balance?  Why
not just go ahead and maximize both?

What exactly do you consider "security" and "freedom" to mean here?  Whose
security?  Whose freedom?

I can take responsibility for ensuring that any Internet communications I
make are protected from inspection or interception by using technological
solutions.  I call that "security".  If you're interested in "security",
what are you doing to protect my freedom to use encryption and anonymous
remailer technologies?
