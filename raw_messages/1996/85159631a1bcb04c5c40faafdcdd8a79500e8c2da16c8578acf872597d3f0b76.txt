If that's true (and I don't doubt that it is) doesn't that suggest to you 
that something serious needs to be done to fix the problem?

If you say we shouldn't rock the boat because the bad guys might come, isn't 
it just possible that the REASON the "bad guys might come" is because we 
have not, in the past, adequately rocked the boat?

My impression is that it is frequently the pacifist-types who get us into 
war, because they start the process out by tolerating actions by others that 
turn into more serious actions, etc.  You know, the appeasers.  Are you an 
appeaser?

All I'm advocating is to set up a system which gives government-types a very 
stark choice: War or peace.  Then let them make that choice.  I predict they 
will choose peace.
