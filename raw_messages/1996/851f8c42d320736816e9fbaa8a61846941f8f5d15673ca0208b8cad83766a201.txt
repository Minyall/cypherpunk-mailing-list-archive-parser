I have put my 'secret' signature on work product by stegoing little things
into the text.  (A simple example would be if the first letter of each
sentence on each paragraph spelled your name).  I'm sure members of the

If this is done discretely enough and embedded "deep" enough into the
property, it is pretty reliable.
