Pardon me Jonathon, but I believe you are confusing Morton Grove
with Elk Grove. I do not have the statistics for the crime rates
there, but several friends who have moved from there insist the
crime rate has continued upwards as you mentioned. Also there are
a couple of other interesting facts.

1) The city council exempted themselves from the handgun ban.

2) The wife of the Mayor reportedly purchased a handgun the day   
after the law was enacted.
