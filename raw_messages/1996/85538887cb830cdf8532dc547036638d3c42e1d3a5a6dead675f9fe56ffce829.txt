Yes, he hit you. But the question relevant to this discussion is: would he
have hit you had you been carrying a firearm, risking not just being beat
up, but death itself? I sincerely doubt it. In fact, one could say that you
were hit *because* you didn't carry a firearm. The truth is, an armed
society is a polite society.
