I'm not sure they're doing either.  When I talked to my friends at WebTv,
I got the impression that they thought a functional browser needed to have
support for electronic commerce.  This electronic commerce needs crypto,
and if you're going to do crypto right, it has to be strong crypto.

Given that they've tried to do everything else right (and, in my opinion,
succeeded), that may be all there is to it.

I'll ask for more details next time I talk to them.
