=1EWe really have to work on cracking DES at least once -- it would

        while you have the setup, try at least three messages so the
    whiners have not claim to "...it was a lucky hit...!"

        what did the 128 key 1976 Scientific American challenge
    take in resources a few years back? it was 386s?

        meanwhile, go after the new one they are using for the govern-
    ment.  you are absolutely correct that the wind will be calm in
    their sails if it is nailed enough times --if we can get the mainstre=
am
    to publish it, and all of us not rounded up for dope, or one of the
    other easy to drop evidence attacks, to get us off the street.... 

       given the smell of the Inslaw / 'Promis' deal with its back doors =

    big enough to drive a truck in and imbedded sniffers, I'm sure DES 
    has a few...  NSA is not about to pass that up, and they wrote it.
