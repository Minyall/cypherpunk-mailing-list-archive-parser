Indeed it may not be practical to try such a program on current 
computers.  I've had thoughts for some time about an analogy where each 
person in a civilization represents a cell in a single brain, and so on, 
so perhaps AP is merely a portion of the program for this "brain".  As 
to what happens when you try to concentrate a disproportionate amount of 
the programming task into a few hands, that appears to be the situation 
we have now.
