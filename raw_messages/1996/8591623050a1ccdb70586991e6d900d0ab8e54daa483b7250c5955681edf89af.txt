Why not use  blinding for obtaining the certificate? 

Create a number up public/private key pairs, blind them, then do the
cut-and-choose thing with the security officer. He signs the blinded key,
then returns it. Unblind the remaining pubic key, and you've got a public
key with the appropriate signature on it.
