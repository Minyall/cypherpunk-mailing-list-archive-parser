Just because the company didn't break any laws doesn't mean that they aren't
going to be harassed by the government.  This is similar to the Philip
Zimmermann case.  A grand jury investigation could be carried on for as long
as the statute of limitations dictates and then the prosecutor of the case
decided at the last minute not to indict.  This is the reason that Netscape
has not yet made a browser with 128-bit encryption available on the Internet.
