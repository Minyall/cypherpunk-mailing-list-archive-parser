Possibly.

No, I'm afraid they aren't. Under the rules, if you have nonpublic
information, even if you are not a corporate officer, you are an
insider for purposes of "insider trading" and your trades are illegal.

Don't go to Tim for advice on steering clear of the SEC's enforcement
people.

Only they were covered by the rules that require registration of all
trades, you mean. You are completely confusing two uses of the word
"insider".

Follow Tim's advice and wind up in jail. I can give people specific
cases if they like.

Securities laws are extremely complex, extraordinarily broad, and
subject to extremely flexible interpretation. I would suggest not
attempting to skate a fine line near them -- the ice is very thin.
