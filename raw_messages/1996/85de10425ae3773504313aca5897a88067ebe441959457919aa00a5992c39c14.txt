Yes, I think these things are deeply intertwined. Coase's work on the
nature of corporations, for example. (Another connection is that economics
and markets are largely about "signalling mechanisms," and it can be argued
that prices are variants of Schelling points, albeit hopping around as
other market players jockey for advantage.)

Which it has, as you note. The availability of microwave dinners,
transportation to new jobs, new employment patterns, and other factors too
numerable to mention are correlated fairly strongly with a reduction in the
size of the average family.

I wouldn't go quite  _this_ far! (And it's hard to go too much further than
we have already...as you noted, increasing numbers of Westerners are
single.)

Certainly your comments are generally relevant and interesting, and
sociologists should have fun examining the economic, game-theoretic,
psychological, and other factors that are interlinked.
