Hi again :-)

Changing the from header is easy -- load netscape and change your from
addy... 

Or else you can telnet to port 25 of any given smtp server and type help
-- the rest is great fun. If memory serves, type HELO (one "l") to
introduce yourself, then declare the recipient and the sender and
finally any headers and the message. But type help -- smtp servers are
very friendly.

Later

Net.  Or brought it to the masses.  Or saved it from a certain and
early demise.  Or all of the above.
