"ONCE again the holidays and other sources of good cheer, including
a growing economy and rising stock markets, have been wrecked by
the annual Maclean's/CBC News poll. In this annual national survey,
the majority of Canadians express generally sensible views on most
issues--less government isn't so bad, a bigger role for the private
sector is good, debt reduction hasn't gone far enough, private health
care is acceptable, as are multiracial immigration ...
  
...
  
"An accompanying Maclean's story on the looming expansion of the
private sector is mostly an anti-business report that chastises
companies for layoffs and mean-spirited bottom-line thinking. The
problem, it claims, is the failure to hold companies responsible for
anything other than maximizing shareholder value, a popular theme
among statists who have run out of state.
