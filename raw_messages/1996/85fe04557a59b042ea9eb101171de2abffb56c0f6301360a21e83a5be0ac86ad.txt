I doubt it. "Cypher punks" are 100% impotent.

Did you hear the one about the woman who complained that her husband
was 300% impotent?  He used to be 100% impotent, then he broke his
finger and bit his tongue.

Homos played an important role in Hitler's rise to power. Here too,
the head cocksucker John Gilmore is pretty quiet - he just pulls the

eager supporters.
