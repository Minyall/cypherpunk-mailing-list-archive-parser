Sorry to take up bandwidth, but I swore I saw a post from someone 
outlining (for what seemed to be a class) a series of legal questions 
regarding the net.  I was almost positive it came across my 
cypherpunks folder.

If anyone remembers this, or better yet still has the post, could you 
send it or a pointer my way?  

Thanks in advance.
