It is still active.  However, there are many people who do not receive the
alt.* groups and those who do may only receive newsgroups "approved" by
the news admin.  It is much more difficult to restrict distribution of
newsgroups carried by most major news feeds.  Also, some NNTP servers may
expire alt groups faster than the other hierarchies which is very undesirable
for message pools.
