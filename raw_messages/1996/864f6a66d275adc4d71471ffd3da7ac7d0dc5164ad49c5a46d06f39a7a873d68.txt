FWIW, a very nice store in NYC called J&R (Park Row) is selling Digital
486 boxes for $600, including 16MB RAM, 540MB hd, and color monitor.
I also bought a 16MB thingie for my kid's 486 for $109.

I just got an internal 28.8Kbps modem (including fax) for $100.

Are we talking about running a remailer over a dial-up UUCP, the way Julf did?
This box runs over dial-up UUCP on 14.4K modem, with two incoming feeds.
I may be willing to run a remailer to replace anon.penet.fi - let's discuss t
(It used to have an outgoing feed to Moscow, but not anymore. :-)
