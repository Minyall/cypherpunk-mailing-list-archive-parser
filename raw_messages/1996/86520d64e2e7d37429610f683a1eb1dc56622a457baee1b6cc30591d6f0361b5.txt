I sent this individual the appropiate address copied from the new subscriber
mailings distributed by the Majordomo bot on sign up.  I also noted the
spelling error for him that has often been mentioned in this list, assuming

many posts it will take before he gets it right?  Any motions to petition
for an alias for the command minus the s?
