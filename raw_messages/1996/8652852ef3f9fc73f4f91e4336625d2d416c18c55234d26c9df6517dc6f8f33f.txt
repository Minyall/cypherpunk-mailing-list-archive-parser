Let's assume that it is an encryption device, though I agree that this
is left unclear.  This is by no means the first announcement of such a
device.  I suspect it is targeted at physical merchants, and intended
more to compete with the likes of Verifone terminals than anything else.
 I doubt that anyone's basing their business plan on the idea that
consumers will spend $100 each for a device that helps them to spend
more money, but has no other direct utility.   -- Nathaniel
