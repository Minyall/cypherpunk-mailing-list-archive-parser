GAK - An acronym coined by cryptographer Carl Ellison (presently employed
by Cybercash) which stands for Government Access to Keys.  It's a
standardized term we (we = folks who are actually interested in the study
of cryptography and the development of public policy surrounding it) use
in the face of constantly changing government terms for what (to us) 
translates to being exactly the same (unacceptable) policy (Key Escrow,
Key Recovery and the various phases of the Clipper development). 

A brief word on abuse... by calling Gilmore or anybody else a "faggot"
doesn't win me over to your cause, as is the case with many others on the
cypherpunks list.  Further, while I may not agree with Dr. Denning's
perspective on these issues, I respect her as a writer, a cryptographer,
and as a computer scientist.  I also (groan if you must)  admire her as a
woman who has maintained such a high-profile position in such a religious
debate, given that she probably gets mail like yours all the time.
