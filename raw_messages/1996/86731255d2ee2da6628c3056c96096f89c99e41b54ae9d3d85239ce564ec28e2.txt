Gee, Phill, you might want to hire a new fact-checker,

>From the latest issue I have of the Usenet Limbaugh Newsletter:

"LIMBAUGH WATCH

"July 16, 1996 - It's now 1336 days after Bill Clinton's election,
but Rush is still on the air with 650 radio affiliates (with more
than 20 million listeners weekly world-wide), 234 TV affiliates,
and a newsletter with more than 500,000 subscribers."
