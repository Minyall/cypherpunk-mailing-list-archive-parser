Well, to one who inserts "(spit)" after nearly every name he cites, and
critiques Hayek as "fucking unreadable. Shit.," I suppose Hayek must indeed
seem unreadable. Shit.

After all, Hayek rarely writes things like: "The senile Von Mises (spit)
and his Sovok Cabal plotters...."

As to "forcing" your students to read Hayek, just who is in charge? If
you're the instructor, they can choose to read what you tell them to read,
or be unprepared on the exams you give and possibly flunk the class. What
part of "Required Reading" do you or your students not understand?
