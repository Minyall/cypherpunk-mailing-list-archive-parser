Interesting proposal from Microsoft regarding digital certificates
(containing keys and a variety of other information) that can be moved from
one computer to another.

A typical marketing response viewing Navigator supports certificates and
Explorer doesn't.  If certificates really take off, that 80 to 90% of the
market that currently uses Netscape is going to be hesitant to switch over
to Explorer.

Love the name.  Aren't personal effects what are left over after they
body-bag you or what the the cops call the contents of your pockets after
you're busted...
