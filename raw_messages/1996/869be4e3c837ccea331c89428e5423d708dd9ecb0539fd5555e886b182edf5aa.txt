Hal is at http://www.portal.com/~hfinney/ .

I have a prototype PGP-encryption implementation in Java, which I was
intending to build into a remailer _client_ (I think remailers
themselves will be better written in C for performance reasons, or at
least the crypto portions); at first, for 'type I' remailers, then
perhaps for mixmaster.

The prototype, which just encrypts to a public key, has been put at
http://www.ozemail.com.au/~geoffk/pke/ .  I'd appreciate people
looking over it, particularly the random number generation.

[The prototype is actually somewhat useful. It's about as secure as
downloading PGP in binary form... ]
