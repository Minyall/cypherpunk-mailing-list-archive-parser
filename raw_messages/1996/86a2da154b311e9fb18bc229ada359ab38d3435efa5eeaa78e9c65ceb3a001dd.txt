I could spare the time too. Maybe you (and whoever else
volunteers) could DCC me some software that violates ITAR via
mIRC: We announce that this is going to happen, which channel and
when, have a virtual party for the condemned person(s), during
which we first  openly discuss what we are going to do...

I doubt they'll want to take me to court in India, but if they
do, I know lawyers who
would defend me for free.
