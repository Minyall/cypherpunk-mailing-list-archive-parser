> JUNIOR SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR / TECHNICAL SUPPORT 

My experience has been that few people flock to apply for 
jobs whose titles contain certain magic words like "junior"
or "trainee."  Such things can be embarrassing when explaining
to professional friends exactly what one does for a living. 

Since titles cost nothing, compared to real perqs like an office
with a window, expensive furniture, or sliding doors opening out
into a lush tropical garden, it behooves employers to make them
as impressive-sounding as possible.  It's sort of the high-tech
version of McDonalds' "Burger Flipper of the Month" plaque.

Might I therefore suggest some alternatives...

             DEPUTY SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR
             ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF SYSTEM ADMINISTRATION
             SENIOR TECHNICAL CONSULTANT, UNIX SERVER DIVISION
             SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR ONLINE SERVICES
             

Nothing to do with crypto, of course, but it does help to give 
the junior dorks some self-esteem.  :)
