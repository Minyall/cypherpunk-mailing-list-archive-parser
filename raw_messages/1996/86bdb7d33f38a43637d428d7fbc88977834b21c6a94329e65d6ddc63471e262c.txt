>Brain-dead segmented architecture, 64k per segment limitation
code segments, ever hear of code segments?  Data segments maybe?  Ever
actually do any 8086 assembler?  You would have liked them.  In fact,
even the MAC's O/S had them built in as I recall, just not a hardware
limitation with the 68000.  A good programmer was not limited by these.

>1-megabyte memory limitation.  The only thing that made it 
OK, I concede here... But if you actually write code instead
of pasting code together, 1MB is plenty of RAM with this
processor.  What was brain dead was the fact that IBM in it's
infinite wisdom "stole" near half of that for it's poor hardware
designs (640k-1MB range).
