If it is a crime to posses photograhic child pornograhy, and this crime is
tested in court., ,

Then is it a crime for a sightless person to posses  photograhic child
pornograhy? If so,
than this matter needs to be thought out some more. If no (by test of
court, paper is more or less
meaningless) than it is thought crime.
