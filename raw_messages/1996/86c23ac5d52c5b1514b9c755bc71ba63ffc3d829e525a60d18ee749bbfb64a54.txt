Equipment exists that can remove the microtremors associated with
stress, thus defeating voice stress analysis technology.  Modeling
someone elses voice print would seem to be of little value, if
possible at all.

However, one could use voice-synthesis software to phone in a
bomb threat.  (The cops would probably arrest Stephen Hawkings 
on the basis of the voice print.)
