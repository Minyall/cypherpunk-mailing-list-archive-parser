Wow, imagine what would happen if a bunch of "in-the-know" folks bought
a product like this under the claims to strong crypto and then found out 
they were fooled!  With charges like these a guy could get into real trouble.

I sure hope Mr. Holt isn't personally accountable.  He sounds like a
real swell guy.  It would be a shame for him to go to prison for what is
obviously his misunderstanding of what is cryptographically strong and 
what is a pitiful excuse for a product.

Of course I've never seen his product so I don't know which category it 
falls into, but it would be a shame.
