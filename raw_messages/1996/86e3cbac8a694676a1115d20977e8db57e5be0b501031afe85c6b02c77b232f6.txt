Rich sez:
: Usura just answered this on alt.privacy.anon-server. The basement
: mail2news gateway is temporarily blocking posts from c2.org until the
: alt.syntax.tactical forgers go away or can be filtered with new code.

: While I publicly whined that SOMETHING needed to be done about the problem
: (for PR reasons if nothing else), I'm disappointed that there was no
: public announcement of the downtime first. Heck, when Scientology came
: knocking, there was an 11-day window before utopia shut down... 

My fault, I didn't imagine shutting down access for c2.org would 
have a big impact. (other then that the forgeries would stop) Besides 
the block was in effect for about 12 hours and I was mearly testing 
if the code did work. (apperantly it does)

My sincere apologies if mail has been lost due to this situation.

bEST Regards,
