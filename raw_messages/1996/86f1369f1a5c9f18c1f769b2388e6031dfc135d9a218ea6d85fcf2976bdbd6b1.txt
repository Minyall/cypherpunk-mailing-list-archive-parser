	Well, as for William's calculations, my ideas have been 
confirmed. What I still think may be possible is a fast search on 
/etc/passwd for blank entries or Obvious (login name, reverse login name, 
etc) password entries, right? Still, ik think it would be fairly illegal; 
not assuming EVERYthing on the net is 100% legal...


	thanx Will
