I didn't follow this case that closely, but I'm quite certain that I read on
the net that the prosecution's witnesses dialed AA BBS _by modem_ from TN
(establishing jurisdiction) and downloaded the materials that were later found
to be offensive to TN's community standards. Snail mail may have been also
involved, but I definitely recall that letting someone in TN download the stuff
via modem was in the indictment.

IMO, this sets a precedent for the German incident.
