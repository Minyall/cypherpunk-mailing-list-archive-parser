Agreed, but does anyone have any reason to believe that these
cards cannot now (or perhaps will) be used just like regular
VISA cards for purchases in stores, restaurants, etc.?

I have two VISA debit cards in my name which can be used anywhere
VISA credit cards are accepted.  The VISA Travel Money card 
appears to be nothing more than a debit card that is tied to a
special sub-account at the issuing bank rather that the account
of a named individual.  At least where the retail establishment
has an on-line credit card terminal, the risks and protections
should be equivalent to a regular debit card. 

I'd bet dollars to donuts that the VISA Travel Money cards will
be usable just like VISA credit and debit cards within the next
2-3 years.  My guess is that they are just going slow to see
what sort of reception the Money cards get.

P.S.	Phil should realize that my offer to bet dollars
	against donuts was not a serious wager.  It will
	not be necessary, therefore, for him to come up
	with some elaborate rationale to weasle out of
	the bet.  :-)
