Kinda sad when students can't even run an alta vista search for themselves.

I get pulled away from my usual work to do 4-5 technical interviews a 
week. I always throw in a few questions that no normal person should know 
the answers to. The ones that make up bullshit lose points, but the ones 
that tell me they don't know the answer, and then tell me how they'd go 
about finding out get hired. I know I'll be able to count on them to deliver.
