And I quote:

# (6) A launch vehicle or payload shall not, by reason of the launching of
# such vehicle, be considered an export for purposes of this subchapter.
# However, for certain limited purposes (see @ 126.1 of this subchapter),
# the controls of this subchapter may apply to any sale, transfer or
# proposal to sell or transfer defense articles or defense services.
