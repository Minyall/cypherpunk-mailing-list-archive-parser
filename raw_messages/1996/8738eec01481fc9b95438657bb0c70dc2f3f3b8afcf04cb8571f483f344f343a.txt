It seems that the lib'ers on the list continue to behave in their
increasingly demagogic style. 
 
Instead of dealing with substantive criticism they charge those who
disagree with them are "censors". 
 
First Atilla charges one critic "paralax" with "not wanting to listen" when
it seems obvious that paralax is not only listening but responding. Then
Atilla concludes by giving us the code for his mail software whereby he
will not listen, thus doing the very thing he accuses others of. 
 
Second, instead of discussing the substantive issues he goes off to
denounce the various lib'ber horsemen of the "liberal media," "political
correctness," "reverse discrimination," "the dole," and "the New World
Order." 
 
I sense that both groups of lib'bers share the same methodology. 
 
The first group (Rush's "lib'bers") around people like Dworkin and other
professional "anti-rape feminists" have their Politically Correct Agenda
and Politically Correct terminology. If you disagree with it they proceed
with a stream of demagogic and vitupertive abuse, followed by another
stream of off-the-wall political attacks using words like "stalking,"
"sexual harassment," "rape," and "male patriarchal [whatever]" followed by
statements of their personal sense of "indignation" and "outrage." Then
they announce they are no longer going to listen to the very discussion
they started. 
 
Until they start another. 
 
The second group (the lib'bertarians) have their Politically Correct Agenda
and Politically Correct Language. If you disagree with them to also get a
stream of off-the-wall political attacks featuring terms like those Atilla
used. Then they, very much like the radical feminist lib'bers put their
electronic fingers in their electronic ears so they do not have to listen. 
 
These are the people who have the political agenda, the personal maturity,
and the political strategy to make the net and the world a better place? 
 
Not from what I've seen.
