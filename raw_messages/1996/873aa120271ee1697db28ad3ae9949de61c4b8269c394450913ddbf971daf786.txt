     How about an "average" NT install versus a "average" linux install? 

     Neither of my machines are all that secure, but they don't have to 
be right now. Neither has more than 5 users, all of whom I either trust 
personally, or don't know enough to do anything. On the other hand, I 
would be willing to bet that Mr. Metzger, or adamsc (sorry, I forgot your
full name) could lock a linux box down as tight as a networked NT machine.

    Hell, I'd bet 20 bucks I could. The machine wouldn't DO a whole lot,
but it would be tough to break into. (basically, don't run telnetd, ftpd,
sendmail, run sshd for incoming/outgoing connections, use a secure httpd
IF NECESSARY, NO NFS, shadow passwords etc.)

     Safe from undesired intrusion.
