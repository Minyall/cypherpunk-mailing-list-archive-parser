	Some good friends (Satanic Mainstream Reporters) who are working on
the case have certainly _said_ they were looking into it; of course, maybe
[your favorite conspiracy here] bought them out/blackmailed them/planted a
microchip in their bum/Stepfordized them/[your favorite subversion method
here]. Given (a) the intense competition among reporters and (b) the
near-impossibility of keeping secret something known by 1/2/3+ people, I
somehow kind of doubt the plane was shot down by a US ship--as one friend
put it, they'd have to sink the entire ship to keep it a secret, but it'd
be hard to keep it a secret why they sunk the ship, etc., etc. And,
frankly, I doubt the FBI/NTSB/et al. really know what happened. Though I
doubt they'd keep on mentioning the missile theory without _very_ good
reason to believe it's likely.
