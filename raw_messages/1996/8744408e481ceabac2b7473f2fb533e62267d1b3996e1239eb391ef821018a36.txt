Perhaps you could ask whoever sent you that message for their 
home phone number, address, and Visa Account number, to be  
posted to this newsletter.  After all, if they are sure this 
is a good policy, and they are not ashamed of it, then the 
individuals who authored it have nothing to hide!

If they really believe what they say, then they won't mind.
I, for one, am waiting.
