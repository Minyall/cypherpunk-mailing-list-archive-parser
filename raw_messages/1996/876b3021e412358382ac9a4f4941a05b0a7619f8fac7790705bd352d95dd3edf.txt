There is a very simple way of dealing with your long lost friend. And any 
other person not on your "free" list. If you find their email worth your 
while, you can always give them their money back. For future contact, you 
can move your friend on the "free" list.

Frankly, I don't think there is anybody new that I care to communicate with 
who wouln't be willing to make a small deposit for initiating communications.
