The US versions of Netscape Navigator 3.0 beta 5 and FastTrack Server
2.0 are now available for download.  Obviously, this is only available
to US citizens or permanent residents.  You can get it from
http://wwwus/eng/US-Current/

There's only one machine serving this stuff right now, so please be
patient if it's slow or you have a hard time connecting.
