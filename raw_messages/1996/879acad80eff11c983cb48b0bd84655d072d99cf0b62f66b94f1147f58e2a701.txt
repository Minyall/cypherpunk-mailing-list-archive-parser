I never visited Nazi Germany, or the Soviet Union under Stalin; but I 
think I am justified in regarding them as nasty places, hostile to any 
concept of liberal civilisation.  Equally, though I have done my best to 
avoid visiting the Islamic world, I have seen enough *religious* Moslems 
here in England, and read enough of their material, to know that Islam is 
more often than not a force for evil.

Turning to literature, I have read my way through dozens of pamphlets 
sent me by the Islamic Propagation Centre International of Birmingham - 
the one that strikes me as most hilariously dishonest is "The Status of 
Women in Islam" by Dr Jamal A. Badawi.  I will upload a review of this 
tomorrow.  I also have a copy of the Koran, translation and Commentary by 
A. Yusuf Ali; and I have read much of Al Ghazali and a French version of 
"The Regency of the Theologian" by the late Ruholla Khomeini.

Of course, even if I list everything I have read about Islam or by 
Moslems, and read three times more, you would still come on this list 
questioning my right to form an opinion.  One tactic - used ad nauseam by 
the socialists - is to dismiss whatever I have read as works 
unrepresentative of the true essence and canon.  Well, I say that I know 
quite enough about Islam to regard it as a horrible religion.  I still 
disagree with Tim as to what response is appropriate.  But I agree with 
him that it would be a nasty day for humanity if Islam were ever to 
become the faith of a powerful and expansionist state.
