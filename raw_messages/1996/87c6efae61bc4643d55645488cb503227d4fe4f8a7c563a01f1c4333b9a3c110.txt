My points were about the _children_ and what they were using when they grew up.

(In fact, note my use of the phrase "who grew up with Commodore PETs and
Apple IIs...")

Indeed, in the 1970s I was using H-P 9825s and DEC PDP 11/34s, but the
teenagers of that decade were, if they were fortunate and energetic, using
PETs, Apple IIs, and the like.
