For years, Radio Shack has sold an indoor/outdoor thermometer with  max/min temperature function.  Going on a long trip and carrying a 5-pound loaf of cheese?  Stick the outdoor thermo pickup in the cheese before you depart, to ensure that it wasn't exposed to damaging temperature excursions!   I'm sure this looks wonderful on an X-ray.
