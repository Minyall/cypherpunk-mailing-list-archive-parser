The advertizers in printed & broadcast media exercise a great deal of control
over the content. E.g., a magazine that gets revenues from tobacco ads isn't
likely to run a story about tobacco companies trying to addict kids. That's
why you see more anti-tobacco content in broadcast media (who can't run
tobacco ads) than in printed media. (And there are cross-ownership
restrictions.)
