Well well...

After putting up the CIA hack mirror page on http://www.skeeve.net/cia/
I learnt a few things.

o it got 50,000 hits in 1 day
o everyone from the cia, senate, fbi, nsa (ncsc) and every other bloody US gov
  department looked at it masses of times. The CIA looked at it every 10-15
  minutes.
zztop{root}:15: cat skeeve.net-access_log | grep ucia.gov | wc -l
    281

o Even the CIA tries to hack you.  

relay1-ext.ucia.gov unknown - [21/Sep/1996:01:56:44 +1000] "GET /cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/cat%20/etc/passwd HTTP/1.0" 404 1180

o Dozens of in.fingerd/in.telnetd attempts from ucia.gov, some mil sites and
  ncsc.mil sites.

as I speak the house are looking at it.
b252-209.house.gov unknown - [21/Sep/1996:02:41:37 +1000] "GET /cia/


I "PRESUME" there are no laws (international or otherwise) being broken by
my housing of the mirror... not like I actually care.. but it would be good
to know.

Ok... ive been up all night chuckling at all the different sort of sites hitting
the mirror... time to sleep.
