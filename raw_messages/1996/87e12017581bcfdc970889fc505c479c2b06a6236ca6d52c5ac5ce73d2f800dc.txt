(I agree with nearly everything in Strata's "Refutation" essay. In 
particular, I find his comments on the net.pundits' hypocrisy about net.bias
and prejudice to be extremely accurate.)

I'm afraid I'm not willing to take this on faith. Strata made some good
observations about the tangible vulnerability of the net-as-we-know-it to
government intervention. If you'd like to try to rebut some of his arguments
a bit more specifically, I'd be very interested in reading about it.
