Nothing like a good personal defamation before even reading my posts, eh?
As those who have paid attention know, I post my policy views, not
flame-bait. The idea that I am deliberately trying to start flame wars is
pure paranoia.

Of course a good attempt to attack personally is an attempt to avoid the
need to try to engage with the substance. It's not only underhanded, but
also sheer laziness, typical of small minds which cannot tolerate a
difference of view. Your position is as prejudiced as those we sometimes
call sexist or racist.

Having made my points on this matter, I have no plans to engage in a
flame-fest with those who love to provoke one and then blame the victim--to
be sure I don't give in to such further provocation from you, welcome to my
filter file.

David
