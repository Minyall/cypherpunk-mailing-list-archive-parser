Except of course schmoe.org.  Primary name service is usually provided
by the organization's own nameserver.  The secondary name server should
(as per the rfc whose number I forget at the moment) be on a separate
network segment.  Anyone who lists a machine from root-servers.net as their
primary needs to learn a bit more about DNS.  Root servers exist to provide
an authoritative starting point for recursive lookups, they do not provide
name service for anything other than top level domains (com. edu. net. etc.).

The NIC has the power to remove domains based upon it's authority among 
the root servers.
