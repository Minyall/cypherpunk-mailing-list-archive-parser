I will not coment on the correctness of the U.S government's funding
allocations, however the above statement is clearly designed to be
deceptive. Given the GDP of the U.S as a whole during fiscal 1996 was
greater than that of any other country at any other time, including the
U.S in previous years (the U.S like most other countries has postive
growth), of course the absolute value of taxes collected will be larger.
