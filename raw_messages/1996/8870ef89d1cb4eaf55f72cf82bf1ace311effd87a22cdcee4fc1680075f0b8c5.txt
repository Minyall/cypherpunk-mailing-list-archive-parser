And then there was another message:

At 6:00 PM -0400 12/3/96, Javier Rivera wrote:

Both seemed to come from "zeen@caribe.net". One under the Ruiz name, the
other under the Rivera name. And similar messages, both in broken English.

I suggest Angel and Javier get together and decide which one of them is the
name they or it subscribed under, and use that. Oh, and I have a sneaking
suspicion they sent in the increasingly-canonical "unsuscribe" or
"unscribe" misspelling.

I'm beginning to think that Cypherpunks appeals especially to morons.
