Known plaintext isn't needed for any brute force DES attack. Indeed,
our own Dave Wagner showed in a paper not that long ago how to
automate the process of detecting a good key.

The numbers in the Blaze et al paper are very realistic on this. A
year is total bull -- not even within several orders of magnitude of
accuracy.
