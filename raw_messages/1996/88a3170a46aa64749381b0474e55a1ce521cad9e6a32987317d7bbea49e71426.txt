You though that was bad?  (Besides I though it was $300/yr not a quarter)
try their clearing services!  $500/mo + 6% of all tranactions.  Yeoch.

 I know T1s and satellite links overseas are  expensive, but they're not THAT 
expensive.  Hey, Mark Twain.  Form a seychelles entity with the same fee
