Bogus mail addresses of that kind are typically added by all sorts of
mail relays.  In other words, although I can't tell you 100% for certain
without seeing the mail headers, the scenario underlying this was
probably something involving a bogus mail relay.  Alternately, there are
some systems where this could have all happened entirely on your end, in
your delivery software.  There are a zillion ways this can happen,
actually.  I've checked my archive, and that address definitely was not
in the mail when it left my system.

I can guarantee you that it wasn't our system that did this.  If there's
one things we know cold, it's email.  -- Nathaniel
