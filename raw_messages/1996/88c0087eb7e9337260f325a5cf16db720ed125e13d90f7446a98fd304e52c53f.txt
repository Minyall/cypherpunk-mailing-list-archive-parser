Just wondering how much of a problem "damaged keys" really are in
practice.  Is this something specific to Microsoft filesystems or
really cheap tape drives?  I've never seen that problem under Unix,
and something like a private RSA key doesn't change very often, so you
would expect to have encrypted copies of it on many backup tapes.

Or maybe this journalist, like most, doesn't know what the fuck he's
talking about?
