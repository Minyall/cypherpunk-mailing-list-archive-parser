SCO (and Novell, when it was selling Unix) both shipped libcrypt.a as a 
seperate product in their development systems.  Only US and Canadian 
customers are allowed to buy the library.  Programs statically compiled
with libcrypt appear to be OK, but furineers can't have API access to
this technology :)
