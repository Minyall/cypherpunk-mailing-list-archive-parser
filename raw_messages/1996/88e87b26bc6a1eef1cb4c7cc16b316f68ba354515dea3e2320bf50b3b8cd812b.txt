Is it necessary to be called a bank?  I've got a storefront in Chicago.  
What would prevent me from opening up a Mark Twain account and buying and 
selling ecash on floppies, in person?  Do account holders have to agree 
not to do that before Mark Twain gives them an account?  Is it illegal?

The currency exchange model almost seems more appropriate for most users
than the bank model.
