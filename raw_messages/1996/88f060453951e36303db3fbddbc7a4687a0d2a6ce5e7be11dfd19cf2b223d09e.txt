And yet how many of these programs actually can transparently
(automatically, push-button, etc.) support PGP? I've been a user of Eudora
for several years, and have pressed for PGP hooks. The company, Qualcomm,
once told me it was on their list of things to do, but....

A few years later, still no PGP-in-Eudora. One would think that this would
be a powerful way of distinguishing their product from other mail packages.

(I understand from this list that Eudora for Windows is now doing this much
more automatically, that someone has a PGP-in-Eudora package. I don't think
it was from Qualcomm, but I could be wrong. As a Macintosh version user,
I'm hoping this comes to the Mac version as well.)

Food for thought.
