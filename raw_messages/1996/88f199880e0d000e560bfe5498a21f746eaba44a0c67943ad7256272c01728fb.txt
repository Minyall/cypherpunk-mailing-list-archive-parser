  The cypherpunks@toad.com list was turned off for just over a day to
keep a set of bogus messages off of the list.  Many thanks go to John
Gilmore for fixing the problem.
  The next message will be a (almost) digest of the 17 messages that
were not passed on in real time to the list.

  Think of it as a vacation.
