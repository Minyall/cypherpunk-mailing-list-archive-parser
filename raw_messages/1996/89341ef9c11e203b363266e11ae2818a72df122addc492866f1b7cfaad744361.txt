I can provide a datapoint here. I started getting into chemistry
when I was about 8, which was in 1981. I can't remember the brand
name, but my first (and last, actually) 'value-added' kit was
designed to keep kids from doing anything that could be
dangerous, a fact tactfully explained on the packaging.

To solve that problem, my mother gave me an Edmund Scientific
catalog and a (severely limited, given my family background)
budget for whatever I wanted.

I ordered direct for supplies from then on.

I would have killed for a computer growing up. I finally got one,
a Mac IIsi, when I went to college (I'm still paying off the
loan I took out to buy it. I gave it to someone when I got another
machine, and it will, if I'm not mistaken, retrieve this message
the next time a certain someone checks mail. That helps
me overlook the fact that I still owe more than the machine
is worth... I learned my lesson.)

There are many in my age bracket who play with non-computer
science; the relevent fact being that whatever the field
of study (I personally know folks doing research in bio, physics,
chemistry and economics (arguably not a science ;)), they all use
computers as a daily part of their work. You can run, but you can't
hide.

Yes, many of us are devoted to the study of Brute Force Insect
Dissection.
