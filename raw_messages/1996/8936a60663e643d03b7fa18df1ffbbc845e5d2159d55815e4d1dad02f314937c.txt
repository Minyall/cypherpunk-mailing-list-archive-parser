Right, and Active X, if those machies were on the web, would not be 
supported.

Correct, however there is one thing you have forgotten... (next paragraph)

While ActiveX does support hand optmized assembler, there are Java 
JustInTime compilers which take JVM bytecodes and turn'em into raw 
assembler.  They aren't hand optimized, they are natively compiled code, 
but they are native code non the less.  A good optimizing compiler may 
not be 100% as cool and as fast as hand optmized code, BUT it'll be 
almost as fast.  And Java will run on just about EVERY platform out there.
And that is a bigger, more important point than a 10%-25% increase in 
power over non-optimized code.

Besides, I'm not arguing AGAINST an ActiveX client, there's no reason 
why there can't be both Java and ActiveX clients out there since there is 
both a compatibilty issue and a speed increase with ActiveX.
