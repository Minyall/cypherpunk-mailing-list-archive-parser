Actually the opposite is the case, he is a notorious womanizer. He played
a gay man in the recent remake of La Cage aux Folles and made the point
that he has also played Stjannus in "I Claudius" and nobody asked if he
was a homicidal maniac.

Yet more proof that nothing Dimitri says is relevant or interesting.
