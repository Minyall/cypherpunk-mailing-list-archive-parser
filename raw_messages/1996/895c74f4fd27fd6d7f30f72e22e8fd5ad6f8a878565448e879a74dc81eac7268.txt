The point was that the group with endocrine problems was an
appropriate group to give growth hormone to, whereas the shortest
10% of the population was not.

Similarly while there might very well be some disorder of
cognition for which amphetamines would be appropriate medication,
prescribing them on the basis of which 10% of the population
performs least well in the traditional "cells and bells" school
environment is not it.

The fact that some claim to be able to demonstrate ADD by
"repeatable biological tests" carries no more weight than the
ability to repeatably demonstrate that a person is short of
stature by "repeatable tape measure tests."

There is a difference between giving medication for a verifiable
organic problem, like insulin for diabetes, or growth hormone for
a pituitary defect, and giving it to the 10% shortest, or the 10%
most likely to call their teachers bleep words.

Again, to return to the height analogy, doctors have to throw
short parents seeking human growth hormone for their perfectly
healthy short children off their doorsteps every day.

Same goes for patients seeking antibiotics inappropriate for
their illnesses, and countless other things.

The price of giving the patient (or the patient's parents)
everything they want is disease-resistant microorganisms, a
country where everyone is over six feet tall, and classrooms full
of obedient citizen-units in Soma-induced trances.
