Matt, can you give us an idea of the cost of a "modest size machine" might
be?  Is this something we can do with a C'punks bake sale or our we going
to need corporate/academic support?  Also, if we do use the bake sale
approach, is there some way the money can be collected and routed into an
R&D sort of facility without causing a lot of stink with whomever actually
runs the place, like a university?
