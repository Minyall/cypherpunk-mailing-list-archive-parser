Hi.  I was thinking as I stood in the lunch line talking
with  Arnaud 
that what I like about <a href=
"http://www-ugrad.cs.colorado.edu/~wilcoxb/faq/DefnOfPseudonymity">
pseudonymity </a> is the part about being free from the
threat of violence.  I _don't_ like the part about being
able to have multiple identities nearly as much.  It would
really please me if I could figure out a way to reliably
determine that Alicenym is not the same human as Bobnym
without compromising the anonymity of the human(s) behind 
Alicenym and Bobnym.  (Since if their anonymity was thus
compromisable, they would be susceptible to the threat of
violence.)


Unfortunately I can't think of a good way to have both
pseudonymity and nym-differentiation.  I think that it is
possible, however.  Can anyone suggest a mechanism?


Regards,

Bryce
