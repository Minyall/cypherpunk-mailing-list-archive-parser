Ok, here is the situation.  I have a person mad at me in one of my mailing
lists.  Turns out, this person was the owner of the mailing list!  Well now
I'm stuck, knocked out of the list.  The owner can not see any of my mail,
no matter how hard I try.  I need some ideas to eather get through to her,
or really fuck up the mailing list.

Any ideas?

P.S. please E-Mail directly to me.  If you can.
