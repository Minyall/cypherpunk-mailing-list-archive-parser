As I remember from discussions with a GSM encryption programmer
(which I posted to this list months ago) GSM is secure enough to prevent
real-time decryption, as keys are changed frequently using another
secure protocol (A8 I believe). GSM  encryption is only supposed
to make people like Princess Diana more secure, that's all. This was
enough for Pakistan to temporarily shut down Motorola's GSM network
in Karachi last February, until they discovered they could
intercept calls simpply by sitting at the base stations where
they're decrypted...
