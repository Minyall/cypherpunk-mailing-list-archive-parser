}The United States is a sovereign nation. Do you dispute that ? The
}constitution is a binding agreement between the government and its citizens
}that determines how that sovereignty will be exercised, the elements in which
}the nation will not interfere with citizens, and the duties which it will
}carry out.

Yes, I do dispute it, but I'm not going to write why all over again, since
you seem to have convieniently snipped the rest of my post, rather than
answer it.  You are arguing a straw man.  I didn't say that the nation
isn't soveriegn, I said that the government is not sovereign.  Yes, there
is a difference.

"Prohibition... goes beyond the bounds of reason in that it attempts to
control a man's appetite by legislation and makes a crime out of things
that are not crimes... A prohibition law strikes a blow at the very
principles upon which our government was founded."

On the meridian of time there is no injustice, only the poetry of motion
creating the illusion of truth and drama.
