There isn't a Mac version yet, but there is a beta version for Windows.
Information is available at http://www.ssh.fi.

It seems to be pretty widespread.  A lot of security conscious ISP's run
sshd and I think there will be an RFC on ssh eventually.

It's really a very good program.  The code is huge, so it is somewhat difficult
to really be certain that there aren't any holes somewhere in the program.
There also isn't much key management which makes MITM attacks easier.  But that
would make it even more complex.
