In this case the entropy is the negative of the logarithm of 
the probability that you or someone else could exactly 
duplicate those mouse movements.  I would guess that you 
get at least three bits a second just doodling around, so 
half a minute of doodles (a pretty long time) should be unbreakable.

Some time ago, at a cypherpunks conference, people were making 
all sorts of ridiculous proposals for being really, really, 
really, sure that you had real entropy, and a prominent 
cypherpunk, possibly Tim May, said, "This is ridiculous:  
Nobody ever broke good crypto through weakness in the 
source of truly random numbers".  Sometime after that 
Netscape was broken through weakness in the source of 
truly random numbers.
