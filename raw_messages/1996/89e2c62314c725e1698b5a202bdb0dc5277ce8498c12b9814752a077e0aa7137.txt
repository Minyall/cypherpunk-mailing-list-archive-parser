Also interesting from a historical cryptography standpoint is the NSA

http://www.nsa.gov:8080/

Interesting information about Soviet one-time pad ciphers and about 
crypto-related documents from the WW2 era that are being declassified.
[I really want to see the picture of a Japanese purple cipher machine.]
