Well - this thread has very little crypto-relevance (AP itself has
questionable crypto-relevance, IMO, and should be discussed in
talk.politics.assassination, carried by every honorable Usenet site).
But as far as AP is concerned, clearly JFK's death (quite deserved)
did not deter other scum like him from seeking political office.
Now, if he had been tried (for treason, murder, etc) and died like
a criminal, not like a hero, on national TV, that would have done
a lot more damage to the image of the office of the president of
the united states. Just look back at what Nixon's resignation did.
I believe in public hangings after a fair trial.
