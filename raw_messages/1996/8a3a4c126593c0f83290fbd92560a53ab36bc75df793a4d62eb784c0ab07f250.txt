I'd like to take an exception to this description of the XMAS EXEC, since
I too received a copy of it in '87 (but had the smarts not to run it).
It didn't break or steal anything. It did 2 things:

 * Displayed an ASCII Xmas tree;
 * E-mailed a copy of itself to every e-mail address listed in the database of
 e-mail aliases. VM/CMS comes a very convenient, standard, and user-friendly
 program for keeping track of nicknames, real names, and e-mail addresses,
 stored in a flat file with tags, which any REXX program can easily read.

I had serious doubts that the person who wrote it was malicious.
