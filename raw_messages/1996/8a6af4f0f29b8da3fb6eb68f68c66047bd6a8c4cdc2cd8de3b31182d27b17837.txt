It certainly rivals the Holocaust of 6M Jews during WW2. One important
difference is that Nazi Germans had specially built death camps with
trained personnel, while in 1905, 1914, and again in 1992, every Armenian
wanted to take part in the massacres.

As I said, *I* don't see what relevance ethnic flames could possibly have
to a supposedly crypto-related mailing list, but Timmy May and his few friends
clearly disagree - witness their many rants about Russians and Cossacks (????)
as well as attacks on mormons. I also recall some clearly anti-Semetic rants
from Timmy May (something about Israel deserving to be nuked).

As for Ray, he's a typical hate-filled Armenian. Armenian heritage has been
defined for centuries in terms of "race-worship" and hatred for Moslems,
Jews, and anyone else non-Armenian. It's somewhat surprising to see such
stereotypical "old-country" behavior in an alleged Californian.

And I don't see any evidence that Timmy or Ray are "crypto people".
