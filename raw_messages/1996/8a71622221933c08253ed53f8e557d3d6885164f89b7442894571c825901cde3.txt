Something else I want to know...  Why is my mail going through microsoft.com?
.......................................................................................................

There is an email 'alias' at Microsoft which was subscribed to the cpunk list, to receive and distribute the cpunk list to members of that alias.

A new beta version of Exchange is being used on a test basis by some departments (apparently all of the cpunks at MS are using it), and the programmers recently encountered a "little complication" (to use a phrase from the movie 'Brazil').   I'm told that the problems were corrected, but that now the spoolers are releasing messages which were backed up while mail delivery was put on hold.   I hate to agree with Timothy C. May, but it is probably best to "use technology " to deal with it for a day or so.
