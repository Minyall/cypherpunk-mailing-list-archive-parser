	The proposed standard wants to make kid-nonavailable material on
"glorifying drug use" and gambling. In both these cases, many political
arguments on the subject (i.e., those arguing that the substances or behaviors
in question are less harmful than some suppose) would be classified as
something that parents should be able to block out.
