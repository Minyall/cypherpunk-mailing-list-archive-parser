I know this isn't a typical posting for this group, but I thought I'd 
point out that O.J. Simpson has a video for sale, to further exploit his 
carnage. 
You can buy it by dialing 1-800-OJTELLS 1-800-658-3557 it is a FREE CALL 
(for you).  
I guess that means the MERCHANT PAYS for the calls, even if NOTHING IS 
ORDERED...
