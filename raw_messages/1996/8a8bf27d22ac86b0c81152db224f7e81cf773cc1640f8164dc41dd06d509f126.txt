OK, suppose that this list was for legal punks...

Suppose that this winter Mr. X was elected Kook of the Month. Suppose
also that Mr. Y was very happy with this fact and his friends announced
it all over USENET, posting to all of the professional newsgroups that
Mr. X posts to, and several dozens of other newsgroups affected by Mr.
X.

Mr. X alleged that this announcement was actionable libel. Mr. Y thought
that since Mr. X really was elected, posting the truth could not be
actionable libel.

Mr. X, however, did not accept the results of Kook elections and simply
said that he was not a kook and all who say otherwise would be sued.

Various people got even happier, started laughing and posted messages to
the effect that Mr. X is a dumb liar in addition to being a cook. Mr. X
continued threatening lawsuits, but with no real action (due to extreme
lack of funds).

Who is right? Did Mr. Y's friends really libel Mr. X?

Thank you very much...
