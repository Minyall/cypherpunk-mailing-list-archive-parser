Not only that, but what's the stop the anon users from claiming to be 
OTHER anon users and requesting tokens.

Say have one true user (Vulis) create 10 zillion tentacles and request 10 
zillion tokens, one from each tentacle and then use them all to post spam?

Human review of posts is likely the only way.  Sure, some things can be 
filtered out, you can look for messages that are less than 1K in size and 
have the words "Timmy" "Mayonaise" "Maya" and various other derogatory 
terms nearby and reject them pronto, but that will only have Vulis change 
the spelling of those words slightly each day and have them show up on the 
list anyway.
