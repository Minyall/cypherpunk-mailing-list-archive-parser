Two others, huh?  Lucky you :-)

I'm tired.

Yes, I'm tired.

For several years I've been blaming it on middle age, poor blood, lack
of vitamins, air pollution, saccharin, obesity, dieting, under-arm
odour, yellow wax buildup and another dozen maladies that make you
wonder if life is really worth living.

But I found out it ain't that.

I'm tired because I'm overworked.

The population of this country is 3.3 million, 0.5 million are
retired, that leaves 2.8 million to do the work.

There are 1 million in school, that leaves 1.8 million to do the work.

200,000 are unemployed and 400,000 are employed by the Government,
that leaves 1.2 million to do the work.

300,000 are employed by City and Borough Councils, leaving 700,000 to
do the work.

There are 420,000 people in hospital and 279,998 in prison.

That leaves two people to do the work.

You and me.

And you are sitting on your arse reading this.

No wonder I'm bloody tired.
