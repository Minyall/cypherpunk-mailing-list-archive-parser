	No, rich is a good excuse for _not_ doing it, unless it can be
done with total anonymity. If I set up a remailer, on my home computer, as
an individual, then I am a very little target. I have nothing (well, damn
little) for anyone to sue me over. What would be the point? They threaten
to sue me for what? They would spend FAR more than they could ever get out
of me, and as long as I don't violate any laws, I _might_ be able to get
"big guns" like the ACLU, EFF etc. on my side to make it a nasty fight for
no return. 
	Someone like Mr. May has assets that can be gotten, so there is
potential for gain from a lawsuit against him, both financially and
otherwise. 

	Rich is neither reason, nor excuse. Capability is the issue. It
would probably be easier for me to run a remailer than Mr. May, not that I
am better equipped mentally, but (until I started posting to this list).

	Come to think of it, would the Mixmaster package run under Xenix?
I have a 286 laying around collecting dust...
