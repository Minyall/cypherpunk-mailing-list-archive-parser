I trust Netscape, but I also cut the cards...

Their file delivery CGI could use some work... no reason I can see to
offer the filename 'pick.cgi' for everything.  Anyone sniffing the link
knows the filename from previous forms submissions, anyway.

OBRealCrypto:  What's the best method for authenticating successive
interactions with a CGI?  Currently, the password is being passed clear
as a hidden input field, but I have to believe there's a better way than
that.  One point is that the user will not be explicitly ending his
session, but just wandering off to other pages.
