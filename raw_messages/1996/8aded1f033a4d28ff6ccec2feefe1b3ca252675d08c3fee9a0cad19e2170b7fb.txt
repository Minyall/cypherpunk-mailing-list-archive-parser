Every once in a while, this list receives a burst of inquiries
which...

  A.  Are clearly explained in a number of widely available FAQs
      which one would hope people interested in cryptography would
      have bothered to read.

  B.  Request information which reasonable persons might better 
      obtain by using, or learning to use, various commonly
      available Net grepping tools.

If the Nth such inquiry in a given week is not always responded to
with complete and utter seriousness, that is something you and
others of your ilk will just have to deal with. 

This is Cypherpunks.  It is not "Unix hacking hints", "Introduction to
Cryptography", nor "Fun With Batteries and Wire."

Everyone with an interest in the topics covered by this list is 
welcome here, but let's keep the "What is DES?" questions out of
the feed from the list server. 

This is, of course, merely the opinion of one person, and may be
agreed with or ignored as others see fit.
