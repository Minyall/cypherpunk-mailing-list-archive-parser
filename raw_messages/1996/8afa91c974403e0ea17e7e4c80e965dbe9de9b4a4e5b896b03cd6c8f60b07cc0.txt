That was the basic format we used.  The only difference was that the keys
were collected before hand and distributed on disk.

The biggest problems were due to unfamiliarity was to what to bring and
procedure from an experience point of view.  (Lack of key fingerprints were
a problem.)

The key signing rules were published, but many people attending did not read
them.  (They were part of an update announcement.  Many people read the top
part, saw nothing had changed and skipped the rest of it...)

Now that we have done it once, it will be alot easier the next time.
