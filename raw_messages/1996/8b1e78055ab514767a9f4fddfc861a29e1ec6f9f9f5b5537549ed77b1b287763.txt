Are you talking about "The Puzzle Palace," or about "Applied Cryptography"?

I thought the thread was about "The Puzzle Palace." It's certainly possible
that Bruce Schneier has contributed to a second edition, beyond the
Foreward or whatever it is, but your comments fit with "Applied
Cryptography" closely, too.

Have you seen a copy of "The Puzzle Palace," 2nd Ed.?
