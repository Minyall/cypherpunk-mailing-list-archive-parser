     Bullshit. Most kids (these days) who use profanity are simply 
undisiplined louts. Yes, I use profanity today, at 28. However, I would 
NEVER have called my mother a "Fucking Asshole" under ANY circumstances, 
My father would have torn my head off. In fact if my father had caught me
speaking like that to ANYONE at 8 years of age, I would have had trouble
sitting for a couple days at least. 

     Of course my parents made sure not to talk like that around me.

     On the other hand, if only 20% of the children that are being drugged
need it, that means that we are sacrificing 80% of these children to save 
20%. 

     Drugs are supposed to be for fun, not for long term behavior 
modification. People need to learn to deal with life.
