Hi everybody.  This is my first de-lurking.

For those interested in how Utah's Signature policy works, check out this
web page:

http://www.state.ut.us/ccjj/digsig/default.htm

This web page includes the text and commentary of the digital signature act,
illustrations, guidelines of the American Bar Association regarding digital
signatures, and a bunch of other stuff.

>From what I understood, in Utah, you need to get a digital signature from a
company that verifies your signature.  Once this has been done, it can be
used for commerce on the internet.  Provision have also been included to
revoke certificates, and explanations are given on who is liable in
different situations.
