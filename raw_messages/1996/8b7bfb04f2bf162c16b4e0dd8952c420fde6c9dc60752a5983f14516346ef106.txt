   I'm considering the idea of cutting a crypto CD, and wanted to see if 
there was any potential interest in the idea, or not. Basically what i 
forsee is a disk with the basic algorithms (DES/IDEA/Etc), and steg tools, 
along with a few large crypto aps like PGP, and basic cracking software (Crypt 
Breakers Work Bench, XOR-type crackers, and dictionary attacks with 
a few dozen dictionaries). I'd also like to include a remail directory 
with some remailer sources, remailer-aware clients, and the mixmaster 
sources. And of course as much infomation as possible -- cyphernomicon 
preferably, possibly even archives of this list..  

I would plan to put unix/dos/mac all on one CD. I'm thinking that 
realistically I can expect 50 megs or so. Possibly as much as 100 if I 
find a TON of wonderful text. 

Could be useful to individuals, as well as for groups wishing to create 
FTP sites etc. 

Pricing with shipping would wind up around US$20.00, give or take 5 dollars..

I'd like to know first off whether such a thing already exists. Secondly 
whether anyone would be interested in possesing such a thing. And lastly 
any suggestions for/about content that I may have missed..



Thanks
Benji
