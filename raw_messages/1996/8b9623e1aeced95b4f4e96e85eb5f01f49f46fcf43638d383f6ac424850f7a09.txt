I took a look at the text of the bill.  There was a line in it making
it a crime to use crypto in a way that obstructs a federal investigation.
While understandable, this is too vague... it could easily be interpreted
(IMO) as any strong crypto without escrow of some kind.

Anyone else feel this way about that line in the bill?
