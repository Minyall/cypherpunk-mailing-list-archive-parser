	Then no one would use them for DNS service.  Back when the NIC first
started charging for services I remember seeing a message from someone who was
going to attempt to make another root name service, but I haven't heard much
about it since.
	Since the NIC charges $100 per registration, you can bet there will be
some legislation somewhere along the line.  They must be makeing 5000-10000%
profit.
