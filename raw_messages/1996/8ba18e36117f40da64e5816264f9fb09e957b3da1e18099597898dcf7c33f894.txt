Since Perry has on several occasions said he does not want to hear about
politics and other "off-topic" posts, and since he has written at least
five of these posts just today (the "Gentleman do not" thread), I suggest
he heed his own advice.

I was skipping most of these posts that Perry, Rich Graves, and others are
writing, but the hypocrisy of calling for others to not engage in
"off-topic" posts while writing five of them himself...well, it speaks for
itself.

Debating basic libertarian theory, including the rights of Divine Beings,
quasi-Divine Beings, Secular Beings, etc., is best done on another list, or
in private e-mail.
