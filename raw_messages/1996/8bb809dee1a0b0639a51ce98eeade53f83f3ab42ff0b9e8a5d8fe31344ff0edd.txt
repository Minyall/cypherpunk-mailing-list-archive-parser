Peter G. Neumann has a very good column this month on risks and the
"worldwide rush [to] digital commerce."  Summarizes problems with our
infrastructure, gives some concrete examples, and discusses importance of
privacy as a commodity, and how "We need, among other things, ...  consistent
use of good cryptography in operating systems and application software."
