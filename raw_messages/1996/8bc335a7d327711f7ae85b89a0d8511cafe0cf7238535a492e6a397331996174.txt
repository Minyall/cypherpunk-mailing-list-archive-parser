That info used to be available at http://www.pafb.af.mil/deomi/DEOMI.HTM
(the Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute), under the "Special
Interest Groups" heading, but access was restricted to MilNet on Friday
when I pointed out, somewhat sarcastically, that they were violating the
ADL's copyrights. Geez, they *REALLY* don't want people accessing that
server; not only is it firewalled now, but they removed www.pafb.af.mil
from the public DNS (its IP address is 131.25.131.53). I guess the Air
Force can't take a joke (gee, I wonder why).

Anyway, if you're interested in a bunch of very interesting reports on
right-wing terrorist groups in the US, most of them dated August 1993, I
just might be able to put you in touch with someone who might have those
files in his or her N*tscape cache directory. My friend Cecelia points 
out that the ADL made a few silly mistakes, though, like getting Neo-Nazi
leader William Pierce's birthdate wrong (Pierce is the wacko who wrote 
The Turner Diaries, which inspired a tring of murders/bank robberies by 
The Order and, more recently, Timothy McVeigh).

The general thrust of DEOMI seems to be that people in non-combat posts in
the military have every right to be involved with these jokers in their
off hours. There are several .mil addresses on the openly Neo-Nazi
Stormfront list -- and they're not all plants. In general, they'll only
investigate you if your paranoid fantasies about the Zionist Occupational
Government prompt you to get up in a tower and start shooting people. 
Which has, of course, happened, so I have no problem whatsoever with the 
USAF (or anyone else) talking to the ADL, as long as rights are respected.
