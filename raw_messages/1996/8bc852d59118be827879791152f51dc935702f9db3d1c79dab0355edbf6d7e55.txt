As far as I'm aware, the rule for Canada is this:

If it came from the US, it can only be exported back to the US.
If it did not come from the US, it can be exported to any "non-evil"
country ("evil" countries are ones like Libya).

Then there are rules for what "came from" means, which are less clear.
I've also heard "substantially modified": if software comes from the US
into Canada, and is "substantially modified" in Canada, it may be
exported.
