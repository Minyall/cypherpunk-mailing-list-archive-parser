Can I just add a loud HURRAH! on the integration of PGP and Pegasus 
using the PGPJN add-on. 

It is by far the smoothest melding of PGP and a e-mail routine to 
date. The only way it would be smoother is on one program. THe 
learning curve is also negligible. 

For all those griping about no good PGP windoze e-mail programs, your 
wait is over. This mail program won over a die hard Eudora fan in 
about 15 minutes... Someone else already posted the sites to get this 
so forgive my laziness of not repeating their words.

Oh, did I mention this is seamless under Windoze 95 as well?


Adam, Esq.
