	BTW, is the license essentially copyright-based? If so, you're going
to have trouble using it in a country that you can't legally sell/give away
with limits the stuff to; it is assumed that you aren't losing anything. I
may be wrong, of course, but that's my understanding of how penalties, etcetera
are determined under copyright law.
