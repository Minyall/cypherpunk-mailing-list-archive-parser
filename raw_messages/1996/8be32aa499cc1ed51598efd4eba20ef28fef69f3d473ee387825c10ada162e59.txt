This is one reason.  I think that there are several other reasons:

 -- Someone may be using a machine at work or on a multiuser UNIX system which
    is untrusted and insecure.  In the case of a UNIX account, one could
    compose a message off-line and rz it using a term program, but that is a
    major hassle.

 -- Many email programs do not have support for PGP so signing a message often
    requires a lot of cutting and pasting.

 -- PGP may not work on the computer a person is using for Internet access or
    the system might be too slow to use PGP.

I think they are both equally important.  The point of public-key cryptography
is the ability to communicate with a person without having a secure channel to
exchange keys.  Once keys can be transmitted using the same medium used for the
encrypted traffic, it makes a MITM or denial-of-service attack much easier.
There has to be some out-of-band method to authenticate keys.  Without
authentication, a lot of the security that could be gained by using PK crypto
is lost.

I don't know of any mail programs that can use PGP (I know there are various
interfaces, sendmail wrappers, and other hacks, but I have yet to see a mailer
with an "Encrypt" or "Sign" option.

Doubtful.  PGP authentication is better than no authentication.
