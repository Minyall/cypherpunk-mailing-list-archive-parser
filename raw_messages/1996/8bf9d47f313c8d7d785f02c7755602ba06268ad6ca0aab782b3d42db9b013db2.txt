Actually, I have always had a soft spot for the Bavarian Illuminati.

Those wanting to know more should find a good university library and look
at:

Vernon Stauffer, New England and the Bavarian Illuminati (published in
1918 -- you won't find this in your bookstore....)

Amazingly, the whole original Bavarian Illuminati panic was set off in
1798 in a single sermon given by Reverend Jedeidiah Morse on May 9, 1798,
based on his reading of John Robison's 1797 book, Proofs of a Conspiracy
Against All the Religions and Governments of Europe.

It's really an incredible piece of US social history and I think tells us
a lot about the national temper then and now.

The national panic over this early "reds under the beds" lasted almost two
years!  No one ever found any Illuminati in the US...
