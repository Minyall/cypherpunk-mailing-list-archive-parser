How much reliability do you need?  As a first approxmation, look out your
window.  How often is it that you can't see your neighbor's house?  Here in
California, power failures are more frequent.  (N.B. higher level protocols
will recover from interruptions due to, e.g. large trucks.)

I first heard of people using the technology to extend an IBM mainframe
channel across a freeway 15 or 20 years ago.
