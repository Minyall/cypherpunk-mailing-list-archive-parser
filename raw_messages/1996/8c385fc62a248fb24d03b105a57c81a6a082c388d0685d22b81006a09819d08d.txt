In 1975, I lived in a small suburb of Kansas City, and went with my 
grandfather from Kansas City Airport on a chartered Boeing 747 to see the 
Apollo part of the Apollo/Soyuz rocket "blast off". (the whole thing was 
arranged my a local group of bigwigs, I think.)  ( I think it was a Saturn
V, but correct me if 
I'm wrong.  I was young and impressionable.) First and last large rocket I 
saw go in person; I was sincerely impressed; it was extremely LOUD and we 
were kept MILES away on a grandstand.  (But we were the closest you could 
get, as I understand it, as we were invited guests of the whole thing.)

Incidentally, flying on the same airplane from Kansas City were:

1.  Susan Ford, daughter of President Gerald Ford.
2.  Dr. Werner Von Braun.


ob crypto:  Uh, none, sorry.
