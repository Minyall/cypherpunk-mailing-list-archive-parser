This may or may not fly, but it is at least worth puting out for general
comment...

Have the people in the e-cash biz thought of getting with the various "Cyber
Cafes" around the world to sell e-cash to the patrons.  Done properly, this
could inject e-cash into a community who would both use the cash, as well as
providing privacy and an exchange for real currency.

There is probibly some sort of financial regulation against it, but it is an
idea to look into...
