So you didn't have time to go check out the URL?

Welcome to the PGP Cracker home page. As system
administrator you know the frustration in reading your
users Email if they use PGP. Or if your lover is
receiving encrypted messages you would be interested in
reading that encrypted email. Of course, government agencies
will be greatly interested in this new tool also.  The
program is free for non-commercial users! For government and
commercial applications the cost is $500.00 per site.
The program only runs on UNIX machines.

How does it work?
To decrypt any message that uses PGP you need the Public
Key and the random number generated to encrypt the message.

Commands:
Crack  -d filename.ext    Decrypts any encrypted message less than 2047 bytes.
Crack  -p secring.pgp     Lets you modify a keys password so the owner can
                          no longer decrypt messages.
Crack  -s PUBKEY.EXT      Lets you modify the public key ID information.
Crack  -h                 The crack help file

The "Download PGP Crack" is a link.  Follow it and you get the following
text:

- ----- begin 'lynx -dump' output -----

                                 APRIL FOOLS!
                                       
- ----- end 'lynx -dump' output -----

Of course, if you have "the random number generated to encrypt the
message", you have the session key.  No further magic is necessary, and
no public key required.

But I bet a lot of newless cluebies bite.
