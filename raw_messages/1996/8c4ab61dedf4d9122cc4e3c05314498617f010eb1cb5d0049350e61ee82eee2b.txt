This article is incorrect in at least two ways.

First, last week the U.S. Government signed a legally binding contract
saying they won't prosecute anyone under the CDA until the hearings are
over. This relates to both the indeceny or "patently offensive"
provisions -- *and* the DoJ has said they won't even *initiate*
investigations.

Second, *if* the law is upheld, the DoJ's first, and second, and third,
choices of plaintiffs will be unpopular figures that will play well on
the evening news. The U.S. understands the value of divide-and-conquer.
At the same time, a court challenge will be easier if someone is
actually prosecuted...
