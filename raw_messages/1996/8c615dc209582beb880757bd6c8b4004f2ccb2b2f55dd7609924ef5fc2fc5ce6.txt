Woah, nice transition.  "That position" suddenly becomes "my position."  
Tell me, what is my position?  I never expressed an opinion.

The above is the argument of the court, not my argument.  I never 
expressed an opinion on the argument.

What was my position again?

My justifications?  Where?

Because English is my third (or fourth depending on how you count them) 
language and I don't bother with spell checkers?  How well do you spell in 
German, Alemanish or Estonian?

As always, I never expressed opinions on the courts view.  You asked for 
justifications, I gave you the court's.  I've not commented on my own 
view.
