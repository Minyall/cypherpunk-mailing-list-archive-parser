Digital cash, if people can be convinced to trust it, will be a wonderful 
thing because of its security, convenience, and anonymity features. I'm 
sorry, but I just don't buy this "corrupt currency" schtick.

But it can't.

Please define "something of real value." Please explain why it will 
always represent the same value to all people, and why it makes sense to 
pin your money to it rather than letting it float.

Money is a convenient fiction that makes civilization work reasonably well
most of the time. The value of money is always set by fiat and social
consensus. People who reminisce about "the gold standard" are talking
ahistorical nonsense. "The gold standard" was fiat money too. The price
and transportation of gold was controlled by governments. The move away
from "the gold standard" was a recognition of this fact, nothing more.

With all due respect, I think he should have kept it private.
