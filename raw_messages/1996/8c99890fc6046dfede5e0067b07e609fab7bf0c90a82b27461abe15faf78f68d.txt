The paragraph in question was as follows:

"The EFC says at least 10 mirrors sites have appeared, including ones at 
Carnegie Mellon University, Stanford University, and MIT. (The one at the 
University of Massachusetts was ordered removed.)"

I don't know the truth of this statement but the article was very 
anti-censorship and struck a pro-freedom stance.

K.K. Campbell, the author of the piece, is eye weekly's net.editor and 
Webmaster (http://www.interlog.com/eye)
