Since we don't need a license, what records are we supposed to keep?


| Today's Federal Register contains a notice from the Department of
| State, Bureau of Political Military Affairs, announcing final rule of
| an amendment to the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR)
| allowing U.S. persons to temporarily export cryptographic products for
* personal use without the need for an export license.  The product must
| not be intended for copying, demonstration, marketing, sale, re-export,
| or transfer of ownership or control.  It must remain in the possession
| of the exporting person, which includes being locked in a hotel room or
| safe.  While in transit, it must be with the person's accompanying
| baggage.  Exports to certain countries are prohibited -- currently
| Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria.  The exporter
* must maintain records of each temporary export for five years.  See
| Federal Register, Vol. 61, No. 33, Friday, February 16, 1996, Public
| Notice 2294, pp. 6111-6113.
