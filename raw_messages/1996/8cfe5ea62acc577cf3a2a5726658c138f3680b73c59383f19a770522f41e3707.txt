I was waiting for Rich to whine about my message criticizing the Simon
Wiesenthal Center. He was good enough to oblige, being the FUCKING
STATIST that he is:

Funny, that. The links I provided were primarily to reports from the
ACLU, CDT, wire dispatches, and firsthand reports by respected

beleaguered -- and sadly misunderstood -- free speech advocates at the
Simon Wiesenthal Center! 
 
> So yes, Morris Dees is a fool, and so are you.

A stinging blow! I can hardly wait for the next.
