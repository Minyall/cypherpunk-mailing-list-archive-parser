	But you could get a massive amount of mixing of messages, by this
logic, simply by having 1 gigantic remailer. It'd have a vast traffic flow
and could do a lot of latency, etcetera. But this also means that whoever
runs it can trace everything - and whoever breaks into it can trace everything.
While multiple remailers on the same machine isn't ideal for this purpose (if
root is cracked, they all are cracked), it's better for this aspect than 1
remailer; root can be assumed to be harder to crack than a non-root-account
remailer. Moreover, this is assuming one machine, or an interlinked group of
machines set up such that there is one root account for all of them; separating
the remailers into machines with different roots would help. The rubber-hose
attack on the sysadmin is still a problem, though.
