Yeah, that's a good point, and it'd slipped my mind since the
PGP permission was eventually granted.  For some applications of RSA,
you can use RSAREF to do them; you may have to not mind an extra DES
layer thrown in where you really don't need it, and the resulting
ugliness.  (But at least encrypting a random session key with a random
DES key doesn't provide much hook for a DES-cracker.)
