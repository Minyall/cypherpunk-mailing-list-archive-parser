Such as the "right" to health insurance, the "right" to free checks for
sitting on one's chair, the "right" to be treated preferentially as
equally qualified non-minorities applying to the same job, the "right" to
housing, the "right" to free education, the "right" to be paid three times
what your labor is worth in the lowest bracket jobs.

The right to personal property.

Beginning to get the picture?

All of the former were created in the last 60 years out of whole cloth
more as "revolution insurance" than anything else.  They are rights
because someone said they were, not because they are well or logically
grounded.
