     Yes, they are, and death does. 

     Loans to third world counties are made (obstensively) to help industry
and farming to be developed, and to improve the conditions of the people. It 
rarely works that way, and I think it is a wasted effort, but it is better 
than nothing. 

     And yes, I do believe that those _are_ the reasons (at least on of the
reasons, others include making sure that markets are open, etc.), and no,
I don't believe in the tooth fairy. 

     I would imagine that the repayment rates (i.e. number of defaults) is 
about the same as the student loan program, and the money used about 
as wisely. This from someone who went $30,000 in debt for student loans 
to go to Art School...
