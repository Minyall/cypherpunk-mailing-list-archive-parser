No.

Tim May is the first person I've ever encountered who calls himself a
libertarian and yet thinks dropping the Bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki
was justified.  I think that, from a consistent libertarian perspective,
using the Bomb was equivalent to taking out a Mafia chieftain by napalming
the neighborhood in which he lived.  Perhaps the bad guy being targetted was
a killer who deserved to die, but that doesn't justify snuffing his neighbors.
