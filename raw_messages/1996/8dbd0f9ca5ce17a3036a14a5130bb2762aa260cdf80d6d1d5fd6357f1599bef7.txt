They lie.  ("why would anyone need another?")

You can avoid ANI by placing an operator assisted toll free call.
Dial 0, and say, "Hi, I'm getting funny beeps when I try to dial
800-905-1514.  Could you help me place the call?"

(Thats the OKBOMB FBI tip number.  Oddly, the FBI is still offering a
$2m reward for information.  And I thought they had their scapegoat.)

Incidentally, Use of the NAME, INITIALS, or SEAL of the FBI is
restricted by law and may be used only with written permission of the
FBI.  (www.fbi.giv)
