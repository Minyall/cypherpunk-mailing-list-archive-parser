C'punks,

The following is from USA Today of last Friday:

	In a comprehensive study that may reshape the 
	gun control debate, researchers have found that 
	letting people carry concealed guns appears to
	sharply reduce killings, rapes and other violent
	crimes.

	The nationwide study [from the University of
	Chicago] found that violent crime fell after
	states made it legal to carry concealed handguns:
	*   Homicide, down 8.5%.
	*   Rape, down 5%.
	*   Aggravated assault, down 7%.
	...
	The drop isn't primarily caused by people 
	defending themselves with guns, says John Lott,
	the study's author.  Rather, criminals seem to 
	alter their behavior to avoid coming into contact
	with a person who might have a gun.

The official release of the study is scheduled for tomorrow.  
The study took two years and was peer reviewed.
