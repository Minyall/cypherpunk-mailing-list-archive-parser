The problem is whether you can separate the functionality of what you're
exporting sufficiently from what you're contracting out that the exported
material isn't a "component of a cryptosystem"; it's tough to do a good bones
version of code if you're concerned about satisfying both the letter and
spirit of a law to avoid hassles with the government.  On the other hand,
if you're as big as IBM or even MIT, sometimes you can do it....
