Er, I believe the above was clearly intended to mean "for one government
to read another government's mail."

How about:

It is the ethical duty of a responsible government to read other 
government's mail, absent any treaties or gentlemen's agreements to the 
contrary.

It is the ethical duty of a responsible government not to read its own 
citizens' mail without specific probable cause that a crime has occurred 
or is imminent.

It is the ethical duty of responsible citizens to read their own
government's mail, to ensure that their government is behaving ethically. 

The knotty bits concern how much of its own mail the government needs to
disclose, because you can't really disclose it to your own citizens
without effectively disclosing it to the whole world. And how much the 
government can lie, cheat, and steal in purely international affairs. I'd 
answer "a lot" to both.
