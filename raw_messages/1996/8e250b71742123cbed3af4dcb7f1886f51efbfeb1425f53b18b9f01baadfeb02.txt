Hmmhhh....I post about the "Net and Terrorism" on Sunday, and the Viper
Militia and their plans to blow up several courthouses in Phoenix are
revealed a few hours later....Snow posts about using computers to knock out

Boycott "Big Brother Inside" software!
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, we know that that ain't allowed.
