| Good question.

Presumably, the signal has a number of charictaristics.  Some of them
have a central switchboard, where preople go to set up calls.  Most
presumably use a mix of a UDP data connection and tcp for control
functions.  They all consist of high volume, long duration connections
(or data flows in the case of UDP.)  Many probably use a standardized
destination port.  They might use the urgent pointer to force data up
the stack quickly.

	In short, yes the data streams can be easily found, if one can
tap and grep a T3 in real time.
