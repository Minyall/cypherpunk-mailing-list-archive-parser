I started reading this thinking it was actually something important. All it describes 
is a keyboard monitor, which greps for CC#s, and which could be spread by an 
(unspecified) virus, and sends the output to a crook over the net by some (unspecified) 
mechanism.

So, what else is new?

It's sort of interesting that "Nathaniel Borenstein" has a PGP key, but failed to 
clearsign this message, which loudly trumpets it's great import. Considering the
lack of actual content, I feel compelled to warn readers that this may be a forgery, 
designed to make him look like he's scaremongering. 

strictly speaking for myself
