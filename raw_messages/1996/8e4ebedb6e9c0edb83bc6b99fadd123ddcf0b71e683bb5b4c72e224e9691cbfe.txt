I have at hand a brochure from "Shorex 96 - The Premier Offshore
Exhibition" to be held November 20-22 in London.  Day One features a
section on "Offshore and the Internet"  including a panel "Will the
Internet Increase the Market Share of the Offshore Industry?"  Featuring
"Lord Mancroft, Chairman, European Union Bank, Antigua."

I wonder if he'll be there.  If we are both there, I'll ask him.
