Curious, David Skaggs (R-CO) while arguing against having the Rocky
Flats Grand Jury testify before congress on they're findings pointed
out that congress can only offer immunity from prosecution for a
testimony _about_ crimes they may have committed.

In Shimomura's case the crime was committed in front of congress
as _part_ of his testimony.  One could easily argue, as Skaggs did,
that congress oversteped it's bounds by asking a witness to commit
a crime.  Then again, they're the ones who decide what most of
these crimes are in the first place.


Sorry to stray off topic.
