	Folks,

	Lets be reasonable.  Its time to jump on board the GAK
bandwagon.  After all, where better to disrupt the music?  We need to
start writing GAK software, and it better be up to the high standards
that the NSA sets for itself.

	Once we've written it, and its being distributed, we can say
'See, another broken bit of GAK software.  Not even the NSA could get
it right.  Our data is too important to be using broken software to
protect us.'

	And we have 56 bit exportability in hand.
