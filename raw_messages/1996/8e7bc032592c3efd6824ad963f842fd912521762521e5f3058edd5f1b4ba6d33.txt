I took a look at it a few days ago, and am disappointed.

As near as I can tell, from the comments by Kahn and from looking at it,
the new edition is _exactly_ the same as the 1967 edition, with the
exception of one additional chapter. The last chapter covers the Enigma
story in detail.

However, the public key cryptography revolution is covered in about two or
three pages (or at least this is my recollection). Brief mention is made of
Diffie, Hellman, etc., but nothing surprising or new.

So, it seems a better deal is to get one of the many used copies of the
original, for $20 or less, and then read any of the many good articles on
modern cryptography.

I'm hoping the new edition of Bamford is handled better.
