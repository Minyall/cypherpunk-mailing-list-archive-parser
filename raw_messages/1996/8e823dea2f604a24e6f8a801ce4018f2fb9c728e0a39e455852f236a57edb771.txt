I have to admit I haven't read the Leahy bill in detail.  But
I do get a little hinky whenever Congress tries to "help" us, 
so it seems reasonable to look for the worm in every legislative 
apple--the Leahy bill included.

Having said that, I am totally put off by the gradiose and 
devisive ravings of this commentator.  During the Second World 
War the Nazis required Jews in the occupied countries to wear a
yellow star of David to identify themselves.  In Denmark, the
king so identified himself, and soon so did most of his subjects. 

In that grand tradition of solidarity with persecuted minorities 
I request that I be added to anonymous' "LIST OF SHAME."  It is 
MY protest against this utter nonsense.  (I have always felt 
cheated that I was too young and politically naive to make the 
Nixon Enemies List.  I've made it up some since then with a fat 
FBI file, but it just isn't the same.)

A CYPHERPUNK CALL TO ARMS!!!

(Did I get the style right?)  C'punks, if you feels as I do, 
please take a few moments to sign up for the LIST OF SHAME?  
Let's show Bill, Bruce, Matt and all the others what most 
Cypherpunks really think about them and Mr/Ms Anonymous.
