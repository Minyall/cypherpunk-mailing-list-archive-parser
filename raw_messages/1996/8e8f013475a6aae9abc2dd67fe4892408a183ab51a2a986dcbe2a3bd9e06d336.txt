Oh, those WhoWhere? guys are just a bunch of pussycats.

The fact that you're sending postcards is only a problem if you don't want
them to be read. It's more the email I receive that I worry about, so all 
my friends use the address rich@alpha.c2.org now.

You should only worry about men in the middle when you're playing
volleyball. The endpoints are usually far more vulnerable.
