While I haven't tried this particular kludge, taking a VSC equipped tape
player (Radio Shack used to sell these, and may still) inserting an 
automotive cassette-stereo CD adapter (the inductive coupling kind that 
are built into cassette shells) and driving that with a cheap mike & low 
power audio amp ... should enable you to lower your voice pitch 
substantially.

Have fun,
-Doug
