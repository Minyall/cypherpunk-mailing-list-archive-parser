Since "everybody" is supposed to agree that the Leahy encryption bill is 
dead, dead, dead, I don't see this as being any kind of problem.  It was 
disliked by Clinton and the Denning-types, and with the exception of a short 
flurry of mistaken optimism around here, it was roundly excoriated here as 
well.  

The one thing I found disgustingly amusing was the statement from the letter:

They seem to have to do an "analysis" of a two-year study.  Harrummmph!
