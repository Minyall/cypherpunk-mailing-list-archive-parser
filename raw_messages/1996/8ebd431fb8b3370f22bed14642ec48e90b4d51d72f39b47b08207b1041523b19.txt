Dust will cause diffraction of the beam (at a reduced intensity, of course).  
Near the source, a detector tuned narrowly to the wavelength of interest would 
probably succeed quickly.  If you have a line of sight channel, there are 
many other ways to signal that will preserve some deniability.
