	Well, the "danger" of posting a static IP must be even
	greater than with a temporary IP.

	Just call the police if you uncover a bonafide case of a
	denial of service attack.  From what I gather, they take
	this shit seriously, and have better capacities of
	getting lazy admins to reveal the relevent data in their
	logs.
