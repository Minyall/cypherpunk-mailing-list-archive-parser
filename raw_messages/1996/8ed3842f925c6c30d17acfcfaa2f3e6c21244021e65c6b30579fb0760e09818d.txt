Hi Evan,

Thanks for that lovely peice about the Chiapas uprising. I'm saving it to 
disk. It's so archtypal of the turgid prose of graduates of Moscow's 
Patrice Lumumba University. How wondrous that leftists-without-a-home can 
find a cause to latch onto and keep their rhetorical skills in practice.

Want to come with me tomorrow? I'm going down to the library to re-read
the history of the Indians of Meso-America.  I like the part about the
hundreds of thousands of peasants who had their hearts cut out without
anesthesia, so that the Emperor could collect lots of taxes on an abundant
harvest.  Damn shame that the Spaniards came along and destroyed a
culture, ya know?
