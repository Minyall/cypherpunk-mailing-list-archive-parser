Earlier, someone mocked someone else for being paranoid.  Sorry, but
this is a mistake.  By definition, you have a non-empty threat model
when you set out to encrypt; therefore you must be paranoid to use
encryption.  Or else they really *could* be out to get you, but
sometimes it's not possible to tell, and you have to assume that they
are.
