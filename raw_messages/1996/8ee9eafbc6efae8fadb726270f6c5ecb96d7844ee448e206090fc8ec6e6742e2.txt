The current Thinking Machines is a software firm, and Daniel Hillis is no
longer amongst the top management.  The name lives on, but the business
of designing, building, and selling exotic supercomputers is kaput.

Corporation still exists in a transmogrified form, although their
mainframe business went up in smoke ages ago.
