This fascist move by the U.S. government is a huge threat to our liberty.
It may be time to simply give up on communicating with these assholes and
give them the treatment they have earned.

And this a very big one indeed. Not only does it probably put organizations
like C2 out of business, at least in terms of supporting the development of
things like the South African and British Web products, but it also may
mean the *Cypherpunks list itself*, and some of its members, are ipso facto
in violation of this "giving comfort to the enemy" (to paraphrase) language!

This may mean, subject to the usual legal system review (a scapegoat is
targetted, a court case is filed, several years of Zimmermann limbo follow,
etc.), that members of this list may be construed to be engaging in
"certain financing, contracting, service, support, transportation, freight
forwarding, or employment that you know will assist in certain
proliferation activities described further in part 744 of the EAR."

Certainly "support" and "service" of these products. Is giving a user
advice on "Stronghold" now to be a felony? How about PGP, which certainly
has not received export approval? And so on.

This very list advocates violation of the ITARs in various ways (I speak of
"the list" as a person in the sense of the consensus of the list...there
may not be unanimity, but the consensus of the vocal members of the list is
obvious).


It may be time for us to go underground. It may be time to take much, much,
much, much more extreme steps. This fascism is unacceptable.
