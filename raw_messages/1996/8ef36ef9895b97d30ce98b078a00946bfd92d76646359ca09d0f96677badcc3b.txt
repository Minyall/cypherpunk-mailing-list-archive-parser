So what the fuck?  That matters not.  The point is that the 
cypherpunks is an "all or nothing" proposition.  There is no
"in between" allowed any more.  After a certain level, EVERYTHING
reaches the "public doamin," and that is the *common-law of
cyberspace.*

Steve Boursy says all of this should go to UseNet, so it goes.
