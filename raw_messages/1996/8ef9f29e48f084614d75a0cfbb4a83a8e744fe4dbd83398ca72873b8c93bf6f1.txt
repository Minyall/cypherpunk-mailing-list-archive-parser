Nothing in the real world is perfect, ideal, or even relatively close to 
either one.  If you want to really solve your problems, it will not 
likely be in running away, but in getting some therapy (seriously).

As far as Fascist goes, fascism is fun enough when everyone gets to 
participate, but I get the idea you feel "some of the pigs are more 
equal than others", if you know what I mean, and I think you do.

I haven't been on the list more than 6-8 weeks, but in that time, it's 
been more interesting than I would have guessed for a non-technical 
forum, which isn't necessarily good, but this is the real world.
