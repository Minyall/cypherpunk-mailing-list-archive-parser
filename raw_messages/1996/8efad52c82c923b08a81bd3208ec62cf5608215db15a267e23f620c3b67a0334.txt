   I am a defender of your right to not be harrassed by legal-definition 
nuisances, not a fashion cop.  I gave up on trying to clean up the 
unwashed masses, a long time ago.

But if your definition of "lounging" includes (say) playing your boombox as 
loud as you want in the park - then mine includes making a buck by burning 
toxic waste.
