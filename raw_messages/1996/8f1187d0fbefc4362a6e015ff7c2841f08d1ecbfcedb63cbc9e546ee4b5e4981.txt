I wasn't thinking of liability, just capacity.

And you don't understand political harrassment suits.
Would you believe that someone worth $50,000 could be served a
$10,200,000 judgement by a jury, fully upheld by the Oregon and U.S.
Supreme courts, Dwelling, business, custumers' property seized,
25% of income annexed for 20 years, all by the plaintiff with
the assistance of the court, merely for publicy speaking to a crowd,
the advocacy of violence, when later that night two members of the
audience murdered a stranger apparantly following that "advice,"
with the plaintiff publicly gloating before|during|post trial, that the
actual violence was merely a VEHICLE for the SUPPRESSION of the
organization of the advocacy of the ENTIRE political spectrum of the
defendants?

Ask our resident "free speech for RESPECTABLE dissidents,"
L. Lurch@stanford.edu (racial capitali$t d0g)
for a virulent defense of Co$ style tactics against racists.
Ask him about SPLC, Seraw vs WAR, Tom, John METZGER.

Straight from the horses ass, go to the library and read 89-93 issues
of KLANWATCH to find out what lying oriental anti-racists
are ADVOCATING and GETTING.

What the hell is the difference between the anti-racist tactics
of Co$ and SPLC, and being forced to your knees by the policeman's
nightstick, merely for advocating "moronic" politics? 
The VIOLENCE to free speech rights is the same.

Do you really think that SPLC and Co$ sue to raise funds?

True, I doubt he would take the risk.  What we mean is that once
an EASY remailer tech is distributed, THOUSANDS will seriously be
interested in it.  After all, did the complexity of linux keep
100,000+ unix newbies from learning *ix from scratch?

Ugh.  I've got a 386 and 4megs, partitioned and compiled linux, pgp,
Mixmaster.  It WILL work once mastering the darned thing.

IMHO, the IDEAL remailer is the following:

What CAN be done right now, with anyone with linux and shell unix,
account paid by fake name/address with postal money order,
is have the linux machine dial up the account, several times a day,
process the mailbox, download the mail, process the mail with pgp or 
mixmaster, upload to account, post/email with the appropriate 
header lines and VOILA!!  

!!!!!!!!!! FULL FEATURED HACKTIC STYLE REMAILER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Unfortunately I DON'T know how to DO any of this.
Isn't someone else want to crank something out and share?
Post around instructions for the clueless to follow.

There.  The number of full featured remailers increases from 0 to 100-300+.
