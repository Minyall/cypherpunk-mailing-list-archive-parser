Rather unlikely, actually. Dyson is far better known, everywhere but the
Internet early-adopter crowd, as publisher of Release 1.0 and an industry 
analyst. Same goes for a lot of our other boardmembers. Who many people 
outside of the civ-lib crowd know Jane Metcalfe from EFF, vs. from Wired? 
Even Mitch Kapor is better know as founder of Lotus than of EFF. A lot of 
press coverage she gets never even mentions EFF at all!  Barlow's 
probalby the only exception - retired ranchers and songwriters who aren't 
also singers generally don't attract many reporters.
