I expect that as corporations move to the net, they will not have the
highly centralized structure of existing corporations.  In any case
this structure is in large part imposed by the state in order to 
facilitate tax collection.  For example the existence of the 
"Human resources department" is largely the result of state 
coercion of corporations.  In web businesses ones primary 
relationship will be with ones immediate coworkers, rather than
the greater corporation.

They will consist rather of a network of relationships -- contracting
will move up, and the Keiretsu structure will move down.  I expect
the institutional structure will resemble that of the mafia -- a loose
confederation of networks rather than tight whole. Thus defection
by one party can only cause limited damage.

In my judgement the Keiretsu form of economic organization is growing 
in large part because of improved communications and lowered 
communication costs.

The Keiretsu form does not in itself facilitate tax evasion, but it
does mean that the state has to apply coercion more directly to
more people in order to collect taxes, and that its coercion has 
to be more visibly arbitrary and disruptive.

In order to do business, one will need a good name (or good nym).

If one does not have a good name, one will be poor.  That is why
I said "every man his own credit bureau".

Existing forms of ecash are costly and inconvenient, hence unsuitable
for spending in tiny quantities.  I expect that
in the not very distant future every shop will offer its own cash,
and that some of these will be in the form of millicents -- suitable
for automatic lightly supervised transactions between computers.  

I expect the transaction cost advantage will eventually be on the side
of electronic money, rather than physical money.
