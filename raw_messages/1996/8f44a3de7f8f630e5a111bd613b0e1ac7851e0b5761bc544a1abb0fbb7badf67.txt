	The problem I have is with the "hardly ever" part - there is always
a chance of being caught out. I prefer the idea of something that can be
verified - like the lawsuit against Mondex. Making a case with documentation
is more impressive, IMHO.

	This is interesting, as the UK police don't claim they need such
powers to deal with the IRA. Now they may already have large wiretapping
powers under law, but I get the impression that most successful anti-IRA
action is due either to infiltration or informers.

>pedophiles in great hordes lurking on the net,

	I know the scares are overblown - there are paedophiles on the net,
but not as many as, say, the tabloid press would claim.

>the infamous 'If you knew what I have been confidentially told' and so on.

	This argument alone would make me suspicious of the claimant.

	IIRC, the bullshit claims are enough to annoy most netizens, though
the politicians aren't aiming at us. Still - I think documented risks of,
say, Mondex would hold more weight.
