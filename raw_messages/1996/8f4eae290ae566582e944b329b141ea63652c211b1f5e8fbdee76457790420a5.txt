I think you missed my point (run on sentences do that :).

To give one of the standard illustrations; I've written a short story, and
the evil mind-control freaks at Analog and IASFM refuse to publish it with
the flimsy excuse of it being crap and written in crayon.  You are not
required to send me millions of dollars so I can publish it myself. 
Howevr, if I did raise the millions of dollars, and TPTB tried to stop me
from publishing, there would be an obligation to fight that censorship by
permitting me to publish. 

Freedom of speech means that it other peoples speech shouldn't be 
censored; however there is no obligation for anyone to fund or lend other 
support towards that speech.  This situation is somewhat complicated in 
that in order to fight the censorship, the mirror sites must 
're-publish' the material; however as a side effect they are also 
publishing the material in a  prominent way to people whose access has 
not been censored.
