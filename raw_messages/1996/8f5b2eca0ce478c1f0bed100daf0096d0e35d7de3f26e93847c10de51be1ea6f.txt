Mischief is true.  However it does get back to the eventual question:  if they
are giving off radiation, are we guilty receiving them?   For instance, if you
have your pot sensing IR camera in a plane, do you need a search warrant?   If
you walk around with a scanner listening to cell-phones is it illegal?

One can also imagine a sewer worker getting sued for looking out of one of
those cover grill things. (Perhaps up at a cover girl. Pun intended.)
