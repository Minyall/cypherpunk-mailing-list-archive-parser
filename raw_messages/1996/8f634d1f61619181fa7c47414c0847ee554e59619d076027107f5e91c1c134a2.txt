He couldn't, at least not in Oklahoma.  In Oklahoma, students in public
schools are now required to have SSN's.  This may not apply to private
schools, but I imagine that it does, at least to some degree.  Having a high
school education is certainly necessary to gain the Masters necessary to be
an engineer.
However, getting a drivers liscense should be easy.  My sisters drivers
liscense number is one that was randomly generated, all because she did not
know her SSN off of the top of her head.  My drivers liscense number is the
same as my SSN, all because I know my state mandated serial number.  For all
practical purposes, I am Roach, Sean 447-xx-xxxx.  Note, 447 refers to the
state of my birth.  My sisters record is at least a little more convoluted.
