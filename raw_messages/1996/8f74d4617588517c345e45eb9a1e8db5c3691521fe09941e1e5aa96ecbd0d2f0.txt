  The navigator will not differentiate them.  We build in a default set of
CA certificates into the navigator, and then allow the user to modify them as
they see fit based on their local trust policy.  The default set of CAs that
we ship with our product will not include the verisign level 1&2 CAs as trusted
SSL Server CAs.
