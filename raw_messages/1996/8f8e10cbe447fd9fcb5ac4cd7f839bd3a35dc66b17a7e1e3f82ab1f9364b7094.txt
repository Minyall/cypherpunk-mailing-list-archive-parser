Not a hoax.  On occasion people signup on various web sites requiring a
username and password with this list name as the e-mail contact and the user
ID and password as "cypherpunk".  Because of that, occasionally spam from
such accounts shows up here, adding to the noise level.

I find it annoying, but I just filter it and go on with my life.
