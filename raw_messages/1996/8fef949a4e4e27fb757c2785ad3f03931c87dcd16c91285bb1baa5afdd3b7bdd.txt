The one by Shane Simpson thoughtfully examines the way 
technology is affecting the sharing of information once 
considered to be proprietary or secret or private. Among other 
topics, it also explores the release of government information, 
prying by Big Bro in the "public interest" and other 
long-standing practices being re-shaped by technology. Some 
mention of the spread of cryptography and the consequent power 
disputes.
