So, add the code to mixmaster (and even the old style remailers) to
collect e-cash as it passes on the anonymous message. Then this will
be a good way to accumulate some e-cash, and a number of people will
try running remailers for this very purpose. Witness the recent
Usenet spam by someone advertizing a for-pay remailer.

Nor should there be.  What's one person's abuse is another person's
free speech.  Internet traffic should not be censored based on contents.
