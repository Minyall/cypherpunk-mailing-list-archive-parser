I often have trouble with foreign passports and one of my associates often
has extensive problems trying to use an american passport for anything in
the United States.

Comments uttered in my presence on the subject have included:

"We don't accept THOSE."

"Sorry, we need to see OFFICIAL identification."

"Don't you have something state issued?"

"Uh, we need a driver's license number."
