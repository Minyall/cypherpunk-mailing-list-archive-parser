How about a Kerberos packet?

Kerberos is a time-honored system.  There are a number of citations
that can be provided to prove that it is in use (perhaps heavy use?)
on Wall Street.

Alternatively, how about a Netscape SSL packet encrypted with DES?

I will volunteer to provide such a challenge if anyone is going to
undertake a serious keysearch effort.
