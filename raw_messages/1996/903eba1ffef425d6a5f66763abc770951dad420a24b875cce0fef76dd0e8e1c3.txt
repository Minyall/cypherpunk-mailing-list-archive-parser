More info on tomorrow's terrorism conference at CATO is at:

 http://www.cato.org/events/calendar.html

This is especially timely given the report that the Aviation Safety and
Security Commission (chaired by Gore) sent to Clinton with 20
recommendations. One is to enact "automated passenger profiling" of all
domestic travellers, which would include airline access to FBI/CIA
databases. This $10 million project bans anonymous air travel and, needless
to say, raises significant privacy questions.
