Iwas wondering if anyone could pint me to a DETAILED description of the 
internet routing system.  Basically how a message gets from my computer 
to another lets say in Europe.  No need for simplicity I would like a 
real description.  Dont worry abpout protocols just where my message 
goes.  Also does anyone have a list of where the net's routers are 
located and who runs them.  Also their respective routing speeds at the 
current times.

Thank You ahead of time!
