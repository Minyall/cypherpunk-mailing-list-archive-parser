Given the recent comments about insecure machines, I thought it was
interesting to note that you can clear *every* password on an NT box by using
a diskeditor to corrupt the password file (Boot off of a floppy and use
NTFSDOS if you have to).  It'll reboot several times and then you'll be
allowed to login.
