Well, this is what in private e-mail to Peter I was referring to when I
said "only a police state" could pull the plug on free speech and strong
crypto once it was ubiquitously deployed.

Throwing people in prison for life for using crypto is something that is
certainly _possible_, though I rather doubt taxpayers will be keen on
paying for this. Simply executing those who use random numbers makes more
sense.

All implausible, of course.

By the way, I've never claimed that I know crypto anarchy is irreversible,
I just think it is. I've presented some plausibility arguments on why I
think this is so, drawing parallels to other developments in history, but
logical proofs and predictions about the future don't usually go together
very well.

We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
