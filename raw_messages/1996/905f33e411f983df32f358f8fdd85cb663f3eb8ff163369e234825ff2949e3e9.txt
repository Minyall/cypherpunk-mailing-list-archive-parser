Schneier actually used my explanation of why this won't work in the Second
Edition of his book.

Basically, with any strong. modern cipher, there is no concept of "getting
closer" to a solution. Thus, the "fitness landscape" for a
brute-force-needed cipher looks like a flat plain (if portrayed in two
dimensions), with the solution/key being a single-point spike rising from
the plain. No hill-climber can find this spike except by landing right on
it, which means evolutionary programming, genetic algorithms, simulated
annealing, and neural net sorts of approaches are worthless.

With some weak ciphers, this might work. I think Schneier makes some
comments about who's looked at this. But weak ciphers are not too
interesting.
