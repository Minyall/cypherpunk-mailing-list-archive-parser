I was under the impression that you couldn't libel/slander a dead
person. Mainly because libel/slander is a offence against reputation
which dead people don't care much for, but also because once you go
against this principle where in hell (no pun intended) do you draw the
line.

Of course my impressions tend to be based around the legal system I've
lived in all my life...
