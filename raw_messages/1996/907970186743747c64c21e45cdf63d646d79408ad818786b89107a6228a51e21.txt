As usual, Blaze/AT&T uses cypherpunks to spread FUD from it's NSA masters.
This time, however, he's stolen the work of others and twisted it to suit
the corporate goals. Bet his next message is a commercial from AT&T for the
clipper chip, which, they will ass-u-re us, fixes this socalled <<attack>>.
Someone should sue Blaze and AT&T.

Blaze, who is a wellknown homosexual Jew, probably can expect a nice bonus
in next weeks blood money check for thinking of this latest little stunt,
so I'm sure he can afford the legal fees. Just a cost of doing biz, right?

Shame on him!

p.S. I know this post sounds angry but this kind of shit just pisses me off
so much.
