A bootable CD-ROM from a reliable source to verify signatures would be much
safer than no signatures at all.  Even just running the signature
verification program from CD-ROM would make an attacker's problem more
difficult.

BTW - The problem is not trusted hardware.  It is software that can isolate
untrusted programs and protect itself.  Anything with an A or B NCSC
security rating would certainly be attractive.  Trusted signature
verification hardware accessed by a compromised system can't be trusted. 
(How do you know what was given to the hardware to be verified?  How do you
know that the answer came from the hardware?)
