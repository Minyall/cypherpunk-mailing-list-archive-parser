So, I take it you have no problems with me as a private individual
selling information about you to the highest bidder so long as I don't
file letters of incorporation?  This is a silly distinction.

But more to the point: The word corporate does not necessarily denote a
huge company with millions of dollars in revenue, thousands of employees
and stock publicly traded on the NYSE.  Most "corporations" are small
companies, one or two or a few employees.  Every time the government-as-
nanny types come up with a new law "to protect us from the evil
corporations", every company big and small is saddled with additional
costs and hassles.  This means dollars to you and me, either directly --
because you're an owner or employee of the company -- or indirectly --
because the price of goods sold increases.  Why is this so hard to grasp?

Yes, it *IS* unreasonable as applied to information.  If you don't want
an individual or company to have information about you, don't give it
to them.  Pay cash for your purchases.  Or make them (contractually)
agree not to release the information.  Sure, it may cost you extra
dollars, and sometimes they may not be willing, so you'll have to take
your business elsewhere or live with the realization that you're trading
convenience (and other benefits) for privacy.
