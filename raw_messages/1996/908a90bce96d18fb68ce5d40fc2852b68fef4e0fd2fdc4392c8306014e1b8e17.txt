There was a piece, I _think_ in Scientific American, tho it might have been
an AI journal, on face recognition by use of neural nets together with what
were called "eigenface" images: 
These eigenfaces each have specific characteristics, which when combined
together can closely approximate a specific face image.  The target face was
analyzed in terms of closeness-of-match to a small set of eigenfaces, on the
order of 5 to 8, I think.  Results of course were promising (else why write
about it, eh?) if not excellent.
