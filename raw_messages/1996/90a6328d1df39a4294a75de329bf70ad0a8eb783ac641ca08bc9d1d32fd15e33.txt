Perhaps not the lawmakers, but...

There was this moment last summer, on a Friday, when loose
talk on the cp-list (and, explicitly, some comments from TC May)
made me 99% sure that selling Netscape stock (short) would be a
great idea. Still next Monday it sold for something like $145.
Next Wednesday it fell to around $120. I know for sure that if
I had been in a position then to conveniently (and immediately)
act on the NY Stock Exchange (which I was not) I would have
risked something like $5,000 on such a deal - I'm not rich but
so strong was the cypherpunkish momentum towards this development.
