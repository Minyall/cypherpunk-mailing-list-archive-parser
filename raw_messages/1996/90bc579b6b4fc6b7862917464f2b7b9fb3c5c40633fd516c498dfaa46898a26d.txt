Agreed. (After all, I'm one of the creators of the spec, so how
couldn't I agree :) However, SSH is a neat hack for today -- I use it
for connecting over the net to machines where I can't hack the
operating system but can drop SSH on. An SSH like interface (actually,
Berkeley r-command like interface) will still be needed into the
future, btw.

Yup. This is a frequently missed point. Link security and object
security have different uses at different times -- and people confuse
them way too often.
