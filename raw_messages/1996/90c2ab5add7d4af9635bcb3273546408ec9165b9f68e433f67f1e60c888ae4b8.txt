   I created a nym with a public key.  Now, it's become the default so
when I go to send an encrypted message, I get prompted to enter the
password for my nym key.
   So, for the $64,000 question: How I can get my *original* public key (the one with my
"real" email address) to again be the default.
   Thx.
