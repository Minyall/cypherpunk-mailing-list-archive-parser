Illogical collectivist claptrap.  When a taxpayer is targeted by 
terrorists, he has been victimized twice--first by the government 
that stole his money, second by the terrorist that punished him
for the (alleged) acts others commited with that money.  If a
mugger buys a gun with the money he took from me, am I then
responsible for the murder he commits with it?  Clearly not.  
This line of "reasoning" is nothing more than a sad variant of 
the old, "blame the victim" game.  For shame.

Let's bring this back to crypto for a moment.  Dimitri's "logic"
must necessarily lead one to the conclusion that Cypherpunks (at
least those in the US) are responsible for whatever draconian
restrictions "our" government puts on free speech, crypto or
whatever.  John Gilmore, Philip Zimmermann, Whit Diffie and 
others will be chagrined to learn this, I'm sure.

Dimitri needs to learn what it means to be an adult.  Everyone is 
totally responsible for what they do, but ONLY for what THEY do.  
No one is responsible for the unassisted, willful acts of others.
