I'm in the process of writing a freeware  IRC client in Visual Basic 3
and wanted to encorporate a secure variant of DCC chat.  Trouble is I
can't find a precompiled library that has either RSA or DH in it.
This doesn't do me much good as I don't even own a Windows C
compiler... (is that a crime in some countries? :) )

I'll appreciate any help you folks could give..
