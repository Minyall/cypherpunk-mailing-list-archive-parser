This is definitely the way to go when trying to break a block
cipher on the Net.  Partitioning out sieving works well for
distributed factoring only because verfying the submitted
relations requires a trivial amount of computer time compared
that expended in locating them.  There is no way for a central
server to verify a claim that a chunk of DES keyspace has been
thoroughly searched without a key being found, and it only takes
one bozo or saboteur to spoil the effort.

At triple the non-overlapping search time, we get about a 5%
chance of failure.  At quadruple, this falls to slightly less
than 2%.

Close enough for government work.
