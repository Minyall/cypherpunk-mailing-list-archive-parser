Considering that most engineering and computer science classses are
approaching 50 percent non-U.S.-citizen, and considering that no such
professors have yet been busted, I'm inclined to think this is a
non-threat.

(Indeed, it's a _potential_ threat, and one we should bear in mind, but it
seems likely that no such prosecutions have occurred or will occur.)

What we talk about every day on this list and the non-prosecution of any of
us should be evidence about where the real emphasis is. (The investigation
of Zimmermann and Goen was related to the appearance on foreign shores of a
real chunk of code, PGP 1.0, and not simple communication with aliens.)

No, could you provide some details? Who was pressured? Micali? Goldwasser?
Rackoff? Please share the details.

There has been an ineffective "voluntary review" process for academic
researchers, and perhaps this is what Dimitri is referring to. But this did
not stop the publication of the ZKIPS work a decade or so ago.
