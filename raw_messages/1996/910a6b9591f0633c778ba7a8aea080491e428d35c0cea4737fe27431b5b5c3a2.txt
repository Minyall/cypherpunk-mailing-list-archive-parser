Well, Bofur, the alleged RC2 code is, at most, "just another cipher."

The issue of the Germans disconnecting from parts of the Net, as a means of
pressuring sites to get material removed, and the bypasses (such as proxies
and mirror sites at CMU, MIT, and Stanford), is just as important, if not
more so.

In any case, Bofur, if you want to talk about RC2, talk about it. Nobody's
stopping you.
