  Allen, 
 
 
  Here's another one, fresh out: 
 
 
      Daniel Lynch and Leslie Lundquist. 
 
      Digital Money. The New Era of Internet Commerce. 
 
      1996.  304 pages.  $24.95. 
 
      John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 
 
      1 800 22 559 4539. 
 
      ISBN 0 471 14178 X. 
 
 
 
  From the blurb: 
 
      It explains the technical underpinnings of transactions, 
      including encryption and digital signatures, and details 
      the resources and procedures involved in establishing an 
      exchange-capable service. 
 
 
  Cordially, 
 
  Jim
