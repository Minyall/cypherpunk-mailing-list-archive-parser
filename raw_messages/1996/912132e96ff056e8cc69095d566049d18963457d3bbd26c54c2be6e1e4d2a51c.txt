Postage is most needed at the point of delivery.

That is the node that will be taking the heat/paying the lawyers.  I'd
operate a remailer if I was never the last node, becuase I don't have
a site that can take the heat/seizure of machines for me.  If we pay
those final nodes to do more, than intermediate nodes can still carry
cover traffic for free.
