Reputations are usefull for more than just getting a job.  If a nym developes
reputation, people may be more likely to trust (or not, depending on the kind
of reputation the nym has earned) a post or e-mail sent from that nym than from
someone who has no reputation.

It is possible to have more than one nym.  You could use each nym to develop
a different reputation.  For instance, one nym could be very knowledgable in
the field of cryptography, and another could be a really good golf player.
There is no reason for anyone to know that these two nyms are used by the same
person because most people on a newsgroup like rec.sports.golf probably
couldn't care less about your interest in cryptography.

I do think that in any situation where both anonymity and reputation are
desired, nyms are of great use.  When you need reputation and not
anonymity, True Names should be used.
