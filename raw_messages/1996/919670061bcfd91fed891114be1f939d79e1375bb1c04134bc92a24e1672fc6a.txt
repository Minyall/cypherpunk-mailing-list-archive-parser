"Translation: I'm too chicken to say yes, but don't want to look like a 
chicken by saying no, so I'll delay this as far as I can.  Meanwhile, 
I'll spam those who point this out with 48kb spam messages of pure 
bullshit and pretend that their ancestors are responsible for said 
actions in bullshit spam message."
