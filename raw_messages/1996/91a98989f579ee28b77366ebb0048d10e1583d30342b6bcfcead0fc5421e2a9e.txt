I think the analogy breaks down here.  No one is using anyone
else as a decoy.  Those of us who are activists for strong
crypto, do so of our own free will.  Nobody is forcing us to 
stand up and draw fire.  Anyway, I don't think our cypher-snipers 
are going to stop, just because we ask them to.  So it's a moot 
issue.  If you can't take the heat...
