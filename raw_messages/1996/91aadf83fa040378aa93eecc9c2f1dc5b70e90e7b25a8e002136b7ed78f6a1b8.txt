	Umm... doesn't that allow code with a faked signature to be temporarily
trusted, long enough to possibly do some damage? For instance, in fetching
sub-classes, what is the code allowed to "know" in fetching them? Such
information could be sent out, including by what the code was requesting.
	Sorry if the above is not applicable; please explain why not, if so.
