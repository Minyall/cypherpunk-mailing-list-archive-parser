Indeed, it was. In a beautiful-to-me scene which Miami's WSVN, Channel 7 
(our big-hair station) called "chilling," Korean-American shopkeepers, 
perched atop their building with semi-automatic firearms, kept one block 
safe while the rest of the neighborhood burned without police protection. 
Upon being informed that this was a biased interpretation of legitimate 
actions by the merchants, which _I_ found heartwarming, they said that 
chilling was "just a word." 
JMR  -- "'Media bias' is just 2 words."
