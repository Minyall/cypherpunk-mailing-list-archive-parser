There is one, but I don't have the URL handy.  Hopefullly someone will
chime in with it.

Personally, I can't wait to check out the Eudora support in PGPmail 4.5,
the new, commercial version of the software from PGP Inc.  Supposedly
it has a special toolbar for Eudora users, plus some other GUI
enhancements for 95 users, like encryption through Windows Explorer.

It should be out sometime in January, and the price point had not been
determined yet, AFAIK.  You don't need a commercial version if you're
not using it for business purposes, but I may pony up for a copy anyway if
it turns out to be as cool as it sounds.

Check www.pgp.com for more info...
