	Why does everyone licensing Microsloth's MS-DOS
implementation?  If (If :) there's a bug in MS's implementation, then
that bug . . . .  It's done, it's available, it (mostly) works.  I
believe that there's a Mac version called Roaster for Macs that even
came out before Sun had a Mac port.

	But when we get signed classes you'll at least know whom to go
after if it does.

	Client would be kinda difficult to do until there's a crypto
lib available.  Either that, or you'd have to load it from local disk
so you could run PGP (the security model for applet hosts such as NS
prevents exec'ing outside programs from code thats loaded from the
network) which kinda defeats the purpose of doing it in Java (aside
from a single cross platform front end).  A server, being a stand
alone app most likely, would be doable but again you'ld need a native
PGP for the crypto.
