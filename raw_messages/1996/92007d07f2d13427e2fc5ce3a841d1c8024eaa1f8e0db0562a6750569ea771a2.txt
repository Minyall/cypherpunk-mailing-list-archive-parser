	Depends on what you mean by graphical PGP shell, but no.  Exmh
(Tk front end for the MH mail reader) has had PGP support for ages.

	IF you really wanted to do such a thing, the best aproach would
be to do it as a C extension (so it could be dynamically loaded with
the new dl support) or if you're a real massochist do it in [incr tcl]
so that the bignums are objects (of a sort).
