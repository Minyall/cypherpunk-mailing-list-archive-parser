	Thanks, I'll check. I don't happen to _have_ a copy of Applied
Cryptography, etcetera, immediately available, and I had gotten the impression
that those concentrated on cyphers as opposed to codes.

	I never said I was interested in putting stuff about codes into
practical usage. Actually, I'm a roleplaying gamer, and I wanted the info for
historical settings. True codes appear to be the historical equivalent of OTPs.
