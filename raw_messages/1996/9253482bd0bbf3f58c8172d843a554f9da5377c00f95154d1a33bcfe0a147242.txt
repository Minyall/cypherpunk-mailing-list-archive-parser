Of course there are other Western Countries that will let you in with the
intent of Arresting you (and possibly extradite you to a 3rd Country since
you are not Guilty of anything in the Extraditing Country except for being
on the 3rd Country's "Wanted List". There was a big stink a while ago about
someone being shipped to Germany on one of these International Pick-Up
Warrants.
