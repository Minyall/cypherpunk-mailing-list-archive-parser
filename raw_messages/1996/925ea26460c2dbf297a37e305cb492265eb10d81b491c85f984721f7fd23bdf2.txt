* I can see it now. Apartments full of geeks because the apartments 
* were originally built with 100BaseX to each place and a T3 in the 
* basement going direct to the local ISP.
* 
* Tack on another $200/month or whatever to the apartment cost ( geeks 
* can afford that for sure ) and one might end up having a pretty nice 
* online melrose place.
* 
* I wonder if anybody has done that yet...

Yes, it has already happened, although in a slightly different
context.  The Georgia Tech campus dormatories got wired with Ethernet
back in 1994, and there was quite a rush by the sizable geek
population to get dorm rooms in the buildings slated to get
installation first.  It worked out quite well, especially the privacy
aspects, as the dorm routers encrypted all packets so only the
intended Ethernet node could receive it (at least that is what they
said).  

So, in this case it was only 10BaseT and gatech.edu as the ISP, but it
still was very neat.
