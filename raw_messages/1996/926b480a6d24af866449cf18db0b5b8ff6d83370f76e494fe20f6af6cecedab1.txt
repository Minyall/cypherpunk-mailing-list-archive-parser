Having exchanged e-mail in the past with Lance Deitweller, I have to conclude
that Vladimir Z. Nuri is NOT Lance, since Lance is actually pretty sharp.

One of the reasons why I don't like Sovoks is that when they're at loss for
words, they resort to name-calling. Your rants hardly deserve any response
other than *plonk*, and you have the gall to bitch that it's "shallow"?

Just watch me ignore it, just as my site ignores all cancels.

Not for me.  Not for most sysadmins or readers who have better things to
do than worry that someone posted something inappropriate to Usenet.

Read Dave Hayes's FAQ.

I said: "Internet traffic should not be censored BASED ON CONTENTS." If the
above actually casued my site problems based on the volume, it would result
in reprecussions for the perpetrator, irrespective of contents.

All of the so-called "spam" combined is a miniscule percentage of Usenet
traffic, less than almost any single alt.binaries. newsgroup.  It can
be easily ignored using a newsreader that processes NoCeM's.

I.e., not a problem, except for some anal-retentive control freaks longing
for their beloved Soviet Union, and their ilk on news.admin.net-abuse.*.

I'm a news admin.  You're not and you don't know what you're talking about.

You have a problem with other people saying something that you can't
control.  With this attitude, I suggest you limit your reading to
soc.culture.russian.moderated.
