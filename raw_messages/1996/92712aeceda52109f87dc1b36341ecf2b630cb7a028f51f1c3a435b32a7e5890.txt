What you saw was a prior incarnation of PGP3.  What we have does look
farily similar to that old spec.  But I think that the new spec is a
lot easier to understand and use.  Hopefully the spec will get to a
state where it can be released for public consumption really soon.

I dont know.  I dont work for ViaCrypt, and they have been fairly
secretive in their work.  For all I know, they've made ViaCrypt PGP
4.0 completely incompatible with PGP 2.6.2 and PGP3.
