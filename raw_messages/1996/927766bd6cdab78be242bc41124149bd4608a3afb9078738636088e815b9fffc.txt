Uh, okay, I didn't mean to suggest that attacks would be entirely 
eliminated.  (The term "deterred" really needed to be quantified there, even 
for a native English speaker.)

But my main point was that (as evidenced by Brian Davis' unwillingness to 
acknowledge that the people who run the system will engage in illegality to 
stop AP) there is a certain hesitancy on the part of the "ruling class" to 
abandon at least the facade of legality that they often promote.
