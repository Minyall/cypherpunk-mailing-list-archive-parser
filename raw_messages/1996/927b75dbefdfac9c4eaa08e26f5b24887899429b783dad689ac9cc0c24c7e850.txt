	I'm sorry, I don't buy this. Last time I saw any stats, less than
5% of AMERICANS have access to the internet in any form. Even if it has
doubled in the last 3 months, that is still only 10%, Now yes, someday
what you say may be true, but most people have never seen the web, execpt
_maybe_ on TV. My father runs a relatively sucessful business, which he
started last year, and he has almost never used a computer more
sophisticated than a calculator (I gave him a zenith supersport (8088)
laptop that he has turned on ONCE)--he dosen't even believe in Cash
Stations). To claim that that being unable to use the web is the 
equivalent of being unable to use the phone is silly, and to an extent 
myopic.
