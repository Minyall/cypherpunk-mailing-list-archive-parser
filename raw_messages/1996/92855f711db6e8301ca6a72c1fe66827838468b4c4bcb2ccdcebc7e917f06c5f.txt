4-29-96 WSJ has page one leader on the December federal bust of 
Bernard Oskar Bowitz, an EE peddling gear for cellular piracy. 
It lays out the cyber-tracking and -trapping.


"This case offers a glimpse into the crime in the 21st 
century," scowls a US Attorney.


Bowitz derises, "I'm very flattered to hear they think I'm a 
mastermind. I think they're watching too many Arnold 
Schwarzenegger movies."
