Those of us who occasionally dip into that Slough of Despond
known as news.admin.net-abuse.misc are *very* familiar with
Mr. Wallace. Check out, for example, 
news:// 32617de2.18341458@news.onramp.net,
where he is ignoring a court order to stop spamming.

Bouncing mail back to him may be emotionally satisfying, but
I suspect he filters it. He also has a skin as thick as a rhino's.
