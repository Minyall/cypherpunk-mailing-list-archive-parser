   The WSJ Page Ones a loser's game about the CIA's role in 
   promoting Japanese pachinko cards to halt the surreptitious 
   funneling of betting cash to the construction of a North 
   Korean nuclear plant. And the op's nuking by the Kobe quake 
   looting of card-reading mechanisms, cracking encryption 
   codes, and counterfeiting not-so-smart cards for counter- 
   tipping the house fix. Mondex, watcher bleedin arse.
