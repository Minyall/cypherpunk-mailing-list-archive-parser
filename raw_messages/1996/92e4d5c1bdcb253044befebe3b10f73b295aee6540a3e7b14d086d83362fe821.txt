You are confused. The above question was e-mailed to me by one of Timmy May's
friends. I just forward their e-mail to this mailing list. I don't read it.
If you have any comments about Timmy May's friends not knowing English,
trying to insult people, and posting non-crypto-relevant political rants,
address them to Timmy May and his friends.
