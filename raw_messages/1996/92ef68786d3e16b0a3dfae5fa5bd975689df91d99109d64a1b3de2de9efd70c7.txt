OK dont shoot me, im new to this list so please Bear with me:

I recently secured an account with anon.penet and then a few days later got
a post informing me that the servive was now terminated. Anybody out there
know of any remailers where you dont have to have a Phd in computer science
and a thorough working knowledge of PGP in order to operate?

Also, are there any remailers which will accept binary attachments?
