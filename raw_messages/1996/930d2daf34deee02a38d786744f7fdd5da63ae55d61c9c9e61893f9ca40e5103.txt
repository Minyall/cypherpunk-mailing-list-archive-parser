And more generally, this is what NeXT's developer documentation has to
say about services... Good stuff.

Examples of a Few Possible Services

Here are a few examples of services that have already been implemented
to give you an idea of what can be done with NeXTSTEP's services
mechanism:

* Encryption
An encryption service can convert data to a more secure form.  For
example, Mail can place a mail message on the pasteboard as a standard
Rich Text Format (RTF) document, and another application could encrypt
the document and place it back into mail as unreadable ASCII text, or as
a document to be opened only by another external decryption application.
