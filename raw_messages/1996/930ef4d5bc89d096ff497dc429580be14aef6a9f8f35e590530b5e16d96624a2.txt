Well, yes and no.  What made me change my mind is when I tried to see 
the situation from the standpoint of a guy from a thuggish mentality. 
Actually, it might not deter somebody else acting on the spur of the 
moment.  Take a typical harsh divorce situation where peoples act in 
the most surprisingly irrationnal way.  I think that ex-husbands or 
wifes would get targeted more than their fair share, and quite often, 
without any reasonable cause.
