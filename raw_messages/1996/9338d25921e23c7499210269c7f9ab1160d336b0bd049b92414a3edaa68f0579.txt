Scenario:  Mr. & Mrs. Joseph and Mary Christian buy SmutNoMore for
their home computer, to protect their children Mathew, Mark, Luke,
John, and Zebediah.  All are happy and content.

One day, Mathew and Mark go to a the home of a school chum, Bart 
Simpson, whose parents are products of the liberal 60's.  Bart has 
a computer too, along with an ISDN link through a local ISP to
the Internet.  But --- horrors --- Bart's computer is not equipped
with SmutNoMore, or any other filtering software.  Bart's parents
do not believe it to be fair to filter their children's access to
information.

During that afternoon of Internet fun, Mark clicks the mouse and
follows a hyperlink link to a web site filled with nasty objectionable
anti-family morally corrosive filth.  Mark and Mathew run home in
tears to their parents and tell all about the nightmare they've
experienced.

I wonder whether the Christians would be able to successfully sue
the Simpsons on some sort of "corruption of a minor" deal?  Indeed,
couldn't it even be possible that some local prosecutor might find
the Simpsons criminally involved?
