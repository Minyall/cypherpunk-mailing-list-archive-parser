On this one I have to agree with Perry.

As I started to read the item someone posted (I have mercifully forgotten
the poster) about TS in the upstairs-hot-tub-with-waterfalls and the
Nepal-returned-starstruck lovers and their "committed" relationship, I felt
I'd opened a manhole above a sewer. Or tuned in to "Sally Jesse Raphael."

"Takedown" is one book I don't plan to even flip through at the bookstore.

No offense intended to John, Tsutomo, Kevin, Julia, Kent, Katie, or John.
