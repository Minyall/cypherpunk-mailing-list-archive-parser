Classic governmental statistics abuse.  Given that probably far over 99% 
of all untraceable remailer return addresses are on Penet,
it's no surprise that 99% of all material with untraceable
destination addresses goes through there...
The largest userid number I've seen on Penet was about 500,000,
and I doubt there are 5000 addresses on nymservers or
reply-block users.
