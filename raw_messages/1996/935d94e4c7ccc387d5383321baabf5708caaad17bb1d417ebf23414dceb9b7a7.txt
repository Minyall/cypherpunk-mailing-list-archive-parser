Send e-mail addressed to listproc@internex.net with "Dilbert" as the 
subject and the words
"subscribe Dilbert_List Joe Blow" in the body of the message (be sure to

e-mail address will be picked up
automatically). NOTE: To unsubscribe, follow these same steps but use 
"unsubscribe
Dilbert_List" in the body of the message.
