UNIX  and  DEC VMS Security Reviews

I would like to take this opportunity to tell you about two of our audit 
software tools, PCUA and PCDA.

PCUA and PCDA are PC based software tools designed to review the security of 
Unix or DEC computers using only the stand-alone PC in your office. There is no 
need for connections to the system, user-IDs or even a knowledge of computer 
security.  Simply obtain a copy (usually on a floppy disk) of key files from 
the system under review, load these onto your PC and let our tools do all the work.

These packages are ideal for use by auditors, security officers and computer 
system managers - anyone who takes computer security seriously.  The programs 
produce a wide variety of reports which show the findings, explain the 
implications of the problems and then make recommendations about how to improve 
security.  Reports range from a full, detailed report which is user-definable 
to a brief list of the problems found.

Both packages are evolving products and we continue to add new tests to them, 
as well as keeping up to date with the latest releases of the operating systems.  
If you would like further tests added, we would be pleased to include these in 
our next release.

To obtain more information or  demonstration disks then please contact us.

Thank you for taking the time to look through this email.
