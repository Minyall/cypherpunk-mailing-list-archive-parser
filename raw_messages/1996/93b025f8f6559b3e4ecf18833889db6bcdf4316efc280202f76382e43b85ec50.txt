Hey, Dimitri?  That's what it's *for*!  This is not about censorship, or 
is it?  Is that what you're suggesting?

No one is forcing you to read anything I, or anyone else, says.  If you 
don't like it, the 'd' key is somewhere on your keyboard.  Or is that too 
much manual labor for you?  Grrr...

"Past the wounds of childhood, past the fallen dreams and the broken families,
through the hurt and the loss and the agony only the night ever hears, is a
waiting soul.  Patient, permanent, abundant, it opens its infinite heart and
asks only one thing of you ... 'Remember who it is you really are.'"
