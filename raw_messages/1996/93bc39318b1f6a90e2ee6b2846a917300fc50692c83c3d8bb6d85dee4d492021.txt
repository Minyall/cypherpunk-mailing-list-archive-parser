For some considerable period of time the doctrine of "separate but equal"
was one of the major racist theories in the U.S. 
 
People who wish to organize for racist ideology behind this doctrine while
proclaiming they are not racists merely place themselves in the old racist
camp. Their organizing for (and their denials of) racist ideology does not
make them less racist, just less honest.

PS: Oh yes, for all the other rightwingers on the net who remain silent
when rightwing views are presented but tell those who challenge the
rightwing material to stop posting because it isn't "cypher" relevant:
perhaps we could call the thread something like "Racist Code Talkers" or
"Why Don't 'Americans' Learn History." Both of those seem to have resembled
past on-topic threads.
