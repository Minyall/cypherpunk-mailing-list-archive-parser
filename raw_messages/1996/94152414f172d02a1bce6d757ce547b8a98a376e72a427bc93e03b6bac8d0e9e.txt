  Well labels--'socialist', 'communist', etc. can be quite misleading'
as they mean many different things to different people but they do
push emotional hot buttons.

  I don't understand the 'exhorbitant taxes' thing--in the US our
taxes are absurdly low compared with most of western Europe and
our social services a disgrace.  I don't know what it's like in
the UK but compared with the rest of Western Europe our tax rate
is a joke designed for the upper classes.
