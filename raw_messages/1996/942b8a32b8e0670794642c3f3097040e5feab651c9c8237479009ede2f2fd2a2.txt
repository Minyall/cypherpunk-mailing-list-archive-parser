I find that a very good solution providing that the browser say:
>"You're about to send a cookie...."
Here, I would add:
"... that contain the following information:"

(information list)

"... back to a web server, continue or abandon?"

Otherwise, it not as worse, but still in the same spirit as to 
sign a blank check to a stranger...

( I am telling you... it's been *at least* a million years that
I did not exagerate! :)
