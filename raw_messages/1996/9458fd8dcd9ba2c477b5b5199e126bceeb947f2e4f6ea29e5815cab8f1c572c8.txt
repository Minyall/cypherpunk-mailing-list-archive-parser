   7-21-96. Sunday WaPo: 
 
   "Liquid Explosives, Miniature Timers May Foil Airline 
   Security Measures." 
 
      1994 spelled the beginning of what some experts fear 
      might be a resurgence of hi-tech terrorism, this time 
      involving persons with more advanced bomb-making skills 
      who know how to defeat even the best airport security 
      devices. The new terrorists favor smaller and much less 
      detectable plastic or liquid explosives detonated by 
      miniaturized and benign looking timers.  
 
      At the heart of such devices is a timer built by 
      rewiring a commonly available Casio digital watch, which 
      is connected to a stabilized form of liquid 
      nitroglycerin stored in a bottle ostensibly filled with 
      contact lens solution. The stabilizer for the 
      nitroglycerin looks like unsuspicious cotton. Even newer 
      screening devices that can see through clothes would 
      have difficulty ferreting out such a substance, 
      according to airplane security experts.
