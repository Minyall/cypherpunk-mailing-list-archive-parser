This still leaves chemical weapons.  Certain chemical weapons are explicitly
banned by treaties, but many of them aren't so the USG is free to test them on
anyone they want.  The U.S. military is also free to conduct training
excercises in heavily populated civilian areas.
http://www.erols.com/igoddard/copters.htm has an article about the military
conducting "urban warfare" training in major U.S. cities.
