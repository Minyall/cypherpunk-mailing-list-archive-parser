Except that Molson is doubtless doing substantial analysis of where
its users go.  Chaining is no use, since the URL gets passed in the
clear.

Web proxies will need to add encrypted URL support to do chaining.
This doesn't require anything on the browser, except SSL.  (Proper
trafic analysis prevention might require mixing of streams, which
implies delays, which amy be unacceptable for most web browsing.)

(Wei pointed this out a long time ago; real time traffic is tough to
protect.)
