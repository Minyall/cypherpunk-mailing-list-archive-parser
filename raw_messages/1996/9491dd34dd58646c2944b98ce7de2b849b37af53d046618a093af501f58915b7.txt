In 1981, the city of Kennesaw, GA suffered 17 violent crimes and 55 burglaries. 
In 1982, Kennesaw passed an ordinance requiring all city residents to own a 
firearm, and there was only 1 violent crime and 19 burglaries. In 1983, Kennesaw 
experienced 3 violent crimes and 9 burglaries. I think that the cause-effect 
relationship is obvious.
