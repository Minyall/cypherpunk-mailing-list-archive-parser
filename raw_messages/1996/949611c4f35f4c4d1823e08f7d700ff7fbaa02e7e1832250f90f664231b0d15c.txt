I don't see how one bank offering fully anonymous digital cash could be
"frozen out."  Partially untracable cash systems may be much more popular, but
as long as the fully anonymous system receives enough money to stay in
business, there would be little risk of fading away.  A bank offering fully
anonymous digital cash could be used for tax evasion, extortion, and money
laundering.  These crimes usually involve large sums of money, so this would
keep the bank in business.
