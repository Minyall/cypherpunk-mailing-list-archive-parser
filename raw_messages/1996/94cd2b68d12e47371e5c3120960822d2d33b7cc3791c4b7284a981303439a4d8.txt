It looks like the majority of download failures are caused by people
using browsers that don't support cookies.  If you aren't sure that
the browser you're using supports cookies, then try Netscape Navigator.
If are using Netscape (or some other cookie-capable browser) and are
still getting a "No Cookie" error, please let me know.
