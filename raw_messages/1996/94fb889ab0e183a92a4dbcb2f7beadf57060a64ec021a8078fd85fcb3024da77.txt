This is a bug in PGP. +makerandom doesn't work properly. I discovered
this a few week ago myself when I needed some random numbers for
another project. Due to a programming bug, the idea based random number
generator doesn't get initialized (read: doesn't get seeded at all)
when +makerandom is used. Note: +makerandom is an undocumented feature.

IMPORTANT: Only +makerandom is effected. In normal use PGP properly
generates random session keys as well as RSA public key pairs.
