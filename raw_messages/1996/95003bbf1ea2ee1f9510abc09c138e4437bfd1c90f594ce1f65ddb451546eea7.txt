O.W. Holmes suggested out in "The Common Law" that the law delineates a
certain minimum level of competence in forseeing the outcomes of our
actions which all members of society are expected to attain.  We'll
hold you responsible for actions a "reasonable person" should have
avoided because of their danger.  As such, persons with limited
training in manipulating biological viruses are expected to avoid doing
so.  Individuals *with* training are expected to take adequate
precautions to avoid their spread.  I see no reason why electronic
viruses shouldn't be treated similarly.  If you're going to write them,
you *better* take steps to prevent their release, or you are liable for
the damages.
