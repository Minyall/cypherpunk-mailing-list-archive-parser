I recall that the perp rented the vehicle and gave a $400 cash deposit.
He subsequently returned to the rental agency, stated that the vehicle
was stolen, and demanded his cash back. And the Oklahoma City perp was
caught speeding with no licence plates.

Shit. Whoever recruits those terrorists needs a better h.r. department to
