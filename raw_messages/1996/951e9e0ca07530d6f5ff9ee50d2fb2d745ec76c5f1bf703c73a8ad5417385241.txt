[Right wing pressure group censorship crap deleted]

Does this document strike anyone else as remarkably similar to the 
propaganda put out by another pressure group, the National Coalition
Against Pornography, which was heavily funded by the millions
Charles Keating stole from his investors?

Have the bozos regrouped, changed their name, and gone online?
