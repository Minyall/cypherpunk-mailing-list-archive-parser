If you consult the archives you will find the decayed remains of many  
cypherpunks whose blood was shed in the "Logo Wars" of years past.

Instead of having another logo war on the mailing list and having to shout  
over the din of accounts and subjects hitting the bottom of subscriber's kill  
files, I'll sum it up for you:  If you have a cool logo, put it on your own web  
pages (or get someone to put it on theirs).  Then post the URL on the mailing  
list.  If others like it they will use it.  Welcome to anarchy.

Forget contests (unless you want to pony up the prizes and the judges), forget  
voting, forget juries presided by PRZ (he has more important things to do...),  
forget trying to get a consensus on the mailing list...  Still, if you feel  
you must select a logo in public, set up your own mailing list for discussing  
the logo...

I doubt that there will be a large number of logos produced (if any...).  If  
one person comes up with a logo that is obviously better than all the rest then  
people will use it.  If nobody puts logos on their pages then it probably  
wasn't meant to be.
