There are a few different ports of SSLeay to various applications (eg telnet/
ftp/Mosaic/httpd) going on. I've written a free SSL library (free for 
comercial and non-comercial use) which people are putting into various 
applications. Being outside the USA, I'm not giving any thought to the legal
aspects of use of my implemetation of RSA or RC4 inside the USA.

The library supports all DES, IDEA and RC4 modes (includeing the 40 bit 
export version) and if some-one reverse engineers RC2 I'll put it in for 
completness :-)
