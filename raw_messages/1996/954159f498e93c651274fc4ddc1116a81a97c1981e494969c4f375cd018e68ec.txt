The abuse of psychiatry as an instrument of opression is not new, of
course. The Soviet Union used it regularly.

However, if anything, Ritalin gives a person with ADD the tools with
which to more effectively subvert authority. Its very hard to smash
the state, or even plot to get even with your boss, when you can't
concentrate sufficiently to execute your plans. It may be true that
someone will be less likely to impulsively act out against authority
under its influence, but such impulses rarely actually produce any
sort of lasting impact -- they only get one in trouble. By contrast,
effective subversion requires patience and self discipline, which is
precisely what an ADD sufferer does not have.

In short, if one really was trying to narcotize a troublemaker,
tranquilizers and the like are probably far better than Ritalin and
other amphetamines, which, in spite of Tim's pronouncements, do not
act as tranquilizers.

Actually, some ADD sufferers actually need less medication with time,
as the ability to concentrate for prolonged periods gives them the
chance to work on non-drug based coping strategies which are difficult
to work on without the meds.

Perhaps you ought to examine the scientific literature rather than
simply deciding to guess.
