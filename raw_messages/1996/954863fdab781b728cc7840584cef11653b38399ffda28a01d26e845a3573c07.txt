Even if they did change the frequency the call was on, 
it would be a simple matter to decode how the frequency
change was negotiated, and "follow" the call (also easily
accomplished with cellular calls).  Failing that, there is 
a very limited range of frequencies allocated for cordless 
fones, and simply re-scanning for the conversation is a 
trivial inconvenience. //cerridwyn//
