Very possible.  Try reading the alt.2600 newsgroup for about a week and see 
how many me-too, teach-me-how2hack, and other lame messages are posted 
there on a daily basis.  God help us now that they've discovered mailing 
lists.  "h3y, w0w, d00dz, th1s cyberpun|< li5t is way |<3\/\/L!"
(Translation: Hey, wow, dudes, this cyberpunk list is way cool!
for those of you who are asciially impaired :)
