The way I envision it (in my nightmares), you'd have two options:  have
the account configured as "kid safe", and live in a cyberspace playground,
or have it configured as "adult", and accept responsibility for your kids'
use.  As I see it, with the censorship support at the network layer that
I outlined, the ISP can have "common carrier" status.  They sold the account
to an adult, so all packets delivered to the account are delivered to that
adult, as owner of the ISDN router.  If the adult chooses to then deliver
that packet to a child, it's no different than if the adult buys a copy
of "Debbie Does Dallas" and shows it to the kid.

Well, I don't know that the CDA supporters are thinking of.  I just
responded to the charge of "technically infeasible" with an outlined
technical solution.

I *do* think that the separation between ISP account and email address
isn't quite as black and white as you seem to think.

Actually, I expect configurations like yours to become more widespread
in the near future.  There are a lot of cable-modem designs that
basically put an ethernet port on your cable box.  There's little
practical difference (from a network topology perspective) between that
and your ISDN setup.
