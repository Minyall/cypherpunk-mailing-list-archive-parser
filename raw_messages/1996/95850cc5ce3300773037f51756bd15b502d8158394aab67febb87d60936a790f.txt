Does somebody here have a pointer to literature on this topic? A system in
which small localized disturbances can amplify, propagate through the
system, leading to catastrophic failure is the worst of all possible
designs. I fail to understand why a system as important as the power grid
would display this type of behavior. Why is the grid negatively dampened?
