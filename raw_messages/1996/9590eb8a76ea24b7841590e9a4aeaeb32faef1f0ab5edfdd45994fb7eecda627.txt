This argument breaks down when one looks at the difference between state
action and private action.

Were one to follow this logic, it would come to pass that citizens could
get warants to search neighbor's residences.

Fair game for law enforcement use and can be presented in court, yes.
And, I might add, there is a different standard for voice communications
however carried.  The heat from a indoor pot garden is a different matter,
and incidently, the matter on which the question was presented.

There is the additional matter of the obstruction of justice issues..

How EXACTLY does this follow?

Again, you need to distinguish law enforcement purposes and private
purposes.

And yet you need a warrant to intercept cell phone conversation.

And the fact that cellphones carry voice communications.

ANd having the blue shirt say "kill the president" maybe would even out
your example.

No, the rational being that the blue shirt carries a communication more
complicated than a simple speed reading, or heat emmission.

I think you are mistaken.
