Yes, but concievably if (whoever would be incharge, FBI?) *could*, 
under law do this, even if they are wrong.  It is a lot harder to 
prove that they intentionally harrassed *you* than it is for them to 
say that they were following leads and show evidence.  Yes, this may 
never happen, but the mere fact that it *could* is uncomforting.  
Kinda like the CDA an Clinton saying "we will not enforce this...."  
Fine, but there is still a law on the books that allows them to if 
they decide to change their mind.  Even if you can't be found guilty, 
you could still be ruined by legal fees, job loss, etc.

Don't wanna end up on that "Group-W" bench!  :)

Cds are often sampled at 48 these days.  Mine was, and we had to 
reduce it to 44.1 for mass producing (much to our surprise, since 
many CD manufacturers love getting stuff at 48 over 44.1)

Not familiar with the Nyquist limit w/ regards to sampling rate vs 
frequency :(
