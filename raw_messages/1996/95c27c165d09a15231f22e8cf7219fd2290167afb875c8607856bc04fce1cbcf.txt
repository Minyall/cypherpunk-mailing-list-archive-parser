The only real legality of requiring some form of payment is that if they
take one form of federal reserve currency (eg the one dollar bill) they
have to take any form of federal reserve currency (eg the penny).  This
means that when your parking ticket says you can't pay in change, you can
still pay in change.  Legally (according to CNN anyway, i've never
bothered to actually go look it up) if you ofer to pay something in
change, and they decline, you can give them one warning, and _assuming a
debt is previously incurred (eg parking ticket, not new pants) you don't
have to pay.

Unfortunatly, they can decline cash/change completely, or decline checks,
or decline credit cards.  But if they take one dollar bills, go by the
bank first and get it in pennies.  Pay with that.
