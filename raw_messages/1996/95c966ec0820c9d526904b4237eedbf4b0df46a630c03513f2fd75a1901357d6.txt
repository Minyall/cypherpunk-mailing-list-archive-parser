: Well, actually, it depends on whether the bytes are treated as signed or
: unsigned, and we don't know for sure that IPG wanted them treated as
: unsigned. This means IPG either:
: 
: a) can't write portable code, or
: b) really are as stupid as we are giving them credit for.

a) is obvious, since they explicitly say that they coded it in 80x86 
assembler, but I wouldn't discount the possibility of b) being true also.
