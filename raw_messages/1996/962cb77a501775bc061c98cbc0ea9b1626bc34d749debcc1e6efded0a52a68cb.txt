I could swear I read something about a PGP plugin called livepgp, and
Altavista can't find it, and I can't glimpse it in my archives of the
list.

Anyone got a pointer?

Please post to the list; making it more likely that a search engine
will find this in the future, and we won't get a rash of 'me toos.'

Thanks,

Adam
