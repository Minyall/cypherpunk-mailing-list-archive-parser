Simple.  Check out Windows NT, under NT you can write/run programs as 
services which log in as an account.  When you do this, that service 
program is limited to the security restrictions of that account.

If you're using the NTFS file system and give that account access only to 
one directory, it can't access anything but that directory.  (If you're 
using FAT, this isn't true and the program can read/write/delete anything 
it wants.)  Works quite well.

It can be done under 95 but Microsoft will have to write a Sandbox 
Virtual Machine (a Virtual x86 session whose API's are filtered to 
prevent access to certain things like the file system, and disables 
direct I/O.)  Not that easy under '95, but it already exists for NT.

The problem is how to deal with DLL's.  You don't know all 
features/functions of all DLL's.  It may be possible to write a DLL that 
runs outside the sandbox and can act as a proxy to the file system, so 
it's iffy unless you limit the DLL's and services that ActiveX apps talk 
to, and make them all live inside the sandbox.
