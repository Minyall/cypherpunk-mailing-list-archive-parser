Different ball game.  OTP isn't "unbreakable" .  OTPs are secure because
no matter what key you use, it _will_ decrypt, so your plaintext is still
hidden simply because it could decrypt to whatever the person trying to
decrypt it wants it to.  Its not that its unbreakable, its that its
breakable in _so many ways_.
