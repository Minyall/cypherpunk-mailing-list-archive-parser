You are of course free not to subscribe. A solution I think 98% of us would
subscribe to, so to speak.

Personally, I take the full Cypherpunks feed. Others may take Eric
Blossom's for-a-fee filtered list, still others may take the
variously-priced filtered lists by others.

As it should be.

(Goldwater and Heinlein got it slightly wrong when they said "There ain't
no such as a free lunch." While true in many ways, TANSTAAFL ignorest the
great willingness of people to donate time, effort, articles, etc. In fact,
I've put many thousands of hours into the Cypherpunks list, for which I've
received not a single centime of compensation. And I have no problem with
this, provided it remains voluntary.)
