Dear Fuji4,
  It seems that I can't cruise a conference anywhere, without
seeing the above message emblazoned everywhere.
  Thanks to your efforts, I am sure that your service provider,
netcom.com, will gain much recognition for their new ethnic
cleansing policy.
  I am sure that they will be very thankful to you for your
efforts on getting the word out on their behalf.
