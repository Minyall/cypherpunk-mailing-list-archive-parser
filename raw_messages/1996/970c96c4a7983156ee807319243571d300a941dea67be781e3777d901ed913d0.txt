FYI:

Front page of the New Jersey Star Ladger:

"GOP's Stolen Laptop had credit card Details"

NJ Republicans' convention info and card card numbers and info was on the
laptop insecurely, a letter went oput to the NJ Republican committee
informing them of the 'inconveince'. Several key Rebulican Reps' cards were
among those stolen including: Dick ZImmer and Christopher Smith as well as
the State Committee's credit card. etc...
