Ordinarily, I'd leave this post alone, but I really hate it when people
twist ideas for their own philosophical purposes.  To whit: "John is the
sole authority over what the users of his computer can do with his
computer" (quote approximate).

I don't *do* anything with *his* computer. I send email into the ether
with an address on it, and he picks it up at his discretion and does
what he wants with it.  I am in no way involved in that process, and I
do not share *any* responsibility for how he handles the email. As far
as his authority goes, I've been subscribed for several months now, and
I don't recall a single statement by Gilmore himself as to what this
"authority" thing means.  But then, why should he, and why should you?
It's patently obvious to anyone with a brain, and we don't need some
authoritarian boot-licking computer-bureaucrat telling us how it is.
