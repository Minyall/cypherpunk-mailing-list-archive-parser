No stupid, you miss the point.  What I told you is that I never
added the cypherpunks address to the fucking list.  And I do
not chop headers.  Get the story straight.  YOU put the address
in the header, and not me.

Look you cocksucking bastard.  If you start harassing my postmaster,
I will put you out of business.  I never put any fucking cyberpunks
address in any e-mail, so don't go blaming me.  

I have a habit of never chopping headers, so YOU had better chop
the fucking cyberpunks header at once, and stop harassing this
location!  Do you want me to sue your ISP ?  Keep up your 
unwanted e-mail to this address, and it will happen.

That is your last warning, Mike.  If you start harasing my postmaster,
I will have your fucking ass in Federal Court before you can blink.
