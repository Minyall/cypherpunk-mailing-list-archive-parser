This has no cryptographic relevance, but...

One alternative was to complete the blockade Japanese islands, then sit
and wait for them to surrender (while possibly fighting in China).

Japan is very vulnerable to blockades. You may recall that the attack on
Pearl Harbor came as a retaliation of the U.S. oil embargo which the
Japanese government viewed as an act of war.

A blockade could have lasted for years and caused millions of Japanese
civilians to starve to death.
