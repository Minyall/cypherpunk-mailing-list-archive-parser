This is what's listed in the newsgroups file:

alt.anonymous		alt!  Who goes there?
alt.anonymous.messages	An anonymous message pool newgroup, whatever that is.

Alt.anonymous is just another content-free, basically dead newsgroup.  Alt.
anonymous.messages is the group used for message pools.  Since the general
rule for naming newsgroups is to use dots only for designating a lower group
hierarchy.  misc.anonymous-messages is probably a better name, since there is
no misc.anonymous.* newsgroup hierarchy.
