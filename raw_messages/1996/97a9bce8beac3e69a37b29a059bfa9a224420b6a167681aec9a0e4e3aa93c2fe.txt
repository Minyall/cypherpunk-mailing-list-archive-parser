The "Idea Futures" forum has established odds on this. The current odds are
currently 60% that a 1024 bit number will be factored by 2010 and 30% that
a 512 bit number will be factored by 1997.

See <http://if.arc.ab.ca/IF.shtml> for Idea Futures and
<http://if.arc.ab.ca/bin/summary> for odds for various questions.
