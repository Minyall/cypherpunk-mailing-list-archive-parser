July Meeting Announcement
**********************************

July 15, 1996,  7-9 PM,  Newbridge Cafe, Nashua, New Hampshire

E$  ----  Electronic Money and Commerce

Robert Hettinga, Digital Commerce Society of Boston

---------------------------------------

Banks have been doing "electronic funds transfers" for years, and now 
ATM transactions have skyrocketed, due to their convenience.  What 
happens when you can take complete control by saving your e-money right 
in your own personal computer's hard drive?  Will there be competing 
e-currencies?  Will transactions become invisible?  The internet and new 
encryption techniques make the possibilities absolutely enthralling.

Hear Bob Hettinga explore all the technologies and possibilities at the 
July Freedom Forum!

apologies to this month's speaker for not creating a full web page on 
his talk.  Will catch up after the talk.
