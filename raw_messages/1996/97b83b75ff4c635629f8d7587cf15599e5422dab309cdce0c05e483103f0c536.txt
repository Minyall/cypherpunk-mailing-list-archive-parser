His comments were not "offensive, racist, and bigoted."  They were funny, 
intentionally so.  The whole "Ebonics" issue is a hilarious example of 
political-correctness gone mad.  Interestingly, Jesse Jackson tried to make it 
look like the blacks were the victims, the ones most offended by the actions 
of the Oakland schools people.  Embarrassed, maybe, victims no.


(A friend of mine greatly prefers the term, "Niglish."  I try hard to not be 
so...coarse.)
