May be you knew this.  A few months back in the UK, some nut flipped
and shot up a school full of kids, finishing up by shooting himself
(sadly for the press, his second cousin once removed, did not have an
internet account).  Much media teeth gnashing about hand guns, and
tighter gun laws ensued.  (The guy had a gun license, something which
is needed to legally own a gun in the UK.)

The Schoolyard Slaughter game is I think a joke by someone with a
funny sense of humor, playing on this incident.
