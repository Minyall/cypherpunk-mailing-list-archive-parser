Well, I agree that saying "I hope you die" is a tad bit more serious than
"You suck, and those boys died."

If these additional words were spoken, why didn't the SS reveal them early
on? (Or, if they did, why did the news reports not mention them?)

Personally, I would never utter such words, even to Clinton. Or Dole.
Tacky, even if one dislikes the Prez.

But I agree that "no action" is pretty likely. "I hope you die" has been a
time-honored insult at least since I was a kindergartner, and presumably
for many decades prior to this. Hardly an active threat.
