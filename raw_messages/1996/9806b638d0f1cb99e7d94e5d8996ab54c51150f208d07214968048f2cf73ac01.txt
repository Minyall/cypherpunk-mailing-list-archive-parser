"With this act of Congress, the very same materials which are legally
available today in book stores and libraries would be illegal if posted on
World Wide Web sites or usenet newsgroups. If signed by President Clinton
as expected, this bill will transform the Internet overnight from the
freest communications medium to the most heavily regulated medium in the
United States."
