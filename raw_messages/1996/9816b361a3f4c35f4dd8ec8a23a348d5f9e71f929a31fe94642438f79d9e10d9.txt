  Well the EFF has been morally dead for a very
long time--the majority of their funing comes
from large corporate interests, they ALWAYS side
with business owners ove users, and the ACLU shot
them down for their active role in approval
of the Exon Ammendment.  They are essentially a
lobby for business interests on the net and
could give a shit about individual users rights.
They are not deserving of any respect.
