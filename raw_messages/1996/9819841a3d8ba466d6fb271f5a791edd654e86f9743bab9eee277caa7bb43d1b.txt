Do not belive it, it will never happen. It is impossible,  and we can
prove it to your satisfaction.

Please be advised that effective immediately any U.S. or Canadian
corporation (ltd), organization or government group may now receive a free
IPG demonstration system, it has some limitations but it does  allow users
to see how easy it is to use the system compared to existing antiquated
systems. It will also allow users to prove to themselves that the security
is truly peerless.

This offer does not apply to individual users.

To obtain your organization free operational demonstration copy, please
send an e-mail request to:

        ipgsales@cyberstation.net

You must include your snail-mail address and telephone number in said
request. 

The pcopy will allow for multiple users.

With kindest regards,

Don Wood
