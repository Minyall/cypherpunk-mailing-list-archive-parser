Apropos of *what*?!  If it was an NTSC colour TV; yes, you could
measure the colour by the phase of the 3.579 colour burst.  But modern
computer monitors (i.e. VGA) don't represent colour that way at all --
they use separate red, green, and blue video signals.  And the
original poster is correct -- it is extremely difficult to determine
which guns are generating any given pixel, using van Eck monitoring.

The only com/mil ELINT demo I've ever seen of a VGA monitor generated a
greyscale display.
