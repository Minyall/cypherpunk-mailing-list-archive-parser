There are exceptions to ITAR for this purpose (overseas offices of US
companies). In addition, like the argument that we shouldn't jail anyone
until all social evils are cured, your argument fails. IBM can secure their
domestic network (at least) without having to secure their global network.
As for your suggestion that I am special pleading, that's just unsupported
defamation. I suppressed nothing--it is you who are omitting the facts I
mention just above. Only a fool would accuse another of special pleading
when the possibility the accuser doesn't understand the argument, or have
all the data exists. If you have any integrity you'll apologize.

Another attempt to accuse, read minds, and impute motives. We're talking
about securing networks such as communications, transportation, and power,
against hacker attacks. Authentication is the core, not encryption. A main
problem is the spoofer instructing the network to self-destruct. Long-key
authentication can address this when coupled with the safeguarding of keys.
and some system precautions not related to encryption.

So what? What part of "more to do with....than" don't you understand? I
never said "all"--that's a straw man to try to shift the ground of the
discussion rather than attempting a direct refutation.

So do it.

So what? Everything is connected to everything else.

Fair comment--you're certainly entitled to your opinion.

At least some of one's interests we might both agree. There's the old joke
"I'm from Washington and I'm here to help you."
