If "digital postage" is ever implemented, this sort of
distributed-origin mailbomb-through-a-remailer would be stopped
immediately.  All the messages that the horny net geeks send would
necessarily contain the same postage stamp, and the remailer would
notice this right away -- and throw away messages containing the used
postage stamp.

One more motivation for e$-like digital postage for remailers.
