When I saw this article in the paper early this morning (like 1am)
on nando.net, I just couldn't beleave it....

When did hackers become a threat? I thought that hackers were a 
national resource! 

It sounds like these gov folks are concerned about how much
hackers know how things work... which is probably more than
they do. Didn't hackers build the Internet? :)

I just blew the article off as noise. I just can't waist 
energy on such rubbish.
