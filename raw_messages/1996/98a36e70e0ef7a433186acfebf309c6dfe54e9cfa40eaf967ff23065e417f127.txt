Tim can and does make moral judgements. So do I. So do you.

I was curious as to why Tim brought them into an argument that did not need
moral judgements to make its point.

I suspect that it is more reflexive than carefully thought out, and I think may
reflect on some of his core assumptions about society in general.

But I don't know, so instead of making my own assumptions, I asked.
