The figures look familiar.  No references around.  I'm not sure it would 
require a whole two weeks for 40-bits, though.  Possibly less than a 
day? (Or was that why you asked baout the figures?)

The "$10,000 worth of supercomputer time" is fuzzy.  One thing that's
left out is that once an organization already owns the equipment and 
has the money to spare, it may be worthwhile to crack things of less 
importance like personal checking info, email, etc.
