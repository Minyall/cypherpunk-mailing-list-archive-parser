For facinating discussions of why insider trading is actually good for 
the market, See e.g., Henry Manne, Insider Trading and the Stock Market 
(1966); Michael P. Dooley, Enforcement of Insider Trading Restrictions, 66 
Va.L.Rev 1 (1980); James D. Cox, Insider Trading and Contracting: A 
Critial Response to the "Chicago School," 1986 Duke L.J. 628 (1986); 
Kenneth E. Scott, Insider Trading: Rule 10b-5, Disclosure and Corporate 
Privacy, 9 J. Legal Stud. 801 (1980); Dennis W. Carlton & Daniel R. 
Fischel, The Regulation of Insider Trading, 35 Stan.L.Rev 857 (1983).

I'll sum up the general arguments for and against insider trading if 
there is enough interest.
