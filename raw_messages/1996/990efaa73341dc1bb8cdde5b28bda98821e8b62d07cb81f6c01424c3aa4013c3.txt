Well, doesn't this beg the question - the "desire" by people to own them
is not as a result of advertising, but the fact that society has long 
fixed them as standard units of "currency".

If all those centuries ago marble was decided upon as a central 
unit of currency, we'd all be killing ourselves to get some, not because
of any aestetic beauty.
