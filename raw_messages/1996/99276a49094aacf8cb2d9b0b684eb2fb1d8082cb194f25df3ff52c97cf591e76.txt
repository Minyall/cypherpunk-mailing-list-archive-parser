Again, I apologize to Ms. Meuller and to Netscape.

In my opinion Netscape has a great track record of addressing concerns and
problems with its software.  Other companies would do well to use
Netscape's policy of addressing and correcting proven security problems,
instead of denying and downplaying them, as a model.
