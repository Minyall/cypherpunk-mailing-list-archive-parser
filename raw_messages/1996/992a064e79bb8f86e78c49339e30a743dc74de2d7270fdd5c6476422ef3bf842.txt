	One problem with the development of such high-end technologies is that
they tend to increase economies of scale to the point where it's impractical to
have anything but a monopoly or ogliopoly. As well as concerns about the degree
of control such an organization may be able to exert in and of itself (acting
like a government, in essence), there's also that such an organization is
easier to pressure than a lot of small providers. Anyone have a suggested
solution, or reasons that I shouldn't be so worried?
