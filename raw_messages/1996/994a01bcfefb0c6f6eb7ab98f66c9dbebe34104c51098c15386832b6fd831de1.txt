  Well--if you look at the ownership of wealth in the US including
but not limited to real estate you'll find much the same.  And that
ownership is not, to my mind, in the least legitimate.

  That's a fair question.  I don't begrude one's ownership of their
fair share--but I do have serious problems with what we shall
call 'accumulators' if you will.  For them I have contempt and no--
they do not have that right of possession and often such 'work' is
at the expense and on the backs of others.
