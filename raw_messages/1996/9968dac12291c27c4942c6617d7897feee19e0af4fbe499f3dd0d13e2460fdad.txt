There's lately been a spate of l00sers subscribing
unsuspecting people to various hugh-traffic mailing lists.

I'd be willing to bet that a number of the 'unsubscrive' people
we have been seeing lately have been subscrived by their "friends"
and have never seen the "welcome to cypherpunks" list message, or
probably any mailing lists welcome message for that matter.

One list admin I know of has to manually unsubscribe
president@whitehouse.gov from a motorcycle racing list
three or more times a week.
