[much drivel snipped]

So what you're saying is I (or we) can testify in front of Congress on
essentially any topic, telling a blatant lie (that we know is false, and
which they will subsequently prove is false), and totally get away with
it.  You and I can do that, is that what you're saying?

If that is true, then my original contention that things are far worse
than the person I originally responded to was imagining, stands as
correct.  Things are bad indeed.
