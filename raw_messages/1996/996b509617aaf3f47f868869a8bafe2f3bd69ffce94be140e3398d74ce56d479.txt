What weight can my opinion possibly have? This list is apparently
owned by a Mr. John Gilmore. If he's being censorous, that's bad,
but it is apparently within his means to execute said censorship.

Improving signal to noise is a laughable goal at a social event of
more than 100 people, why do people insist upon trying it on the net?
