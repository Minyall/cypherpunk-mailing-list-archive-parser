The only computationally feasible way to accomplish this would be to use a
variation of the one time pad (OTP) cipher, and use two keys:  the genuine
key, which is made by the random number generator of your choice, and a
specially cooked key generated by XORing the encrypted message with an
innocuous message.  Decrypting with the random key will yield the real
message, and decrypting with the cooked key will yield the innocuous message.
 The disadvantage to this system is that each key will be the same length as
the message.

The method you propose (using multiple RSA keys) is not workable.  Finding 2
RSA keys that will decrypt a given ciphertext block to any 2 meaningful
plaintexts is at least as difficult as breaking RSA, and expanding this
concept to messages longer than 1 block moves it into the realm of
impossibility.
