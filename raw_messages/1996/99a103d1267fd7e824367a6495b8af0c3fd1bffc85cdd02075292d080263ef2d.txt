Can you list a source for the 1024-bit signature restriction?  I know
about the 40-bit RC2/RC4 and 512-bit public encryption keys because they
are specifically addressed in the State Dept's "Procedure for Submitting
a Commodity Jurisdiction Request for a Mass Market Software Product that
Contains Encryption".  However, digital signatures are not mentioned in
this procedure.  I can't image what justificication could be used to
restrict the strength of digital signatures.
