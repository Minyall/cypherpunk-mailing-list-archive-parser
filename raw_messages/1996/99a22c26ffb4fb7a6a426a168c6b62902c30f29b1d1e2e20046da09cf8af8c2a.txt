A number of people have been asking me about some work I've been doing
(with Joan Feigenbaum and Jack Lacy) on alternatives to traditional
(X.509, PGP, etc.) identity-based certificates.  We've just finished
up our paper on the concept, "Decentralized Trust Management", to
appear at the Oakland Security Conference in May.
