  I assume you mean this applies to both parties.  The ISP has resources
that I want to purchase.  I have monetary resources it wants in return. 
Here's an idea; a contract socket.  This socket negotiates a info exchange
deal based on a base of variables that you have programmed it with.  The
exchange is made and money changes hands.  Build in the usual things like
reputation checking and what not to verify that the other guy meets the
variables outlined(or at least can be trusted to).
