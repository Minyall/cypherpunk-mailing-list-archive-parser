! * as Germany is bent on blocking sites which carry this subversive

! * when the Germans went into Danmark and insisted Jews wear badges,

! wearing these Star of David badges.
! 
! * wouldn't it be deliciously ironic if the "Free Speech Blue Ribbon" now
! attached to so many pages were to be joined by a "Star of David"? This Star
! of David symbol could mean "We support freedom to read, and our site
! contains the "Radikal" publication which Germans are forbidden to access."

! (I know nothing of how such symbolic campaigns are actually launched and
! managed, so I'm suggesting the hint of an idea. I do think mirroring the
! banned publication (_any_ banned publication, by _any_ government) on as
! many sites as possible is a Good Idea.)

Can someone post an uncensored copy here?  That's a good start.  I 
could repost Jolly Roger which I think I archived, or post
something from Kurt Saxon in de.soc and soc.culture.german for a 
good start!
