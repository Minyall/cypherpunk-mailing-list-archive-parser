I think the best way to approach this problem is to first try to solve
it assuming there are only two robbers rather than 20.  Then once you
have that figured out, try it for three, then four, and so on.  Keep in
mind that 50% support is enough for a proposed distribution to pass, you
don't need a strict majority.
