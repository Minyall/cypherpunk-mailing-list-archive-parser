Whether you're _presumed_ innocent or not isn't the point he was making.
If you commit a crime, you are guilty of that crime, proven or not.  You
might not be _proven guilty_ in court, which you have to be in order to be
convicted, and you are still _presumed_ innocent.  But you're still guilty
of the crime.
