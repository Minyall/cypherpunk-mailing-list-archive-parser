I think Timmy mentioned something about a tryst with Gilmore (spit).
Is that why the coward has quiesced posting his tripe to this list?
Would it be more appropriate to put (swallow) rather than (spit)
after Gilmore's name?
How much proeteins, fats, carbohydrates, and vitamines are contained
in an average human ejaculation?
What about farm animals'?
Timmy (fart) and John (swallow) can tell us a lot about this subject.

Yes, Timmy May is one sick motherfucker.

Of course Timmy May is a coward. Despite his boasting about his
assault weapons collection, he probably doesn't have the balls
to ice a mouse caught in a mousetrap. Timmy is probably so femme,
he wails like a banshee and asks whoever he sleeps with that day
to take the mouse out.

It's been showing for a while. Timmy May has been exposed on this list
as a coward, a liar, a racist, and an all-around scumbag.

Like I said, Timmy May is a coward.
