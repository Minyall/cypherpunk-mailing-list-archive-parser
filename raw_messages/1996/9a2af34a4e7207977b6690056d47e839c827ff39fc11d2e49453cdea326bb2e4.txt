Perhaps they are worried about the implications of putting thousands
of cryptographers into the private sector?

And what if you were one of them? You'd probably have a hard time
using or publishing anything classified.  Not to mention the usual
governmental conflict-of-interest work rules (for low-level employees
the standards of who you can work for after leaving the government is
a lot stricter than if you were a cabinet member).

Just a thought.
