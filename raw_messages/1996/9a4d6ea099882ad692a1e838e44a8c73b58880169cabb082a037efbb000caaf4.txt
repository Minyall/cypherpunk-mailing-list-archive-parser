Try the 908 area code, from which the initial report to alt.2600 came. I
haven't tried the number, because I don't want to incriminate myself, but
757 appears to be a valid exchange. 

The Cisco 1020 has a default password that some people forget to change.

A Boeing 757 went down under mysterious circumstances recently. The time was
approximately 10:20 AM. Why hasn't the press reported whether a close
Clinton associate involved in the Mena affair was aboard that plane? Hmmmmm.

Add the numbers up and you get 1777, "the shot heard 'round the world."

What was going on in Area 51 last week?

1-888-757-1020 is mysteriously "unreachable" now.
