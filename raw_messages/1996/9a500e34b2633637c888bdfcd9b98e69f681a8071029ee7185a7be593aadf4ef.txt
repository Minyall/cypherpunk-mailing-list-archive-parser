The Prime Minister's Social Security Number
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's US Social Security Number is
172-42-6111, according to the Boston  Consulting Group in Massachusetts,
which employed Netanyahu for about one-year during 1979-80.=20

The number indicated by the marketing firm contradicts information contained
in a credit report by  the US federally-regulated Transunion Company, pulled
from company files during the first days of July.  According to that report,
Netanyahu and an American named   John J. Sullivan both used Social Security
number 020-36-4537.

Questions were raised in the reports as to whether  Netanyahu had attempted
to create a false identity or had used a number which was not his.
Publication of the credit report findings, and later  reports indicating
that Netanyahu's name had suddenly been deleted from Transunion's files,
raised additional questions about possible computer break-ins into the
company's records.

Netanyahu aides have repeatedly claimed that the prime minister does not
remember his number. In order to untangle Netanyahu from the issue, aides
three weeks ago,   asked US officials to provide his number. According to
the Prime Minister's Office, that request has yet to be answered.
