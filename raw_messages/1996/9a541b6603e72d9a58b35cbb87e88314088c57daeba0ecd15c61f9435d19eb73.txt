Pardon me, Alex (and other fellow "flame"rs), but the ranting, 
name-calling, acting like children, etc. are ALL (repeat, ALL) much more 
interesting to read than the self-pitying, self-centered slobbering 
you're adding to the list.  If you could *not* be a child yourself for 
just a little bit, you could go do something worthwhile, like feed the 
homeless or something.
