Actually, animated gifs provide an excellent carrier for regular
stego. Just create your gif with 32 or so colors, then use the rest of
the bits for close matches. You could, say, use the standard
intersection of the Mac/Windoze pallettes. With something like this,
you get like 3 bits per pixel (if you do the color map right), which
could be enormous with a big animated gif.

Liking lossless animation standards,
