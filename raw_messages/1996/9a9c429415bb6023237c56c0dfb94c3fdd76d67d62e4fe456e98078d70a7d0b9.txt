I'm sure they're scared. What press? NBC News? The Seattle Times? 
The Wall Street Journal? Windows Magazine? Maybe Michael Kinsley 
will run a hard-hitting expose.

About a dozen recognizable computer magazine reporters and editors 
are on the win95netbugs mailing list. For months, the majordomo 
welcome message has told subscribers the bugs they should come to 
expect in Exchange:

1. Return-Path overrides From:. This is a Major Bummer on, for 
example, majordomo lists, because by default all replies go to the 
list owner.

2. No .signature support. Combine with the above and you have a real 
problem.

3. Annoying WINMAIL.DAT ms-tnef attachment.

4. Annoying "if you don't have a standard MIME mail reader, you need 
to upgrade" prepended to every message. Suddenly Microsoft supports 
IETF standards.

5. The alternative to ms-tnef is quoted/printable, not text/plain. 
Not all MUAs handle the quoted/printable generated by Exchange 
properly. Microsoft Mail and Pine, for example.
