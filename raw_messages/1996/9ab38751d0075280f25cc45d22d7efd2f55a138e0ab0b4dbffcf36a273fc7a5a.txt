The link on 
http://www.gatech.edu/lcc/idt/Miscellaneous/Glass_Houses/Organizations/Cypherpunks.html
that points to the hotwired article on the cypherpunks has changed from
http://www.hotwired.com/wired/1.2/features/cryptorebels.html   to
http://www.hotwired.com/wired/1.2/features/crypto.rebels.html.  Or 
perhaps a typo?  You may also want to include a link to 
http://www.hotwired.com/wired/1.2/features/crypto.rebels.sidebars.html
