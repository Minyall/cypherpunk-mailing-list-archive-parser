1) If you believe that Ritalin has a different effect on hyperactive
   children, that would seem to indicate that the May hypothesis that
   hyperactivity isn't a biological phenomenon is false.
2) Yes, it appears that Ritalin has s different effect on children
   with ADD, in that it reduces their symptoms. "depressant", though,
   isn't the right term.

3) Of course, this isn't a crypto mailing list any more, so why NOT
   discuss every topic under the sun.
