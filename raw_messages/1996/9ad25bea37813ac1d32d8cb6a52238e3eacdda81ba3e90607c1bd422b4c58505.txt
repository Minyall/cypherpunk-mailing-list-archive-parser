No it wouldn't. There is a tiny but nonzero probability that xoring
your one time pad with your text will result in a cyphertext equal to,
say, the Bible. Big deal. If the key is really random, the
cryptanalyst has no way to tell what the underlying text was.

Huh?

There is only one context in which things are compressable or not --
is there a smaller representation for them.

True enough, but the claim was that a random string has no
representation which is smaller than itself.
