I will be discontinuing my "Cpunks Frog Forwards" filtering service within
one week of the announcement of Perry Metzger's new crypto list, and possibly
sooner if my patience runs out, because 1) I have too many other things to
take care of in my life, 2) there really isn't as great a need for it anymore
due to the number and variety of other filtering services, and 3) my sanity
is being stretched to its limits having to wade through the mountains of
bullshit that now infest my inbox, even with procmail's kindly assistance.
Perry was right: Cypherpunks has become a sewer. As Robert Anton Wilson said,
"Only a sewer accepts everything."
 
Here is a list of the other filtering services I am currently aware of:
 
 o Alan Clegg runs an UNMODERATED cypherpunks digest, which only reduces the
   the volume of separate messages. Subscribe by mailing to
 
    majordomo@gateway.com
 
    (Standard majordomo list -- send "help" in the body for information.)
 
 
 o Eric Blossom runs a commercial "Cypherpunks Lite" for a modest fee,
   approximately 20.00US/year. Mail eb@comsec.com for more info. For a
   sample, read the archive at
 
   ftp://ftp.crl.com/users/co/comsec/cp-lite
 
 
 o Ray Arachelian runs a free filtering service, sticking mostly to news
   and technical stuff with a few other tidbits thrown in. Mail
 
   sunder@dorsai.dorsai.org
 
   for more info, or to be added.
 
 
See you all on the other side.
