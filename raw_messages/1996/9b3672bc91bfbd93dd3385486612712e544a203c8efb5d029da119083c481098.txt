   TIS will license its encryption key recovery technology 
   to Atalla 
 
      The agreement comes on the heels of two other recent 
      developments: a new Administration policy regarding 
      export controls on strong encryption, and TIS and 
      Atalla's participation in a new computer industry 
      alliance to promote adoption of a worldwide standard 
      for encryption key recovery. 
 
      RecoverKey supports the Administration's new policy by 
      allowing emergency recovery of an encrypted message or 
      file. This technology, patented by TIS and first 
      approved by the U.S. government for export in January 
      1996, is fundamental to approaches now being 
      considered as the basis for a new global standard.
