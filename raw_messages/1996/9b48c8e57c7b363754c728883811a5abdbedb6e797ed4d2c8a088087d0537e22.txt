[shrug] Happens to all of us.  Sometimes just keeping up on press releases
seems to be a full time job.

They are, but not exclusively.  They are supporting both JavaScript and VBScript
in IE3.  For that sort of work I think Basic might be more appropriate anyway.
(Added to the fact that they have committed to making the reference source
for VBScript available online with a free for whatever you want type of license.)

The spin at TechEd last week seemed to be a complete spectrum running
C++ -- Java -- VB depending on the desired speed/control vs. easy of 
development.
