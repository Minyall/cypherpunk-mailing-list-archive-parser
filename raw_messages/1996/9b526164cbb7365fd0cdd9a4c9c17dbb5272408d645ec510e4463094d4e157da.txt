I hope a lot of people read this - an excellent post in spite of the
paranoia.  However, there's a suggestion below (and perhaps in the [snip])
that government would use the rants by "aga" and the famous "Doctor" to
cut back on freedom, that somehow it would prove that cypherpunks are
inherently or latently "crazy" or whatever.

It's never been my impression that those kinds of rants had anything to
do with govt. clampdowns, in fact, the clamping down would more likely
follow the cypherpunks' heavy-handed responses to said rants.  Seems to
me that teaching how to filter would be the universal solution.
