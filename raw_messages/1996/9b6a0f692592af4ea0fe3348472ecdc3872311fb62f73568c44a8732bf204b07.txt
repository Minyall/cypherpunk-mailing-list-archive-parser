  The June 10, 1996 Network World carried a story on page 8 under the 
title "Microsoft breaks crypto barrier", which starts off as follows:

  " Microsoft Corp. last week said it will include cryptography-based 
security technology in its operating systems, messaging product and 
Web browser through a new set of APIs that will be available both in 
the U.S. and overseas.

 " The fact that the National Security Agency is allowing Microsoft 
to export the cryptographic APIs is somewhat of a coup for the 
software vendor, although the NSA did nothing to alter the current 
export ban on strong encryption."

  Later on, it says:

"  Microsoft's Crypto APIs will be available to third-party vendors
writing applications with embedded security. But the hardware or
software Crypto-engines for these applications will need to be
digitally signed by Microsoft before they will work with the APIs.
Under an unusual arrangement with the NSA, Microsoft will act as a
front man for the powerful U.S. spy agency, checking on whether the
vendors' products comply with U.S. export rules."

  I was a bit surprised not to see any discussion of this here. Is it 
just old news? Or maybe people here don't read Network World?

  I didn't paste in the whole article for copyright reasons. Since 
they seem to be on a one-month lag with posting back articles on 
their Web site, it just this week became available at 
www.nwfusion.com. 

  An MS/NSA alliance?
