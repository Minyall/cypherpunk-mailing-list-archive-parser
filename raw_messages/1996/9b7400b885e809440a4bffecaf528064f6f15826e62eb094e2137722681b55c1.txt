First off Alan posted private mail to the list. In this case mail
that was more than simply personal. 

Secondly unless Alan withdraws his allegations I will bring proceedings
against him for libel. While I accept his right to free speech I do
not accept that he has a right to attempt to restrict mine with his
threats of deportation.
