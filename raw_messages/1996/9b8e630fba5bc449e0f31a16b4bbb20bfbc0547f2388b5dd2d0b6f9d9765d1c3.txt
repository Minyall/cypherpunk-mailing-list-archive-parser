In a presentation at CommerceNet'96 in California, Jim Bidzos, CEO of RSA, clarified RSA's position on Clipper IV.

RSA supported IBM's efforts to establish a *commercial* key escrow system. For reasons that aren't clear to me, this commercial key escrow system turned into Clipper IV. RSA does not like or support the use of this system for GAK and will create a webpage explaining RSA's position on their site.
