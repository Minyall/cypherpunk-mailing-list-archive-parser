        Secure Computing Corp. has signed a $15 million deal with the
        National Security Agency to develop the agency's secure
        network server system for Department of Defense employees'
        E-mail.

        Officials of the St. Paul, Minn., company announced that
        Secure Computing will take about a year to complete the
        project, which will ensure security within the Defense
        Department E-mail system.

        The agreement is an extension of a deal Secure Computing first
        signed with the National Security Agency in 1992, according to
        company officials.
