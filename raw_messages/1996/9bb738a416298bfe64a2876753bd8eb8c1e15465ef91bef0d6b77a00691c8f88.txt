It's that time of year. Please donate the spare cycles on your Pentium or 
PowerPC to a good cause and help find a new Mersenne prime while you 
sleep. See http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/justforfun/range.htm
for details.

Seriously, folks, what is your PC's CPU doing half the time? I thought so.
