If they were antithetical then as freedom increased security would
decrease, and as security increased freedom would decrease.

It is not IMHO inevitable that if we increase security we will jeopardize
freedom.  My concern is that if we ignore security we will have no freedom
left to protect.

I don't believe the Internet community is split into two camps on this
issue - there appear to me to be many places where people draw their lines
at different points.  I don't believe that security is the enemy of
freedom.  I believe that freedom needs security in order to exist at all.
