In the course of channel surfing, I have once or twice come across
the Christians ranting about pornography.  They have both legitimate
and illegimate complaints, but mainly they emphasize the legitimate
complaint.  PICS addresses this legitimate complaint.

Should cut the volume down considerably, or else force them to drop
the hypocrisy, if indeed they are hypocrites.
