Ah, yes, Jim "I'll say anything to get the FBI its way" Kallstrom. I
remember when he spoke at length about snuff films in public without
flinching during the Clipper debate at the NY Bar Association.

I suspect, of course, that no one will have a chance to call him on
his lies in the line of duty. Too bad.
