In the march '96 issue of macworld there's a "Viewpoint" reporting on the
progress of the info superhighway.  Privacy and security issues predominate
the text, the primary source of which is larry irving --- "a top
administration adviser on telecommunications."
One issue, "mouse droppings" --- "a trail of every site they visit and for
how long [on the www], was highlighted as an example of existing privacy
regulations falling short of consumer expectations.  Apparently, the
amorphous public is shocked, *SHOCKED* I tell you , to discover that their
service providers are selling the personal preference information to the
highest bidder.  More info in article.
Would some rocket scientist speak to this terrifying mouse droppings issue?
