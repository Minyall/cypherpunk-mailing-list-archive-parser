  I can see two practical ways to build a netscape product outside
the US.  The first is to export the source code for the Navigator
with the crypto code removed.  All of the calls to crypto would
have to be removed as well.  I've heard some people claim that the
government could come after us on the grounds that we were taking
part in a conspiracy to export strong crypto.

  The other way would be to export a binary with pluggable crypto,
which is generally agreed to be regulated by the ITAR in the same
way as software that actually contains crypto.

  I suspect that to get around the US government in this way we
would have to develop the entire product outside of the US.  That
would be a very drastic move that is not likely to happen any
time soon.  We are going to invest some money and effort into
trying to get the current restrictions lifted first.

  Of course there are some of us who are ready and willing to go
if it comes to that...
