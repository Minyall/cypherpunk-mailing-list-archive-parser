Dear Cypherpunks,

Speaking to a colleague who works at Queen's University of Belfast about
the speculation of someone recently breaking PGP her response was, although
short, very interesting which I thought may be of interest to the
group.....

"When people talk of encryption they use the word break, they are
approaching from one way but not the only way. I am at present trying the
reciprocal, that is, to mend."

I asked her to go into more detail but she declined saying that.....

"The early experiments have worked."

What this means I don't know and she never anwsered whom the work was for
but maybe this is a route which one has not considered - if at all it
exists......the reciprocal ?.....
