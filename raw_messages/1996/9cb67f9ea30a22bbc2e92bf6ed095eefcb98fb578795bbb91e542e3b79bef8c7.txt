Can someone point me to any standard files that are used when testing
encryption strength. Iie i'm looking for a gourp of files that may have been
used by an agency or Internet group in the past that when encrypted were
tested for byte frequency etc. as well as cryptoanalytic atacks. thanks in
advance.
