Not _technically_ perhaps.  But in most cases it's a
go-down-to-the-police-station-and-have-them-sign-the-card operation.  Who
is it that can tell a random signature from a police signature exactly?
Like I said, standard print cards are available at the GPO.

Or _theoretically_ done in the light of day by a tech.

Depends on what you are looking to do.  If your goal is to deter random
searching through a national database, mutilation will probably be very
effective.  If they have the prints of the murderer (you) and you're a
suspect, mutilation aside from actually removing the fingers isn't going
to do anything.

See above about tech end around.

This is interesting.  I suspect that you'd have to have major damage to
the ridges however.
