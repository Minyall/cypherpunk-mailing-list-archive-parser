Something that has come up in my recent random thoughts...

Given that the US State Department classifies strong crypto as
munitions, is it possible that any laws passed outlawing the use of
strong crypto among US citizens could be declared unconsitutional, in
violation of the second amendment?

Are there any legal precedents that apply here? Is the question purely
academic (i.e., no such laws exist, no such bills are in the works, or
none have been tried)? Does anyone know of any laws on the books that
might be relevant to my question?
