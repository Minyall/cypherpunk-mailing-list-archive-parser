Greetings,

	There are other ways of detecting the application of the tap,
but at this time, the chance of detecting the existance of the tap is
reallistically pretty slim. 

	If the fiber is enclosed in a pressurised conduit, then a drop
in the conduit pressure indicates that someone MAY be trying to gain
access to the fiber.  While a pressurized glove-box around the conduit
may allow a break in the conduit to be made without detection, varying
the pressure in the conduit makes that a lot more difficult.  It all
depends on what the value is of the data you are trying to
protect/access.
