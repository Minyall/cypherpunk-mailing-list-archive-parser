My community had an accidental Ninja raid on the wrong house a year or so
back; the local yokels inadvertantly raided the home of a secret service
agent. Luckily, the agent was away, and only the wife and kids were home. 
Nobody started a firefight and nobody died. A lot of people ended up
looking like bozos, especially the local swat team in their
ninja-bunny-suits with no visable police i.d. whatsoever. The community
outrage likely did more for personal freedom than a dead nekid hippie
martyr armed with an HK could have ...
