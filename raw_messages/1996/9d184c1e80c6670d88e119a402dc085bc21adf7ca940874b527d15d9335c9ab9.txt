If anyone happens to know which vulnerability(s) this hack exploited I would
be most grateful if they could let me know, either on the list or privately
(stephen@iu.net). I am not asking for someone to publish the attack script
or specifics of what was done to get in, but I would like to know what holes
were used (e.g. cgi script error).

Respectfully...Stephen
