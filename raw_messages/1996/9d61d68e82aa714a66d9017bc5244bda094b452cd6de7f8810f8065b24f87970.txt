Pyramid schemes invalidate the worth of one's word. By gaining financially from one's recommendation said recommendation becomes of dubious trustworthiness. Traditionally, personal experience and anecdotes about products, goods and services have served as reputable guides in consumer culture. By gaining financially from one's word, one is cashing in their reputation.
