Some remailers (read: Mixmaster) include a destination.block capability.

The target can be taught about mail filters.

	The target can ask the remailer op to remove the particular
alias, after verifying that he receives mail sent to it.  Too clever
by half solutions such as ZKP would work, as would the remailer-op
sending an arbitrary message encrypted to the complainer to the
address in question.  If the complainer gets the message, either he's
sniffing well, mucking with the DNS, or is the intended recipient of
the nym server.
