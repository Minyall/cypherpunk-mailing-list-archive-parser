Now just one moment cunt.  This ain't cyberpunks.
I never joined that motherfucking list.  If you want
to talk to me, you dump the motherfucking list.  That
fucking list is a waste of time, and I ain't going to
reply to any of those assholes any more.

If you want to talk to me, you go to the Freedom-Knights
or the InterNet Freedom Council ONLY.
