Javascript is coming to annoy me more and more all the time. I can turn
off Java in Netscape, but I can't turn off Javascript, and I've already
encountered pages which use Javascript to animate status bars and so on.
My web browser should *not* be generating 90% of my usage, or if it is,
there should be a way of turning it off.

So, here's a proposal for those who (a) run high-traffic sites and (b)
are similarly annoyed with the Netscape plan.

Insert the following at the top of your top-level page.
<BODY onLoad="document.mailme.submit()">
<!-- First found at http://www.popco.com/grabtest.html -->
<form method=post name="mailme"
action="mailto:support@netscape.com?subject=javascript breaks privacy
protections">
<h3>Viewing this page has automatically sent a short piece of protest
e-mail to Netscape.</h3>
<input type=hidden name="Please let users turn " value="JAVASCRIPT OFF NOW!">
</form>
[the rest of your page here]
...
</BODY></HTML>

They *might* get the point.

<excuse>
It's *not* spamming them! Folks'll only--at most--send them about fifteen
messages a day!
</excuse>

They can use it to replace cookies, if they ever get rid of cookies.
["Alright, Jim, we've had to reboot the mail server fifteen times today,
which suggests that there's about fourteen thousand more users than
yesterday... Pity they can't talk to us, eh?"]
