Japanese Data-Scrambling Chip Renews Debate

      By JOHN MARKOFF
      
     
     
     
     
     W ASHINGTON -- Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. has quietly
     begun selling a powerful data-scrambling chip set that is likely to
     undermine the Clinton administration's efforts to restrict the
     export of the fundamental technology for protecting secrets and
     commerce in the information age.
     
     The existence of the two-chip set, which will have broad potential
     application for local computer networks, the Internet and telephone
     switching networks, was disclosed in Washington in a speech Monday
     at a public policy workshop by the chief executive of RSA Data
     Security, a Silicon Valley-based company that has frequently dueled
     with the administration over its export-control policies.
