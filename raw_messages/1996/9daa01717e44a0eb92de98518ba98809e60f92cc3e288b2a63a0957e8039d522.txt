WhoWhere.com and ParsecWeb.com are being firewalled from all but a few
networks at stanford.edu, ucr.edu, and other places. This is a step I
recommend to others. 

Unfortunately, I have more important things to worry about than fighting
off threats from some petty net-abusing scam, but I'd be glad to give the
reasons privately.
