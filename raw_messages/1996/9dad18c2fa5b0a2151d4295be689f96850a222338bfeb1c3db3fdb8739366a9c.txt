As far as majordomo is concerned, - yes.  However, there are those who 
subscribe invisible and therefore wouldn't show up when you say "who 
cypherpunks" to majordomo@toad.com.

I will not argue on John's reaction since I do not know him, nor have I 
met him, however, the fact that Vulis posts and reads cypherpunks means 
he's still here.

If he had been ultimatly censored, shot, stoned, beat on, and 
cement-booted, he certainly wouldn't be able to post.  He's still here. 
So the above is bullshit.

It's not a question that he found a way to read from and post to the 
cypherpunks list.  He hasn't been prevented from doing so, therefore his 
unsubscription hasn't been enforced, so he's still here.

If before he was unsubscribed he was able to post messages and read 
messages, and now that he's unsubscribed he's able to post messages and 
read messages, what's the difference to the rest of us on the list?  As 
far as we can see, he's still subscribed.  Never mind that he gets his 
messages from usenet or elsewhere, he's still here.  There is NO 
difference to the rest of cypherpunks.
