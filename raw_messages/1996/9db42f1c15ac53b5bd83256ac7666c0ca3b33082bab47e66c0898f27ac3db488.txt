I got a mouse pad in the mail today, mailed in
Maryland, but otherwise in a plain brown envelope.
It has nice, understated gold seal announcing it
is from the National Security Agency's Information
Systems Security Organization.

Obviously it wasn't export controlled.

I met these people at the recent USENIX
conference; there was an Air Force related trade
show in the center next door to the San Diego
Marriott. I was looking for people to submit
papers to the upcoming USENIX Unix and Network
Security Conference in San Jose in July. The
deadline for extended abstracts is one month away
(hint, hint).

Greg.
