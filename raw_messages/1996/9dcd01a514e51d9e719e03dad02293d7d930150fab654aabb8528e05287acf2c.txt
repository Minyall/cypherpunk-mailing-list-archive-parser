The cat is out of the bag. Janet Reno is calling for mandatory Government
Access to Keys. Not that her statement would surprise anyone on this list.
Still, I believe the administration has never before publicly stated that
people will be _required_ to deposit their encryption keys with the
government. I wonder what the penalties for failure to comply with this
requirement will be.

[I have requested a transcript of Reno's speech from the Commonwealth Club.
I will make the relevant parts available as soon as I get it].
