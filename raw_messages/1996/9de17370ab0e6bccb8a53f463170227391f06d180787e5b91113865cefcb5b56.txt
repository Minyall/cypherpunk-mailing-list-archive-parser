Listen fool,

Much as we might advance this possibility we do not need to.

Your system has been proven insecure by two cryptanalytic attacks, 
one by Adam and one by myself. if you cannot understand these attacks 
what are you doing creating cryptosystems and if you can understand 
them WHY are you still calling your system secure?

Please enlihten us as to which of these two distinct cases you fall 
into, if 1. then you are a fool, if 2. then you are a stubborn fool.
