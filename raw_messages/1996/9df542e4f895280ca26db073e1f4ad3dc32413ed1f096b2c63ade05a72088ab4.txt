  OFFICE MEMO         RSAREF for Mac?                       Date:  5/14/96

It seems that I have seen this question asked before, but as I had no need for
the answer at that time, I trashed it. So, without further ado:

Can anyone point in the direction of RSAREF for the Macintosh? 

expectantly, (no, i'm not pregnant,)
