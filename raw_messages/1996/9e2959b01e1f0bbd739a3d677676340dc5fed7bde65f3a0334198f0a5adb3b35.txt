Good ideas, all. And deploying steganography is a natural fit to this situation.

And this is yet another example of the negative effects of the U.S.
restrictions on crypto export: where widespread crypto tools might be used
to destabilize repressive governments, the lack of these tools integrated
into common applications makes it harder for freedom-fighters in China,
Burma, Iran, France, etc., to use them.

I often think the American CIA and NSA are actually just enforcers of the
status quo, preferring a New World Order of crypto-restricted citizen-units
to a more diverse, anarchic world in which private citizens and
corporations can thwart the desires of central governments.
