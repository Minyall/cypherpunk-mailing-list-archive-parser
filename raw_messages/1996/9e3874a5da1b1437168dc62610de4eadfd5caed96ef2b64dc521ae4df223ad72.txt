     Has anyone recently had problems trying to upload their public key to
   BAL's PGP Public Key Server?
     I had no problem connecting to BAL's site.  However, I tried several times
   to submit my public key and kept receiving "server down, try later, etc."
   message.

The machine the keyserver runs on was having problems yesterday, which
caused the keyserver to get behind on e-mail requests and also shut down
the "beta" keyserver.  Things are back to normal now.
