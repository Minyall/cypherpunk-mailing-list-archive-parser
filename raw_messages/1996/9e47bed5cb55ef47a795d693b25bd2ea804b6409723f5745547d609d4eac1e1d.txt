Well, yes, but not just that... The force (and indeed the type of
explosion) caused by a pipe bomb depends on several things, including (but
not limited to), the type of pipe, the type of explosives, and the
material used to seal the ends of the pipe.

Idealy you would use gauged copper pipe (copper bends, tears, etc,
comparitvly easy), with copper stopping at the end.  The stopping needs to
be the same material as the pipe,  or else there will be significantly
less gass-expansion when the bomb goes off (i.e., the end is the weekest
point, you've made a rather shitty shotgun).  One might also conceive of
using actuall explosives (C4, Semtex, plasticene) in a pipe bomb, rather
than the usual "matcheads and gunpowder" approach as suggested by many
"cookbooks".

yes.  but for best results these "alterations" to the pipe must be of
uniform depth and spacing.

I wouldn't limit that to Russia.  Every kid goes through their pyromaniacy
stage, its really just a question of how good they are at it ;)

I'll bet.

Hrmm.. that's a little extreme, dontcha think?

Hrmm... I've always lived in the US, and I lost interest in that sort of
thing when I was ~14...

Bullshit.
