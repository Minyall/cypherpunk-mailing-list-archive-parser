This statement is entirely wrong and totally false.

What I really meant to say, rather than "tolerance for offenses like...", was that there is created an atmosphere which is tolerant towards classifying certain kinds of thinking as "thought crimes".   And once it is allowed that some types of thoughts, or some types of thinking, are classifiable as criminally offensive, I expect most anyone on this list can extrapolate the consequences of such a development upon the collective conscience.
