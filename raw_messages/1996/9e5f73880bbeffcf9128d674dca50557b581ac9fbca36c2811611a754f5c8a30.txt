PGP has provided a key recovery option for several years.
You can either use the EncryptToSelf option, or use multiple recipients,
one of which is your favorite backup service (or yourself,
perhaps one of your other keys.)  Works fine, and you can use it
to recover the session key when you want.  Keep a backup copy
of your private key on a floppy in your safe deposit box,
and maybe keep your passphrase on a yellow sticky (:-)
and you're all set.

Now, if PGP had a single-DES option for encryption, they could
apply for an export permit......

  Imagine if three million people voted for somebody they _knew_,
  and the politicians had to count them all.
