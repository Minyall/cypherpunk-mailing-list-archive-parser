Not really - you just give the prize to the first person to return the 
correct key (just like a real lottery).

BTW, if you use a central site to allocate ranges to search, this site 
should not know the correct key, as otherwise it could decide who gets 
the chocolate bar with the golden ticket.

If this project is run, I can't see it getting a hit for at least six 
months unless its _really_ well promoted. The java approach would be a cool 
hook - a slowish applet for your web page with something along the lines of

 "You may already have won 20c; whilst you're reading this page, your
computer is playing the cypherpunks challenge. For a better chance of
winning, download this free high performance screen saver and game piece."
