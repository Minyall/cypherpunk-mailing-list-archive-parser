Familiar phrases indeed. Now, it seems to me that the Commerce Clause and
other Constitutional portions you cited could apply as well to 
communications between two U.S. citizens inside the U.S. as they do to the
citizen-alien communications you mentioned. Yet if I read you correctly
earlier, you don't think the USG has the right to regulate those
communications. Why the distinction ?
