A tiny nit to pick here.  The Cray T3D and T3E computers are
massively parallel machines consisting of DEC Alpha chips hooked
up in a 3D Torus configuration.  They would probably make pretty
decent key search engines, as opposed to the general purpose
vector supercomputers Cray is better known for.

You left out the most interesting part!
