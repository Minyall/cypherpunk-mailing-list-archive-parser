On my Beginnings of Freedom page, I've had links to some similar sites
for a while now:

Banned Media and Organizations List

I keep them around as examples of laughable assumptions that shrivel at
the slightest sign of daylight. If I don't keep an eye on folks who espouse
bad ideas, they're more likely to pose a threat to me at some point in the
future; I'd rather know exactly what they believe, and what they want, and
how they hope to accomplish it, the better to protect myself and possibly
work against them in some manner. (It'll probably get worse; I don't see
David Brin's vision in _Earth_ of "every man a spy/Boy Scout/Neighborhood
Watcher" as being that far-fetched. And that's the least possible evil.. :-S

spokeswoman, quoted in AP 1/27/96. I don't know about you, but the only folks
I know who'd enjoy seeing someone in uniform on their porch are leathermen...
