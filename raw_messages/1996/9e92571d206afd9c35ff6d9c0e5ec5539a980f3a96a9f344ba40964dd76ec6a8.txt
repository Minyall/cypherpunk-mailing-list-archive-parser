	One thing that may make a difference in this is that the major
providers are getting overloaded. We're currently having problems here (in
terms of slowdowns, failures to connect, et al) because MCI's trunk lines
are majorly overloaded, and that's who _all_ the local ISPs go through. I am
currently attempting to persuade them to at least get contacts with another
ISP (and to serve as a router) in order to speed up local stuff.
