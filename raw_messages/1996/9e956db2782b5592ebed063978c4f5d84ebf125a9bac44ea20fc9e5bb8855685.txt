Mailcrypt support for type 2 remailers doesn't really work very well.
You can't specify more than one recipient.  You can't post to a
newsgroup with the "post: news.group" destination.  And somehow not
all the right headers end up making it into the next message.

A better emacs interface to mixmaster remailers is definitely needed.
