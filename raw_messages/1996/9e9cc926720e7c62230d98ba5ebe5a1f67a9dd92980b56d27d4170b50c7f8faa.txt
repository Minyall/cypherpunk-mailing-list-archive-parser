Well, I'm discouraged.  I'm looking for strongly encrypted cellular telephones,
but I can't seem to find many.  If you know of some, could you pass along some
pointers for me?  I would really like to avoid using a GAK enabled product,
if there's any way to avoid it (even if it means paying lots of extra $$$).

Cheers,
Phil
