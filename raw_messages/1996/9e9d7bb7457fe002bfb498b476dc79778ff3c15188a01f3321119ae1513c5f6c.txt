That's what I said in line 1.  Your point?
(And of course if these machines were on the Web as servers, they could take
advantage of ActiveX on clients.)

I've seen many Forth implementations, including pseudo-compilers similar
to what you describe. They sure generated a lot of instructions and an
occasional speed improvement over a simple-minded interpreter.

Can it go out on the web and talk to arbitrary servers?
Can it work with local files?

Where did the 10-25% figure come from?

Of course, Ray works for Earthweb, who has a "special partnership" with
SunSoft, and gets paid to badmouth competing products and push Java when
it's clearly inappropriate.
