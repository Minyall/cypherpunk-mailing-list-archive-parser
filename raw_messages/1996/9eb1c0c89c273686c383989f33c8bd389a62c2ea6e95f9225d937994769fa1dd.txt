Really, then how come you keep posting your messages through
cypherpunks, a list over which an alleged "Faggot" has complete
control?  You keep telling others not to post to the list, but you
keep posting there yourself.  Could it be that you have no authority
yourself, and thus can't even keep your own E-mail away from the
control of "Faggots"?

I guess there aren't very many good men left, and the few who are left
don't have any authority themselves--They are forced to use mailing
lists under the authority of "Faggots."  I guess you loose and the
"Faggots" win.  Game over, now shut up.
