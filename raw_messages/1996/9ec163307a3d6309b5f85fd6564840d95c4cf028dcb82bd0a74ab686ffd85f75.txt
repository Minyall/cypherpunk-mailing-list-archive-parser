The series is 'Natural Born Losers' Where this biker chick and
her new boyfriend perform a sex act with the soon to be dead
ex-boyfriend, and then they both use a hacksaw to chop the poor
fellow into pieces.  The couple shot the film and dropped it
off to a 'friend' at a one-hour photo place and someone else
looked at the photos and called the police.  Don't eat *anything*
before viewing these pictures!
