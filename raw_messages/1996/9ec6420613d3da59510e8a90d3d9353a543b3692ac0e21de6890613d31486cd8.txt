If AOL wants to stop spammers, let them. They have every right to do so as
long as their agreement with their customers permits it. It's a matter of
contract law between AOL and its customers and should not involve the
spammers and a lawsuit brought by the spammers.

It seems as though the judge was snookered by the spammers' claim of U.S. 
Mail-like service, free speech, blah. The right to free speech does 
extend to corporations; in that way, it includes the right *not* to speak.
