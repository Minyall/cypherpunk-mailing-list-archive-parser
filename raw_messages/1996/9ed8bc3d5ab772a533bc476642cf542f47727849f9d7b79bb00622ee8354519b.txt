Ah, but what about the _fee_ for registering a key? You really didn't think
this would be free, did you?

(It costs money to register cars, guns, etc., so why would it be "free" to
register a key?)

Besides being a revenue enhancement tool, charging a fee stops this sort of
flooding attack.

(Note: One of my biggest objections to GAK, besides the political/civil
rights issue, is what it does to systems which generate lots and lots of
keys on an ad hoc, continuing basis. GAK, if enforced, puts a major speed
bump in the way and increases costs, possibly making certain kinds of
systems infeasible.)
