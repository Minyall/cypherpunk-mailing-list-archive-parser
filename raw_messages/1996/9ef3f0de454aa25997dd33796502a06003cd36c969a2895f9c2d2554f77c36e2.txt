Yes, but it requires alot of time and money.  (As well as a nice car and a
six figure income.)  

I recommend taking the firewall out to a nice restaurant, feeding it dinner,
taking it out for drinks and then back to your house or apartment.

If everything works, you should be able to penetrate said firewall.

But she will not return your calls in the morning...
