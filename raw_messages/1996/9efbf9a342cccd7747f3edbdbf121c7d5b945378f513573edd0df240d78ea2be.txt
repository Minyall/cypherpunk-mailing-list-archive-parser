I've noticed recently that two PGP programmers (Mr. Zimmerman and Mr. 
Atkins) do not seem to PGP clearsign their messages to this list. In fact, 
a surprisingly small percentage of messages on the C-punk list are signed. 
This despite the fact that the average subscriber is at least literate in 
PGP.

Does anybody have any speculation on why this is?

Is it because people consider mundane mail unimportant enough to sign?

Is it because the members of this list are more concerned with encryption 
than authentication?

Is it because most mail programs are not PGP aware?

Is it because of the weaknesses in MD5?
