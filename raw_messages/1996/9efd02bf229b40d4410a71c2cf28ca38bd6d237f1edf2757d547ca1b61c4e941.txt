I need someone who can give a speech on Contingency Disaster Planning 
from November 4-6 in Northern California to the computer security group 
at NASA AMES. Female speakers are encouraged as well.

All expenses would be paid as well as a speaker fee for each individual 
day. While this is a *one time* event, it may be possible that it would 
lead to other engagements on a periodic basis both across the US, and 
infrequently in Japan and Europe.

Email me if interested or if you need more information.
