October 25 Science reports on the latest teleportation research
in "To Send Data, Physicists Resort to Quantum Voodoo."

It describes a laser-driven apparatus for transmitting highly
secure encoded (but not encrypted) messages via entangled
photon states.

IBM's Charles Bennett says, "as other researchers work to
harness quantum mechanics for computation and
cryptography, teleportation could become the equivalent
of a quantum mail service."
