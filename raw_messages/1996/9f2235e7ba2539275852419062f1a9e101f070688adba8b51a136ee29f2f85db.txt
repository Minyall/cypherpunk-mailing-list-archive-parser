If all you want to do is hide, not commit fraud, you're pretty safe. 
There's nothing that says that you can't change your name or use an MBE
mailbox or refuse to give out your phone number or even fake an employee
ID - as long as you're not trying to defraud someone.

"Past the wounds of childhood, past the fallen dreams and the broken families,
through the hurt and the loss and the agony only the night ever hears, is a
waiting soul.  Patient, permanent, abundant, it opens its infinite heart and
asks only one thing of you ... 'Remember who it is you really are.'"
