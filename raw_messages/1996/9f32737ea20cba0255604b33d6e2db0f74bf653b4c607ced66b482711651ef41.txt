This is the meme I've been trying to spread -- that 56-bit DES is *not*
secure. This cuts through all the rhetoric about differences between key
recovery and key escrow, who's going to be in this industry alliance, etc. 

Bottom line: it sucks; your data are insecure; don't use it. That 
argument is one jlists can understand.

And I think I've been successful. Tomorrow's issue of a popular
newsmagazine may mention just this.
