Who said anything about C, Detweiler. Smalltalk. Scheme. Postscript. 
There are dozens of them out there. All of them are totally machine
independent. You could run Smalltalk images byte for byte identical on
large numbers of different processors years and years and years
ago. Byte codes aren't new either -- Smalltalk's virtual machine, PSL
and others had them decades ago.

The rest of your comments are equally silly.
