Okay, I setup a quick web site for the large integer class I talked
about yesterday.  The URL is 

http://www.mit.edu:8001/people/grimm/Int/Int.home.html

Included in the package is a quick demonstration using Fibonacci
numbers.  (Beware: the code as-is spits everything out in hex.)

Comments, suggestions, etc. are always welcome.
