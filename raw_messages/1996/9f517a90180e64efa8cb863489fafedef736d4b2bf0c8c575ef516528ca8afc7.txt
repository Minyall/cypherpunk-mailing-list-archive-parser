Here's our chance to talk with, learn from, and educate the folks who
are pushing the concept of information warfare and seeing where it
goes.  The conference itself costs $1000 to attend, but I bet it's
free to speakers.  So dig out some related concept you've been wanting
to pin down on paper, write it up, and send it in.  It'd be pretty
silly to run or defend against an InfoWar without the cypherpunks, so
let's introduce ourselves before the hostilities begin.  I've got a
paper in mind...
