I think the other big, if not worse, question is, why is it that Flight 
800 is still so STEADILY in the news, even now?  They seem to be really 
good at fighting back and forth with themselves with the same outcomes.
I don't like this, one bit.

I haven't seen this much annoying trash on the news since OJ Shrimpson 
was around.

I don't watch the news anymore.  I don't want to know what I am becoming 
a part of (outlawing illegal immigrants from being able to go to school, 
nationwide ID cards, being a number (and this only began in the late 70's),
and so on and so forth -- we are becoming that which we sought to escape 
in the 1400's, and that frightens the hell out of me.)

OBcrypto:  There is a product in beta-testing stage now called Secure 
Mail (and secure web protocol).  I haven't gotten around to testing it 
yet, but have the facts, if anyone wants them -- I'd like to see this 
pseudoencryption go down the toilet.  It makes me ill, though not as ill 
as the original subject of this post... :)

Have a nice day.
