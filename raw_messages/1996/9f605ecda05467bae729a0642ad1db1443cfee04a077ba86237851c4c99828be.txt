The religious right did not *support* the "push to regulate the
Internet" -- they drafted, defended, and pushed through the damn CDA!

Did you *read* the message I posted, with information about how the
religious right/anti-porn groups created and then worked to push this
legislation through Congress?

Did you *read* the files in my Rimm archive, detailing how an editor at
the Georgetown Law Journal worked to get Rimm's "research" approved for
publication? Did you know that he's a leading anti-porn activist?

Did you *read* Mike Godwin's collection of articles about how the
religious right organied the anti-porn scare?

Certainly the mass media were complicit, but they served a supporting role.
