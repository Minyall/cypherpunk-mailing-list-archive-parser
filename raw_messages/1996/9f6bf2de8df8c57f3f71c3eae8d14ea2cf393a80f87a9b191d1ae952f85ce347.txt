Does Compuserve count as the Internet?  It soon will be the Internet since
they are dropping their proprietary software.  TSB (including TSB's Jersey
subsidiary) has a new net-based banking arrangement using Compuserve.  See
the TSB web site http://www.tsb.co.uk/pcbank.htm or Compuserve (GO TSB).
TSB in Jersey (or predecessor institutions) has been there since the 1820s
or so.
