Isn't there just the tiniest bit of a double-standard here?  If the ship was 
supposedly "justified" in firing on an airplane just because it 
_could_become_ a threat, and _could_ fire a missile at any moment, then why 
can't we turn this logic around and claim that an Iranian aircraft could 
view an Aegis as a ship which "could become a threat" and "could fire a 
missile at any moment."

Generally, I'm not sympathetic to the Iranians; far from it.  But I can 
smell hypocrisy a mile away and the US military's "logic" in this area is 
unbelievable.
