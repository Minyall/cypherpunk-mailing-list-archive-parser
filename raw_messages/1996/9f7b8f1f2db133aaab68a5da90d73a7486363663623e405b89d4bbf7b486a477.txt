I have some anagram code that could be easily adapted to do what you
say.  Basically, it will find any anagram of a word exists in a
dictionary.  This means you can query an arbitrarily large dictionary at
>100 words per second.  

Actually, now that I think about it, it takes 2 seeks, but you could
remove one of them if you were doing a lot of queries.  (i.e. 1+n seeks
for n=number of words.)
