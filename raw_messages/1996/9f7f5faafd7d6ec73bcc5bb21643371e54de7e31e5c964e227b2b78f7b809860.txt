Oh, that's a different kettle of fish entirely. As a matter of fact I do
have catastrophic coverage only ($2500 annual deductible and other
limitations), but were I less hale and youthful, or had I a family, I would
probably opt for "managed care."

However, you'll find that catastrophic coverage really isn't that much
cheaper than full "managed care," because without intimate knowledge of my
habits and detailed records of regular doctor's visits, the insurance
company doesn't trust me as much as it trusts a "managed care" patient.
