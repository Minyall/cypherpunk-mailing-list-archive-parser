As always when this question comes up, I give this answer:
The only idea that seems to address the issue of chaining of realtime 
connections is Wei Dai's PipeNet. However, Wei doesn't have the time to 
turn it into code. Neither do I. But my offer from years ago still 
stands: I will fully finance the *second* node running PipeNet.

For newcomers, PipeNet is a "remailer" for IP. You use constant bandwidth 
pipes to conceal traffic. To be useful in any way, PipeNet requires at 
least a dedicated T1.
