Most of the emphasis in the paper seems to be on the lack of a 
denotational semantics for java and the java VM, and on the lack of a 
formally defined set of rules for type inferencing rules. 

For security purposes, java-the-language is not particularly important; 
it's the VM code that counts. This is a shame, as it's pretty easy to 
come up with a reasonably clean denotation for java, wheras the byte code 
gets pretty messy. It would probably be easier to get a cleaner semantics 
if you define a set of rules to transform the byte code into an alternate 
form and then define the denotational semantics for that. The paper 
mentions  that the authors believe the VM to be unsuitable for a 
denotational semantics, but the issue is not explored to any great depth.

I take it twenty minutes before I go to sleep; seems to work pretty well.
