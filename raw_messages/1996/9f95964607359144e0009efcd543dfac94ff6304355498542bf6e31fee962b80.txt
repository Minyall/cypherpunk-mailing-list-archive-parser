This, of course, is not any indication that we should not stay
vigilant.  As is clear from every public statement by the past
and present administrations, they have an agenda to protect
their monopoly on intelligence gathering.  They clearly have a
strong interest in hamstringing every single challenge to the
current regulations.  If ITAR is torn down, then they will use
the OECD and other international organizations to stop the
flow of encryption.  It is NOT useful to reason with them.

It takes direct confrontation using legislation and court case
battles to fix this problem.
