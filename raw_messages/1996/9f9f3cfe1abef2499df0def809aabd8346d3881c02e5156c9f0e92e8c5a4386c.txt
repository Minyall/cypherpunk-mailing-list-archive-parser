This was in the 10/28 issue of Network World Infusion.  Did anyone else
see it?

Gurus prove that encryption's not all it's cracked up to be

	Two eminent Israeli cryptographers last week sent a shock wave
	through security circles with the announcement that they had
	figured out a way to extract private Data Encryption Standard
	(DES) encryption keys from such things as PCs and smart cards.
	Adi Shamir and Eli Biham showed they could get at even a
	Triple-DES secret key, by applying small amounts of heat or
	radiation to change the key's bit structure. Then, using a
	technique known as Differential Fault Analysis, they compared
	the encrypted outputs from both the damaged and undamaged cards
	to derive the key. ... Links include Biham's own overview of
	their findings, encryption primers and a time line of
	cryptography through the ages.  DocFinder: 2814.
