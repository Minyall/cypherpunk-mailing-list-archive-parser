Unfortunately, PGP 2.6.2 will do this only if the PGP message has
proper keyIDs.  It finds the proper key by matching the keyID in the
PGP message to the keyIDs in the secret keyring.  If you remove the
keyIDs from the message (as stealth does), PGP 2.6.2 cannot find the
secret key to use.

One fix would be to have PGP (say, PGP3 ;) try all the keys on your
secret keyring if the keyID in the message is 0.  In other words, you
can pseudo-stealth a message by leaving off the keyID and PGP3 would
attempt all the secret keys.  If one worked, you'd be able to read it.
This doesn't solve the whole problem of stealth; you still know that
what you have is a PGP message, and even that it is an encrypted
message, but you do not know to whom it has been encrypted.  The nice
thing about this approach is that this works for multiple recipients,
too!

NOTE: while the PGP3 API should be able to handle this case, I do not
know if support for this feature will be implemented in PGP 3.0
