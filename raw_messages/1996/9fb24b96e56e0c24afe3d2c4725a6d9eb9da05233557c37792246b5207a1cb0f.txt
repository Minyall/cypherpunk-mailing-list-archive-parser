And David Chaum, Digicash, etc. And not just Holland, but Europe as well.
And America. The point being that people should carefully consider the uses
to which technology is put. (I agree that one should not "hold back" on
technical/scientific discoveries out of unreasonable fear; my comments were
mainly triggered by your own comments about the "need to catch criminals.")

This "I've said what I want to say and now I want you to shut up" rejoinder
is all too common here on this list. If you only want to talk crypto, go
ahead. But  others of us will discuss what we think is important.

As it happens, I think any of the variants of "government access to keys"
(GAK, key escrow, key recovery, binding cryptography, traceable e-cash,
etc.) are worthy topics of discussion. Pure crypto, absent any
sociopolitical implications, is probably best discussed in
sci.crypt.research, the Crypto and EuroCrypt Conferences, networks of
preprint distribution, and suchlike.

We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
