   8-8-96. Wash Tech: 
 
   "Internet Betting Spurs Regulatory Interest." 
 
      A new commission to investigate the nation's $40 
      billion gambling industry will initiate Congress' 
      latest effort to curb the fast-growing gambling 
      industry, and may open up additional efforts to 
      regulate the burgeoning Internet industry. 
 
      Extra legislation is not needed to suppress on-line 
      gambling, said Bernie Horn, National Coalition Against 
      Legalized Gambling. "If the Justice Department wanted 
      to, it could make things unbearable for companies 
      offering on-line gambling from outside the country," 
      he said.
