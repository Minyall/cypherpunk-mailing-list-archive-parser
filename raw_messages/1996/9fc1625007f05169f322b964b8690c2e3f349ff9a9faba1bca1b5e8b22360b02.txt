d. The "V-Chip" device makes a network query to the selected rating service
to ask for a rating.  What happen when the rating service is unreachable is
just one of the many parameters that the parent needs to set.  (If designed
right, no parent could use it, but its availability would still stop the
adult censorship croud in congress.)

This approach as the advantage that the communications costs accrue to
those using the feature and not to everyone else.  A disadvantage is that
each content item needs some ID.
