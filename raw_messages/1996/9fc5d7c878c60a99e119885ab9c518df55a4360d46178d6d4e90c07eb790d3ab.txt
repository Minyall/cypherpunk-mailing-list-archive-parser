I've posted the instructions _several_ times in the last week or two.
(Others have also provided instrutctions.) You obviously are not even
looking at messages. Which is fine. Except how  do you expect to find the
instructions if someone _does_ send them to you?

Nevertheless, I am again including them below. I doubt it will help.

I predict MatriX Spider (how clever) will soon be issuing frantic
"unsudcribe" and "unsribe" messages to this list.
