I have actually had Secure File System, Secure Drive, and Secure Device
all installed with mounted volumes at the same time under Win95.  However,
32bit file access is not the problem.  When you load a TSR in Win95, the
operating system forces you into 16bit DOS compatability mode.  I'm not a
kernal guru so I can't explain all the specifics, but it basically makes
95 act as Win-3.11 and looses multithreading (as it were) and creates
serious memory paging problems if you have >32mb installed.

Thanks for the reply though .. and if you need assitance with getting
SECDEV working under 95, just drop me a note.
