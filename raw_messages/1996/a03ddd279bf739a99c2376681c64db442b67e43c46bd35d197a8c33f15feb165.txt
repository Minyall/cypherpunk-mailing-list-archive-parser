I am afraid it is not that simple.  Remember that the mailbombing consists
of many, many horny little geeks responding to a single message.  They are
replying to the same message (and probibly adding a few "me too!" lines),
not mailing the same one over and over again.

Another idea would be to keep a md5 (or other) hash list of the reply block
used and have a disabled list for such spam attacks.  (Unfortunatly this
requires code, thus time.)

Pretty nasty variation on a "denial of service" attack.  What next?  Fake
"David Rhodes does e-cash" messages with the target's e-mail address?
