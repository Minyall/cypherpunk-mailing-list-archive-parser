	Neat script.  I had an idea for verification of pages using a
Java applet.  You have in the signed page an applet tag that would
reference the authenticator applet (which because of security restrictions
would need to be loaded from local disk, but . . .).  The applet would
get the URL of the current page and save it to disk.  It would also grab
the signature (either by just appending ".asc", or with something processed
by Ed's script by searching for the key phrase).  The applet then runs
PGP and verifies the page and pops up a window with the results.  It would
then tell the browser to re-read the verified document from the local
filesystem.

	There are a couple of problems (i.e. you'ld need to provide an
applet from the server that would put up a pointer to where to get your
copy of the real authenticator applet and how to install it), but does
anyone see any other problems with it (Aside from it being a mega 
kludge :)?  And does anyone know when PGP 3.0 is out so that a Java
wrapper could be put around the library to make it even easier? :)

	What do you think, sirs?
