"how can you be so sure that the cypherpunks lists is really
 what you think it is?" 

'Cause I'm real, real smart.

"a bunch of people from around the country independently
interested in crypto?" 

"An effete corp of impudent snobs who fancy themselves intellectuals."
(Spiro Agnew)

"an agent provacteur, or agent saboteur, could
create a vastly different perception regardless of the 
input of other people."

It's true there are juveniles who occasionally disturb the list, but I expect that most members have a real interest in the subjects discussed and wish to bring out pithy points of truth & wisdom for all to behold, taking full credit for their contribution to the general atmosphere of learned intelligence.

People have to grow up from childhood, Nuri-logical, and even then it's possible to be mistaken & to be misled.  But there is no substitute for work, for the work of thought, which is the only means any human being has to solve the problems of living as a conscious, sensitive being.  The only way to deal with all of the problems you mentioned is to continue to work to solve them in the way which will be most satisfactory to moral creatures.
