It is most certainly worth something, as long as the
participants exercise the necessary measures to detect and
correct any active attacks on it.  The primary reason that
the Web O Trust is ineffective at this point is the
prevalence of misunderstandings among users (including
cypherpunks) about its usage and its efficacy.


As an example of these prevalent misunderstandings, I submit
to you the fact that PGP keyservers do not use PGP, either
for encryption or authentication.  If you suggest it to them
(or indeed, to most cypherpunks) they will respond that it
would "do no good".  Ridiculous.


It's a shame really, since if we _did_ have the wits to
create a Web O Trust now, it would serve to prevent active
attacks in the future.


Hopefully the public key infrastructure people will come up
with something that will replace the WoT and will be more
understandable or acceptable to people.


In the meantime, I cannot have much confidence in the
security of my private communications with Black Unicorn,
which makes me hesitant to exchange money with him.


Unfortunate that cypherpunks are so ineffectual when it
comes to "social engineering" (not in the "social cracking"
sense).
