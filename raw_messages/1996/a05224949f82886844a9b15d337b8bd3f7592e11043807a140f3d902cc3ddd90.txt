I can see it now. Apartments full of geeks because the apartments
were originally built with 100BaseX to each place and a T3 in the
basement going direct to the local ISP.

Tack on another $200/month or whatever to the apartment cost ( geeks
can afford that for sure ) and one might end up having a pretty nice
online melrose place.

I wonder if anybody has done that yet...
