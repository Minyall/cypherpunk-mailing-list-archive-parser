The fact that you choose not to charge for your time does not make your
time worthless.  The value your voluntary efforts add should be assigned
due compensation even if you choose to waive it.

The failure to take such contributions into account is one of the most
serious flaws in all current economic paradigms.  I think this will become
more apparent in decades to come, as old concepts of `work' and `jobs'
obsolesce.
