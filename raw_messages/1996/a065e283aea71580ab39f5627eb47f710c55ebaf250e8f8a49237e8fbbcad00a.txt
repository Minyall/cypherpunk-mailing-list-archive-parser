"Cypher punks" don't write code. Hence Mark is not a "cypher punk".

That's the kind of software we need. How about a PGP aware client for
Windows 95 and NT that would talk to POP3 and SMTP servers? Sort of
like a drop-in replacement for the mail programs that come with Netscape
and MS IE. By the way, the mailtool that comes with SunOS is really
lame. Take a look at Z-mail (if it's still around - I understand the
company that used to market it got bought by some homos who totally
screwed it up).
