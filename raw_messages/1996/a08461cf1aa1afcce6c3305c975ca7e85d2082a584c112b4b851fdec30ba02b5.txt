Colin and I have been speaking to Phil.  That doesn't mean that I have
any idea what ViaCrypt is doing.  Perhaps Phil and ViaCrypt should
talk?  If there is a problem with ViaCrypt 4.0, it is between Phil and
ViaCrypt.

I have nothing to do with ViaCrypt.  I dont know anything about their
products.  I don't know what they have or plan to have in their 4.0
version.  I dont know what spec they are using.  I dont know what new
data structures they have created.
