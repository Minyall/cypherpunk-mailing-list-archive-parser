This is easy.  Just use end-to-end encryption.  No sweat.  (So what if
call setup takes a half a second to do a public key encryption?  The phone
rings for a couple of seconds before the other guy picks it up anyhow.)

Well, there's that nasty key distribution and management problem (e.g.
who certifies the millions of public keys corresponding to everyone's
phone number?), but that's not specific to voice traffic, and this is
a well-known annoying problem.


The *real* challenge: how do you support sender- and recipient- anonymous
phone calls with strong security?  Have fun.
