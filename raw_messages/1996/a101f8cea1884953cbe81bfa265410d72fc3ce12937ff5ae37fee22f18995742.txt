Well this isn't quite true because the cypherpunks are 
apparently allowed to change their votes based upon how their 
votes will effect other cyhpherpunks' votes.  So #3 can vote 
"No" on "#1 gets it all" proposals because he knows that #1 
_knows_ he will vote "No" on "#1 gets it all" proposals and thus
#1 will instead give #3 some money.
 
 
So if you are going to play it that way then you have to be sure
that none of your cypherpunks are allowed to think about the 
possibility that their own (probable) voting will affect their
companions' voting.
