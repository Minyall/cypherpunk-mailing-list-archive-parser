Varies with the micropayment system.  Some proposals are to use Digicash,
either online or offline.  Others are to use simpler systems, such as S/Key 
variants or piles of tokens - you'd use some heavyweight payment system like
a credit card / ATM / digicash to buy 100 or 1000 microtokens, which you'd
use for the actual payments, and which would require less computation to
authenticate.
