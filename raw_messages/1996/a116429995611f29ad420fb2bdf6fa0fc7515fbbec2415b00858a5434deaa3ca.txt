Excellent.  This is much-needed.  Please see
"http://www.c2.org/~bryce/WhatIsPGP.html", and consider
cross-linking with me.  I'd rather point people to your
novice guide than to Stale's International PGP pages.  


I wrote BAP for the same reason-- clueless newbies needed to
be able to use PGP.  My mother is able to successfully use
BAP, so I consider it a great success.  Unfortunately since
I am distributing it in return for electronic cash I have
limited myself to a higher-tech audience than the program
was actually intended for.  I'm still considering what to do
about this dilemma...
