I have a copy of the original German version of this, I can snail mail a copy
if anyone wants to translate it.  It has lots of graphs and diagrams which
probably won't scan very well, and it will need translation before most of the
people on the list can make any use of it.  I know there are English versions
floating around, but I've never seen one.

BTW the work was done in the early '80's, not 1990.
