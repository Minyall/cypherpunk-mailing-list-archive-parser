FAS offers the January 19, 1996 testimony before the 
President's Commission on the Future of Intelligence by Bobby 
Inman, Frank Carlucci and others including Richard Haass, 
principal author of the recent CoFR report (which is now also 
at the IRP site).

The Commission's report to the President is due this Friday.


For admiration of the deeply set spook-hooks in the US economy, 
take a look at the IRP humongous list of firms that happily 
fabricate products for $28 billion per year. Firms that 
generously pasture the ex-TLAs like Inman, Carlucci, Haass, et 
al, for their, uh, wisdom and expert testimony to insure a 
bountiful demand for fertilizer and fuel oil.
