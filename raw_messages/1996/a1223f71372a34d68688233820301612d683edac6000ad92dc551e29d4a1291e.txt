The FUDgine keeps rolling down the track...

Looks like Monitor Radio's promoting 56-bit encryption. Reporter's name is
Duncan Moon.

Quotes a guy quoting Blaze (not mentioning Matt). Calls 56 bit encryption
"puny in the future", but not now.

The article talks about hardware as giving keylength economic legs, with
some logic I can't quite fathom...

Cheers,
Bob
