I submit that this is what one would expect when one sends supposedly
confidential material out in the absence of binding NDAs.

IPG, why don't you simply post the source code to your system?  I know
I've suggested this before, but it bears repeating that any truly secure
cryptosystem depends _only_ on the secrecy of the key.  The algorithm
should be able to be published in the New York Times with no compromise
to the security of the system.  If this is not the case for your system,
than perhaps you should be considering alternative entrepreneurial
exploits.
