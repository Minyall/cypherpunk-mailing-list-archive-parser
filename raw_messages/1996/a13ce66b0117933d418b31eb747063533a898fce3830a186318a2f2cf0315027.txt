I suppose this part could be true.

Phil Zimmerman has been shown to be a person of remarkable personal
integrity and
since he was up on and beat charges of illegally exporting munitions, I
some how find a
lame threat of a frame up for narcotic trafficking as making him cave to
the "shadowy" government
wishes a bit hard to swallow.

Oh yeah, sorry, I forgot that the all powerful TC was behind it all, so of
course its true.

Somehow, I just don't see the FSF collaborating and caveing to threats.
Also please note that
all of this code under discussion has been and is constantly being reviewed
by some of these here fine folks
and thus far, ain't no one found this often rumored secret back door, but
then again, I am quite sure the TC is behind the coverup.
