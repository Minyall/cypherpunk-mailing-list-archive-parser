I'll be down through Tuesday morning looking up public records on my new
Neo-Nazi friends (and their opposition, some of which is also unseemly),
stuff like that. I'll be talking to Ingrid, Zundel's press secretary, on
Tuesday, I hope. I'd love to do lunch with someone who knows the local San
Diego/North County/Fallbrook ISP environment, especially a level-headed
libertarian type. I'll buy.
