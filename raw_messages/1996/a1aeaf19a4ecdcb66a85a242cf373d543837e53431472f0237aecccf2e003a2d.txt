By popular request, here is the address for the place that sells the "I
(picture of a heart) Explosives" bumper stickers as well as black powder in
20 pound economy packs. Black powder will be shipped via UPS. Coonie's is a
federally licensed explosives dealer, offering a wide variety of commercial
high explosives. However, such explosives will only be sold to
appropriately licensed individuals. They are very nice people, please don't
ask them stupid questions.
