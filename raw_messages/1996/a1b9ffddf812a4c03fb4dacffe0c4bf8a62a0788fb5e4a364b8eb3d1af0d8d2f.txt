Im running a mirror of the DoJ site on http://www.skeeve.net/doj/

It has had some 14000 hits or so since I put it up.. so I installed a stats
package to see where they were coming from...

low and behold!

looks like the DoJ have been looking around at the mirrors.. maybe to 
legally hassle people about them....

Well since Im not in the US.. good luck DoJ
