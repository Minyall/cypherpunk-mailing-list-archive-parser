Another Cypherpunks exclusive!

Bowing to US pressure, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has quietly made changes to Japanese crypto export regulations.

In the past, export of crypto products from Japan was unregulated. The exporter had to file a pro-forma export declaration with MITI. The new regulations, imposed in recent weeks without public announcement, require the exporter to state the ultimate recipient of the crypto product. MITI then conducts a lengthy approval process that can take many weeks.

It is widely assumed that the US used the thread of trade sanctions to bring about this 180 degree turn in the attitude of the Japanese government.

The new regulations apply to exports from Japan to all countries, including the US.
