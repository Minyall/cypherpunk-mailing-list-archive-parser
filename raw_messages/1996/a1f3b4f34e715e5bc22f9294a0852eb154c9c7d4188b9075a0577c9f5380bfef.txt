  Ah ha! Now I understand what this argument has been all about. This 
is not a flaw with PGP, but with the software doing the signing. It 
should/could add a line with a time and date stamp inside the 
signature envelope, or Bob could add more information, making the 
message more specific.

  I don't think PGP needs to be 'fixed', but the signing software 
does.
