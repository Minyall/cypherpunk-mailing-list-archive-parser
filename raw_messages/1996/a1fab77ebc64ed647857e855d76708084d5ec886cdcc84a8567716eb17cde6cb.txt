Tim has misstated my belief.  I do think that short- or long-term
bets fulfill a purpose, but it is not an epistemological one.
(Tim, are you thinking of Robin or Nick?)  The purpose it serves
is to make pontificators more cautious in the pontifications.  
It's easy to gas on about subjects in which you have no economic
stake; we all do that at times.  The possiblity of financial loss
or reward, however, encourages temperance.
