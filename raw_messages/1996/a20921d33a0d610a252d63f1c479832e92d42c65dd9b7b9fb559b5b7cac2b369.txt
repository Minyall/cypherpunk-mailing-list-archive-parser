I sent a letter to the Economist last year pointing this out after reading
an article containing the offhand statement, "... and of course it is
entirely feasible to control Internet content" (or something like that).
I don't have those magic two letters at the front of my name though.  It
seems so utterly obvious.  When you connect to an ISP via PPP or SLIP,
all the ISP is doing is routing packets.

Uhh...  what about the rather obvious problem that some of these new
fangled computers can support an enormous spread of information?  My
web site at io.com has no offensive materials (though I recently rated
it as basically "Satan's Headquarters" via SurfWatch), but other stuff
at io.com may well be offensive.  Packets routed out through io's
interface will of course all come from the same address.

Maybe they're suggesting that every disk block in the universe should have
its own IP address.  Hmm, maybe there's a use after all for those 24 byte 
OSI addresses...
