Odd... That came through on the mail/news gateway but the preceeding
article that explains what that was about didn't.... did anyone
receive it?

In case no, it's based on Clifford A. Pickover's paper "Random Number
Generators: Pretty Good Ones are Easy to Find" which doesn't deal with
useful RNGs for crypto sense, but the paper does explain ways to
visually represent RNGs so that seemingly good RNGs show their awful
correlations, etc.

My previous post that should have showed up mentioned that these
methods might be useful for checking out crypto functions (hashes,
pRNGs, ciphers).
