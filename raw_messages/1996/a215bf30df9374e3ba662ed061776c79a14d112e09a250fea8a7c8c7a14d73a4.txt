tcmay: You're coming perilously close to actually calling for 
the killing of a  federal judge. My recollection is that a 
couple of folks have been arrested  and charged for calling for 
the killing of judges.

Any half-wit falling for agent provocateur Bell's rap will do 
hard time, or maybe get popped "in self-defense" by his TLA 
watchers.


The son-of-a-bitch's baiting pigeon traps, no question. He's 
too myopic to see how he's luring falcons for attack by 
high-circling eagles. Bell's going down blind-sided with his 
gulls.
