Triple DES Encryption Now Available For Telephone Privacy Protection 


Santa Rosa, Calif., August 16, 1996, -- The Communication Security
Corporation today announced availability of the CS8191. The first
telephone security device built using uncompromised cryptography,
based on 168--bit key triple DES.
  
Triple DES encryption technology provides an uncompromised level of
security (72 quadrillion times stronger against a brute force attack)
than products based on the US Data Encryption Standard (single DES).
In addition, unlike the government's "Clipper" proposal, the CS8191
does not reveal or "escrow" the encryption keys with third parties.
 
The CS8191 has been designed to work with conventional analog
telephone systems (POTS).  The unit connects between your telephone
and the wall. In 'clear' mode, your telephone continues to work as it
normally does. Pressing the 'go secure' button encrypts
conversations. Communication Security has also incorporated a
leading-edge speech coder.  Voice clarity is undisturbed whether the
system is in 'secure' or 'clear' mode. 

With many of today's standard technologies, anyone can gain access to
our most private of conversations.  The Communication Security
Corporation dedicates their resources to addressing the increasing
need for private, secure voice communication devices. The introduction
of the CS8191 paves the way for research and development for
additional communication security devices for cell phones, modems, fax
machines and computers. For more information on the CS8191, please
contact the Communication Security Corporation, 1275 Fourth St. Suite
194, Santa Rosa, CA 95404, Tel: (707) 577-0409 Fax: (707) 577-0413,
