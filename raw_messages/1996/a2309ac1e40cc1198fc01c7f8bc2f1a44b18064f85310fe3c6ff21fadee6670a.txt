Hi,

I have set up a mailing list for PGP developers.  The main topic
of conversation will be issues directly related to developing PGP
tools and libraries, such as non-standard cipher feedback modes :-/

The list can be joined by sending

	  subscribe pgp-dev _your mail address_
	  
to majordomo@systemics.com.


Best regards,

Gary Howland
