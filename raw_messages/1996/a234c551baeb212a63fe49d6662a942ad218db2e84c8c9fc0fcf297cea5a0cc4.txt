Although your viewpoint is well expressed, I feel you've
overlooked the possibility of socialism to solve the high
tax outrages detailed.

Socialism, a truly progressive economic system, would have
an actual graduated income tax, to discourage useless
make-work by the rich.

There are so many other benefits to patriotic socialism, it
would take a book the size of Das Kapitol just to list them.

For instance:

Taxes on trade, will act as a tonic on the national economy.

The tax on trade, of course, prevents it; relieving the
national security apparatus of 90% of its reason for being.

The state itself as a unifying theme, rather than patho
meanderings like crime, anti-racism, and religion.

Tcmay, you've already acted on your socialistic urges without
even knowing it; your successfully operating a free people's
spontaneous propaganda bureau.  Please develop this further
and thumb your nose at the members of your class.
