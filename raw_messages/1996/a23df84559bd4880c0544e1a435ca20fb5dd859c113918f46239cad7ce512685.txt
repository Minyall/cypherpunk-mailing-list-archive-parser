I agree that in the absolute sense, this is true. However, it is not 
practical to do so in our modern society. If you are prepared to live 
without credit or health insurance you can do this but the price is too
high for most people to consider.                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	So you're prepared for everyone to pay more, but not for those who
want privacy to pay more? While I do support taxes to pay for a minimal amount
of welfare, I don't think that much intrusion into private property rights is
justified.
