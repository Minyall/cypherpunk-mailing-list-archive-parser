They've been working on this for awhile.  The problem is that the

the USPS maintain the certificates, but I have heard that it's been 
tossed back and forth between them and GSA and neither of them wants to 
do it.

IRT the actual crypto being used in the solution, they are using the 
Digitial Signature Standard (FIPS PUB 186) with message digests being 
created via the Secure Hash Algorithm (FIP PUB 180).  Unless you're using 
the FIPS stuff, you'd be hard pressed to get GAO or OMB to approve it.
