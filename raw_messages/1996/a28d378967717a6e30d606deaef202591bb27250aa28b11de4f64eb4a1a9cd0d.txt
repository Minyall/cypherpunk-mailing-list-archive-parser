The RSA/SDTI merger may be the only chance we ever get to see RSA's
financial info.  Previously it was a privately held company, which
didn't report its finances publicly; now it'll be reported as part of
SDI (a much bigger company), so its finances will be hidden in
their larger business.

You can also see what RSA and SDTI are saying about the
RSA/Cylink/Schlafly lawsuits, the origins of VeriSign, how
Addison Fisher bankrolled RSA and owned 55% of it, etc.

Look on the SEC's EDGAR system, which contains copies of reports that
the government requires publicly traded companies to file.  Go to
http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/srch-edgar?security+dynamics+technologies
and view the various forms.  The most fun is probably the big one,
the 1.5MB S-4 form from the merger itself.

These documents will require a tolerance for legalese, but there are lots
of gems in there for the patient.
