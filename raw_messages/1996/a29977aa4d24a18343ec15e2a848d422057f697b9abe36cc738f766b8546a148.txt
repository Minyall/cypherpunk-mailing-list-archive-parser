They're quite correct - it's a problem of values and goals,
and theirs differ from mine.  IF law enforcement is to be effective
(at those things it's effective at, like self-preservation and
politician-electing), then it WILL need this increase in power.
Because otherwise we WILL move to crypto-anarchy.  I hope we will
anyway, and perhaps the tackiness of the Clipper forces will 
encourage the general public to get there faster rather than slower.

BTW, the reason Swiss banking laws were so strong for so many years
was because the Nazis were pressuring bankers to give out information
on their Jewish customers...
