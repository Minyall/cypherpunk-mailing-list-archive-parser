A case in point: A small company which manufactures premium, hand-rolled,
cigars received a bill from the ATF for an unpaid tax and penalties.  The
notice indicated that the particular tax was over 5 years delinquint.  When
asked where in the over 500 pages of ATF regulations this tax was
documented the investigator said he didn't know and indeed didn't find it
after weeks of trying.  Finally and expert in D.C. found the obscure
reference.  The company wanted to know why they were being billed for this
tax after almost a decade of operation.  They were told that althought the
tax has been on the books the ATF had only recently programmed its
computers to access the tax.  Nevertheless, the tax and penalties were
owed, billed or not.
