Whether providing mail service is a criminal offence due to the possibility
to gain access to `inciting material.' 

Whether providing phone service is a criminal offence due to the possibility
to gain access to `inciting material.' 

Whether selling radios is a criminal offence due to the possibility to gain
access to `inciting material.' 

Whether selling satellite dishes is a criminal offence due to the
possibility to gain access to `inciting material.' 

Whether teaching reading is a criminal offence due to the possibility to
gain access to `inciting material.'

requests something like a web page is the "actor" in this drama not the
carrier.  The carrier is not doing anything.  The requestor is controlling
the system momentarily.
