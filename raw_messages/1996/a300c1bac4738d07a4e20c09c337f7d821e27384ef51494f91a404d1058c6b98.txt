EDS is "Electronic Data Systems", the company Ross & a buddy started
back in the late 60's/early 70's.  That's where Ross made his money.

EDS is a place that when Ross was in charge (and maybe still today)
was a lot like what Grumman sounds like in terms of employee
security issues.  Armed guards patrolled the computer rooms when I
was working there (1979).
