I'm more concerned about the other side of the coin.

The next time there's street riots because a jury decided to think for 
itself, will the ACLU be issuing quota guidelines that mandate that all 
black arrestees above (percentage-of-population) be given a 
"get-out-of-jail-free-for-pulling-a-bystanding-trucker-out-of-his-cab-and 
slamming-his-head-with-bricks" card?
