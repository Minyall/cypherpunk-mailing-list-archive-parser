Righ. But in addition to the forcible acquisition of information, there's
the unwitting acquisition - you are never informed that party A has
transmitted information X to party B, who in turn passed it to C, who
garbled it and then passed the erroneous info to D....

I'm a raving anarcho-capitalist, and I see not the slightest ethical problem
in requiring people to tell me what information they're gathering on me. At
that point I can make an informed decision to deal or not deal with them -
and that's a complex decision. I might well prefer to do business with, say,
Tim's House O' Stuff even though it's collecting more info than I'd prefer,
if there are compensatory factors. But I can't weigh my options in a void.
