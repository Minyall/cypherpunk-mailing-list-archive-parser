Doesn't this statement represent something of a bias in favor of today's 
system?  Is the "total death and destruction chaos" a function of the 
collapse of that strong government, or the immediate tendency of it to be 
replaced with dictator wannabes?

In other words, if a "strong government" could be brought down with a 
guarantee that nobody would be able to even begin to replace it, might that 
not be an entirely different matter?

Doesn't this statement contradict the previous statement you made?  If 
there's "chaos" perhaps that's merely because a small group of people is 
trying to take control.  Most people want peace, but it can be disturbed by 
a minority.
