Many languages are machine independent. Thats hardly a new feature.

Scheme, anyone?

However, your point is taken. Java is a neat little language in many
ways. However, that isn't cause enough for literally fifty books on
the subject to be on display, including breathless ones proclaiming
"Tips from experienced Java programmers!" as if there are any in the
world at this point. There are dozens of cute little languages in the
world -- scheme, smalltalk, etc, etc.

I mean, with all the "Teach yourself Java in 21 days" and company
books coming out, you would think you were dealing witht he major
application programming language for the world instead of something
that at the moment is used for almost nothing more interesting than
fake scrolling LED sign applets.

Since that doesn't exist, it isn't an option for my users. It is not,
in any case, my obligation to make Java secure. I'm not the one hyping
it.

Useless, almost, for a web environment.

If you want to really put Crypto in netscape, the plugin facilities
and a good C compiler are a better tool, and C is 99% portable.

You could hand any websurfer a Netscape PGP plugin without much work
at all, and you could easily build it on lots of platforms. After all,
look at how many platforms that lowly C code like PGP runs on.
