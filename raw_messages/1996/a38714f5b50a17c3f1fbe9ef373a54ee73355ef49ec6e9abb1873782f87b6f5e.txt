URLs are nice, but I'm not quite sure they are sufficient in practice,
though they are certainly theoretically sufficient. If I get a
document from someone, and it is signed, I'd like to be able to get
the key associated with the signature, and the URL is in theory enough
to do that. However, going in the opposite direction -- retrieving a
key associated with, say, a remote host's TELNET server, I'd like to
be able to query a server ask much more flexible questions than an FTP
URL would let me ask -- I might have a prefered public key system (RSA
versus DSS or what have you), I might want to be able to distinguish
between versions of the key, I might want to ask for all keys of a
certain class, etc.

In the end, we are probably going to need something in the way of key
servers, which may (or may not) imply either a new type of URL or
something other than a URL to do retrieval off of.
