A few brief comments if I may:

To Mormons:
First, Mormonism has nothing to do with cryptography & therefore, has
 no place on this list.  
Second, CP is not what I would consider to be an appropriate atmosphere
 for proselytizing.  

To Non-Mormons:
First, Mormonism (or any other religion for that matter) has nothing to
 do with cryptography & hence has no place on this list.  Let's stick to 
 the subject, please.

Last, but not least, I think this list has some great material and offers
tremendous food for thought.  However, I for one would get a lot more out 
of this list if the Signal to Noise ratio were a little better.  Personally,
I find that the petty personal attacks and profanity detract from the subject 
at hand and tend to reduce the author's credibility.  

Food for thought.

Peace.

Best Regards,


Frank
