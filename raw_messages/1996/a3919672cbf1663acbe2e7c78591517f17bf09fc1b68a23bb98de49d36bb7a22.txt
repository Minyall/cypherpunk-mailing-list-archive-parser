Ahhh... But you truly miss the buety of this system.

Once in place all the goverment needs to do is ban all e-mail not sent through their system. Add this to the outlawing of all non-keyescrowed encryption, and the ability to archive all messages sent through their system. Now the goverment would have total access to everything you wright.

Eventually they could get rid of all snail-mail. Put in place scaners with OCR, handwrighting reconition & voice dictation in local post offices for those without Inet access.

The even BIGGER PICTURE:

Eventually we will not have dial-up internet access the way it is today. Mater of fact we will not have phone systems the way we have today. Instead we will have 1 huge network, a SuperIneternet, inwhich all homes & business are connected. For those without computers in their homes will be small dumb terminals that will let them connect & provide basic services (such devices are being developed right now).

In such a system anyone could be monitored, at any time.

Sound far fetched? The technology is here now to do this. Just remember that the "powers to be" don't think in terms of months or years but decades. It may take 20-30yrs for such a system to be fully implimented. "They" are very patient.

1984? no, 2084 without a doubt!
