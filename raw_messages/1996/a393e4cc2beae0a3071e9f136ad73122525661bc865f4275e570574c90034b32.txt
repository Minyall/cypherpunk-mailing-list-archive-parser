You are committing a logical fallacy with the above. You're saying that 
the mugger who commits the crime with a stolen gun is equivalent to my 
own hired hitmen (the local and federal police I pay so dearly for).

This is obviously not the case.  I didn't hire the mugger, nor did I 
encourage the thief in an overt way.  But I did consciously select and 
pay for the police and govt. assassins.  And so did you.  Unless you're 
saying that the govt. forcibly takes you down to the voting booth, etc.
