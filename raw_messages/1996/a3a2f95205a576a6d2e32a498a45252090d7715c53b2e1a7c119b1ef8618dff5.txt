Would anyone be interested in collaborating on a "Know Your Net Enemies"
project?

We'd start with a resource like Bob Chatelle's excellent web pages at
<http://world.std.com/~kip/bcfenatl.html> and with permission build on
it and list the deceptions and misrepresentations each Net-Enemy has
engaged in -- what each has done to restrict liberty online. We'd
include original documents and links as appropriate.

Who would be listed? Well, there's the family values groups
[AFA/CC/NLC/EE!/FOF/FRC], the green card spammers, Carnegie Mellon
University, Marty Rimm, the Church of Scientology, the Simon Wiesenthal
Center, the NSA, German state prosecutors, Senator Exon, Dorothy
Denning, and so on.

If each collaborator takes a particular group or person, this could be
done relatively quickly. Then we'd put it online at EFF's web site, with
prominent treatment. All contributors would receive full credit for
their work, of course.

Anyone interested? This would be a great resource.
