You dumbass.

This is not "CENSORSHIP"...whatever you had in mind, no such mailing list
is copied in your "To:" or "cc:" field.

Secondly, "unsubscribe" is not spelled "UNSUBCRIBE."

Thirdly, send your unsubscribe commands to the appropriate place for the
list involved, not to the list itself.

Sheldon Andrews is hereby added to the "Don't Hire" list. Hope you weren't
planning to apply for work out here.
