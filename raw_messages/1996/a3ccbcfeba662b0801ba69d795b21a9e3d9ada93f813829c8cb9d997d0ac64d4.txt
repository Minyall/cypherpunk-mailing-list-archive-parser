TRS stands for "Technical Report Series." These are put out
periodically by the computer science departments of major
universities.  TRS-80 is a monograph titled - "The Sternlight
Effect: The Application of Nonlinear Matched Filters to the
Reduction of Additive Gaussian Noise in Usenet Articles."

DES stands for "Diethylstilbestrol", a synthetic estrogen given
to women at high risk for miscarriage in the 1950's.  Its use was
discontinued when the daughters of those who took it were
discovered to have a high incidence of vaginal and cervical
adenocarcinomas.  Male offspring suffered no life-threatening
health problems from prenatal DES exposure, but were often
afflicted with TWS. (Teeny Weeny Syndrome)

And finally, GAK is the name for the green slime frequently seen
to cover people on Nickelodeon, the childrens' cable channel.  It
is prepared from a variety of non-toxic ingredients in the
Nickelodeon kitchens, and supposedly is safe to ingest, should
one feel motivated to do so.

Now that you know the secret Three Letter Abbreviations, you are
an official Cypherpunk.  Congratulations.
