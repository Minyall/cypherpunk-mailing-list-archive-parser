Well, not really. Silvio Micali did some work on this topic. We also
get the lovely folks from the FBI making their public appeals (replete
with references to snuff films and other nonexistant threats), and Stu
Baker, former NSA official, does his periodic "insult the nerds"
schtick. There are others. The point is taken, though.
