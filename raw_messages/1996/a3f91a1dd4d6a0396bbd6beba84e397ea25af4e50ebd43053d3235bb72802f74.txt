*** Euro-Commission to tackle porn on Internet

The European Commission, faced with calls to clamp down on Internet
pornography following a Belgian pedophilia scandal, will take a first
step in October toward seeing how it can be done. On Oct. 9, Culture
Commissioner Marcelino Oreja plans to unveil a paper outlining how to
identify authors of Internet pornography and how to interrupt that
pornography. Oreja said options raised in the paper include encrypting
access so that only those who pay could see the material or including
a V-chip to screen against pornographic content. For the full text
