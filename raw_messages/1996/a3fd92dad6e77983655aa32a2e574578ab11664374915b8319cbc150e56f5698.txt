The Pouch uses a 64 x 64 block product cipher, a 1024 bit random initialization
vector and the CBC technique.  Most experts agree that such an implementation is highly resistant to all forms of cryptographic attack.
Hellman and Dilfie rely on knowing the algorithm for their known plain text attacks
An unpublished algorithm forces them into reverse engineering the computer
programs to learn the algorithm. The POUCH has many roadblocks built in
to prevent this.
I refer to Cummings, Cryptography and Data Security pages 150 and 98 in this regard.
