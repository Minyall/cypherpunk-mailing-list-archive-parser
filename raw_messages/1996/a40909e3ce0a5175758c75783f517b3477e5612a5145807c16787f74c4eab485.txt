As I pointed out in a private note to Perry, it's not the high-speed
routers that have to change the packets.  They typically are between
the sort of ISPs that would get "network common carrier" status, and
could rely on the options added (or not) by the other side.  It's only
when the packet crosses the border from outside the "common carrier"
net to inside that the header needs changed, and that's usually at a
terminal server, not a "very high speed router".
