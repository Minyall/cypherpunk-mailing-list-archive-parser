Yep, I've been getting 'em. There's one in my inbox right now. :(

I dunno.... Maybe it's some weird mail system at dca.com... Looking at the
full header of the "not deliverable" message I got, it looks like
smtphost.dca.com is using SMTPLINK V2.11 PreRelease 4. I've never heard of
that program, but I would guess (stab in the dark) that that PreRelease
version sees the To:cypherpunks@toad.com and can't find any user named
"cypherpunks" on their system, and so it bounces. That's just a stab in
the dark, though... I don't know anything about that mailer beyond the
fact that it's bouncing these messages around.
