     If it is vital to have bulletproof security, then they will:
      1) learn Cryptography and C well enough to read the code themselves.
      2) hire an expert to do 1). 
      3) Do the research and purchase a commercial package that has 
         guarentees and recommendations.

     If you believe that _anything_ is absolutely secure, you get what you 
diserve. It would seem far far cheaper to simply insert a couple extra chips
in the form of a tap in your keyboard to trap all of your keystrokes & forward
them via radio signals, or to rubber hose you. 

     PGP has been looked over by lots of people, so I trust it not to have 
any deliberate holes. As to bugs, or accidental errors, well, it is "freeware,
you get what you pay for. Sometimes you get more, and I am not denegrating 
PGP, but if you don't pay for it you shouldn't even expect it to keep working,
much less be bug free. This comes from someone whose main computer rarely 
runs commercial software (hey, free games just aren't as cool as the commercial
ones).
