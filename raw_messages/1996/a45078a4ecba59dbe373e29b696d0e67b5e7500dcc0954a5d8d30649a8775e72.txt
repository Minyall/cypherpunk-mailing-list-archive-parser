BZZZZT.  Point A well taken.  Point B fails, unfortunately.  Brought to 
my attention not so long ago by a post something along the lines of
"I'll take it for granted that Timmy May is a wanker, but what about
the crypto stuff on this list."  You can't disregard that there is a 
constant rotation of subscribers to this list.

{C. So with A & B true when Dimitri makes his nutty statements they are taken 
{by the list as just that, nutty statements. 

You're correct, so long as it's someone that's been on the list for 
long enough to realize that DV appears to have a problem distinguishing
real information from his fantasies.


By the by, I'd be happy to spend a few bucks to defray those legal
expenses, if it actually comes to that.  Either that, or I'll be 
happy to supply the rolled-up newspaper to whack him upon the nose.
