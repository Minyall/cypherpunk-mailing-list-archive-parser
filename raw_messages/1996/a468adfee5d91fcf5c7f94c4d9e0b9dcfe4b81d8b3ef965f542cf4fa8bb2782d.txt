I suspect that if US company A sent its Swiss subsidiary B a sent
of standards and said "write this", your interpretation would be correct.
It's how I read ITAR also.

However, company A can publish standards.  Published standards
aren't covered under ITAR.  Non-US company C can read standards
and implement code to those standards.  I was going to back this up
by citing the appropriate part of the regs, but they're so vague
as to be almost useless.  However in real life this seems to
pass- i.e. Netscape's publishing of the SSL spec and Eric Young's
use of that spec to make an independent interoperable implementation.
