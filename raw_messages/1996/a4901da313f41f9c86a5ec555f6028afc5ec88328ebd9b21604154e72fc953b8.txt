Maybe I shouldn't have tried to (slightly) change the subject.  It was 
my thought that someone could encourage the person(s) who wanted to do a 
Snake-Oil product list to generalize the list, to be a more scholarly 
reference, and not just a blacklist.  Since the original(?) proposal 
concerned actual products, and not just techniques which fit into neatly 
identifiable categories, that might justify a Consumer Reports type of 
review list for these products.
