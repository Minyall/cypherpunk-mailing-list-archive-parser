I am glad to hear that the bill can be easily stopped.  I think we should 
do something to kill it right away.

The only good thing the bill does is give big companies the same power 
that most of us now possess -- the power to export crypto and get away
with it.   A good thing, a very good thing, but small change compared to 
the important individual liberties that the bill lightly discards.
