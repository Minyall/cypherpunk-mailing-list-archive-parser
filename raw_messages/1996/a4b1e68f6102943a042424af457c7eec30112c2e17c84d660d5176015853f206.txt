One other small advantage I can see to using Lotus's crippled encryption. 
It disguises the fact that a message is actually (double) encrypted with
PGP.  Attackers have to break the 40 bits before they see the PGP encrypted
data.  A pecular kind of steganography.  (If you leave off the PGP header
and trailer, it may be hard to determine which 40 bits are the correct
key.)
