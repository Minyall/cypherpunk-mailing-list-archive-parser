Gains on currency 'speculation' (which this example is, even in the 
absence of intent to profit) are most certainly included in income for 
the purposes of U.S. tax.  Moreover, they are not capital gains income in 
the case of short term transactions like this.  As a result, instead of the 
lower rate on capital gains, they will be taxed at normal graduated rates.

In addition, to prevent funds from being removed to non-resident aliens 
or foreign entities where tax enforcement and collection is difficult, 
there is a 30% withholding requirement in the event the payee is not a 
U.S. citizen or resident (for tax purposes).  Note that this requirement 
is imposed on the paying entity regardless of the disposition of the 
funds.  That would mean that if the e-cash bank were to pay profits to a 
foreign payee without withholding, the IRS would hold the bank itself 
liable and let the bank deal itself with collecting the tax from the 
account holder on its own time and after paying the IRS.
