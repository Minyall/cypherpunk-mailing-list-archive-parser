	What's the point here, or is Unicorn just having fun
lambasting Jim Bell?

	My basic attitude, running an internet privacy provider, is if
Mr. Govt. wants my data, and gives me a court order (subpoena,
"compelled discovery", whatever), then I'll give it to 'em.
	If my customers that they were looking for had any brains at
all, a court order, compelled discover, whatever, will not help
Mr. Govt. That's the cornerstone of my security model.

	Or am I confused about what you are talking about here.
