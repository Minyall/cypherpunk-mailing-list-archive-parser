It's a sad fact that many unscrupulous(sp?) writers of WWW pages use 
non-visilble "on load" HTML to record what the web browser thinks the 
email address of the person browsing the page, and, I presume sell this 
info to the junk email producers.

Part of the WhoWhere archives could have come from such sources. (personally 
my address in netscape is stop.stealing@addresses.you.CENSORED)

If one really set ones mind to it, I guess that grepping through mailing 
list archives for addresses, and using a webcrawler to search for MAILTO=
would lead to many thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of addresses.

On the plus side, the search engine will not let "*","\*","?*" and so be 
used, and there are no real matches for "root", apart from stuff like 
"Bob Root" etc.
