I don't know if this has been covered before...

Why not incorporate an approved senders list function in mail readers? 
(Or at least
accomodate a plug-in?)

Have the mail reader keep a history of all addresses ever mailed to. 
These will automatically be approved, unless you later delete them from
the list.

If you are on a listserv of whatever nature and you want to receive mail
from list readers off the list, have the mail reader update the approved
list by querying (when?) the addresses of those on the list.

If you post to a usenet group, and you want off-group mail from the
group's readers, have the mail reader grab a list of addresses of people
who have posted on that newsgroup.

Continue to use a kill file to kill the spammers from listserv and
usenet address sources.

These are just general suggestions which could hooked up as options by
mailing list, newsgroup, etc.

What do you think?
