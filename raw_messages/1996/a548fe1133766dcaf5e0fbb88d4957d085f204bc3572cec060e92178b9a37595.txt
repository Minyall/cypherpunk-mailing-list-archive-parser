I would agree with you, except I started International Caving.  When in
Hungery, I heard, "Peter will guide you thru the rest of the cave.  Don't
worry, he speaks good German."  Fortunatly, my German was good enough.

While in China as a normal tourist, a travel agency in Yichang tried to
extort $600 from our group.  My wife's (very poor) knowledge of Manderin
probably scared the preps enough to get them to lay off.

BTW - There are also French speakers on the US border.  They don't want to
speak english either.
