Or one can use the technique my father accidentally discovered when he
was  in school and wanted to electrolyze water.  He made himself a
cell out of a broken light bulb (and wired it in series with a good
light bulb) and then realized that he did not have any sulphuric acid
lying around to use as a catalyst.  So he used table salt instead.
