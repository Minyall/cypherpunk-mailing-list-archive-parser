The big latent assumption here being that you have only one-way
communication with the subscribers. DSS has a modem. It could get a new
key from a distribution center frequently - i.e. every day. Then the
pirates would somehow have to update their keys daily, in real time.
Once we have live packet communication (cable modems or ISDN D-channel,
for example) the keys can be changed minute by minute, if necessary.
Each new-key request is checked with a digital signature from the box's
key, and the KDC will not accept two requests for the same key. If you
clone the box, one or the other won't get a key. The pirates will have
to run their own network parallel to the legitimate one to distribute
the keys. Therefore piracy requires an ongoing organization, and is
subject to being tracked down.
