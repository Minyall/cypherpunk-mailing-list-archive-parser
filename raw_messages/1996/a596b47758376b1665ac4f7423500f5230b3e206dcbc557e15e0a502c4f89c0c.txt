Because Java is a general-purpose programming language, it is indeed
possible to use Java to do keyboard sniffing, just like it's possible
to use it for an adventure game, or system management software, or
anything else you can imagine a general-purpose programming language
being used for.

The real question is, "can I use a Java applet in the context of a
particular Java virtual machine implementation (like, maybe, the
Netscape Navigator web browser) to do keyboard sniffing?".

The Java interpreter is only as secure as the wrapper implementation
wants it to be.  For lots of purposes, you don't need or want any more
security for a Java program than you would for a C++ program.
