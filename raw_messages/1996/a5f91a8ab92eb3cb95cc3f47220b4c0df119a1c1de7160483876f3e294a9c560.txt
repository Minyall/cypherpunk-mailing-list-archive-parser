IDEA is reputed to be resistant against known plaintext attacks.
But I did not read about wether or not it is resistant to 
several-plaintexts (?choosen plaintext) attack.

If the sectors were not salted, each zeroed sectors would translate in 
an identical way on the encrypted disk.  So, there would be only one 
cyphertext-plaintext pair repeated over many empty sectors.

If you salt the encryptor, there are many different cyphertexts 
corresponding to one single plaintext.

Can the salt be figured out by an attacker?

If yes, would the many-cyphertext to single-ultimate-plaintext could give an 
edge to an attacker?

In that case, it would be effectively better to not wipe a drive with 
zeroes.

The problem is, realdeal cannot be turned selectively for only one 
drive while not wiping the other one.

Thanks for your reply.
