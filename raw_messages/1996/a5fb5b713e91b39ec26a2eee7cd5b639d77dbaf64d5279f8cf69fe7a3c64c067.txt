COMPLETELY ANONYMOUS POSTING & E-MAIL
Send and receive E-Mail and Post to newsgroups with TOTAL anonymity  

As you must know the government is getting ready to crack down on freedom
of speech on the internet.  Already people are being fined and imprisoned.
Your service providers are being asked to turn over records and they are
cooperating.  Even if they don't want to cooperate the can be forced by
the courts to release records to the authorities.
Our New Service let's you send and receive E-Mail and post to newsgroups
with no fear of your messages ever being traced to you.  Not even a
Federal Court Order will result in your identity being revealed.  Finally
total safety for your most confidential or controversial electronic
messages.

ShhhNET Will begin operating in late June and you can be a part of the
only truly secure way to send and receive E-Mail or post to UseNet
Newsgroups.  For a limited time ShhhNet will be offered for only $50.00
per Year.  If you are interested, Please send E-Mail to ShhhNet@AOL.Com 
We will respond with information about how our service works and how you
can be totally secure in your Internet transactions.
