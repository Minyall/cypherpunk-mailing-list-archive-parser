I'm glad to see that somebody's addressing this issue.  It seems to me that 
if all the people on a given suburban block want some sort of low-cost, 
alternative method to access networks, they should be able to install some 
sort of centralized switchbox and run the cabling themselves down their back 
fence.  Where is industry on this sort of thing?  Why can't we buy such a 
thing?
