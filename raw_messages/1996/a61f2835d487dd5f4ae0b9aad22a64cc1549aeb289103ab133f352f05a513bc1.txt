>Here's another idea (don't laugh): to set up a system where mailing
lists and newsgroups have public keys that you can encrypt directly to.
Advantage for anonymous mail is that if a remailer is untrustowrthy,
there's still some security in the final remailing of the document.
------------------
	The newsgroups part of the idea has the problem that you've got to have
either a centralized place from which the newsgroup is run that has the private
key (a problem for controversial newsgroups, which are precisely the ones to
which people will tend to use remailers to post to), or lots of places having
the private key (an obvious problem from the cryptographic standpoint).
