The only way I know to solve this problem is to get a real operating system.
This excludes the Mac, DOS and its descendents.
First the kernel must be designed to prevent programs from installing
themselves wherever they wish. (Gasp, even useful prrograms!) Second
they must not be encumbered with piles of tools written by people with
no sense of security. Such tools are often installed with more authority
than they should require. There is a Unix system call that displays the
most recent command that any user has typed. This call is used by the
ps command to describe the origin of a task.

Perhaps NT is new enough that it hasn't gathered all of these holes.
I don't use NT so I wouldn't know.
