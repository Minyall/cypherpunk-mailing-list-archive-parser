Yeah, right.  You clearly chose not to address the requirements of
international company networks in your argument.  You admit that such
companies have international networks, and that you knew it.  It was
obviously relevant and you could have and should have addressed it.
The fact that you chose not to speaks to your own lack of integrity.
To gain the upper hand in the argument is clearly your supreme objective;
any point that doesn't fit the argument is simply not addressed.

In the last round, you mentioned financial networks.  You conveniently
left those out here.  I argue that these as well as others require
encryption.  Again, the fact that you fail to exclude any "inconvenient"
scenarios in whatever happens to be the matter under discussion destroys
your credibility (well, it would have, if you had any amongst the members
of this list).

On the contrary, you are the one who responds to each objection by 
pointing out that there is at least one situation where the current
regulations do not completely rule out solutions.  As one who has dealt
with security problems in the trenches, I have been involved in numerous
attempts to tiptoe through the mine-field of crypto regulations in search
of solutions.  I would prefer not to have to do so as it's a huge waste
of my time, and my (and everyone else's) money and other resources.

Ouch, David, stop it.  Once again, I'm skewered by your rapier wit.

I have.  News flash for David: not everyone agrees on the meaning of
various clauses in the Constitution.  Believe it or not, reasonable
people hold opinions that differ from the gospel-according-to-Sternlight.
The constitution means whatever the Supreme Court says it means and
that changes from time to time even though the constitution generally
does not.

Unfortunately, you seem to believe them most of the time, and want us
to believe them too in this case, while I choose to believe them rarely
if ever.


As this debate has now deteriorated to the "Sternlight claims
defamation, demands apology" point, and the substantive content is
quickly approaching zero, I'll try to make this my last post.  (List
breathes collective sigh of relief.)
