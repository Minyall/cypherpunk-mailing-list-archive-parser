	Thanks. =) 

	I personally think that Joey's Winsock-style remailers are the
way to go. It offloads the remailing work from the mail server, so
that anyone with a PC can have direct contorl over the remailer's most
intensive resources without making their ISPs mail server overloaded
or settingup a fulltime net site.
