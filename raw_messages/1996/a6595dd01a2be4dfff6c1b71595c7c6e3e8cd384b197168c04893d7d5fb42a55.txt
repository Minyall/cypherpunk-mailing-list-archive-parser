   "How to crack secret computer codes."

      Bellcore researchers plan to publish on the Internet
      this week technical details of a new method of cracking
      encryption systems used to protect computer data. The
      approach relies on spotting errors made by computers and
      applying a mathematical equation to work out secret
      encryption codes. "This is very sophisticated math. The
      only people who will understand it are other
      cryptography experts."
