Yes, I'm afraid these ahistorical myths are widespread. What _do_ they teach
in these schools?

Pick up anything by Renzo De Felice to gain a basic historical understanding
of what fascism was about, from someone who was sympathetic to them. 

I'd also recommend a biography of the very influential and gifted American
modernist poet Ezra Pound, who led the Italian fascist propaganda effort
from 1941 to 1943 and spent six months in an American POW camp, followed by
some time in mental hospitals as his rants against jewish conspiracies under
every bed became increasingly incoherent, for his trouble. Like Orwell's
very complicated views towards socialism and Stalinism (see Homage to
Catalonia), e. e. cummings' anti-government pacifism, Whitman's queerness,
and Byron's essential kookiness, this is something your high school english
teacher probably failed to mention.
