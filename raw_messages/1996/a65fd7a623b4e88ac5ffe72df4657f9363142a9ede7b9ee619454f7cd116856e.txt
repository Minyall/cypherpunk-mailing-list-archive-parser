He *had* some FI, in Central and South America, during the war.  During
the war he worked assiduously to undermine Wild Bill Donovan and the OSS
and succeeded in having that organization eliminated in September 1945.  

Upon doing so he immediately presented a plan to Attorney General Tom 
Clark for expanding the FBI's South American intelligence network
worldwide.  The spook community counterattacked and persuaded Harry
Truman to reign the FBI back, eliminating its foreign activities
entirely and clearing the path for the creation of the CIG (later CIA)
in 1946.  Hoover's only victory in this debacle was his preventing
his arch-rival Donovan from heading the new agency.
