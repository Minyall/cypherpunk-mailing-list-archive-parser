I actually think its probably okay even for systems that might come
under professional attack -- I don't recommend it for use on systems
that are mission critical, though, like systems running transactions
and such. Indeed, I don't recommend running ANYTHING on such systems
unless you are really, really, really careful about what you are
running and where you are running it from.
