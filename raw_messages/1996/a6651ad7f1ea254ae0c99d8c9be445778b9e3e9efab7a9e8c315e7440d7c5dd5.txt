Yes, you can perhaps show whom it was stolen _from_, i.e., the creator, but
not _who_ stole it.

Even in the case where each end recipient receives a uniquely watermarked
or marked image, e.g., where N different instances of the work are
instantiated, there are ways to obscure the source of the theft (or leak,
when one is using such techniques to detect leaks of confidential
information, a la the famous "canary traps"). To whit, M recipients of the
work can compare their copies and remove or modify the bits which don't
match up. This then yields only a "collusion set" the original creator can
narrow things down to. Enough to cast doubt on the M recipients, but
probably not enough to "probabalistically convict" them of a crime, unless
the crime is "conspiracy."

An interesting question. As Nelson notes, not something with easy technical
solutions.
