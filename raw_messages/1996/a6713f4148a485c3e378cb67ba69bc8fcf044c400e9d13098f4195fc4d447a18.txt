I have been using some shareware that simply has a built-in counter.  Once
the counter runs out, you have to register.  I would suppose that one could
hack the code to find the counter, assuming you could decompile it (or
wanted to).

Personally I think this is a decent solution to the problem -- the counter
on this particular software let you use it 50 times.  That's adequate to
determine whether you want to keep it or not.

Of course, if you saved the .zip file to disk before you installed it, you
could delete the copy and reinstall the .zip.  But everyone knows this.
