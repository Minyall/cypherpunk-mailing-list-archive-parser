How much of a bonus do you think he got for exposing the flaw in the
clipper chip?

Is there anything wrong with being a homosexual Jew?  Can you
elaborate?

Exactly what pisses you off?

The message Blase posted implies that there are serious problems with
making "tamperproof" devices.  This sounds like good news to me, as it
makes it significantly harder for the government to realy on the
secrecy of encryption keys for "LEAF" packets.

If you think there is something incorrect or dishonest about the
announcement Blaze forwarded, I'd like to hear about it.  However, I'm
trying to follow your logic but can't figure it out.  You claim:

  1.  Blaze stole the work of others.

How can this be since he clearly attributed the message to
Biham/Shamir

  2.  He's twisted the work to fit his corporate needs.

How does discrediting tamper-proof hardware fit the needs of AT&T?

  3.  Blaze is about to endorse the clipper chip in his next message.

Why would Blaze endorse a system he has already shown is flawed?
Anyway, since he hasn't endorsed the clipper chip yet, why can't we
wait and see what he does before attacking him?
