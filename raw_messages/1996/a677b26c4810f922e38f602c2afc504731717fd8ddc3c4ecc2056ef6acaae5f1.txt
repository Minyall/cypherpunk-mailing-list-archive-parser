>EU TAKES A CLOSER LOOK AT THE INTERNET
>European Union culture and telecommunications ministers met last week to
>discuss ways of controlling access to the Internet to prevent criminal
>activity and protect children.  "Many member states perceive the need now
>for some discipline, some kind of regulatory framework or code of ethics,"
>says the Italian telecommunications minister.  Some European governments,
>such as Germany and Great Britain, have already adopted Internet-related
>laws and others are considering it.  (Wall Street Journal 3 May 96 B5B)

	We've heard a lot on the German one. What's the Great Britain one look
like?

>CANADIAN SATELLITES TARGETED
>The race into space with direct broadcast satellite TV has created a
>regulatory black hole that the U.S. government is struggling to fill.  A
>plan by Telesat Canada to finance its $1.6-billion satellite program by
>leasing capacity to American broadcasters has prompted the Federal
>Communications Commission to hold special hearings in Washington to
>investigate whether it can regulate the use of Canadian satellites.
>(Toronto Financial Post 4 May 96 p1)

	Of course they're going to try to control it.
