	Given the numbers of times that a democracy has done more harm than
good to civil liberties (Prohibition, the election of Islamic Fundamentalists
in Algeria, etcetera), we don't _want_ a "populist"/demagogue president. We
want someone in charge (to whatever degree that someone has to be in charge)
who will respect civil liberties. The masses aren't going to elect such a
person; they prefer protection to liberty and always will.
