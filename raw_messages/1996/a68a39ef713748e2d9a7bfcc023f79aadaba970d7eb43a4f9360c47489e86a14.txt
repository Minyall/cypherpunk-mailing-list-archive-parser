He sounds a lot like a Cypherpunk to me.

As to "countless third world deaths" due to debt...I'm skeptical that
Citicorp had much to do with countless deaths. Money was lent for economic
development projects...some worked, some didn't. Lenders of money don't
"cause" deaths. People are responsible for their own actions, mostly. If
their governments are corrupt, they need to replace those governments.

(Besides, the Third World is extremely good at reproduction, and is way,
way ahead of the curve in terms of overpopulating themselves to extinction.
A few tens of millions of deaths are as nothing compared to the 7,000
million that now exist, increasing by 100+ million every year.)

Cypherpunks is about finding ways that the breeders cannot seize the assets
of those who save, who plan for the future, and who are not sheep.

If this sounds harsh, so be it. Cypherpunks is not about redistributing
wealth. Nor is about putting lenders of money in prison because they have
allegedly caused "countless third world deaths."
