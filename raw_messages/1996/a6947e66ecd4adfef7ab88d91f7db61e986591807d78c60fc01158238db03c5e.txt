OK, I will "subsribe" you.

On the off chance that you meant "subscribe", instructions follow at the
end of this message.

The Cypherpunks list is handled with the "Majordomo" automated list
handler. All commands must be addressed to  majordomo@toad.com, not to the
readers of the Cypherpunks list.

How to subscribe to the Cypherpunks mailing list: send a message to
"majordomo@toad.com" with the body message "subscribe cypherpunks". To
unsubscribe, send the message "unsubscribe cypherpunks" to the same
address. For help, send "help cypherpunks".  Don't send these requests to
the Cypherpunks list itself. And be aware that the list generates between
40 and 100 messages a day.
