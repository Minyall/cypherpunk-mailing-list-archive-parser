It used to exist a few years ago.  It was called the "Clueless Users
Mailing List".  The idea was that somebody annoyed by a clueless user's
sending subscribe or unsubscribe messages to a list would subscribe the
clueless user to the clueless users' mailing list, where the clueless
users would all get each other's "help" and "get me out" and "unsubscrive"
messages, but would not get any help from clueful folk, until they figured
out how to use the appropriate "-request" address.
