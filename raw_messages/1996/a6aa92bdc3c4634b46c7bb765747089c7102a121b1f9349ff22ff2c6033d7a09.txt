So - get a scanner (which may be illegal), put a horny kid to transcribe
whatever you hear, and post it to usenet via the anonymous remailers.

That'll catch the media's attention.

I've been on the Internet for close to 15 years. I used to tell people how
wonderful it is and how they should use it at least for e-mail. And they'd
say to me, most of the people they want to talk to either don't use e-mail
or are on systems not connected to the Internet back then, like Compuserve.
And they were right at that time.
