Whatever you do, PLEASE stop using the term "checksum" when what you really 
mean is CRC, hash or something else.  A "checksum" is a bad error checker, 
only somewhat better than none at all.  If you use the term "checksum" some 
neophyte might actually misinterpret what you're doing and implement a real, 
honest-to-goodness checksum in his next program.
