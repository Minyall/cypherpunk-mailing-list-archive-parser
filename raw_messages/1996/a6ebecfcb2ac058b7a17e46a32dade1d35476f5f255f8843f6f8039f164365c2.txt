    reply from attila:

	I agree there will be "universal" secrecy --there will always 
    someone who manages to decode one or two "signatures" including 
    handshakes, and spoofs them, after burying the sucker machine in
    response commands so it has a chance to grab the handshaking.

	a little group effort, a couple of fast machines to
    coordinate the attack, and rest just might be history.  seems
    to me both Netscape and the abominable creature from the 
    Pacific Northwest said they could not be broken....

	Personally, I think NSA has figured out how to break PGP --
    enough specialized DSPs and prime factoring tables on magneto-
    optical disks can go along way.  If you have traffic both ways,
    you have the hash as well.

	dropping Phil accomplished two basic things: a cheap give-
    away to look good in public; and, they avoided defending ITAR
    in court  --and the ninth circuit can be pretty cranky on the
    Bill of Rights  --they don't follow Washington's line too 
    well.
