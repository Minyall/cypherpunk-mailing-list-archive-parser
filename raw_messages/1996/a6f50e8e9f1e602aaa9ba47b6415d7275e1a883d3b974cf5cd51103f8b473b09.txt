Caught an interesting segment on this evening's PBS news program with Jim
Lehrer.

Two senators were discussing whether the U.S. should sign the international
agreement banning chemical warfare.

Sen. Kyl maintains that verification is impossible and that Iraq, Libya, and
North Korea will never participate.

Sen. Nunn responds that we should sign anyway.  Besides, he adds in the non
sequitur of the week, anyone can get instructions on how to build chemical
weapons on the Internet.

I guess the Internet isn't just for pornography and conventional bomb-making
advice anymore.
