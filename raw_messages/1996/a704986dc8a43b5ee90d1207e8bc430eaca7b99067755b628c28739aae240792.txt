TRACKING SMART CASH

A senior Justice Department official has urged makers of smart
carts to include a mechanism for tracking transactions over a
certain dollar amount.

Assistant Attorney General Robert Litt also called for "sensible
limits" on how much value can be stored or transferred on a
single card or PC.  The government hopes it can work with industry
without stifling smart card development, and without compromising
individual rights.

"We don't want to dictate how these features are designed, but
there are certain reasonable parameters that industry should build
into their systems," says Litt.
