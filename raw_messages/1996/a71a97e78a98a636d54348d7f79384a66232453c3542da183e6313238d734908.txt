This is truly bizarre. First, if they were on the NASDAQ, they'd have a
4-letter ticker symbol, not a 3-letter symbol. MSFT (Microsoft) is on NASDAQ.
IBM (IBM) and F (Ford) are on the New York stock exchange and/or
American stock exchange.

Sometimes the stock of a foreign company is traded in the U.S. in the form
of American Depository Receipts (ADRs) not sponsored by the company. How
could that impose any obligation on it?
