Allgaeuer Zeitung, 9.9.96 says:
(A German newspaper)

The German Company MobilCom wants to proove
that the German GSM networks D1,D2 and E+ are
secure.

There have been rumors that it's possible to
phone with a hacked code.

If a hacker is able to phone using the number
0171 / 3 28 99 66 in Germany with a hacked code,
the company will pay 100.000 DM (~65.000$) to a non
profit organisation of the hackers choice.

Is someone able to do this ? :)
