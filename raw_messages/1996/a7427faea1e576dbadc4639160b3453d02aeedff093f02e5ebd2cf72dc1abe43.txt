I just updated the type2.list/pubring.mix combination on jpunix.com to 
reflect the disappearance of the ncognito remailer. I've been getting 
nothing but bounces and the owner doesn't seem to be around to fix it. 
The updated lists can be obtained by WWW from www.jpunix.com and by 
anonymous FTP from ftp.jpunix.com.
