Sounds good!

Now that coderpunks have split off of cypherpunks, I propose the creation of
at least two more mailing lists on toad.com (to keep the traffic on the
original cypherpunks more in line with Perry's views of what's appropriate):

* nukepunks - for educating the public how to build nuclear weapons
 (discussions of refining U-232 in your garage and the like)

* chempunks - for educating the public how to build chemical weapons
 (how to make Cyclon-B out of common household chemicals)

   :-)
