    Sorry, but no.

Then either you must think that this *is* WHINERpunks, or you are a
hypocrit.
    
    I usually just reply to such posts in private and note that they are
    off topic, but since you insisted on bringing it up in public...

Well, you sure post a hell of a lot of them to the list.
