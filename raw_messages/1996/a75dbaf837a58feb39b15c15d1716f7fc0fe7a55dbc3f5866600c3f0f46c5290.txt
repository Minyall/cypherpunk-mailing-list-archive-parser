a) chips do not need makeup
b) t'were me, I would just fix the chip so that instead of 2^56 (DES) keys
   or whatever, the PRNG was "fixed" so that the total keyspace was only 2^32
   for instance. Enough to be nearly impossible to check but small enough
   for a brute force engine to zip through in seconds *if you knew the 
   algorithm*.

The nice thing about am implimentation in software is that the code can be 
examined for just this sort of thing *on a randomly selected operating unit*.
- hard to do with a chip.
						Warmly,
