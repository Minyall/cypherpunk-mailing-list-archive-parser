However, future judicial assistance treaties are meaningless if you store
your keys anonymously (domestically or internationally) so that even the
keeper doesn't know he has them or exactly where they are in his pile of keys.

In general, I think that we should attack government key escrow on economic
efficiency grounds by pointing out that it is unlikely that "socialized key
escrow" would do as good a job as private enterprise key escrow.  The
Stalinist method of industrial production, is well known for its
inefficiencies and similar inefficiencies attach to government key escrow.

In fact, I suppose that government operation of the identification system
(drivers' licenses, passports, etc.) in general is also horribly inefficient
and should be attacked on efficiency grounds.
