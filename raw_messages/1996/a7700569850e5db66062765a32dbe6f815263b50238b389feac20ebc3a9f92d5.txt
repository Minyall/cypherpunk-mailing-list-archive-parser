Here's a puzzle for our game theorists.

Twenty cypherpunks robbed a bank. They took 20 million bucks. Here's
how they plan to split the money: they stay in line, and the first guy
suggests how to split the money. Then they vote on his suggestion. If
50% or more vote for his proposal, his suggestion is adopted.

Otherwise they kill the  first robber and now it is the turn of guy #2
to make another splitting proposal. Same voting rules apply.

The question is, what will be the outcome? How will they split the
money, how many robbers will be dead, and so on?
