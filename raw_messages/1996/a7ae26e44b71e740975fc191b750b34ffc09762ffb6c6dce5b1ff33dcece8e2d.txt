the point is that the source code is available and public.  I may not be 
able to find any errors or hiddens trapdoors in it, but I have greater 
trust in it because many other people can read it and make public 
comments about it.   the advantage of a published (public) work is that 
even those of us who are not experts can gain the advantage of having the 
work reviewed openly by anyone who is so inclined.
