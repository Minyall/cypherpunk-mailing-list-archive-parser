I disagree. It is your community, and your involvement can still make a 
difference. When all you do is turn away, or complain to the authorities, 
rather than becomming involved, the "crime rate" goes up, and the 
authorities respond by raising taxes, passing laws, and putting more 
police on the streets.

Most spammers just don't know any better. One of the sites I manage 
started choking on spam that was a "mailing list" of a few hundred email 
addresses in the "cc:" field. A polite email message to the offender, and 
another to their ISP, was all that was needed to stop the problem. Took 
much less time than reading this thread.  :)

I doubt this. One can still get a "blind" post office box rather easily. 
Why would the 'net be any different?

You're taking a stand on the minority side of a viewpoint; society can, 
and might, fight back by making your tools themselves illegal, rather 
than the uses you put them to. At least in the U.S., you can fall back on 
the Bill of Rights, but the CDA is a prime example of the erosian of even 
our most fundamental protection.

The problem is that we're running a bit short on the "good laws" side, at 
least here in the U.S. Election-year stupidity has again set in, and our 
(mostly uninformed) leaders are racing to anything involving regulation 
of the 'net, as it's a sure way to get into the public eye. Take the 
"minor bit" as an example of a hasty and ill-thought-out p.r. stunt ...

If I send snail, there are "rules" governing who can open the envelope. 
If I'm suspected of criminal activity, the community has recourse.

The 'net is different. The envelope is always open. I suppose this falls 
right into the trap of giving the govt. key escrow, which I'm against, 
but that's another story ...
