The real problem with remailers and kids, from my experience, is not
kids who use nyms; it is people sending sexual material, unsolicited,
to children.  I have had a few complaints from parents where this has
happened.

I am pretty sure it is illegal, CDA or not, at least if the material
is obscene rather than merely indecent.  As Declan says, the issue is
accountability.  If the remailer operator ends up being considered the
person who sent the mail, he could be in deep trouble.
