Please note the difference between crypt(3), the C library call used to
hash passwords, and crypt(1), the user program that encrypts files.  The
former is based on DES, and has not been broken (unless someone from the
NSA wants to speak up now).  The latter is based on the Enigma machine,
and is the one that "Crypt Breakers Workbench" attacks.
