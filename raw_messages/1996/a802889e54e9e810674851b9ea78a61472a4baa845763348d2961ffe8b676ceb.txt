Something for Jim Bell and his ilk to think about:

         "If we could climb
               the highest steeple
          And look around at
               all the people,
          And shoot the ones
               not wholly good
          As we, like noble
               shooters, should,
          Why, then there'd be
               an only worry ---
          Who would be left
               to bury 
                 us?"

                 - Walt Kelly
