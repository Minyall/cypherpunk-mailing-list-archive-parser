What makes you think you got the export version?

Here's one way to find out.  If you look in the Security Preferences
panel under the Options menu, there are two "Configure" buttons for
configuring what ciphers are enabled for SSL 2 and SSL 3.  The domestic
version supports a greater variety of options, including triple DES.
