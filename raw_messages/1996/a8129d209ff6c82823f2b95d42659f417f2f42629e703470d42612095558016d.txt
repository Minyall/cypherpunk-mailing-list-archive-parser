Long-distance telecommunications carriers have been in bed with
governments since Samuel F. B. Morse strung a line into DC.  Only 
a modest amount of cynicism is required to think that there are
"wiretap" hooks in the carriers' systems.  When an MCI merges
with a Britsh Telecom, who gets the benefit of the hooks?
