I don't doubt this, honestly.  After all, novels alone don't earn the kind of
guided tours, information, and assistance he's received on many counts.  It
had the feel of military connections, but I wasn't about to doubt it, I've
allways this truely was the Land Of Opertunity.

In any event, he deserves such treatment.  He's an excellent author, and does
justice to the people he portrays, despite the disclaimer that none of the
characters are made to represent anyone living or dead.

Daniel.
