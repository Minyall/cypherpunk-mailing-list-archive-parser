This goes along with what others have postulated.

But I have to wonder -- how long will the [re]train take?
One of the gripes about PEP was that retrains were slow....
This sounds slower.

Further, how stable will the outcome be -- will the 'slop' in the 
CO's AD conversion overwhelm things?

given that they will object to anything that benefits subscribers
and does not give them an added cut.. witness ISDN pricing, for
example.]
