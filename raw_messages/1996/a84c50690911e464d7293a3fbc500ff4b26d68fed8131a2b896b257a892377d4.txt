"Let's try it and see how it goes" is often a dangerous step. It could kill
the list as we know it; exactly what fraction of current subscribers do you
think will arrange for digital cash accounts, will arrange their mailing
software to use this, will bother with PGP, etc.?

Now maybe this is a Good Thing, to drive out the slackers and those without
good tools integrating PGP into their mailers, etc., but maybe it is not a
Good Thing .

It seems to me that one should not lightly just say "Let's try it and see
what happens!"

My sentiments exactly. But I fail to see how collecting a dollar per post,
or whatever the fee is ultimately set at, increases the number of good
posts (not the percentage, the S/N, the _number_, which is what we both
agree is the important thing).
