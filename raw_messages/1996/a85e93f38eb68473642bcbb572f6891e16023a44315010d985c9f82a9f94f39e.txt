I suspect that this meme propagates (especially among
non-native-English-speakers) via the list itself.  Peter
Posch probably saw one of the previous "unsubscrives" and is
hoping it will work for him.  Perhaps the 
owner-cypherpunks@toad.com people could hack it to bounce
"unsubscrives" (along with the other spellings) back to
sender with an explanation?
