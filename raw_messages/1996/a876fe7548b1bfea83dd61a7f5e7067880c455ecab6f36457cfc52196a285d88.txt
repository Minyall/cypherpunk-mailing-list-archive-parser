Dan, 

We do not asked that all the people on the Cypherpunks mailing list sign 
anything - not even the ones that particpate in the testing - they sign 
nothing and agree to nothing other than to be intellectually honest - 
there is nothing for anyone to sign - 

We have complied with Derek's request, why are so many of you starting to 
protest - are you afraid of the truth? Obviously so - or you would not be 
so timid - some of you have snapped at the opportunity to test the system, 
the others are obviously skating backwards as fast as they can,

Appreciatively,

Ralph 


Converstaion between Ralph and Charles Metzger, paraphrase -

Charles Metzger, was a brillant Docturate of Applied Mathematics, who was 
blinded duribng his twenties  - he became a programmer, using punched 
cards at first and later braille 

Ralph: You amaze me Charles, you are the most precisioned programmer that 
       I know - I bet 20% of your programs run the first time.

Charles: Not that much, probably more like 10%, you know what 
         Panchatantra said ?

Ralph: No what? 

Charles: Knowledge is the true organ of sight, not the eyes.

Ralph: I could not agree more -


It is obvious that some Cypherpunks true vision are not nearly so astute 
as Charles was - not nearly, they are blinded by their arbitrary dogmatism
