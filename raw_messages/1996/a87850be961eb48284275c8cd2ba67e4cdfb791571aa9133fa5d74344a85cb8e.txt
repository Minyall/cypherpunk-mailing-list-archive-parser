It seems to me that if we consider that there are two separate functions remailers provide:

1.  Anonymization.

2.  Jurisdiction swapping

Then perhaps one way to improve the robustness of remailers against 
copyright-type legal attacks is to provide remailers with temporary (1-2 
week) remail-only sites.  All material would be processed by the front end, 
then delivered in bulk to the other site.   This sounds similar to the idea 
you described.

That way, the remailer's "front end" can stay around for years, developing 
reputation.  Any attack on copyright would simply be an attack on the back 
end, which wouldn't last anyway.
