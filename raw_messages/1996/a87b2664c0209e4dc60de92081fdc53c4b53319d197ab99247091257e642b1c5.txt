Very nice. There are just two little issues:

a) How do you generate the random bytes?
b) How do you transmit them to the other side, without having a secure channel?

In 1940, you needed airplanes to solve b), now you can use PGP (or any 
other combined strong asymmetric & symmetric crypto) to solve b) and
partially even a), saving you a lot of fuel ;-)

BTW: In my opinion, your 'randomization of bits' corresponds to cyphers, 
and the way you randomize them corresponds to 'keys'.


My 0.2 cents worth.
