Ed, I've met Eric Hughes.  You're no Eric Hughes.

The crypto people on this mailing list have asked people repeatedly to
curtail non-crypto-related postings (most recently, Tim May, who started
this thread). This is not censorship. The sliencing of Fred Cohen by a lynch
mob of non-technicals (who, e.g., send e-mail twice) is a disturbing example
of censorship.
