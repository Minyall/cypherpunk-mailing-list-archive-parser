NOISE.SYS Version 0.6.3-Beta is now released.  Check ftp.funet.fi in 
directory /pub/crypt/random.

NOISE.SYS is a /dev/random-like driver for DOS systems, similar to 
the Linux implementation.  It collects timings from keystrokes, disk 
access, mouse movement, and other system events as sources of 
randomness.

Changes include:
  Ability to add samples by writing to RANDOM$ or URANDOM$ devices
  Fixes bug when reading RANDOM$ device in ASCII mode under MSDOS7
    (Yes, it was a minor bug)

If you have any questions, comments, or problems, drop me a line.

Rob.
