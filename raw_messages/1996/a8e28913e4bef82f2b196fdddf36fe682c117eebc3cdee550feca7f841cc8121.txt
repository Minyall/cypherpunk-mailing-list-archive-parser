  The question is, if Microsoft is proposing this to the W3C and IETF, will
they provide a reference implementation with source freely available? Microsoft
has a habit of proposing "open" standards, of which they have the only 
implementation, which quickly becomes a defacto standard along with
any "extensions" they make.
