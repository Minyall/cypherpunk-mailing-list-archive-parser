I also believe Netscape has cast its lot on the side of strong crypto, and
will likely reject the GAK-IBM-Clipper IV-TIS monstrosity.

And if Netscape doesn't, there's always Microsoft Explorer waiting!

(Seriously, if either Netscape or Microsoft, the two 800-MB gorillas,
chooses to implement GAK, a concerted campaign to urge people to switch to
the _other_ one can be launched. "Just Say No to Netscape" or "Just Say No
to MS Explorer," as applicable. Then the other one, the one not yet
implementing GAK, can get the message. If, of course, they coordinate their
adoption of GAK for a simultaneous release, then we're screwed. :-})

As for IBM's involvement, they've played around with the NSA for decades.
Nothing new there. Fortunately, today they're just a marginal player.
