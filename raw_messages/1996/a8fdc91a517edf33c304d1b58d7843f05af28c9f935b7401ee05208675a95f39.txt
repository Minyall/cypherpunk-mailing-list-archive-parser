Some list redirector of somesort has gone wonky at Netscape.  (Take a look
at the headers if you do not believe me.  They are originating off of some
internal lists at mcom.com, the original Netscape domain.)

Cypherpunks is not the only list effected by this.  I am getting these weird
messages on wwwsecurity as well.

Since it is Friday, I expect that this will be with us until someone gets in
the office on Monday.
