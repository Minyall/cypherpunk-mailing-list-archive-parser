If you use the fan remember in your power supply remember that many of them
run directly off the 120 VAC. As a consequence the sound it makes will have
a strong 60Hz componant.

If you are using a DC bearing fan then there will be a componant in the
noise related to the number of balls in the bearing.

DC bearingless fans should provide the best white noise provided the
bushings are not worn. Once they wear you will be a harmonic related to
shaft diameter, shaft length, and the gap between main shaft and bushing.
