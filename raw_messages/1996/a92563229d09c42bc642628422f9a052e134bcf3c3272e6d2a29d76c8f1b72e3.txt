To all PGP users:

We would like to make you aware of a new tool, called PathServer, for
use with the "Pretty Good Privacy" (PGP) key management and encryption
software. PathServer is a tool to help users to determine to whom a 
public key belongs, i.e., to "authenticate" the key. PathServer 
returns an active graphical representation of disjoint paths from a 
trusted key to the query key. PathServer helps support user 
authentication policies requiring that no single introducer is relied 
upon multiple times for information regariding a key. 

 PathServer can be accessed at
	http://akpublic.research.att.com/~reiter/PathServer

We welcome and appreciate any comments or suggestions.  Send any
comments to reiter@research.att.com or stubblebine@research.att.com.

PathServer is an experimental service that is still under development,
and thus it will likely be unreliable and slow for a while.  Thanks in
advance for your patience.
