Yes, it's completely dependent on the AWT implementation.  (Or, of
course, on the implementation of whatever graphical library provided
by the particular Java runtime environment in question.)

The "standard" AWT that's used in the Netscape (and maybe HotJava)
web browsers decorates all windows applets create such that it's
obvious they're there.  It is designed to be impossible for the applet
itself to corrupt the AWT such that the windows don't bear that
decoration.  (Whether the design works as advertised is a question
worth asking, of course.)
