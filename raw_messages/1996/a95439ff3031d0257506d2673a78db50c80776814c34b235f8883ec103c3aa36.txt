What's the reason for ZKP below?  Is the objective that A and B
only know the other one is interested if they have also
advertised interest, and that nobody else can tell they're 
interested in each other?  Or just that you can advertise who
you're interested in so that only they know you're interested
and nobody else does (except possibly a Trusted Third Party.)

For the latter case, instead of publishing g^(AB)mod n,
publish hash(g^(AB)mod n), where hash is some non-invertible
function (maybe strong like MD5, or maybe cheap like a CRC32,
depending on how often you're willing to risk collisions.)
If you're concerned about replay attacks, use something like
(timestamp, MD5(timestamp, g^(AB)mod n)).
