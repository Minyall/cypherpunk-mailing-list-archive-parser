Isn't it the libertarian types on the list who are into mass killings of
civilians with nukes and the "socialist statists" who tend to oppose it? 
 
How does this square with your view that it is people into "'proactive'
government" who are "crush[ing] other people's lives?" 
 
It seems to me having your city nuked is a tad more likely to produce the
crushing. 
 
Normally, I would not be the first to post this onto cypherpunks, but since
*you* did I'm game for another seemingly off-topic discussion.
