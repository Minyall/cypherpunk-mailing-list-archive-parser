        Could something akin to this be a practicle method or test for
Blaze's "Key Escrow without Escrow Agents"? The main thing lacking is a
secure method to get it out to the different escrow servers... (One could
just encrypt each chunk of the message/key in a server's public key...
Servers would read that newsgroup and pull down and escrow the chunks that
they recognize.)
