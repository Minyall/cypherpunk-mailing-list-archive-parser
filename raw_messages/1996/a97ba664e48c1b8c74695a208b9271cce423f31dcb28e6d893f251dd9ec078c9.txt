I don't think so.  Especially for jpg which uses a lossy compression scheme.
Any random noise could be attributed to the compression.  There is already
enough noise in wav files that inverting one bit won't make much of a
difference.

The whole point of steganography is plausible denial.  The data that someone
could de-stego from a file should just be random garbage, in which case there
would be no way of telling whether there was an encrypted file stegoed in the
data file.  If PGP files are used, a utility like Stealth is a must.
