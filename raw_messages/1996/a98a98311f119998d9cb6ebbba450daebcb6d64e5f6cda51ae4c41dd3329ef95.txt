His testomony, which the prosecution would have reviewed with him (in so
far as it does not break the ethical line of reviewing and constructing of
course).

In the American system I think that many people who have not had experiece
watching juries and the lunacy that surrounds the process fall victim to
an effect the likes of which you described on the list some time ago.
"Best as the enemy of good."  I think is the way you phrased it.  Juries
are very good at pointing fingers at merely "decent" evidence.  Arguments
of the sort that are made here, while logically sound, and convincing to
me personally, will simply not be as effective in court.

I invite all the members of the list to go sit in on a trial at some time
or another and pay attention to evidence and how it really impacts juries.

It implied a great deal.  It proves nothing.  Unfortunately you really
don't have to prove anything.  Reasonable inferences are enough.  I'm not
telling you how I think it should be, but rather how, in my experience, it
tends to work out in practice.  Add it to the video tape of the customs
area (with our poor defendant on camera turning on the laptop for security
to show them its not a bomb or something) and things get more and more
interesting.

It's all a matter of how much effort you want to put it to it.

If everyone is convinced that export controls will never be enforced, why
all the efforts to comply with ITAR on ftp sites and so forth?  Certainly
those are a lot more in the grey area than actually transporting the data
physically...?

Actually, given that in this case the defendant would have explicitly
claimed to have taken the software out on a laptop, all that would really
be needed to lend a bit of material to verify would be testimony by anyone
that he had a laptop of his own on the trip.

See the Klaus von Bulow bag for an example of how ownership and possession
and multiple items which all look alike don't really care

"PGP isn't on here?  You destroyed evidence!"
Works both ways.  It doesn't help that he admitted to the crime to his
buddies on the evil conspiracy mailing list either.

I challenge you to find an airport today that will not hand inspect
laptops in checked bagage and either x-ray or hand inspect or both laptops
carried on.  I also challenge you to find an airport that does not keep
video tape records of their security areas.  If you do make sure to call
the FAA and report them as well.  I understand there is a reward for lax
security reports now.

All these speculations are idle where the defendant admitted to the means
he used to commit the crime.  Reasonable verification is all that is
required, and in some circumstances, not even that.

I'm not telling you he'd go away.  I am telling you that if I wanted to
prosecute the case, I'd make a very good run of it and without someone on
their toes, probably talk defendant into a plea deal.

With respect, Mr. May, nothing you have presented is legal argument
either.

Thats a reading of the law, not the dogma of a courtroom.

In print, distributed to nearly 1500 people, I simply cannot agree.

Disagree strongly.  I have seen jail terms for less.  Particularly where a
prosecutorial political motive was being served.

Merely enough to allow a jury to make a reasonable judgement to the
reliability of the confession.

Comparing export regulations to murder investigation undercuts your
argument rather seriously.  I really suggest you spend some time in the
pragmatic world of the courtroom and watch exactly how the letter of the
law is put into practice.
