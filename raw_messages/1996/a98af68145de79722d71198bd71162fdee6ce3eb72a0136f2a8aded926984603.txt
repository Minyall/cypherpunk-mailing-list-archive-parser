The next release of my encryption library (currently available as
ftp://garbo.uwasa.fi/pc/security/crypl110.zip) will contain a nice fast RSA
implementation.  It includes 16 and 32-bit DLL's.  Actually the current version
has support for it, but I took out the code because the key management routines
weren't ready yet.
 
There are two things worth noting, the first is that RSA itself isn't much use
without a *lot* of key management code (which is what's holding up the
RSA-enabled version).  The second is that if you're in the US you're probably
going to run into legal hassles using this code unless someone wants to do an
alternative RSAREF implementation which you can plug in in place of the
existing RSA code.
