mattC> Quote #1:
mattC> "The POUCH is a secure e-mail terminal program for IBM compatible
mattC> computers. It uses a secret key phrase, advanced cryptographic
mattC> techniques and several unpublished algorithms to protect data in the
mattC> body of e-mail messages. The key phrase, which can be up to 48 bytes
mattC> long, is easily remembered and communicated. The POUCH is highly
mattC> resistant to all known forms of cryptographic attack."

mattC> Quote #2:
mattC> "We warrant that the product when delivered to you has no short cuts,

To coin a phrase, "pseudocrapto" :-)
