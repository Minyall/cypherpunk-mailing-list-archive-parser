You are Swedish?

I heard on talk.politics.guns somebody say that in Sweden they 
had banned knives with a sharp point at the end, and were going 
to ban sharp knives altogether.  I think he was just engaging in 
hyperbole, that he really meant that gun control in Sweden was 
unreasonably strict, but on reflection I am not sure.

What is the story?
