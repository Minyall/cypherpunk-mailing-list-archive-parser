Hmmm.  Interesting point.  But would admitting you had a contract with 
Fred to smuggle 100 kilos of herion into the United States be a waiver of 
your Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination?  (I think most 
certainly so).

Even if that could be enforced in civil proceedings, it would hardly 
encourage litigants to just come to court instead of shooting themselves.
