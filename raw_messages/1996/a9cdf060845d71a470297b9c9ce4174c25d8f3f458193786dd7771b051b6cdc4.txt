To set the record straight, Tim Dierks mentioned this in response to my
point that the French do some things right. (Emphasis on "some.")

Also, while I'm clarifying things, at least two recent messages have
referred to me as "Dr. May." Normally I don't feel obliged to correct such
things, but I will here. I don't have a Ph.D., just a bachelors degree.
Sosumi.
