Weren't those his _private_ keys, though?  You probably shouldn't be able
to transfer those in a secure system.

ObCrypto: would the transfer of private keys be necessarily a good
thing?  Or would a transfer of "reputation" be a better idea?
Example: suppose, and this is _very_ hypothetical, that the President
of the U.S. has a PGP key.  (We can dream, eh?)  Would it be
wiser to transfer that key from one President to the next, or have
the President sign the President-elect's new key?  
(I'm stretching here - feel free to killfile me.)
