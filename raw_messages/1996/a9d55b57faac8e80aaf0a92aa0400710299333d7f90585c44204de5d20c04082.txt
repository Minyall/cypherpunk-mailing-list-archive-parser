	Actually I think that this view is at the core of the misunderstanding.

	In fact, we ARE required to suffer fools.  It is a clear and
acknowledged expense for an open society.

	This does not mean that we have to encourage them.  For example,
it's just fine to make a point of never responding to any mail from someone
you happen to consider a fool.  If enough list participants happen to
concur with your assessment, a de facto state of ostracism results.

	We need to acknowledge the responsibility we each carry for
encouraging continued activity by those we simultaneously assess as fools
(or worse.)

	Involuntary list membership termination is a fundamental error.
