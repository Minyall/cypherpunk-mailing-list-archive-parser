i have to agree.  there is a huge difference in telling someone that
they're breaking the law and supporting a law.

as far as i'm concerned, on cypherpunks we try to disect laws or
regulations so that we can chip away at weaknesses in them.  it is
also useful if one wants to determine how your oppenent is going to
react when you do something; know your enemy and all that.
