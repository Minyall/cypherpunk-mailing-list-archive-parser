("Ebonics" elided)

There's got to be a better way than Ebonizing manually. First there was the
Canadianizer, eh, hoser? Then there was Zippy
(www.metahtml.com/demos/zippy/), which is terrific for Willy/Freeh/Reno
speeches. We really need an Ebonizer (TM)!

BTW, Tim's not kidding about the Oakland, CA school system.  Check your
regular news source.
