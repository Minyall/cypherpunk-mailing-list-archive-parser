Because this has Cpunks relevance in the use of crypto, I'm going to keep

But what does it mean to add 'firewalling capabilities' to an O/S?  By 
definition, a firewall is supposed to stop the spread of 'fire' by being 
the sole mechanism for the interchange of packets.

If you're referring to making a hardened OS that can protect itself 
through the use of well written code, memory protections, etc. then, yes 
by all means add it to your OS, but these shouldn't be luxuries in that 
they're thought of as 'firewalling' features.  Rather these things should 
be compulsory in the development of OS's.

Even if OS's could be secure(lets not get into Orange Book here) they 
would need constant updating.  Most users have problems printing, let 
alone installing patches and tweaking afterwards to deal with conflicts.  
And you can't expect IS to micromanage the corporation's entire fleet of 
machines.

This would be nice, and would be a good start, but like I said above, 
these things shouldn't be considered to be luxuries.  Rather they should 
be compulsory.  That doesn't mean that they will obsolete firewalls by 
any stretch of the imagination.

(I'm starting to think Frank may have been right to move this to 
firewalls.  I think I'll crosspost this message too)
