a quick word to the cpunks with legal interests.

a great new book called "Online Law: the SPA's Legal Guide
to Doing Business on the Internet" seems to me to be
a superlative compilation. edited by Thomas J Smedinghoff.
Addison-Wesley, 1996.

extremely up-to-date-- in one section cites various court
decisions from 1995 on the scientologists vs. netcom etc.
heavy on the citations/footnotes of existing law.

has very good coverage of encryption and digital signatures
etc. and talks about their legal status. also, good info
on copyrights, defamation, patents, online transactions, 
trade secrets, privacy, licensing 1st amendment, 
sexually explicit materials, email in the workplace, 
export control, trade practices, contracts, etc.

I expect this volume is going to be widely praised and
become a very definitive guide. it seems to me a quick
look in this book would go about 95% toward resolving
immediately a lot of the online debates I've read here
and elsewhere about "what the law says".  the price
is also very good for something of this type, typically
the law-related material is really expensive.
