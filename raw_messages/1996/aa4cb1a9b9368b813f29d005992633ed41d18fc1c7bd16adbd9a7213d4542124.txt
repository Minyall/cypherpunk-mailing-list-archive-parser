And I think the anonymity issue is interesting. In the past, Detweiler
railed against the uses of anonymity while himself being the single most
prolific user of anonymous insults and the like, so it's an interesting
pathology to study.
.......................................................................................

Just wanted to mention that the reason Detweiler used anonymity was as a counter-example of why he opposed the use of it.  He wanted to impress upon the cpunks the points he was making against anonymity by using it in the ways which he warned could become a problem.

As he said in his recent post "detweiling", he aimed his efforts against those whom he considered the "big egos" - i.e., the ones who disagreed with him on his prognosis for the future.
