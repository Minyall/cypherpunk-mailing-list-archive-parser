Cypherpunks make the news again.

I'm watching the LA NBC news channel, and they report that the Oregon "look
up any license plate" Web site is causing a flap. Though apparently legal,
the critics admit, the Governor wants the material removed.

(Sounds like a good time to mirror it on some other sites, pronto!)
