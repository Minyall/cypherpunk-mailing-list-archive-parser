This is all getting unnecessarily complicated. As I pointed out
in another post ("FV's blatant double standards") NO SYSTEM FOR
SECURITY IS SAFE when one allows for recipient compromise, i.e. 
privileged access to a recipient's system by a malicious program.

Easy or difficult is not the point. In DOS it's possible for any program,
in Unix only for those with root access. Security fails when it is
not possible to make a distinctionbetween a program that _should_ 
have access and one that _shouldn't_. Anyone who's tried to teach
novice DOS users what to do when one of those anti-virus TSR tools
complains that something is doing something it shouldn't will know
how hard it is for _users_ to guard themselves.

I would think that most viruses are transmitted by floppy
disk, even now, or by programs _intentionally_ downloaded
and _intended_ to patch the OS (such as a screen blanker). 
The possibility of mass net-based creepy-crawlies has been
remote due to the uniquely multi-platform nature if Internet
protocols; they're Unix-based, but end-users have PCs. Only
metaplatforms such as Java, perlCCI, Telescript could change
this.
