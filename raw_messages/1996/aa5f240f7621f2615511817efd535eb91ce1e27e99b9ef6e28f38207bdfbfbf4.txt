Key certificates also include signatures.  If you have many signatures
on your key, your key certificate can get very big.  For example, mine
is about 10k or more (I haven't checked recently) with all the
signature intact.

As for keysize, you can generate keys as large as 2048 bits with PGP
2.6.2; you just need to type "2048" when it asks you for a keysize.
Alternatively, you can type in any keysize you wish to use, rather
than using the default sizes.

I hope this helps.
