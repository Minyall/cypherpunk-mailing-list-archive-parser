Well Stig, the world is getting crazier by the second.....

What about the dutch man that made a trademark out of the name 'Route 66'
combined with the highway sign. He got it and now has a nice swimming
pool.........of about 100 meters long.......and it's heated!

: Perhaps this has already been voiced on the main list (I get a filtered
: helping or two of cypherpunks), but *I'm* surprised that such a generic
name

: It's like giving Microsoft a trademark on the term 'Email'...  It's
nuts!
: Was the term ecash not in use before DigiCash showed up on the scene?
