I and you may well choose to do so, but the vast majority of the human
beings believe just anything that is repeated loud and long enough.
Otherwise, nobody would hire PR and pay for advertisement, politicians
wouln't be fedwith taxpayer's money, Bosnians would trade goods instead
of gunshots, etc. I'm personally not interested in conjuring up the latest
utopia for a minoritarian sect of illuminati: I need to live in the real
world, and push for viable solutions that change it for better, now.
