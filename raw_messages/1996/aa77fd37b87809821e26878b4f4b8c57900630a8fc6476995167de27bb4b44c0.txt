May I suggest that a better demonstration for the public would be to allow any
person take a pre-determined text (such as "cypherpunks"), encrypt it wtih a
key of their choice (40-bir or 56-bit, depending on what we're trying to prove),
(i.e. demonstrating that some 40-bit key scheme is unsafe may be sufficient )
send the cyphertext to a GruborBot via e-mail or Web page, and get back within
reasonable time the key(s) that were used.  I think this is feasible; whether
it's all lookup table or some lookup and some computation is details.
