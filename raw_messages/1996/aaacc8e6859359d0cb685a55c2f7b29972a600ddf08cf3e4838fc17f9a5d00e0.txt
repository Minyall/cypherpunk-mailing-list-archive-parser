The problem however, is that artificial selection maybe the only way to
select beneficial attributes at all. What is presently being selected
for in western societies is all the factors that lead to a lack of
practice or belief in birth control. I'll let the reader think for a
moment on just what those are. Perhaps we can also somehow test for and
abolish the "Catholic" gene?

 may be the most  oppressive.  It may be better to live under  robber barons  
 than  under  omnipotent  moral busybodies,  The robber baron's  cruelty may  
 sometimes sleep,  his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who  
 torment us for own good  will torment us  without end,  for they do so with 
 the approval of their own conscience."    -   C.S. Lewis, _God in the Dock_
