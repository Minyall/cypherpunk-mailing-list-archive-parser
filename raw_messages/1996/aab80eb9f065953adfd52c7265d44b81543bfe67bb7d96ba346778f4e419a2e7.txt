There are more details about Livingston's Exon Box (they call it
ChoiceNet) available at
http://www.livingston.com/Marketing/Press/choicenet_press.html .

My kneejerk reaction was to hate this thing too, but now I'm not so
sure. If I was responsible for the Internet connectivity for a K-12
school system, I would want this capability in a big way. 

I see the Livingston product as an enabling technology. The obvious
associated risk is Big Brother deciding, "If one router CAN do it, then
every router MUST do it!" The idea of having a Naughty_Enabled Bit in
IPv6 is, of course, even worse; but I'm glad it isn't my job to
exlpain why it is horrid to a Federal judge.
