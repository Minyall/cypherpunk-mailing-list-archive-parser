Well, once I've got my strong crypto and electronic commerce, and 20
or so virtual identities to do things for me, and the gub'ment can't
tell what money I'm making and spending, so they can't tax me. So if
they can't tax me, and they can't tax lots of folks, then they can't
pay their jack-booted thugs. So the goverment becomes irrelevant. It
can't support a huge police state infrastructure, and certainly can't
but mega-crays to break my crypto, so how're they going to retain
control?
When we say anarchy, we mean anarchy.
