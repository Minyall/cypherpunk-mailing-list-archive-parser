I'd say that anything directly dealing with digital cash, its
implications, deployment, and technical issues associated with
it. General discussions of whether the Federal Reserve is a bunch of
evil old men and the like are what are out of bounds.

This means:

"How does blinding work"

and 

"Do you think that digital cash systems will hurt bank regulatory
supervision"

are fine things to talk about but

"Do you think the Federal Reserve issues counterfeit money"

are not.
