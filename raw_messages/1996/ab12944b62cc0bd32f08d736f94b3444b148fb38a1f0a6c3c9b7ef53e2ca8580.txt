I got carried away with adding triple DES to libdes v 3.21+ (listed at
most of the above mentioned sites) back in november.  It has routines for
triple DES in ecb, cbc, cfb64 and ofb64 modes.

The SSLeay package builds a utility called 'enc' which can 
encrypt/decrypt with optional base64 conversion in any of the above 
mentioned modes (plus more).  Infact, SSLeay has much nicer higher level 
'by parts' finctions for the ciphers that are much easier to use.
