As stated by Dr. Vulis, he is no longer on the cypherpunks mailing
list, and indeed majordomo@toad.com HAS been instructed to ignore his
requests to resubscribe.

I removed him, on my own initiative.  I got tired of asking him to
stop stirring up flames.  When he posted a message saying that we'd
have to use technical means to stop him from flaming the list, I said,
"OK".

Tim May was not involved.

I've met Dr. Vulis in person.  He seemed like a reasonable guy.  I
treated him that way for months, despite his inability to control
himself on the list.  When he ultimately declined to control his
outbursts after numerous personal requests, I removed him.

The cypherpunks list is for discussions centered around cryptography.
I'm sure there are several mailing lists where ethnic cleansing
discussions would be welcome.  There are probably even mailing lists
which encourage people to fire off their best inflammatory messages.
If there aren't, Dr Vulis could start one.  I don't sponsor any.

Cypherpunks, please resist your own temptation to bait him (or anyone
else).  The best defense a mailing list has against flames is to
simply ignore them.  When they don't provoke an emotional response,
they don't accomplish the poster's goal, and the poster eventually
wanders off in search of more naive pastures.
