THIS IS NOT MITNICK PUNKS.

I'm sick of seeing this. I and many others read this mailing list for
information on CRYPTOGRAPHY. If and when you can demonstrate why there
is a link between, say, factoring and whether John Markoff is
profiteering off of the Mitnick case, then this becomes relevant.

Until then, GET THE CRAP OFF.

(I've been writing people privately for some time. I'm again writing
in public because more and more people seem to be getting in to the
act.)

PS I'm really not interested in reading large chunks of information on
John Gilmore's or Tsutomu Shimomura's sex lives anywhere at all, but
I'm sure there is SOME mailing list where it is relevant. Why don't
you go and post the garbage there, eh?
