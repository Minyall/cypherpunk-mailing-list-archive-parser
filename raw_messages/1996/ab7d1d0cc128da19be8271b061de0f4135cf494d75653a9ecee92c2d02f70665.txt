	Interesting - I hadn't been following the matter, that's why I'd 
missed it. I knew MI5 was trying to get involved with anti-terrorism measures
in the UK, though I don't know with what success.

	It could be argued that it is a matter of degree - it is probably
easier to trace transactions through Mondex than with cash alone.

	They say: "In everyday use Mondex transactions are private, like cash"
at http://www.mondex.com/faq.htm#anon

	Thus they are making two claims:
	1. Cash is anonymous.
	2. Mondex is like cash.
