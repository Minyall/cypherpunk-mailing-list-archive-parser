Doing something like this might also further the analogy of email to
snailmail; particularly if the remailers were able to issue 'books' of stamps.
It might even be possible to have each remailer issue Estamps (tm) of
different 'kinds', much as there are different postage stamp 'themes'.
Having different stamps from each remailer would also allow some means of
tracking spammers and rip-off artists ("hmmm. an 'Elvis' Estamp. That came
from hactic; let's see if they can tell us who they sold this book to.....")
IF the nature of the offense were sever enough.

Too, Estamp-based remailers would be a start on reputation basing: if the
email goes through a postage-based remailer, there will eventually be an
increased level of confidence that it isn't some kind of scam or other
nuisance ("This came through vox, a postage remailer; therefore, someone had
to go through some degree of bother; therefore, it's a lot less likely that
it's some Frosh playing with his new Internet toy.").

Of course, I could be just spitting into the wind, or posting what is
blatantly obvious to everyone else :-)
