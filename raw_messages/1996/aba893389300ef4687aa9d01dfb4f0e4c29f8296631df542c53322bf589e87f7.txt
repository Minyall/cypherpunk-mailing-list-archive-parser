Found out how to get a password. Sort of. I explored some of the site and
found this page http://www.bmh.com/ARPA/SynthEnv.html down at the bottom it
says:

Access to the password protected sections of our K/A database may be
obtained by request to
Debbie Adair. Please send an e-mail message explaining your need for
access. Be sure to include a
day time phone number and any pertinent information regarding your
employer/command.

I guess it might be military only.
