Big Brother Inside stickers are a classic and should be revived.  I would  
like to see a takeoff of the IBM logo since they are the ones who seem to be  
cozying up to the USG the most (with the exception of TIS whom nobody has ever  
heard of).   How about "GAK" in the familiar IBM blue pinstripe logo?  Or  
"IBBM"  International Big Brother Machines?  Everyone recognizes the IBM logo.
