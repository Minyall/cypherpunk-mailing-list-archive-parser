     Ok, I'm with you to here...

     While I agree that merely branding Clinton a facist without
backing it up is childish, I really don't see how it's `an insult to
the 10 million civilians murdered by Hitler.'  Come on now!  Facist
does not necessarily imply Hitler, or even Nazi.  The term facist has
roots that go at least as far back as the Romans, and I don't recall a
`genocide policy' as a prerequisite to being facist at any point in
history.  Even if he had called Clinton a Nazi, how does that equate
to insulting those killed by Hitler and his flunkies?  Perhaps calling
someone a Communist also is insulting everyone that Stalin killed?
