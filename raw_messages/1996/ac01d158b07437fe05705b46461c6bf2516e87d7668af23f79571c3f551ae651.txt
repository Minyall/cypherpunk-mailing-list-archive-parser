	Thats not clear.  The ITARs seem, on their face, to create a
prior restraint on speech based on its content, and forbid Americans
the right to leave the country to pursue their livlihoods.  The odds
of geting persecuted seem pretty low.

	As to the (predictable) comment that I'm not doing this, I'd
be happy to entertain offers of crypto work that are not in the US,
possibly leading to me being a test case.
