Right, I agree that you have been removed from majordomo's list of 
"subscribers" however you haven't been removed in as much as you can 
still read the list and in as much as you can post messages.  

So what is the difference were you subscribed?  Were you subscribed you 
could also post and read messages.  Now that you are unsubscribed, you 
can also post and read messages.  What's the difference?

Whatever Mr. Gilmore did made no differece.  You still read.  You still 
post.  If he wanted to totally remove you, you wouldn't be able to post 
at all.  Yet, you still do.  The rumors of your forced unsubscription are 
clearly greatly exaturated.

And yet, you post to cypherpunks@toad.com, and you read messages from 
cypherpunks@toad.com. QED: You're still here.
