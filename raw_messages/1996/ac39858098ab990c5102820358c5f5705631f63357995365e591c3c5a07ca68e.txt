Hmmmm.... It seems that your are not familiar with the fact that a false sense of
security is WORSE than no security at all. This is exactly what this type of "crypto"
provides: a FALSE sense of security.

The masses are much better off with out any crypto that some sudo-crypto provided by
the government. Atleast when you send messages in the clear the user knows that it is
open for everyone to read and not to send sensitive info.

<sigh> another simpleton. Why is it whenever anyone stands up against the "powers
that be" to defend their rights and the Consitution they are branded as "extreamist".
Just which Article of the Bill of Rights should we "compromise" on next? It is
obvious you have no respect for the 1st, 4th & 5th admendments or a clue as to what
they stand for or how they relate to this issue.
