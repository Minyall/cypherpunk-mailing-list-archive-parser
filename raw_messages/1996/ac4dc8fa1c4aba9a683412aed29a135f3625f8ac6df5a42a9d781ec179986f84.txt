Dr. Simon Phoenix (my resident quantum crypto guru) says no, you can't
use em - you have to build secure repeaters. Simon has been doing this
sort of thing in the Lab for years. He's simon@alien.bt.co.uk if you want
to probe him gently.

BTW: You can build  an Erbium doped amp that is 'transparent' to your
secure channel.
