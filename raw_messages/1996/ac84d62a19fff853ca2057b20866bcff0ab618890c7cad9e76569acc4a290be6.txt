One way to implement this would be to set up a remailer that only 
accepts input signed by a key on its ring.

Or just share a secret key. It would have to be timestamped, i.e., 
"104th Congress Key."

You either need to trust a shared server to know and then blind your 
identity, or trust the people with whom you share a secret key not to 
give that key to non-group members.
