I can't speak to the honorable senator Exon's situation, but my brother
is being required to provide his fingerprints to prove that he is fit to
be the legal guardian of his wife's daughter.  And it isn't his wife,
currently the sole legal guardian, who is questioning his fitness or
demanding his fingerprints.

And on another thread, if rights are simply restrictions on the
government and not attributes (inate, even) of the individual, then they
are meaningless.
