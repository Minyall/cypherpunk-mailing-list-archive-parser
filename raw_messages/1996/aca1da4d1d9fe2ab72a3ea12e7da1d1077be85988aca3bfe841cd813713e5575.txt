I have not seen this here yet, so sorry if you have seen it...

ViaCrypt is claiming that they are now shipping the Windows version of their
PGP 4.0.  (I tend to not believe marketing claims until I hear from people
who actually have it.)

Does anyone know if there are plans for this version to be interoperable
with PGP 3.0?

Furthermore, has anyone tried the new version?
