  Given that the IETF has no "official" (whatever that means) sanction,
what would prevent any other organization from coming in and trying to
take over their turf?  I saw an article today (sorry, can't remember
where) that suggested a brewing fight between IETF and W3C over future
HTTP and HTML standards.  If someone stands up and says that the IETF 
is becoming too slow and overcome by bickering (not my opinion, just
a what if), and that their new group is better suited to setting standards,
who decides who is right, and based on what criteria?  It seems that
one aspect of anarchy is that anyone could move in and replace "their
anarchy" with the "new anarchy".

  Just some philosophical pondering late one night...
