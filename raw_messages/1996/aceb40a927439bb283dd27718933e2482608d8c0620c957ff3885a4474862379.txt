I asked one of the NorTel sales reps. about this at the RSA conference. As
I recall, CAST is an espionage-enabled version of DES -- i.e. 16 of the key
bits are sent in the clear, or have a fixed value, or something along those
lines. The guy I spoke to didn't know the technical details.

Of course, maybe we should consider 56-bit DES espionage-enabled at this 
point too !
