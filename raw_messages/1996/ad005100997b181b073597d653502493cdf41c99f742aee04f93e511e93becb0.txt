This has been discussed a lot in the URI working groups since around 92. 
I think it's actually documented in the RFC

They say in  online country             So which side are you on boys
There is no middle way                  Which side are you on
You'll either be a Usenet man           Which side are you on boys
Or a thug for the CDA                   Which side are you on?
