Subject: RSA accellerators on ISA/PCI cards?

Does anybody have any recommendations for a good RSA accellerator 
available on an ISA/PCI card? I'm looking for something that can be used 
with numerous public/private keys, though the ability to have one 
tamperproof key would be a bonus.

Thanks
Simon
