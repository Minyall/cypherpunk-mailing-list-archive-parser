	I don't know about Futplex, but Derek and I are well paid for
our time.  In order to find the time to fairly judge this system, I
would expect to be compensated for time spent, in advance.  After all,
I wouldn't want to see your bank account disapear should your system
be broken and the company sold.

	I would be happy to not let this money influence my judging.
After all, the money is in pocket, and I've already expressed doubts
about the system.

	So, if IPG is really interested in retaining me as a judge,
lets discuss terms & conditions.
