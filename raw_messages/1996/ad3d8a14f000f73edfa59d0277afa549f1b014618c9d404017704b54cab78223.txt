If you accept that, then doesn't that make writing crypto software for
any Unix platform *even more* of a waste of time?  Because last time I
checked, there were way more Macs on mom-and-pop's desks than Unix
machines, counting *all* vendors.

Even if Apple folded *tomorrow*, those machines wouldn't vaporize.
If you put easy-to-use strong crypto on a significant fraction of
those desks six months from now, your work could easily have a lifetime
of a year and a half even in your worst case scenario.

(PS, I haven't used a Mac since 1985, so that's not why I say this.)
