In addition, (if I remember correctly from _The Puzzle Palace_), a person who was heavily initially involved in the formation of NSA also helped establishing the Chinese Intelligence Service.  Also from the same book, in the US has set up, with Chinese approval, a sigint shop within China.  This was done to sigint the Russians.  With the tensions between the US and China now, I'm not sure whether they closed shop or not.
