Looks like we're a little late. However, we can still grab the tape from 
Oregon's DMV for $220. It would be an interesting excercise to try to get 
these tapes from each state with similar provisions and put them all 
online.

Anyone want to donate server space?

   Don't panic, I just want to think about the situation for a while.    
   Stay tuned. --Aaron

   There is a very real chance that it will be turned off. That's becuase
   all of the people who hate it call the TV and Radio stations, the DMV,
   and their elected representitives. All of the people who love it send
   me email. As much as I appreciate hearing from all of you, sending me
   email doesn't let anyone else know how you feel. If you want to keep
   this service going, make your voices heard.
