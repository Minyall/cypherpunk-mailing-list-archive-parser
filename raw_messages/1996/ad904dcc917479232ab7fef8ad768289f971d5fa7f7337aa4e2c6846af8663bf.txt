I disagree.  This IS inside someone's home--both metaphorically
and in reality.  John has graciously provided us with a venue for 
our never-ending Cypherpunk salon.  I think my example of an
inappropriate guest in Dale's mom's livingroom is exactly on 
point.  Just for the record, I would appreciate it if Dale would
address my hypothetical, just in case other readers find it as
cogent as do I.
