It is fairly simple. There are just two subroutines which check the two 
lists, and return a flag indicating whether to trash the message. Just 
change it only send if a match is found. It is just a simple strstr in a 
text file.

through random chains at random times. There are a handfull of these 
running now. They make up a fair fraction of all Mixmaster remailer 
traffic (it is impossible to know exactly how much).
