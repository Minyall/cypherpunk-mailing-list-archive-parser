Ah, but the clause which says:

>>    (7) General Prohibition Seven--Support of Certain Activities by
>>U.S. persons--(i) Support of Proliferation Activities (U.S. Person
>>Proliferation Activity). If you are a U.S. Person as that term is

would appear to make such a "conspiracy" itself a crime, regardless of
First Amendment issues. This is why this new law is so pernicious: it
declares a broad class of behaviors (contracting, support, financing, etc.)
to be criminal acts.

And "prior restraint" isn't even really needed...all they have to do is to
prosecute those who provide aid and comfort to the enemy, _after_ the
publication, and the effect will be to suppress further such publications
of code.

(Note of course that the government does not practice prior restraint as a
means of stopping spies and traitors, generally. Nor are such acts of
treason or espionage protected on First Amendment grounds....I see no
reason to expect that publication of crypto code would be treated much
differently, should this new crypto law be upheld.)
