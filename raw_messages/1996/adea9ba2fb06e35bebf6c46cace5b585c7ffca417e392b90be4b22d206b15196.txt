	Does anyone know any papers on secure deletion of things from memory? That
is one thing that most people are oblivious to, though, if a program leaves
your unencrypted passkey laying in memory or a buffer of your plaintext,
then all the encryption in the world won't help. Should I overwrite the 32
times specified for hard drives, or are RAM chips easier to clear? Thanks.
