Someone's not paying attention ...

When WWW browsers are available at hotels and airports, as they surely
will be, then accessing ones email via www will be commonplace.  This
can be called "world wide web e-mail".  And of course you wouldn't want
to carry around a list of s/keys, would you?, so what better way to
authorise the connection than with an iButton?  (Answer: An iButton with
a user interface, perhaps a watch?)
