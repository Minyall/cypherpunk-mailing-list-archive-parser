I finally have a Website:

    http://www.counterpane.com

On the site I have information on Applied Cryptography, Blowfish,
Counterpane Systems consulting, and more.  The site has the latest errata,
information on ordering the book and source code disks, and the final copy
of "Why Cryptography is Harder Than it Looks."

If you have a website that mentions Bruce Schneier, Applied Cryptography,
Blowfish, or Counterpane Systems, please point to my website.  If you sell
or give away a product that uses Blowfish, please let me know so that I can
point to it.  If you are running an ftp server that has the Blowfish code
available, please tell me so that I can send people to you.

Thanks,
Bruce
