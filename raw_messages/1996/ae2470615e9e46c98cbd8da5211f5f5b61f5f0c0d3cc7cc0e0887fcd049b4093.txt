You're confused.  You're describe YOUR reaction to ME, not MY reaction to 
YOU.  And I am unaware of being invited to a "party," and now that I've 
discovered what a sleazy person Alan Olsen and his merry band are, it is 
really doubtful that I would have enjoyed what was advertised as a 
cypherpunks meeting, but which you now claim was a "party."  Your level of 
"honesty" is showing.
