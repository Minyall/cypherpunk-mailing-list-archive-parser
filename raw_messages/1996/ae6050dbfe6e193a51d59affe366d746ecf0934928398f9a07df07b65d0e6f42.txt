Unfortunately, this last statement isn't really true.  To quote from the
"Java Security" paper from some Princeton researchers:

    The Java language has neighter a formal semantics nor a formal
    description of its type system.  We do not know what a Java program
    means, in any formal sense, so we cannot reason formally about Java
    and the security properties of the Java libraries written in Java.
    Java lacks a formal description of its type system, yet the security
    of Java relies on the soundness of its type system.

And later:

    The Java bytecode is where the security properties must ultimately
    be verified . . . .  Unfortunately, it is rather difficult to verify
    the bytecode. . . .  The present type verifier cannot be proven
    correct, because there is not a formal description of the type
    system.  Object-oriented type systems are a current research topic;
    it seems unwise for the system's security to rely on such a
    mechanism without a strong theoretical foundation.  It is not
    certain that an informally specified system as large and complicated
    as Java bytecode is consistent.

And in the conclusions:

    We conclude that the Java system in its current form cannot easily
    be made secure.  Significant redesign of the language, the bytecode
    format, and the runtime system appear to be necessary steps toward
    building a higher-assurance system. . . . Execution of remotely-
    loaded code is a relatively new phenomenon, and more work is
    required to make it safe.

I do think that the ideas embodied in Java are very important, and will
significantly shape the future of computing, but Java itself may be just
a stepping stone on the way.
