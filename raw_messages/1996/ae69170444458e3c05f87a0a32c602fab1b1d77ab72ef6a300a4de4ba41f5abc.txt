	Accroding to Stephan Neuhaus's 'Statistical Properties of IDEA
session keys in PGP,' the session keys are very well distributed, when
tested for equidistribution and serial correlation.

	This does not demonstrate that the RSA keys are as well
distributed, but it does generate some confidence that the key
generation methods of PGP are not very broken.  Testing for RSA
generation would be more difficult, since there are some practical
difficulties in getting a large sample of RSA private keys.

Stephan Neuhaus is neuhaus@informatik.uni-kl.de.  He has a long (24
page), and short (8? page) version of the paper available.
