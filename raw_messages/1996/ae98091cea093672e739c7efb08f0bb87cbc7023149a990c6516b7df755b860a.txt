The emerging consensus is, in fact, nonexistant.

Gorelick trotted out the same fiction when she, Leahy, Sen. Kyl, and White
(deputy defense secretary) testified before the Senate permanent
subcommittee on investigations this morning.

(Note that Leahy is only occasionally a friend of the Net. His original
crypto bill had troubling additional criminal penalties; he shepharded
Digital Telephony through Congress; he is a co-sponsor of the vile
copyright bill pending right now. In sum, he'd hurt the Net more than help
it. This becomes a problem when netizens hold him up as an champion of our
freedoms -- and then when DT II comes along his fellow senators think it's
okay to vote for it 'cuz Mr. Net, Leahy, is a cosponsor.)

My rebuttal to Gorelick's fantasy is: well, what about Japan, where the
country's constitution forbids wiretapping?
