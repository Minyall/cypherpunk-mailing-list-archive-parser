Alternatively, it may be that the host earth station that the VSAT providers
uses was affected by the hurricane.  But different ATM providers use different
technologies for connecting their ATM networks, and may mix technologies if
that's
cheapest.  VSATs are one approach, leased lines another (generally multidrop
with ugly IBMish protocols), X.25 networks, frame relay networks, etc.
Maybe all the ATM machines run by your bank were out.  But taking out all the
ATM machines in a money-using city like New York would require some major
disaster,
like a nuclear explosion or a stupid regulation written by a government
official.
