Well,that day is not all that far off, when there is trusted h/w, or trusted components, on the desktop.
This will be the usual two-edged sword ....

Signing anything is somewaht a waste of time, unless the verification
siftware is highly trusted, and there is good intergity/authenticity
control of the root public key(s).
So, in geneal - ho hum - until trusted hardware is available on the 
desktop.
