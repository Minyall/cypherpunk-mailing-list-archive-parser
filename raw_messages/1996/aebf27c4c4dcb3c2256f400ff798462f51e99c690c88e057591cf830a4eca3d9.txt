Perhaps my connection is only disrupted accidently, but
I can't access www.xs4all.nl from one account
(the two others still work).
IP tried : 194.109.6.100

SPG: What is the 'new' IP ?
(I hope you don't think I'm a spy for
the German Government :)

Perhaps this time we have to 
proove that it's impossible to 
block an IP/Web site, so that all govs
get a clue about who inet works.

Hmm, some may claim it's better that the
goverment thinks they sucessfully restricted
the access to those pages.
I think they should know what they can't do.
