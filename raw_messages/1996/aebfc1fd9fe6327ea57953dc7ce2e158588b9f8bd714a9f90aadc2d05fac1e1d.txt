First they only blocked the IP-number of the web-server. After a while
they blocked 2 complete C-networks because xs4all changed the IP-number
of the webserver every half an hour.

At this moment they don't block anymore after we removed the radikal 154
temporary from xs4all. After they stopped blocking xs4all we've put the
issue back online of course :) We are now aiting what they will do next.
Either stop this censorship or block all +60 mirrors.
