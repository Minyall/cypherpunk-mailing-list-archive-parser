Actually, you can be even more clueless than that and still run a
remailer, pretty much as you describe. See:

 http://www.c2.org/~winsock/

But that requires MicroSnot software rather than Linux, and of course,
your ISP is liable to shut you down, without notice, as soon as they
realize what you're doing. The service location and survivability problems
remain. 

The POP/SMTP remailer idea has a lot of promise forprospective remailer
operators who are clueless and/or lack a full-time net connection, but you
still need to be upfront with your ISP about the fact that you're running
a remailer. The best ISPs will let you. I'm quite impressed with Portal
(or does Hal have something on them?), but I doubt Netcom would let you
into the remailer racket. 

c2.org, of course, has enough remailers on it already, but I did play
with the WinSock Remailer for a bit. It should be quite trivial to hack
something like it together for Linux. Just run fetchmail or whatever as a
POP client, pipe the mail spool to your mixmaster, and SMTP away.
