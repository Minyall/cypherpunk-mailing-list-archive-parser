Perry,

What constitutes "real DNS"?

DNS server administrators need only add one line to their named.boot file to
resolve .nic hosts.

secondary       nic     204.94.42.1             db.nic


It's that easy! The concept of centralized name resolutions is flawed and
only exists out of habit.
