Nit: Gronk is actually the noise the dinosaur makes. If you will, saurian
ejaculata (the verbal kind, you pervert!). Thus, to be "gronked" could be
considered be to suffer the indignities of dinosaur breath. :-).

Something the people on this list, who are, er, on the cutting edge of
societal evolution, have no small experience with, as our latest experience
with Hewlett Packard shows...

;-).

Cheers,
Bob
