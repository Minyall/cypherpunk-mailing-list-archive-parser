Chaum's DC net solves flood problems.  However it itself has high
bandwidth requirements.  Also you need to do something about denial of
service attacks.  There are algorithms to detect disrupters.

Ross Andersion's www page is:

	http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/

he has a collection of postscript files for published and to be
published papers, eternity service is one of them.

You might find Matt Blaze's netescrow interesting also, and related:

	ftp://ftp.research.att.com/dist/mab/netescrow.ps

Sounds similar to eternity.  It involves splitting the data over many
sites in many jurisdictions.  Is a UPS description available on www?

Eternities approach is to place sites in different jurisdictions, and
to arrange so that the sites themselves don't know what data the parts
of which they are serving.  (Removes the knowledge of what is being
distributed, which seems to be an element of the legal concept of
contributory infringement, as explained by Greg Broiles).
