Worse for the ISP (and better for its customers), such interception would 
violate ECPA, as the 18 U.S.C. Section 2511(2)(a)(i) exception for 
interceptions by electronic communications services would not apply to 
protect the ISP.  One could hardly (successfully) argue that selling out 
its customers was a "necessary incident" to the rendition of the ISP's 
services.  Indeed, the exception also states "that a provider ... shall 
not utilize service observing or random monitoring except for mechanical 
or service quality control checks.

I know.  They could use the exception to give away a little bit, but not 
the whole enchilada.
