Actually, it anything from Windows systems to Unix boxes to routers to
printers to firewalls, etc can be vulnerable..!

I know that linux got a patch out in 2 hours 35 minutes 10 seconds and that
OS/2 hasn't been vulnerable since 1990 or so, but that's just because I use
those systems.  Check http://www.sophist.demon.co.uk/ping/ for details on
