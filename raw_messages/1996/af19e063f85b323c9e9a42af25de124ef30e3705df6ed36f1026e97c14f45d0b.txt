I agree about the technological fixes. When enough people figure out or 
are shown how to block unwanted messages, the economics of scale 
disappear real fast. Unfortunately, there will always be a ready supply 
of the unwitting, and government's reaction is to legislate rather than 
educate.

Practically, it would be better to allow and promote a technological 
outlet for all of this, as it will never go away, so long as the medium 
exists.
