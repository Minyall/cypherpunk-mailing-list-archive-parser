                             PGP LIBRARY FOR PERL
     _________________________________________________________________

                                  DESCRIPTION

   This library contains a suite of PGP modules for Perl. Many of the
   modules require the Systemics Cryptix 1.1 library.

   Although the library is quite usable, it is still a long way from
   being complete, and the interface subject to change.

                                   FEATURES

   This library contains the modules to do the following:
     
     * PGP ascii armouring
     * PGP conventional encryption
     * PGP public key encryption/decryption
     * PGP key generation, including vanity keys!
   
   Note - the current version cannot handle compressed data packets,
   does not handle signatures, and the key management is quite poor.
   
   The library can be downloaded from http://www.systemics.com/software/
   
   Enjoy!
