Not with one-time-pads... the key is as long as the plaintext. Our Hamlet 
writing monkeys will produce, amongst others, numerous versions of the 
play where the prince's name is telmaH. As well as vastly more where the 
monkeys get all the way to the last sentence and then 

One-Time-Pads offer perfect security as long as they're only used once. If
they're used more than once, they're not one-time-pads.
