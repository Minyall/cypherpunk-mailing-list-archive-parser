Lucky - you know the answer to that, several people have access to Cray's 
and the like - you must prove that we have an exploitable flaw, not 
just claim it - everyone claims it smokes and mirrors, why are you not willing 
to  go ahead and decipher a message - everyone claimed it was so easy - 
why are the cypherpunks so quite all of a sudden, we have been getting 
about 5 messages an hour up until we accepted Dereks challenge - now we 
have not received any messages for over five hours until we received 
yours. If it is so EASY, JUST GO AHEAD AND DO IT!
