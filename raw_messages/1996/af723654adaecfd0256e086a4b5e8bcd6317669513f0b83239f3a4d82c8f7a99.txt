The Post Office has now jumped on the terrorist bandwagon by 
announcing that it will no longer be legal to drop any package
weighing over 16 ounces into a collection box. 

Larger packages will have to be presented in person at the 
Post Office, and I wouldn't be surprised if several forms of
ID were required.

Should wreak havoc with the mail order video tape rental business,
with those handy pre-paid 4th class labels you just slap on the 
tapes before dropping in the nearest mailbox. 

I suspect one could do a lot of damage to a mailbox with under 16
ounces of the proper explosive.  Perhaps one of our resident
Cypherpunks bomb experts could expand on this subject.
