Anyone that has earned a PhD has EARNED the right to follow his/her name
with that distinction.  Power to him.  It's an accomplishment that we should
all strive for if we're so inclined.  Dr Cohen: I respect your degree and it
doesn't bother me one bit for you to  use the title that you deserve.

Let's consider the cretin that considers USC a "second rank school."

And what, may I ask, have YOU written?

I really don't understand this guys' hostility toward Dr Cohen.  But...
it just doesn't matter.  To hell with him.
