A copy of the regulations is available from
http://www.gov.sg/sba/netreg/regrel.htm

One of the providers in Singapore (singnet) has the following 
page up about the proxy server that Singnet customers will be forced
to use
http://www.singnet.com.sg/cache/sbareg.html

Scary stuff. But pretty much everything I hear about Singapore is
pretty scary.

I'm wondering if they'll implement this by blocking direct 
connectivity from their customers machines for TCP with the 
destination ports commonly used by http, ftp, etc. thus allowing 
people to do things not supported by the proxy and to get around the 
blocking pretty easily, or if they'll just block all direct IP 
connectivity between their customers and the rest of the Internet, so 
people in Singapore will be reduced to viewing the Internet as 
nothing more than the WWW.
