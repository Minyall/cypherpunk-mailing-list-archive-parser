I'm a PhD student at the Annenberg School for Communication at the
University of Pennsylvania.  My research is on the ways that various groups
influence the development of "digital cash" systems.

I'd like to work with cypherpunks for part of this research.  Right now, I
expect this work to include reviewing the list's archives, participating in
the list and in physical meetings, and interviewing some people.

If you have any thoughts on this (or feelings: revulsion, intrigue, pique
perhaps), please drop me a line.

Thanks.

I'm researching cultural, economic, legal, and technical aspects of the
development of digital cash systems.  Let me know if you're interested.
