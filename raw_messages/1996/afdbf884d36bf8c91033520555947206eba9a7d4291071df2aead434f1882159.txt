I was trying to think what I would use a cycle market for.  The
only thing that I wait for more than a minute on currently is
compiling.  It might be quicker to ship my source code to a
remote compilation service with big pipes and big engines.
Considering that I've got a Pentium 120 on my desktop, though,
those would have be pretty big engines to make up for the time
lost in transmission of source and compiler output (both
compiler messages and object files.)


Just musing out loud.


Regards,

Bryce
