I was trying hard not to get into this thread as it is basically just 
one long flamewar that is getting out of control but I have to 
comment here:

There need be no reason for paranoia. I don`t call it paranoia, I 
call it constant vigilance, to demonize it is a statist position and 
tries to ostricise those who protect their privacy. 

Whether you do anything criminal or not is not the point. Indeed I 
would say that 90-95% of encryption usage is for perfectly legal 
purposes, and only about 0.1% of encrypted material is concerned with 
unethical acts rather than illegal acts. The point is you should 
retain the right to protect your privacy. 
Sure, it`s not illegal to  put forward anarchist arguments in mail today, 
but do you really want your company boss knowing about it? 
 I personally don`t work - I`m a student so it doesn`t matter to me, 
but whether it is right that your employement and political views should 
affect each other they do, so you should be able to protect yourself 
with technology...
