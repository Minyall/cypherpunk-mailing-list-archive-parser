>From the list of new features:

New Translation Services API: this is a programming interface that will make it
       easier for other software applications to simply plug into Eudora
Pro software,
       opening up a whole new world of uses for e-mail. For example,
natural language
       translation products that can translate a message from English to
some other
       language. Another example is a security application that could
automatically
       encrypt/decrypt your messages.

Interesting....
