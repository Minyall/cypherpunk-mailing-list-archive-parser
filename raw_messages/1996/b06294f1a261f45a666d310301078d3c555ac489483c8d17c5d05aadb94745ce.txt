Dear Receiver,

I am completing a brief survey of encryption technologies and the uses of
this technology in commercial enterprises. I have included three questions
below. After reviewing these short questions, I would appreciate greatly, if
you could provide your input (your responses) to me. My email address is
mjsus@ix.netcom.com - thanks in advance.

Best regards,

Mark
