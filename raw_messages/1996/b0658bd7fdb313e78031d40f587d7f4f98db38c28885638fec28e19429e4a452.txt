	Not passing untainted data to system is clearly a very good
idea.

	Less clear is how much other parsing should be done.  I like
extreme parsing (when its cheap; as Marcus Watts pointed out,
verifying remote hostnames & usernames can be expensive).  If you
don't strongly verify data on the way in, it can get to other places
not so careful about its contents.  This is why I chose to recommend
against accepting a wide variety of legit email address formats;
because they will be passed back to a database that assumes that the
addresses have been sanitized, and are in user@foo.net format, and not
treat them with the care they deserve.

	In an ideal world, programmers would be careful with the data
they get, but we don't live in an ideal world.  I choose to suggest
paranoia over inclusiveness, but am adding an appendix discussing
issues of mail addressing.
