	You really don't even need a client.  RFC822 defines a method
for bouncing mail through another server.  Just use

"user%final.dest.com@laxly.configured.org" 

as the address and laxly.configured.org will send it on to
user@final.dest.com.  

	Wonder what would happened if the sendmail in the
(Linux|NetBSD|your favourite i386 UNIX) distributions came cofigured
to not add Received: headers by default . . . .  Probably would make
diagnosing bounces hell, but it would make a lot of remailer-chain
tail ends.

	Anyone tried out whitehouse.gov to see if it's adding
Received:'s or not yet? :)
