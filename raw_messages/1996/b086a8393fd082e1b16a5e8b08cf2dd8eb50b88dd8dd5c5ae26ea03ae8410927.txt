That charge is every bit as foundless as the charges that you are
responsible for the "A Daily Warning Regarding Tim May" posts
of a while back, or the current round of remailed messages featuring
the sickeningly cutesy ASCII graphics at the bottom.

OTOH, if you've discovered a way to gain access to the remailers in
such a fashion as to prove those messages originated from Tim May,
please share.  (It just might be crypto-relevant, which would be
a small miracle on the cypherpunks list these days :)

> What a moron.
I'm not even touching that sentence.  It's just too tempting.
