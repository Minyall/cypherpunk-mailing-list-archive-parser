It's a hundred times easier to do tools for the IBM PC.  I make
utilities for the PC, and it would take no more than ten or fifteen
minutes to cook this one up.

But nobody answered my question:  Is there a shortcut way to do the
wipe, say, thirty times?  Ordinarily, I'd run the program thirty
times, which would consist of a data write followed by a flush,
which would take 30x amount of time.
