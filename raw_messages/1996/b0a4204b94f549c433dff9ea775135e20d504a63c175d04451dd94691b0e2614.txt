Not so:  I believe this figure is "parent or guardian".  Nearly all
kids are killed by stepfathers, and some by step mothers.  Murders of
children by their natural parents are extraordinarily rare.

A stepfather or stepmother has even more incentive, and 
considerably more opportunity, to murder her spouses children 
than she has to murder her spouses lover.

Nobody, least of all Castro, knows what the infant mortality
rate in Cuba is, since in Cuba, truth is a crime.
