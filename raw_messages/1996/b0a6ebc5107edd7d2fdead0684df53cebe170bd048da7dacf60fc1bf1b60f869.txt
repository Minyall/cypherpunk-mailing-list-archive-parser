In case you want to see, check it out at:
http://www.cnn.com/US/9607/27/pipe.bomb.explain/index.html

The picture that is on the page gives enough information for the average
person to go to the hardware store and buy the parts.....

Not only do they HAVE to point out that the information is available, but
also provide it.  *NOW* who is irresponsible?
