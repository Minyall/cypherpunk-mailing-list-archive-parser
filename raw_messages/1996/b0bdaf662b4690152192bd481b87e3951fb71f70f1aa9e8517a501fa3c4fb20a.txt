My estimate is that an FPGA-based machine that can do a single DES key
every four months (eight months to exhaust the whole keyspace) could
be built with off-the-shelf stuff for comfortably under $50k (plus
labor, plus software development costs).  A prototype board should cost
under $1000 and will help prove the concept and get a more accurate cost
estimate.  I expect to build such a prototype machine myself, and, if it
works as I expect, maybe the whole thing.
