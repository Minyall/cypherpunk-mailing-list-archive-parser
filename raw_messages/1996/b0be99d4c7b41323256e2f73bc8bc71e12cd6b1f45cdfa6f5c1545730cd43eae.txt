The restricted hardware implementation of KEA classification does not 
affect
us(people outside of the USA), and therefore is "unrestricted" to us in our 
minds, so please note, this request is only for those prepared to make it
avalaible, not for those who want to let us know that it is restricted.

You are asking if there;s someone around willing to commit espionage: 
releasing US Government Classified information?  You are asking to 
illegally obtain US Government Classified documents?
Ummmmm.... maybe you need to be a little more covert.

Or perhaps you are just simply painfully unaware of the difference between 
US crypto export restrictions (ITAR),
and laws pertaining to illegally obtaining and releasing Classified stuff.

In ether case you don't look so good.
