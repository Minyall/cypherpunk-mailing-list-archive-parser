Here in Austin, TX there is at least 1 IR camera located at the top of the
police building downtown (8th & IH-35). Many intersections have stoplight
synchronized cameras for getting license plates of red light runners (eg N.
Lamar & 51st). I know the output of the cameras is cabled off-pole (can see
the cables) to a NEMA style box. Don't know the format from there. It would
be no technological leap to buy cable channels and mux the pictures back to a
centralized site. This city is lousy with cable and fiber and the city
bought in from the get-go with a project called I-Net in the mid-80's.
