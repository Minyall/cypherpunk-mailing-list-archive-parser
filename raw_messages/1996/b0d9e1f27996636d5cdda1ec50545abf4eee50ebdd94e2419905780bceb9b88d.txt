     I disagree. The thing about exporting crypto code in book for is that 
it allows budding anarc^h^h^h^h^h cryptographers and crypto-programmers
specific examples of algorythm implementation. 

     It allows people outside the US to learn about and write good crypto.

     I, for one, don't care _where_ the code gets written, as long as I can
get it, and use it. France, Libya, Russia, or Albania, it doesn't matter
WHERE the keyboard is, with the internet it is all 30 or 40 hops away.

     Of course, that is the problem. Soon we will see the banning of 
IMPORT of strong crypto. 

     These people are either very stupid, or very bright. Either way, they
are not on friendly terms with freedom.
