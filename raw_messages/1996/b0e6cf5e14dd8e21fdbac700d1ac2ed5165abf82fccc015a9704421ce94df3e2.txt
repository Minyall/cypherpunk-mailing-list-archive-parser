I do not know how it is run by the JPG and GIF files, but I do know that the
code somehow loads into the image viewer itself..I am not sure how it works,
just that it is very destructive.. I had it destroy my 486 (using Lview Pro)
Oh, well, ENOUGH already.  if you have something to say that is related to
"image files cant execute a virus" please do not. there are too many spams
with those ideas out now
