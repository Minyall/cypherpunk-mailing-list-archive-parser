We aren't talking about IC masks here.  We are talking about
electrostatic charges which would instantly leak away if the
insulation around them were in the least bit compromised.

Such data wouldn't even survive the preparation for scanning
microscopy, much less the actual inspection process.

If you put something fragile inside a container which cannot be
breached without exposing the fragile thing to a destructive
environment, then the fragile thing is very unlikely to be
retrieved intact.  The specific parameters here will of course
vary with what technology is available, but I think live EEPROM
cells deep inside a multi-layer VLSI device are probably safe
from scrutiny for the lifetime of your average smart card.  Live
registers too, for that matter.

It is neither likely nor relevant.

The original scenario outlined how strong cryptography could be
used to authorize pay per view in a manner which was not
vulnerable to obvious hacking.  The successful use of strong
cryptography depends upon keeping certain key information secret,
and it was postulated as part of the scenario that this could be
done within a smart card.

An endless metaphysical quibble over whether God can create a
smart card he can't peek into does not serve to further
illuminate the cryptographic issues under discussion.
