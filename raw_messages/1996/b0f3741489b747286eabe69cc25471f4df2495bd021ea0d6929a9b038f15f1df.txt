  Not surprising at all.  Unbeknownst to most of the general populace, DMV
records (for the most part) are public records and are subject to Freedom of
Information requests.  AAMOF, I have an account with NYS/DMV which I use to
pull my clients' records when they are charged with DWI and/or other traffic
offenses.  I simply dial into DMV's [outdated] computer and pull the record.
It also came in handy on a personal level when I did not get my registration
card after buying my car and discovered that the dealer had not registered
my car.
