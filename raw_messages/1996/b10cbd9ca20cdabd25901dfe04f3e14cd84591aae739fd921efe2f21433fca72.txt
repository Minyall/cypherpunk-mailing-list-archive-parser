Hmm.  Maybe I am missing something.  Can someone please explain to me 
exactly WHAT relevance this has to the list?

People, I really DON'T CARE what your opinions are of Tim May, or anyone 
else for that matter!!!  Can you please stop acting like children in a 
playground name-calling contest and move on to something else?  Something 
of relevance to the list please?  If you absolutely *HAVE* to continue to 
act like children then take it to private email.  If for nothing else, then 
to save YOURSELVES from embarrassment.

</FLAME>

Thank you,

AlexF@iss.net

No deal, then. I suggest that for your next meeting you book Timmy May to
perform live sex acts on stage with his two cats, as Ray and Zach do the
Macarena circle-jerk.

> How about you and Tim sit down and *NICELY* talk about your differences?
