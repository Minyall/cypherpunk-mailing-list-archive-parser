	This is old news to those of us who understand it.  But this new
way of presenting the information is newsworthy.  Yes, it
over-simplifies the costs of collecting the transactions to force, but
the sound bite nature of reporting today requires that.  The government
is trying to give people warm fuzzies about the 'security' of 40-bit
encryption, and we, unfortunately, need to be spreading FUD about that.
This helps to do that.
