What employer?  What money?  Some Anguillan consulting bodyshop
sent some guys who did the work, and MegaCo paid the bodyshop.
The shop paid the guys some typical low wages, and also
bought computer services from another Anguillan company,
which deposited its profits in its bank account in Jersey.
Employee Jean D'Eau used the company Visa card for the account 
and took some business trips to San Diego, stayed in 
a hotel in Seattle, rented cars, ate out, bought computer toys at
47th St. Computer, paid for his Netcom account,
and got a Visa Cash advance in Jamaica.  No problem, mon.
