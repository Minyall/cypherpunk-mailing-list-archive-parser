Looks like advocating GAK(3-4?) hasn't hurt [and may helped]
Clinton. Dole is now an even-longer shot than before, and Perot
is back on the table at Ladbrokes, though William Hill is still
giving a better deal on him. Here are the latest odds from your
roving UK reporter. I'll try to develop a nym by next post, in
case you are interested in corresponding.

Coral, another national firm in the same business, expects to be
offering odds shortly. (+44-345-581527). Local bookmakers said to
be laying off (and putting on a hefty markup!). No explanation so
far for the lack of odds on longer-shot candidates Browne, Nader,
Hagelin, Phillips, etc. as these would all seem to be pure profit
to the oddsman, but I am not in the gambling business. Oh well.
