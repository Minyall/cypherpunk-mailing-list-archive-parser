I used acoustic couplers. My first modem was 110 bps, and when we got 300 bps,
it seems so fast in comparison... And then 1200 bps seemed even faster.
Acoustic couplers are still useful if you travel to places where there are
no rj11 connectors.
I recall that AT&T's argument against connecting any kind of user equipment to
their lines was that it might electrocute one of their workers.
I recall that recently in Germany one could not have a modem without some
kind of licence from DT - has it changed?
Personal computers, modems, and phone lines are ubiquitous in the U.S. and
most other developed countries. I suspect that modems may be rare enough in
China for the government to regulate their possession, using any silly excuse.
