1. Try codeprunks. Just e-mail majordomo@toad.com and say
subscribe coderpunks.

It's got some very interesting traffic, although it's pretty low volume.

2. Try the firewalls mailing list.

3. Try Usenet newsgroups alt.security,sci.crypt,etc. They have better
s/n ratio than this mailing list.

4. Try staying on the cypherpunks mailing list, but use procmail (or
equivalent) to filter out non-crypto-relevant rants, lies, and personal
attacks from *@got.net.
