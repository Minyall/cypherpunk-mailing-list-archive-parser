Other than the article I quote in its entirety in Part 8 of AP, an article 
from the Asahi Evening News (an english-language daily newspaper in Japan), no.

Unfortunately, it generally takes knowledge of at least computer networking, 
with a little knowledge of encryption and a vaguely passing familiarity with 
digital cash, to understand AP with enough detail to be useful.  But I'm 
constantly amazed at how many people really APPRECIATE the idea, and its 
ramifications.

If anything, I think AP would have allowed Indians to defend themselves, had 
they had access to it.

I don't think this is necessary:  They need not see that something is wrong 
to be deterred by the possibility of their agents getting killed doing 
something that they see as "non-coercive."

Yes, I think it would be a good idea to name the resulting society...
