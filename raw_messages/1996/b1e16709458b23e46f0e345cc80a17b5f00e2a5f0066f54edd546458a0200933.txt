Hey peachpit

The cartoon news broadcasts are part of the problem, not part of the 
solution.

I vote that San Francisco be given back to the Mexicans, until the 
current generation of nudnicks dies off. We'lll steal it back in 40 years, 
after there arises a generation hardened by life in the desert.
