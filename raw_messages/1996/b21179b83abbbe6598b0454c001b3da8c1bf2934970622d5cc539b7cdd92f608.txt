I don't know about Mexican law.  US persons are not supposed to export it
without government permission, but that's not very relevant.
Mexican law may or may not restrict import or use of crypto; better check
with someone local.  (I haven't heard anything saying that it _does_
restrict it - I just don't know either way.)

That part's easy - DES source is available on ftp.ox.ac.uk, and also on
ftp.dsi.unimi.it and ftp.funet.fi.  There may be specific triple-DES 
code there, but if not, triple DES is just
        Encrypt(Key1, Decrypt(Key2, Encrypt(Key3, Message)))
so you can easily write a subroutine to do that.
