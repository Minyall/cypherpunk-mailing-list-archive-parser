	Cyberpromotions VS AOL is about AOL returning to CyberPromotions
	E-Mail for whom there was no user on AOL.
	
	CyberPromotions had a number of "User Unknown" addresses in
	its list, as as a consequence, they bounced back to the 
	sender.    And like most bounce messages, the majority of them
	wre for individual address.

	MCI has announced that any domain that originates spam
	that travels through their system is subject to being
	cut off of their system.   They appear to be following
	through with that policy.  

	Sprint doesn't care what travels through their system.
