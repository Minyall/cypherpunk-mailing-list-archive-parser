I think this is yet another difference between Canada and the USofA, I
too have used $100 bills to pay for things quite often. The only time
there has been a problem is when the amount of the purchase is less than
$20.00 (and then its only because few stores keep that much change
around). 

Isn't the problem a result of the War On Drugs?
