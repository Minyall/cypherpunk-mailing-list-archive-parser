On the other hand, a virus is malicious speech, no? Sorta like libel or 
fraud. You said bad and untrue things to the victim's computer and the 
dimwitted OS believed it.

Also this is impersonation. You spoke words that led the OS to think that 
you were a legit user and, having its gained trust on false grounds, it lets
you do malicious things.

So is misrepresentation also constitutional? (Not like I need this 
answered ;-> )
