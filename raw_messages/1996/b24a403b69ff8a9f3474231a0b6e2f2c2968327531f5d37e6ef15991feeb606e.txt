No he does not.   I pointed this out to him in private mail after reading
the text of the "rant" at hotwired.  He says that he makes the distinction a
number of times throughout the article between "the person who logs in
internally" from hotwired " and the "cypherpunks mailing group."

I replied, "no, Jon, you did not...and I suspect that I am not the only
reader of your article who thinks so."  

I will be most interested in his reply.

Anyone care to wager that he won't post any sort of correction or addendum
in a later forum?
