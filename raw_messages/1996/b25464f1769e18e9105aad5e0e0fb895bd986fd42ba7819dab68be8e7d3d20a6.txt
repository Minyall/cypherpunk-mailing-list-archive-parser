I suppose this remark is targeted at me and Eric.
Yes, I am sensitive to the issue, but no, I don't think the threat of 
an American invasion particularly realistic.
At present, I worry more about the threat of (organized) crime than 
about the threat of government abuse, call it Dutch naivete if you 
want.

So much for politics. Can we get back to crypto?
