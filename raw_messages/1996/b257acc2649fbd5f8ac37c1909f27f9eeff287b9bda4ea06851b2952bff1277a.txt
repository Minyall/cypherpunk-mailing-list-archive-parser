But it's a state school.  All you have to do is sue.  Since academics are
gutless, they aren't that hard to face down.  So far, no one's really wanted
to face my mouth so they've left me alone once I made it clear that I was a
libertarian anarchist nut.

I feel sorry for Lewis though and wouldn't want him to do anything he wasn't
comfortable with.
