I wrote my comment before I saw your message. Does this make it clearer?

I agree that the fewer brackets have lessened the problem in the last
couple of years, but, then, inflation has not been an issue in the last
couple of years. (I seem to recall an explicit statement that the brackets
would not be adjusted upward, as the bill called for, because the inflation
rate had been below the threshold....).

In any case, my larger point has been about the effect over the last decade
or so, where significant numbers of people are now up at the 40-45%
marginal tax rate (Federal plus state, in many states).

The top marginal rate was increased. As I recall, from around 38% to around 42%.

(As the money runs out, as the so-called trust funds turn out to be empty,
as "entitlements" expand, and as more and more people are too
poorly-educated and -motivated to succeed in high-paying jobs, I expect the
top marginal rate to continue to be ratcheted upward. Until other forces
come into play, of course.)
