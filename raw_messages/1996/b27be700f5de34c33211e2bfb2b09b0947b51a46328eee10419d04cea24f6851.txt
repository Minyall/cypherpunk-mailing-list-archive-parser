This seems odd.  Logically (okay, I know logic doesn't work with the 
government) any smuggler is going to try to be as innocuous as possible.  
He's cut his hair, and shave, and probably wear a tie, etc.  Which means the 
government should pay more attention to....

Oh, never mind!

Some comedian 15 years or so ago (David Brenner, maybe?) had a joke which  went 
something like this:

"The odds of there being a bomb on a commercial airliner is one in a 
million.  The odds of there being TWO bombs on a commercial airliner are one 
in a _million_million_.  Therefore, if you are taking an airplane flight and 
want to feel REALLY safe....Take a bomb!"
