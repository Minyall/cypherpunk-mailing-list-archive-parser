I am currently writting a report into the controverys invovled with data 
encyption and have desided to target the current DES system, I have 
found pages on the internet explaining the new triple DES system 
thought i need more information on the current controversys involved 
with the current DES system i'm aware that the key is no longer long 
enough for data to be protected for any amount of time, thought i 
really need more information to draw conclutions, if there is anyone 
with information could they please forward it to me.
