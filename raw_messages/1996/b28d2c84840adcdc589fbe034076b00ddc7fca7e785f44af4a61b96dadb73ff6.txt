Gee - Is it April 1st again?  Time to troll the newbies in all
my favorite newsgroups. 

On a more serious note, does anyone know what is happening 
with Arjen Lenstra and RSA-130?  Last I heard back in late 
December, FAFNER, the magic WWW sieving dragon, had collected 
more than enough relations from participants to yield a 
factorization.  Surely they have not spent an additional four 
months crunching the big boolean matrix at CWI.

This is an important experiment, since it will yield a robust
estimate of the time required to break 512 bit PGP keys using
the best available factoring software.
