When I think about Clipper.
In my personal opinion, Clinton is afraid of unrestricted crypto because
when he thinks about all the things he would have done with it when he was
(is?) a hippie radical, he shuders, then, he makes the error of assuming
that everyone in the U.S. of A. has the same low morals that he has shown.
He feels that he must protect us from the monsters, yet, he feels that we
are all potential monsters.
And when I think about the assualt rifle ban, I think the same thing.
In my personal opinion.  None of this should be taken for anything but my
opinion.
Oh the nightmares you must have Mr. President.  I am grateful that I don't
see the world through your eyes.
