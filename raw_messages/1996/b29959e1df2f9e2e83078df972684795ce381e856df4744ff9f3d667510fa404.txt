    I can point to one circumstance which calls your belief into question:

    Prohibition.

    Alcohol was widely seen as a problem by people who didn't use it, and 
social pressures made many people who did use it vote to get rid of it. 

    Other people promptly got rich selling it to those who still wanted it.

    Alcohol is a little more obvious and harder to hide than crypto.
