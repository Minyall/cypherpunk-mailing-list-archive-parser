	Most merchant agreements prohibit asking for more ID beyond
the card.

	As to the issue of 'do people look at photos?' they don't even
look at signatures.  I know because I carried a card around for 2
years before anyone noticed that I hadn't signed it.  The person who
noticed asked me to sign the card (without showing other ID!) before
handing over the computer I was buying.

cpunk relevance?  Most security that relies on people being awake is
broken.  Security that relies on people with no financial interest in
a transactions security is broken.  Studying how security breaks today
is a good idea.
