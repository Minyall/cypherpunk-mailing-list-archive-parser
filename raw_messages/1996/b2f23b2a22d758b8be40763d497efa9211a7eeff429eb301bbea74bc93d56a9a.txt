Specter wrote to Leahy because the two of them get along well.  (Recall
the Clipper hearings for example) and because Specter and Burns do not.

It may also explain things to realize that Leahy wrote the circular asking
for other Senators to support the bill.  Specter is probably responding to
that.

Leahy's office has been the point unit for crypto initatives because their
legal staff are the only ones who really understand what is going on or
are able to answer questions intelligently.

Be careful with your assumptions and take replies to e-mail please.
