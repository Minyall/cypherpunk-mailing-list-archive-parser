Absolutely, 

As much as I might hate Vulis`s stuff (and believe me I do). It is no 
justification for removing him from the list. We are supposed to be a 
platform for the discussion of cryptography but as the list has 
become more and more a libertarian platform for ideas and discussion 
we cannot really justify censorship in this way. I very much wish I 
could say that I agreed with John but I cannot do so with a clear 
conscience.
