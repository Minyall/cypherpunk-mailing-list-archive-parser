While there is not an "out of the box" version of Mixmaster like this, it
would be easy to do. The UNIX POP clients I have seen just dump the mail
into a mbox formated file. A simple script could be written to yank out the
messages one at a time, and feed them to Mixmaster (or mail-in or
whatever). In fact, the more recent versions of Mixmaster should be able to
swallow the file whole, pulling out the mixmaster messages itself. This
modification was made to support "subway" remailers, which want to send a
fixed number of messages (in one email) each time period.
