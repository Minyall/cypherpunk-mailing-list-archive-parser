	I'd guess it's some sort of dialin (possibly via tymnet or some such).
In that case, you'd simply have your remailer on your system at home, calling
the system up at some (probably randomly determined) time and downloading the
incoming mail and uploading whatever outgoing mail that (given latency) you
wanted to go out at that point. (Any on-encrypted email, such as their ads,
you'd be able to filter out very easily). You could even potentially run it
off of a portable computer. For unattended running, the hardware RNG would be
best, of course.
