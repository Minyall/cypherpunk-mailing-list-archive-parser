I don't get it.  Help me out here-- how can this possibly be constitutional?

I'm reading the Fourth Amendment to our honored Constitution of the United
States, which proclaims

	[...]
	no warrants shall issue,
	but upon probable cause,
	supported by oath or affirmation,
	and *particularly describing the place to be searched*,
	and the persons or things to be seized.

Are we just to strike out that emphasized phrase?  What's going on here?
Someone tell me I'm not just having a bad nightmare.

Apologies if these are silly questions,

P.S.  Do police really need a search warrant to wiretap cellular phones?
