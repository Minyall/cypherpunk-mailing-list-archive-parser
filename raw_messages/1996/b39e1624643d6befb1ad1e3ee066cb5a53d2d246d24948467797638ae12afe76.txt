One thing I don't understand, why do you trust signed code? 

So you know the code is signed by Jack the Ripper.  so what?  How do 
decide what you want the code to be allowed to do?   I think there's 
nothing for it but a kind of limited capabilities model built on top
of the authentication mechanism.
