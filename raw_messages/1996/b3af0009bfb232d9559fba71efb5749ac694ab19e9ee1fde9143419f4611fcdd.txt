PS: Over margaritas and enchiladas tonight, I was talking with one of the
crypto-ITAR enforcers from State. I mentioned that I'd be going out of the
country soon and taking my PowerBook laptop. Quite sincerely, he urged me
to keep a record of when I left and when I returned for five years. You
see, I have domestic Netscape Navigator on it. Wacky stuff.
