In theory, yes; with digitized sound, anything is "possible."

However, in practice, it isn't all that different from altering digitized 
photos. In theory, a "perfect" false image could be produced, but in 
practice, subtle errors are detectable. Once you've detected that 
alteration has occurred, the information is suspect, and the 
perpetrator has added clues as to his/her identity.
