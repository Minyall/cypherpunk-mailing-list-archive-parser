This is obviously just more of dimitri's bullshit. 
The only thing that should have been taken seriously about the
post is that it illustrated well why he has no fucking place
on this list. You can't argue with mean spirited stupidity,
and I wouldn't even try if I were you, it's a waste of packets,
much like dimitri's presence on the net.
