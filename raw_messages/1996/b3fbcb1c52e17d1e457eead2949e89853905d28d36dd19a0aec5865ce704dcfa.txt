This has come up several times. As I recall, some guys at a Navy research
lab (San Diego?) were claiming to have a "chaotic encryption" system.

As to using chaotic systems for PRNGs or RNGs, the "turbulent flow over
disk drive platters causes speed variations" idea, described recently, is
of course an example of nominally using a chaotic/turbulent system to
defeat predictability.

I have at least a couple of paragraphs on chaos and crypto in my Cyphernomicon.
