I'm looking for 19 other people interested in "Secret Power" (Craig
Potton Publishers has indicated that there is a discount for 20 or
more copies).  If you are in the San Francisco Bay Area, please
contact me by phone or E-Mail.

As usual with these things, I would prefer to see you in person and
have a cash or check committed.  Also remember that the shipping is
quite steep (for the faster methods) ...  The US price uses US$0.71
per NZ$1.00.

                                                 US PRICE
1 Copy
    NZ$27.50 per copy                            US$19.53
    NZ$19.00 for shipping via air                US$13.49
    NZ$12.50 for shipping via economy            US$ 8.88
    NZ$10.00 for shipping via sea                US$ 7.10
