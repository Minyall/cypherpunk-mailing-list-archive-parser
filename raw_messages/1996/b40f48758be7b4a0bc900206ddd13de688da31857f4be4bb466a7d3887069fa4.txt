Ah, but the issue of who _signs_ a document is fundamentally and
importantly different from the issue of who _wrote_ the document.

If I have allegedly _signed_ a contract, who cares if exhaustive analysis
reveals it to have been _written_ with 77.93% probability by Irving J.
Shlublutz, CPA for State Farm Insurance Compance?

The issue with digital signatures is who _signed_ a document, not who
_wrote_ a document.
