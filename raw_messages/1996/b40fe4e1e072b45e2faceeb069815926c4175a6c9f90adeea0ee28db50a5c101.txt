Problem is that chaining interferes with this.

A better way is to skin certain types of newsgroup headers over a period of 
time (a week or two) for messages sent from remailers.  It will also give
some stats as to what kinds of topics to people prefer anonymity.

It's also rather interesting to see how much remailer traffic is used for
posting rants/erotica/politically unpopular deas/heresies/criticism/
whistleblowing [I put these in the same category because they are related] 
and how many use them for the sake of just being anonymous [a regular 
participant who signs with an anonymous id/pgp-key but isn't necessarally 
posting something that requires anonyimity... hard to distinguish from first 
one though].
