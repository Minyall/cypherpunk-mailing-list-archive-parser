Yes. We use both terms, and perhaps others as well. As to the Northern
Aggression, the avalanche of propaganda after the war (and continuing
with Ken Burns' disonfo on PBS TV) was intended to "persuade" the public
that the South started the War, having "attacked" Ft. Sumter (their own
property), and having had the temerity to withdraw from the Union (their
right as free states), not to mention holding slaves (an act not made
"illegal" until 1862, i.e., a year after the war started).
