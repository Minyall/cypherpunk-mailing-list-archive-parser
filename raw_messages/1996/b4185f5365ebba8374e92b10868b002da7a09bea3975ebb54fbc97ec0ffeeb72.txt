Latest version of NOISE.SYS has been uploaded to ftp.funet.fi,
and a few other sites, as "noise04.zip".

It is a random-noise device driver for DOS, which samples fast
timings between keystrokes, disk access, clock-drift, and even mouse
movement or audio card and hashes with SHA-2 algorithm to generate
some good-quality randomness.

Note changes since previous version: this one defines two devices akin
to random.c patch for Linux, /dev/random and /dev/urandom.  The latter
will output as many bytes as are requested, while the first will only
output as many bits as are estimated to be in the pool.

Source included. 386 req'd.

Take care,

(Still waiting on comments or suggestions about earlier versions...)
