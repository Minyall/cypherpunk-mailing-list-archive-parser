It's even sillier over here in Europe, and the paperwork is probably
a couple of order of magnitudes more expensive (due to the translations
required).  Quick example (but old figures) - the EU spends $10 million
a year to campaign against smoking, and then spends $1200 million a year
to subsidise tobacco production.

Thought for the day - Think about what the 'S' in IRS stands for.
