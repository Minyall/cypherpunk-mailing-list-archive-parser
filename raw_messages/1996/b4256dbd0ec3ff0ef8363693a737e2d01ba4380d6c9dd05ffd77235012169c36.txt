They way it will be forbidden is by outlawing the execution of the
algorithms.  The algorithms (the secure ones anyway) are well defined
as is executing them.  The legal system has dealt with greater
ambiguities than this.

An analogy to the drug laws might be useful.  We don't outlaw all drugs
that cause you to have weird visions and to act strangely.  That would
be hard to define and would cover a number of legal drugs.

Instead, the specific chemicals are forbidden as they are discovered.
