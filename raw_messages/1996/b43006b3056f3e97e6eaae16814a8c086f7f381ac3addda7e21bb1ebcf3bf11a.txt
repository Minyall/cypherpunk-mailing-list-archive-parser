Yes...but...   How can the NSA serve two masters?  If the NSA has the 
American public's best interests at heart, then it should have revealed the 
flaw if it knew of it. (Otherwise, it can't be trusted...)  

If it did not, then it likewise should admit to this to show that their 
trustworthiness and reliability isn't particularly high and we shouldn't 
trust their opinions on Clipper etc.

It is at least arguable that the NSA might have a vested interest in 
allowing an enemy to continue to use a flawed encryption system, as in 
Enigma.   However, MD5 produces what ought to be secure hashes, right? A 
flaw in MD5 allows the person knowing the secret flaw to fake a file that 
produces a similar hash.  What interest could the NSA possibly have in 
allowing such faked files to be produced?  Is this part of the NSA's job 
description?

Yes, it is.  But I'd like to think that the NSA isn't acting as if WE are 
the "enemy."
