Return reply envelopes can be alot of fun.  

In "A Handful of Zen" by Camden Benares (a book on Discordian Zen) he
suggests collecting them.  When you have something sufficiently weird for a
mass mailing, you just fill a bunch of them and drop them in the local
public posting bin.

An interesting way to releave the daily stress...
