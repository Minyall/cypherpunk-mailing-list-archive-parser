That was my meaning: either 1 or 2 filesystems, at the users option,
and for the file system to look the same to anyone not holding the 2nd
key (if there is one) whether or not there is a 2nd hidden file system.

More subtle than straight nuke the data, but still they'll have the
backup, and the code to reverse-engineer.

Another idea might be to have secret shared keys to your encrypted fs,
so you can't access your file system without your friend(s)
co-operation.  That would give your friends an opportunity to nuke
their share of the key before they got their dawn raid.  You could
automate the nuking, with some pre-arranged policy for key destruction
(eg the computers could bounce messages off each other, and if this
stops the key-portion gets nuked).

However, the opposition is already one step ahead: simultaneous dawn
raids were the fad during operation Sun-Devil, just in case of such
schemes I presume.
