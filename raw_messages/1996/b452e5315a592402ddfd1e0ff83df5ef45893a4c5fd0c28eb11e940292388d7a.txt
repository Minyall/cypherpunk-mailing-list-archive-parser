welllllllll all, It really depends on what you do.
Hacking IRC can be determined as hacking OPS in a channel... which I can see
NO legal frontier in which it crosses. Its more of a battle of wits.
Something as simple as finding a server disconnected from the net....making
that channel there...and waiting for it to rejoin the net was used to hack
OPS on a channel. Now.. that can be something done purely by accident..not
realizing the server isnt fully hooked up at the time.
