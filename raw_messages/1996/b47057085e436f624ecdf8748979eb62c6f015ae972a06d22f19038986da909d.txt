[Various holocaust revisionist crap deleted]

Don't worry, it will very soon become impossible to block access to
anything on the Web. I have a long record of opposing the holocaust
revisionists. I have never attempted to prevent them putting their
views forward. It is better to expose them and their lies. Winston
Smith, Faust and co disappeared after we proved that they were the 
creations of one Dan Gannon. Attempting to cut off access and the 
conceit that the truth needs to be legislated merely plays into the 
facists hands.

Any attempt to cut of service can be circumvented simply by connecting
to a cache. Hensa in the UK (www.hensa.co.uk ?) run a very large one.
There are also many caches run by US universities although for obvious
reasons it is preferable for the French to go through a European one.

And please, no more anonymous posts trying to persuade us that there
is anything worth reading at these hate sites. The literary style
is familiar enough that nobody should be fooled. 


	Phill
