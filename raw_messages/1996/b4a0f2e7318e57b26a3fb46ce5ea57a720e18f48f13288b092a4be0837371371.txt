Since the Java stuff that I'm running around here either (a) is from
netscape, which jams a little line saying, "Untrusted Java Applet" at the
bottom of each window a Java applet creates or (b) is run by me, by hand,
from the command line, using either the interpreter or the appletviewer...
I don't think this is much of a threat. I see much more difficulties with
javascript.
