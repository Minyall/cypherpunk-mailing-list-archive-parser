So I pulled up the Web site to see what sort of reward they
offered to the successful cracker.  Under the heading 
"Attention `Hackers'" they said if you crack their 
unbreakable SafE Mail code, you get 5 free copies of ...
SafE Mail!  Oh, that's a really primo prize, broken 
software.  Duh.

Since cracking their encryption is IMPOSSIBLE, I suggest 
they make the stakes interesting--$100,000, or hell, a cool
million.  After all, it's unbreakable.  It's not like they
will have to pay up or anything.
