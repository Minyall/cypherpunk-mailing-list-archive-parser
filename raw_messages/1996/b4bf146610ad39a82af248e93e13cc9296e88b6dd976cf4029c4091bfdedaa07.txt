This evening I heard a story on Internet censorship on All Things
Considered.  They said that Compuserve was close to deploying technology to
keep only Germans out of the 200 news groups.  (Compuserve and the Germans
still disagree about where the list came from.)

They also interviewed Denise Curaso (sp?) who provided some reality about
the how censorship could quickly move to political views that certain
countries don't like and how a Compuserve user could easly bypass
Compuserve censorship.

The story ended with the comment that in the past, many net people have
said that since the Internet was designed to survive atomic war, the net
would just bypass around censorship, but between the Germans and Exon,
fewer of them are saying it now.
