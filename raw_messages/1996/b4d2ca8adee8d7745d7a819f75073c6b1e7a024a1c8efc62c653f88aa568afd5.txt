You can do that safely without making it dangerous for your machine. I
know how I would build a restricted execution environment for such
markets. However, Java is 1) too slow, since if you are selling
rendering cycles or such you don't want to be running an interpreter,
2) insufficently safe, and 3) paradoxically, insufficiently powerful
for the sort of code you would want to run in such an environment.
