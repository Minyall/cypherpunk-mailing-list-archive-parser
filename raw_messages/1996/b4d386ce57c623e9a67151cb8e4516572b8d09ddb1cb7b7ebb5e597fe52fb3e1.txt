I think this problem can be solved by blind signing the tokens.  A user
generates a random number, multiplies it by the blinding factor, then sending
it to a token server which would append a timestamp and sign the blinded
token.  All signature requests should be signed with a PGP key.  The server
response would be encrypted with the user's public key.  A person's PGP key
would be sent along with the subscription request and then saved by the list
software.

The token would be included in a user's list submission, removed, and saved by
the list software to detect any duplicates.  The server would issue a limited
number of tokens to each public key registered with it.  If two signed requests
come from the same email address in the same day signed with different keys,
only the tokens in the first request should be signed.

The only problem with this scheme is the inconvenience of having to register
a public key with the server before posting.  Someone with many different email
addresses could generate a public key for each address to get more tokens.  The
only way to prevent this is to control list subscriptions.
