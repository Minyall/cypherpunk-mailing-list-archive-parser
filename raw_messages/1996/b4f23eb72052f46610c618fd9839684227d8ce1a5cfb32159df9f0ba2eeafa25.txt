Hi all,

I had the strangest dream this morning. I drempt that I had 
forgotton to vote!  

As I was heading for the poles, I saw Dole heading into the
poles wearing a man's coal grey/black suit and womens' black high 
heal shoes. It was pretty bazzar.... I wonder what it means?
It was pretty scary...

Turns out I was too late getting to the poles to vote and I awoke
in a panic thinking I had missed it all. I turned to my sleeping
babe and after I awoke him, he assured me that voting happens 
tomorrow.

Whew!
