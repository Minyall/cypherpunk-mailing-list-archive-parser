Of course, one area where the doctor will continue to hold a patient's
records, instead of the patient, due to the nature of the current system:

Prescription medication.

Of course, with the really big problems with this stuff, drug
interactions, there's still no system for a doctor to find out what you're
on thanks to another doctor. Which is why it's very important to always
use the same pharmacist.
