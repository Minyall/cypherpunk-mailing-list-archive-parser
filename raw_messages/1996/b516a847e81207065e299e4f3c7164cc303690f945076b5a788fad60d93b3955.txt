I'd like to hear Tim, too, in this Big Apple. RealAudio, perhaps. 
 
 
Tim's views are far more substantial and worthwhile than those play-it-safe
Pro-Code dronings. 
 
 
And his pith should go out far and wide, around the world, not only out
there on its edge. 
 
 
Vinnie, Robert, All Appledom, do your global duty, don't miss this chance
to leapfrog the small-beans promoters of the crypto industry. 
 
 
What would you offer to set off Tim's simmering crypto-anarcho-volcano,
make it heard round the planet?
