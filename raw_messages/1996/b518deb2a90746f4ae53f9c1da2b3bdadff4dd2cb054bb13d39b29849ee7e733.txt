Last semester, I taught a graduate course called "Cryptography and
Computer Security" at NYU. I have written up a summary of the 
experience. You can find it at

ftp:    thumper.bellcore.com  in /pub/rubin/fall95.ps or fall95.ps.Z
web:    ftp://thumper.bellcore.com/pub/rubin/fall95.ps.Z

and there is a link to it from my home page:

I will be teaching the same class next semester at NYU, and there are
plans for a sequel next fall.
