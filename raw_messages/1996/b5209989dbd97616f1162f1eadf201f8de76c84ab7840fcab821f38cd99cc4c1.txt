     It is becoming obvious to anyone with two brain cells to rub
together that RC4 and now RC2 have been deliberately released by RSA
Data Security.

     Consider that neither of these ciphers would be used in any
freely available software systems if licensing fees had to be paid to
RSA.  Now that the algorithms are public knowledge, many developers
will include them in their products if for no other reason than to
tweak RSA's nose.

     The warning notices and claims of dire consequences from RSA
are clearly designed to spread FUD among deep-pocket users of such
products.  Rather than risk any legal exposure, medium and large
companies who wish to use products containing RC2 and RC4 will obtain
licenses from RSA.  RSA has traded the entirety of a small pie for a
significant portion of a much larger pastry.

     Quite brilliant marketing when one thinks about it.
