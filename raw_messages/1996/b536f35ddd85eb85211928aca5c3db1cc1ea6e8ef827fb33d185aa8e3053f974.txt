Before I do it myself, thought I'd check if anyone has updated Peter
Gutmann's CRYPT.BAS file for CryptLib (if not, I'll forward it to Peter
when I get finished).  The current version is fairly out of date, and I'm
looking for a library to use with Visual Basic to implement some secure
hashing and 3DES.  

Thanks in advance...
