It became this, yes, but the original concept (at least according to the

I forgot to mention that welfare and free health insurance plans do not
SPREAD risk either.  They concentrate the risk of the entitlement eligable
population including those able to pay down onto the smaller group of only
those who earn an income substantial enough to contribute.

Those who can pay in are effectively burdening the risk of those who
cannot as well as themselves, instead of just themselves.
