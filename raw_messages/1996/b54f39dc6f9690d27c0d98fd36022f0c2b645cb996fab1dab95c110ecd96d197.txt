You are right that this only works in instances where the customer just
needs a little prodding to get the upgrade and not in instances where
the customer might put up with significant inconvenience to avoid it.

However, why not use "beacons"?  The clock could have a built-in timer
that needs to be reset once a month from an authenticated source.  This
assumes the presence of net connectivity, but that's not a terrible
assumption.
