And thus it begins... I think it's a bad idea to provoke the TLAs like this,
but I suppose it's inevitable. (But doesn't anyone use Macs or Suns?)

Fight for the spin: "Since Netscape isn't allowed to sell its software
overseas, people are going to pirate it, thereby losing the US o' A both
technology and money."

Why would you want one when the source for Apache-SSL is available? Besides,
it's a Serious Copyright Violation, said with minimal irony. This whole
