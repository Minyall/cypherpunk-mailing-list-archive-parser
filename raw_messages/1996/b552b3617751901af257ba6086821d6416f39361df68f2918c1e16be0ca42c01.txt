Don't take this as legal advice, since I'm neither a lawyer nor French, but
if you're a French citizen, there may be more restrictions concerning
"utilisation du systemes cryptographique" placed on you by your _own_
government - no matter what your location is worldwide - than the US' ITAR
regs (governing "export" of crypto restrictions will place on you when
working here in the US).

Especially if you're _working_ in the US, (depending on the exact length
and specifications listed on your work permit itself - see the nearest
embassy*) I believe you're allowed to _use_ crypto systems _here_ (it might
even help if it was part of your work), as long as you are supervised in
some way and do not take them away with you (clearly a serious violation
under ITAR). Someone please correct me if I err here.

You - or better yet, your company's legal representative - should contact
the U.S. Department of State, Office of Defense Trade Controls (ODTC) at
<URL:pgpfone:/+1.703.875.6644>**. At the _very_ least, you enjoy an
slightly overlong yet entertaining bureaucratic journey.

Bon Voyage! ;)
