Tim Maysits at his terminal dressed in five-inch stiletto heels, fishnet 
stockings, a gold-lame mini-skirt, a purple halter with girdle underneath to 
keep in his flabby gut, A Fredericks of Hollywood padded bra also underneath 
the halter, a cheap Naomi Sims pink afro wig, waiting to yank his crank 
whenever a black man responds to one of his posts.
