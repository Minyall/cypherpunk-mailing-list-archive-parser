The moderator would not prosecuted if the moderator & host machine wasn't 
located in USA and not a USA citizen and if the post was not from USA. 

The poster may be a target if located inside USA or a USA citizen. The 
moderator might be prosecuted if the post originated inside USA or went 
through USA to be exported outside USA & Canada.

Welcome to the rest of the world.
