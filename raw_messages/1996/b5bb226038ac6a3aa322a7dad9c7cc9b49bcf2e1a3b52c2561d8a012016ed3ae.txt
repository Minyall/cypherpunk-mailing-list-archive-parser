Good question.


Speaking unofficially and off-the-top-of-my head, I estimate the
marginal cost to be "really really small".


I mean, if you really want to know the marginal cost of
something you have to determine which costs are considered
marginal and which aren't.  Is Frank O. Trotter's salary a
marginal cost?  I mean, if everyone in the world started sending
each other Mark Twain Bank pennies, MTB might have to hire a
second or third banker-type like Frank to keep an eye on things.


But disregarding such speculation, what is the marginal cost of a
kilobyte or so on Mark Twain Bank's internet connection?  Or
(snicker) a handful of CPU cycles on bank.marktwain.com?


The biggest "marginal cost" is probably the salaries of the
employees who keep those two things running.
