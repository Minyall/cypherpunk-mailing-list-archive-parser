100 dead skunks in exchange for ONE is exactly what this discussion
is all about.  You CypherWIMPS just love over-kill.  EmailRobot sent
ONE message to EACH address.  Are you guys so unskilled in arithmetic
to understand the difference between 1 and 100?

One message is NOT spam, 100 messages to a single box IS spamming.
