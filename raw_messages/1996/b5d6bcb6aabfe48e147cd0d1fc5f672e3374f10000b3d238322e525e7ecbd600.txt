Let's not confuse strict regulation with arbitrary and capricious plug-pulling.

If the rules say something like, "Whoever incites an ethnic flame war*, or
a religious flame war**, or posts long diatribes that have nothing to do with
cryptoanarchy***, shall be kicked off the mailing list", then they don't seem
to apply to everyone who violates them.

* E.g. by calling multiple posters "crazy Russians"

** E.g. by attacking the poor hapless mormons :-)

*** E.g. by ranting about third-world debt
