Off the top of my head, the figure I have usually heard quoted puts RSA at
about 100 times slower than your average symmetric key algorithm. So ignoring
key setup, I would expect an extra factor of 100 in the brute forcing time
for RSA over IDEA. 

I don't believe it's worth spending much time worrying about your RSA
key size. If you pick some decent size (1-2k), it's likely that RSA itself
will have been broken, or your key compromised by some other means, before
any direct brute force attack will succeed.
