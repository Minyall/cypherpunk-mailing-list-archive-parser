	Browsers are big, complex bits of technology.  If you built an
applet verifier that ran on a firewall, it could be substantially
smaller than the 6mb of Netscape3.0 (SunOS).  Smaller code is easier
to verify, and less likely to contain bugs.  In addition, you could be
more confident that your policy goals are met in controlling what
applets enter the perimiter that the firewall deliniates.

	Deploying new browsers to every desktop can be challenging.
If you have a java-gw, there is a lesser need for new browsers
everywhere in response to bugs.  Also, you may be able to get the
source to a verifier, but not to the browser.

	Doing a good job in real time would be very tough.  We need
signed capacity requirements, and an organization that will stand by
its certifications of security.  I have at least one client who would
pay for certified ok applets.  (Not certified origin, certified
non-malicious, for various values of non-malicious).
