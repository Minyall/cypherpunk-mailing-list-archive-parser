I have to say I agree with this. I know more than a few kids in my
neighborhood who are more than smart enough, if they got over their
technophobia and a little innumeracy. They could make more than the average
drug dealer's lookout if they were to learn to code.

Unfortunately, all the "trade" schools around here teach you to replace
boards rather than hack code.
