Hi there,

Just to add gasoline on the burning flame. 
It doesn't happen just now. It is always like that. 
The attention on Indonesia issues by people (western media) is too
much focus on East Timor and they forget that there are much more
severe violations happening. 
I just hope that this example will open people's eyes that
Indonesian's problems are not only East Timor affairs but much more.
Arrest of one mailing list's maintainer is common, you would be
surprised how many people actually 'disappear' because of this.

Regards,
Sent.
