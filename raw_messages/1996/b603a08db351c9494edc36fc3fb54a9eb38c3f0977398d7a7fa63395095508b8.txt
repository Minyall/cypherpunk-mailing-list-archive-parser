I think you or someone here recently remarked  the U.S.Government has the only
_real_ capability to wage world  terrorism on the internet, and after I read
Frank Sowa's  feb. Boardwatch article I'm beginning to wonder.   I suppose
quoting the article at length will be at least as good as some of the other
traffic around here... just in case anybody missed it, Sowa reviewed 35 federal
reports, and quotes Page saying "As a result, we've had no choice but to create
an offensive capability in cyberspace.  I can't discuss it ... However, you'd
feel good and feel safe and secure if you knew about it"  (yeah, really)
Further, Sowa reports the Natl Defense U is forming an elite Information Corps,
'a F0rce whose scope is to fight the battles of "Information Warfare from the
Pentagon war room to the home PCs" according to DOD' (p90-92).... And further,
RAND corp is using an "all out cyberwar simulator at their research center in
Santa Monica" and... oh well,  the whole article is just crammed with stuff!
Yikes!   I would sure like to know what people think about it. thanks.
