However, Helms is a politician and he's supposed to be on his best behavior. 
 (What Helms' "best behavior" is, is certainly debateable.)

Bored?  You're bored?  Maybe I'm going to have to figure out something to 
spice it up, huh?  By the time everybody is as bored as you are today, then 
I will have won.

"naive"?  In what way?

Technically, it wasn't derived from anything directly, or for that matter 
even indirectly.  However, since there's nothing new under the sun, 
similarities exist...with your material as well.  Consider this a bow to 
you, I suppose.

Even so, given how much noise we've been hearing out of DC on the subject 
of the Internet, digital cash, and good encryption, I'd say SOMEBODY is 
getting a bit worried.  I haven't exactly been keeping this stuff a secret:  
What do you think their reaction has been, so far?  When those 
government-types start considering various scary scenarios, what do you 
think they are imagining?

Not quite yet, anyway.  I'm very disappointed to have waited over a year for 
some slick lawyer to show me how I'd be violating some law or another to do so.

>nor is he calling for the killing of any particilar persons.

I generally don't feel the need to name specific people.  I'm sure each 
reader has his own pet list to fall back on.

Wait a year or two.
