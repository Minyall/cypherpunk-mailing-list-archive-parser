Did anyone hear about a device called LC-1? It is a voice encryption
hardware that uses IDEA. I've found info about it on a Germany server. Tried
to contact two guys that developed the thing and got no answer. One of the
guys' names is Kurt (khuwig@cs.uni-sb.de) and the other one is Marko
(maba@stud.uni-sb.de).

Any comments would be appreciated.

TIA.

TT.
