Today at lunchtime in the Eastern Time Zone, the radio show Real 
Computing with John C. Dvorak had John Gilmore as a guest, and Dvorak 
asked several questions about the US federal case against Phil 
Zimmerman.  Surprising how little Dvorak knew about the issues, 
especially considering he's a pretty bright guy and up-to-speed with the 
technology.  He asked JG [paraphrasing] - now that the government case 
against PRZ is dropped, what else is the Electronic Frontier Foundation 
(of which Gilmore is a board member) taking up as its next 'cause'?

The implication was that the 'crypto thing' is settled and we can move on
to other issues.

This may have been a rebroadcast of an earlier show, I don't know.

Gilmore was referred to by Dvorak as the head of the cypherpunks a few 
times.
