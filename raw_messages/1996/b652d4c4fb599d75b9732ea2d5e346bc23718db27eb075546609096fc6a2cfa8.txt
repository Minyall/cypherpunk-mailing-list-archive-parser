This is the first posting I have seen (someone unSCUMscribed me a
few days ago) which addresses the need for having defences in
place against spamming attacks.

  The fact is, the InterNet is a global neighborhood, and everyone
will be affected by the security or non-security of their neighbors.
Since the Web is currently seen as the new 'gold rush', every Tom,
Dick and Harry who wants to capitalize on it will be putting up
web sites, with their concern being focused much more on increasing 
their piece of the pie, than on being good neighbors.
  So sports lists are going to make it easy-as-pie for 10,000 Laker's
fans named Bubba to subscribe to their list and, as a result, make it
also as easy-as-pie for people to take advantage of their come-one-
come-all policy in order to engage in the sport of spamming. 

  While there are many good list operators who take reasonable
precautions against abuse of their system, they are often still
left open to abuse coming from the system of less concerned
list operators.
  It would seem to me that part of the solution would be to have
in place a monitoring system which would reflect a sudden increase
in email coming in from new (or current) sources.  Then the source
of any excessive increase could be put on 'hold' until the system
operator has a chance to check on the validity of the reason behind
the sudden increase.
  (20 messages from Bubba is an inconvenience, but 500 messages
is a royal pain-in-the-ass)

  As for 'mailbots', I think that any solutions to the potential
abuse will only be a 'stopping action', at best.
  My view is that the machines are starting to make their play
towards taking over, and that we will eventually be doomed to be
their slaves, and not the other way around.
