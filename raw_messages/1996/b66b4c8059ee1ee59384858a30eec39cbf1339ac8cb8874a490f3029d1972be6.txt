I've been issuing NoCeM notices for off-topic traffic in several Usenet
newsgroups. (Not in the last few days because we get the Usenet feed from
panix.com, who's been hit with the SYN attack and stopped sending us news.)
Look at the existing technology - it works pretty well. All you need is
more people issuing notices about what's worth reading and what's not in
more newsgroups. Then you can pick and choose whose notices to honor.
