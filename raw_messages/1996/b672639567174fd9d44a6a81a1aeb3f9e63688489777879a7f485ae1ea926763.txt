There must be something wrong with bank people all over the world. One
local bank that now is offering payments using their WWW server here in
Estonia, and every time I publicly announce some security flaw in their
system, I have to convince them this bug really exists, they never want to
believe me. Also those bank persons are saying they will believe me only
when I really break into their system and transfer money from somewhere
else's account. It just seems the reward they are offering me is not
enough for my work. What might be a good reward for hacking into an
Internet bank and showing I can steal their money?
