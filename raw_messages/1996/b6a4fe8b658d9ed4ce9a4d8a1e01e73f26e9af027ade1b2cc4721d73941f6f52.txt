Don't confuse quantity with quality.  When I want a FAQ for some area I
don't normally follow, I go to news.answers.  I know I won't be buried in
social good times the way someone who wants to know about cryptography is
buried when they go to cyperpunks.  I have no such assurance if I were to
go to the news group which created the FAQ.

The reason there are so many different models on the net is they each serve
a purpose.  Don't make the mistake of trying to jam everything into one
mold.
