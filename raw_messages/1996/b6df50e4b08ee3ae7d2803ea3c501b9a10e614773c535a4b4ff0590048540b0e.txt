NYT reported today that it has set up a new web site: 
http://www.nytimes.com


It offers most of the daily articles as well as some from 
archives. More info on subscription and the offerings at the 
home page.


Subscription is free, for now. Though there is a charge for 
downloading, and a battery of whistling-in-the-dark copyright 
proclamations and threats and pleadings.


For the Times-addicted, today's WSJ has a page one article on 
NYT-leadership squabbling, fomented by board member Gerstner, 
infamous IBM-Lotus espionage-enabler.
