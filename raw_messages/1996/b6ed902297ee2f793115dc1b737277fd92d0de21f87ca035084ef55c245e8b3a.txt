Now there you are wrong.  No one forced Fred to stop posting to the list
(I noticed that I just got a posting from him just yesterday, so he may
have stopped since then), but no one deprived Fred of his right to speak. 
I don't see Eric Hughes standing up and saying "Fed, stop posting to the
list", and I certainly note that his postings are getting through to the
list.  So, your statements regarding people harassing Fred, causing him to
stop posting, etc., are just eyewash and an attempt to emotionally
manipulate your audience by calling it "censorship".
