I agree with Anon - Timmy (fart) is a lying sack of shit. I caught him
"complaining" to various people in the computer security industry
about what I write on the 'net - and he attributes shit to me that
I knows I never wrote. That's lie #1.

When confronted with evidence, Timmy further lied about his communication
with one of these people. He's a sad piece of work.

Yes - please, don't send a *daily* Timmy shit to this mailing list. This used
to be a good forum to discuss crypto. Timmy doesn't know much about crypto,
so he's been spamming it with his libertarian crap. Please don't contribute
more shit than we already get from Timmy.
