If you want to do that, why not do so as a response to Don's FAQ?

Is the concept here that:  Whereas conventional crypto generates/hashes
a *key* with which to encode the text, IPG generates a *pad* from a key,
more or less the length of the text, with which to encode the text??

It seems to me they're putting an additional layer of stuff ("OTP") between
the key generation and the actual encoding, so what's the problem with that,
as a concept?
