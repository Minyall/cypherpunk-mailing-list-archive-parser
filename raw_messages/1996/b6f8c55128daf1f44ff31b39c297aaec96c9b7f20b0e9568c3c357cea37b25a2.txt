The question as to Social Security numbers came up earlier today in a
conversation off-list.

Do any of the lawyer types that hang out here know the exact statutes as to
use and misuse of Social Security numbers?

My understanding (probably flawed) is that it is (or was) illegal for
certain types of businesses to ask for SS numbers.

Does anyone know what the actual laws regarding this are?  Pointers to
statute numbers would also be appreciated.

Also, I noticed that the text "Not for Indentification" does not appear on
later versions of the Social Security cards.  (Comparing my card with my
fathers showed some interesting differences.  That text change was the most
glaring.)
