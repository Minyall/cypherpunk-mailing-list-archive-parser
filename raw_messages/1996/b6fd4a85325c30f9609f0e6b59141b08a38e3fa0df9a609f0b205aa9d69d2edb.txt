The virus is activated when the GIF is _viewed_.

The viewing of the GIF activates the cerebro-visual processing centers of
the brain, activating the ancient Sumerian meme complex. I assume, of

If infected, the only solution is to unsubscribe from the Cypherpunks list
before others are similarly infected.

Hey, Moroni, we've missed your particular slant these last few months.
