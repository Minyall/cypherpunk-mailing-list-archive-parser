They have a very simple bottom line. Ban strong crypto. Eliminate loopholes.

Official Prediction (For new readers of this list, once in a while I make an "official prediction". That means the reader is urged to call me on it and, yes, I take bets):

The US will make the following acts illegal and or subject to licensing within two years:
1. Production of strong crypto for sale abroad by a subsidiary of a US corporation.
2. Production of strong crypto for sale abroad, if the project is financed by a US corporation. Alternatively, US companies might be prohibited to financially benefit from such a product.

I am not saying that these acts will be prohibited in all cases. I am saying that they will be prohibited in some cases.
