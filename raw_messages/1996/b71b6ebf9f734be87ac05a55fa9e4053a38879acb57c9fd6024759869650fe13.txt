You hve absolutely no idea of what is happening in Bosnia. There
is widespread support in each of the communities for genocide 
policies. 

You do not demonstrate any reason why people would be more interested
in murdering politicians than other people. 

You assume that contract murderers do not have political or social
agendas of their own. A member of the KKK is much more likely to 
become a contract killer than a liberal. 


>How long do you think that such groups would last with AP functional?  

Murder Politics (lets give your psychopathic scheme an acurate name)
will never be functional. If anonymous cash implied muder politics then
society would be right to reject anonymous cash. It is easily done
since money only has value so long as it is convertable. 

Not only are rights dependent on a social infrastructure that
guarantees that they will be respected but currency is as well.
Without the social and political infrastructure of the US 
government a dollar bill has only the value of the paper its 
printed on. An electronic balance has zero value. 


If you want to live in a society where the political system has been
"reformed" through murder of inconvenient politicians then go and
live in Columbia. Its the nearest thing you will find on the planet
to libertopia.
