Thanks for the tip!  My friend is good with electronics and he is
building a red box using all chips and shit.  He found out some equation
to use so when a capacitor fills up and then discharges to a resistor,
using a certain equation u can generate frequencys.  I also found out
that you can do the same with QBasic.  I wish there was a way to blue
box, but it seems that there's not.  Thanks for everything.
