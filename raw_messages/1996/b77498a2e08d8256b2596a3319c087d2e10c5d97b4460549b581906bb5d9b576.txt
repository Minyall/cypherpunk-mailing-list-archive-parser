Subscribe them to cypherpunks, lots of times (if that is possible) and don't tell em hot to get off :)

Alternatively have a moderated "spam.die.die" mailing list and subscribe the culprit too this list.
Generate lot of data (like Octal dumps of entire hard disks) and keep sending out mails to these guys
on regular basis.
