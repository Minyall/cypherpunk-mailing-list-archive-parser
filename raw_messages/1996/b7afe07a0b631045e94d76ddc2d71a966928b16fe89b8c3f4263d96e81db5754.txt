The latter, for this application -- unlike the straightforward approach to
RC4 cracking, the partial relations that contributors find for the
factoring exercise are (like the factoring itself) time-consuming to
compute but dead simple to check... and, in fact, each of them is checked
before accepting it.

Yes, that's a good point and one we hashed around a bit at the beginning
of the RC4 project, with less than a perfect conclusion -- but some good
ideas.  You need to account for several kinds of people, including people
plaing with less than a full deck of clues; and the target of the cracking
ring allocating and turning in a "not found" report on the actual target
part of the space.

Absolutely.
