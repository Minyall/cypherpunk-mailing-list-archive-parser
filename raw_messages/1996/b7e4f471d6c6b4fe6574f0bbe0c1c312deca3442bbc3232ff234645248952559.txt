You're kidding, right? With all the uncensored spiders out there, anybody
can find anything in a second. Search for "sarin not japan not aum" to cut
down on the noise. Here's two of the top ten from AltaVista.

1. For US Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA)
   recommendations regarding Sarin (um... avoid?), see:

   http://www.skcinc.com/niosh/file_1424.html

2. Sorry, no detailed recipe, and it says "don't try this at home," but there
   is a bibliography, and the Stanford Libraries have four of the journals
   listed. 

    From http://www.xmission.com/~seer/mcw/sarin.html

Sarin is now known as "GB." It has several chemical names:
1-Methylethyl methylphosphonate, Isopropylhydrogen
methylphosphonate or Isopropyl methylphosphonate. Note the
word "isopropyl." One of the key ingredients of the Sarin made by AUM
Shinrikyo is isopropyl alcohol. Altogether there are four ingredients in
Sarin: phosphorus trichloride, sodium fluoride, isopropyl alcohol
and acetonitrile. Its chemical structure is as follows:
(H3C)2CHOPF(O)Me. Sarin is not the type of weapon that can be made in
the home, it can only be manufactured in a laboratory, though very
sophisticated equipment is not needed. It is extremely dangerous to
manufacture and handle.

It's a German invention. Here's a (mostly) German Bibliography.
