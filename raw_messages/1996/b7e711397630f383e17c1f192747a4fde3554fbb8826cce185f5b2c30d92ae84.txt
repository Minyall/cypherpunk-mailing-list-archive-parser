You are building a straw man.  Nobody has been said to deserve their
fate.  Their fates appear to be unlikely events.

Contrary to what several privacy advocates have implied, I am not
claiming that people should not be allowed to protect their privacy.
Nor am I claiming that people who protect their privacy are criminals.

I am asking why I should protect my privacy.  Most people have
concluded that it is not worth the bother.  Why are they wrong?

(And, why are privacy advocates uniformly hostile to these questions?
Because they are asked anonymously?)

Fair enough.
