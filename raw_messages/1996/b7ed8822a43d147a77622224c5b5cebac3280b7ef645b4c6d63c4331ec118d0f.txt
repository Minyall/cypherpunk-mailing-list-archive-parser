	The headline in the Toronto Star this morning is "'SMART CARD'
HERE WITHIN YEAR" 
	The idea is to have everyone in Ontario have a 'smart card' that
will "keep track of everything from mammograms to speeding tickets". This
card will "replace the existing health card, drivers's licence, social
assistance identification, drug card, and senior identification". 
	Health Minister Jim Wilson said " For example, when you are 
discharged from hospital, your patient record doesn't follow you (so) you 
may go to your family doctor back in your hometown and have all the tests 
and x-rays duplicated." "That sort of information can be available in a 
central database. Of course we have to have all the discussions about 
privacy of information." (I'll just bet we do!)
	"Former Health Minister Ruth Grier also explored a smart card, but
rejected the idea because she said it posed too great a risk to patient
privacy. Wilson said privacy protection will be a key part of the new 
card, ensuring that only appropriate health-care workers and OHIP 
(Ontario Health Insurance Plan) officials can access sensitive patient 
information."
	"The card would carry basic 'tombstone data' such as date of 
birth and gender that Wilson said is now collected by 200 different 
government programs."
	"Wilson said the government has not decided whether the cards will
carry a residents's fingerprints, photo or other form of identification." 

	It seems that Canada is backing into a national identity card
using 'smart' technology. Before any Americans on this list get too smug
about 'it could never happen in America', just remember, all it takes is a
successful example of implementation in a western country and the pressure
will come to your country too.
