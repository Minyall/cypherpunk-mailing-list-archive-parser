What you mean WE, white man?  Does this "requirement" include 
John Gilmore?  Must he and his machine be held in hostage to 
the gratuitous flames of Dimitri?  I think not.

Clear and acknowledged by whom?  Certainly not me.  We are not
talking about Dimitri's right to speak in open society.  This is
a private list provided through the generosity of one person.
Please refrain from making arguments that tacitly assume that
toad.com is a public good or has somehow been nationalized "in
the public interest."  

I challenge those who think John's actions were intemperate or
ill-advised to make their arguments without rewriting history or 
the facts, or by making use of poorly thought out metaphors.

This IS a private list, like it or not.  Crying "censorship" or
"authoritarianism" merely because John handled this differently
than you would have, is disingenuous to say the least.
