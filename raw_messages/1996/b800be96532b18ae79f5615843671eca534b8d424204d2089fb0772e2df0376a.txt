Here are my back-of-the-calculator numbers:

2^55 = 3.6 * 10^16 trial ecb operations (+key setup).
Best P-100 DES software implementation I can find can do 110000 ECBs/sec.
Key setup takes about twice as long as a single ECB.
Assuming amazingly fast key setup and careful ECB optimization
(precompute IP and FP, gray coded key enumeration with cached round results,
etc), MAYBE, somehow, you could do 100000 ECB/sec on "average" workstation
(average = 100mhz Pentium).

That's 11000 Pentium-100 years for half the DES keyspace.

Well, I'm working on getting the funds to build (or support someone
to build) some kind of parallel DES engine.  I can probably scrape
together an FPGA-based machine that can do a key in less than 6 months.
I'm very serious about this project, but I can't say for sure when or if
I'll be ready to start.
