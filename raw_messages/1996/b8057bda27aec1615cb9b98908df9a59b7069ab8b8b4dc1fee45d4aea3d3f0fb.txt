   Did it move?  I hadn't seen any announcement of this...

No, it hasn't moved, but the server it was running on got "upgraded" and
some things were (or still are) broken.  The e-mail based keyserver and
the older WWW interface were working as of Wed. night.  The new WWW
keyserver code compiles but has some bugs I'm still trying to work out.;
I hope to have it back on-line soon.

Sorry for the problems, folks
