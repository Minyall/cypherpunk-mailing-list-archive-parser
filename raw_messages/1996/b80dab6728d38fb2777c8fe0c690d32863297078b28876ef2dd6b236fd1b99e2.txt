see
http://www.marcus.rts.com.au/faq/one-time.html for a really brief summary
of the assumptions I'm about to use.

a) if I use a chunk of data A to encrypt another chunk of data B, then
   my method of encryption is *not* a one-time pad if size(A) < size(B)

b) the security of a one-time-pad O is only as good as any encryption used
   to exchange O between two parties, which leads to...

c) if C. lu`Lez, an Idiotic Pseudo-security Generator, wishes to transmit
   a chunk of data A to L. User, then for A (if A is truly random to begin
   with) to have the security of a one-time pad, A must be exchanged using
   a one-time pad B where size(B) > size(A)

d) CONTRADICTION: If C and L already share B, which is greater in size
   than A, *why is C sending more keys*?

Of course, it all works out if you stop expecting A to be a one-time pad when
it gets to L.
