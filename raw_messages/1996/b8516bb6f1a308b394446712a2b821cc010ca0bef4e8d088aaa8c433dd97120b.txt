  This is from our US download FAQ at
http://home.netscape.com/eng/US-Current/faq.html

	The information users provide when applying to download the 128-bit
	encryption software is used ONLY to verify eligibility. The U.S.
	government requires Netscape to maintain a log of software downloads
	should they deem it necessary under court order, to use this
information
	in their investigations of illegal use or misrepresentation of
	information. 

  If law enforcement got a court order to get the entire list, we would
fight it in court as being over broad.

  We are not doing any type of credit check.  We are doing some address
verification using local databases, so these queries don't go into
anyones tracking database.
