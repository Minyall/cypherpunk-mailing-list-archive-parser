        It's a natural outgrowth of Jim Bell's noggin, more like. It has
nothing per se to do with anonymous remailers _or_ anonymous cash _or_
double blinding _or_ anything else of much interest to anyone on this list
except for a few overheated zealots: you could describe any economic
activity you want--including selling candy to children or paying big
meanies to steal it from them--with precisely the same protocols. KILL THIS
THREAD, NOT POLITICIANS.
