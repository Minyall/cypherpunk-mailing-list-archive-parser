Interesting that if the transition to crypto anarchy includes any phase
of conflict between the state and the individual, failing to properly
protect those assets may result in their seizure anyhow.  If they are
attachable now, as you seem to suggest, then they are attachable then.

I know that Mr. May has, in past, been a asset protection "naysayer," but
this falls into a general, and disturbing, pattern.

I'll wager, though I have no data to back it up, that most of the people
in this forum who are uncertain about the safety of their assets don't
bother to engage in the most basic of asset preservation tactics, namely:
geographic diversification.

Surprising considering the perfectly legal options which would protect
many of them.
