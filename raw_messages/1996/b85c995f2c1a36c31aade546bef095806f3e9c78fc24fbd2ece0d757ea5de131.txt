Well, ignoring the narcissistic overtones of your comment, and the fact that I
was quoting David Gelernter from Yale, I could point out the qualifier
"reasonably sophisticated" or the relative comparator "happier", but I think it
will suffice to say that an environment that included women may just include
your mother.
 
And wouldn't we all be happier with our mommy around?

You can fool all of the people some of the time, and some of the people all of
the time, but you can't fool mom.
