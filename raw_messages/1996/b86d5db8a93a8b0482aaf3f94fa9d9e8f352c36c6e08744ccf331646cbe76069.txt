I would hardly classify alphabet city as a `low-crime suburban locale'.
Much more of an issue is that the locals downtown are much closer to being
within walking distance of the higher-rent higher-income areas, so the
local bodegas must keep prices low to compete.  Up here, it's a lot
farther to an alternative, and a lot fewer people have cars, so you have a
lot fewer choices.  The result is that what choices there are can pretty
much stock what they please and charge what they please...

The issue here is much more one of the insularity of the ghetto than it's
crime rate...
