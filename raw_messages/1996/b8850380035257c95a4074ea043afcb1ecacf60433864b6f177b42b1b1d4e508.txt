   "Preventing Terrorism: Where to Draw the Line? With
   Militias, U.S. Adopts Preemptive Strategy"

      This strategy requires aggressive and potentially
      controversial tactics as investigators infiltrate groups
      and bring charges on the basis of allegedly criminal
      plans that are conceived but not carried out. Federal
      agencies are more willing to launch investigations when
      people talk about committing violent acts, and
      investigators are more prone to use ordinary citizens as
      informants.

      According to legal experts, the mere discussion of a
      crime, no matter how fanciful it may be, can constitute
      a criminal conspiracy. "The classic example is that you
      are guilty of a crime if you conspire with someone else
      to stick pins in a voodoo doll in the belief that your
      enemy will fall dead," said Albert Alschuler, a law
      professor at the University of Chicago.
