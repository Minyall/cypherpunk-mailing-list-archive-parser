If you're saying that it's wrong (bad, whatever) for corporations to have
special protections and so on (taxes, other things) that don't apply to
individuals who are (for example) not part of any corporations, then I
do agree with you.

OTOH, the evils which can be accomplished in practice (never mind theory)
by power groups such as large corporations, which cannot be accomplished
by individuals (or cannot in practice be defended against) are a problem
that society has addressed, sometimes on a case-by-case basis (usually
better), and sometimes through big legislation, which often far outlives
its usefulness.  I hope we're at least seeing the same points.
