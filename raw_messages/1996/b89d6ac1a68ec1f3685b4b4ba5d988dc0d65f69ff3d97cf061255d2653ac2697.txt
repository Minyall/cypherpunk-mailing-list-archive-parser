Resident aliens, as well as U.S. persons, have First Amendment rights.  
Second, we have a right to speak to foreign audiences.  Independently of
the First Amendment, there is an equal protection issue whenever you
discriminate against aliens.  There's case law on these points which I
won't bother to cite.
