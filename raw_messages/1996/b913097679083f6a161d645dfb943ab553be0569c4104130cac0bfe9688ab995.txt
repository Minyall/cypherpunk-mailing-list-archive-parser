Where is Redonda on the map, I'm too lazy to look it up, 
The group working on the Oceania Project tried to find an 
accommodating country that would allow them to run as a soverign
nation, Last I heard they were planning to purchase a former 
hospital ship and refurbish it.

About now I am feeling like Woody Allen in 'Bananas' I'll find
Tim May becoming 'El Presidente' alerting everybody on the island
that their underwear will be worn on the outside, A yearly gift
of his weight in discarded AOL disks, and that everyone must own 
a hot-tub just like his  :)
