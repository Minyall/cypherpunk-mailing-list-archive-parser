NetSurfer said:  If you know a valid email address on the spammers system you can always
bounce each message back to them.  If enough people turned the messages
back on them it might give them the opportunity to experience first hand
what its like to receive tons of mail you don't want or need...

Doesn't seem to work that well.  The "green card lawyers" were reported
to have received hate-mail in the hundreds of thousands.  The happily waded
through it all and pulled out a few valid replies who apparently made it
all a net profit for them, apparently.  What we really need is to improve
our defensive filtering mechanisms.  Someday soon we'll all have our own
personal software agents that will handle all this stuff for us.
