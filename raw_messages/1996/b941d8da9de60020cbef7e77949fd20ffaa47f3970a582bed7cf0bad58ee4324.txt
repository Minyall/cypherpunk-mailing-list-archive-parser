I have been IDed numerous times for no other reason than walking on the
sidewalk at a late hour in an area where most people use cars to go to the
7/11 down the block. Southern California is especially bad in this regard.
A friend, who had the same problem, finally got a dog. After that the cops
left her alone. Seems walking your dog is a legitimate reason to be out at
night...
