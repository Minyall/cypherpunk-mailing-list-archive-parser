HSS needs to verify that the researcher didn't just make up the data. The
Department therefore has to be able to audit the results of the study by
contacting a small subset of the participants directly. How can the
Department contact the participants if they are known only under their
nyms? No, pseudonymous remailers are not a valid answer. All this has to be
done without requiring any type of email/Internet access. US Mail only.
