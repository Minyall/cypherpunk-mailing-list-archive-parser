If you really owned it, you would not need to control it.

Methinks you know not to whom you are speaking to. Those that know may
see just how the seeds of assumptions are sown in this person's mindset.

The fact that control exists does not mean it is effective, necessary,
or appropriate. Unchecked need to control is merely an outward sign of
a lack of inner control, which is a disease most control freaks have.

I am not attempting to demonize you...you do that to yourself well
enough. I have no interest in your support or opposition, other than
as a tool to show those who can see where certain specific attitudes
come from.

I maintain that it is neither appropriate nor in any sense beneficial
to apply this kind of draconian control to internet communication in
the general sense.

Why is it that when less regulation is desirable, the kneejerk
response is to declare that desire anarchistic? 

Human attempts at creating and imposing "law" are arbitrary,
inefficient, and subject to change based on the whim of those 
who claim to own their implementation.

Hence your attempt to control others.

Hence your inability to understand the concept of "honor".

"Education" has very little to do with knowledge and a lot more to do
with external approval, in the sense you appear to be using it.
"Indoctrination" and "Conditioning" are the two terms that best fit
your apparent notion. 

We all know how far those have gotten us in the past 2000 years.
One can see this "progress" by looking at the net's attempts to control
