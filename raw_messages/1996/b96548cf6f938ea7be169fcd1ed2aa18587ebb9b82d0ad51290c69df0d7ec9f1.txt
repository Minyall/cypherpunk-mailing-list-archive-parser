Someone just asked me if it would be possible for the NSA to use a front 
company to buy crypto patents (or companies that own lots of crypto 
patents), then simply pull them off the market.

When I thought about it I couldn't understand why they haven't done it
already. 

Can whoever ends up with the rsa patent pull rsaref off the market, and
retroactively make software that uses it illegal?  Or would they just be 
able to prevent people from writing new code with rsaref?
