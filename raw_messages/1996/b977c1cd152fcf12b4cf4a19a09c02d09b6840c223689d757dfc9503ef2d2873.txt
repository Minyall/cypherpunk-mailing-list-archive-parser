And if the IRS is concerned with legal correctness.

I note that a number of ingenious and popular tax minimization
gimmicks have in the end failed to benefit anyone other than 
their promoters.

When you need a pallet and a forklift truck to carry the tax
code, it does not matter much what the books say.

The more bits of paper you send the IRS, the more they know
about you.  The more they know about you, the more they can
shake you down.

Sending ingenious and unusual bits of paper crafted by a clever
lawyer merely alerts them to the smell of money.
