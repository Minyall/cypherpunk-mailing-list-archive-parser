Since the messages were sent from an AoL account, I would assume that a
simple court order would be all that would be needed to force/require AoL
to release the billing-address records for the account. That would allow CS
First Boston to name the defendant. Refusal by AoL would just force CS
First Boston to add AoL as a co-defendant (until they supply the
name/info).
