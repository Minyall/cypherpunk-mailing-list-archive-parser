This has been slightly discussed on cypherpunks already. The url for the 
DTI report has been posted, and somebody mentioned an IEE meeting where 
things are supposed to be unveiled on the 27th. 


I'm in the UK at the moment - I asked if there were any plans for a 
cypherpunks presence at the meeting, but didn't get any responses. 
It's currently a DTI white-paper, and is not inevitable with 
appropriate lobbying
