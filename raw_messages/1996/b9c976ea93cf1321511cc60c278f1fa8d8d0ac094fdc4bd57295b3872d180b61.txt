	Buggy drivers?  But isn't that the point in this case? :)

	The Frank Herbert (of _Dune_ fame) book _White Plague_ comes
to mind.  Basically a molecluar biologist's wife and kids are killed
by an IRA bomb while visiting Dublin.  He snaps and creates a plague
which kills women (men are carriers) as revenge.  All without using
that nasty Internet (in fact, the book was written back before even
ARPAnet).
