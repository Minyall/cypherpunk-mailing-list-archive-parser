Unfortunately, I think his filter puts too high a bound on the
entropy. Put it this way: I think he's only giving you an upper
bound. Furthermore, he's using his technique because he's using
spinners as RNGs, which I have a substantial fear of.

However, you are correct that this mechanism is no worse than not
using it at all. However, it doesn't substitute for doing a thorough
systems analysis to try to figure out how much entropy there actually
is in your source.

Thus, to summarize, yes, I agree with your strict statement that using
the filter this way is not weaker than not using it at all, but I'm
not sure it is worthwhile in this case because it isn't sufficient.

Agreed.

Sad but true.
