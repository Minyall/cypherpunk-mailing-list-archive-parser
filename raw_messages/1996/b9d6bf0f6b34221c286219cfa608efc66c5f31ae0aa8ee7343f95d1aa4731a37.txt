There has to be a way to tell the system that the sectors are used 
when not the drive isn't mounted and the filesystem isn't active.

Having a copy of the driver is enough to arouse suspicion.  If they 
don't find anything useful in that one partition, they'll assume 
the second is in use and that you're not giving up the key.  You may 
very well get accused of maintaining a second system even if you are 
not and do not have anything incriminating in the one encrypted fs.
