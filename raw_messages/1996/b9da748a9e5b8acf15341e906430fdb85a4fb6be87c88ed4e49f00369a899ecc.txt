	The financial industry doesn't need GAK, the SEC, FINCEN et al
already get full access to their networks & data.  The financial
industry is very cooperative about this.  As such, GAK is adding
(unquantifiable) risk to their plans, without giving the LEAs
anything.  I am suggesting to my customers in the financial sector
that they continue moving towords 3des, and only look at this as an
alternative to foreign software for their overseas branches.

	Remember, banks already get a partial exemption to the ITARs.
