This is hardly questionable as the reason for restricted key lengths; if 
this wasn't the fact of the matter, they wouldn't make it difficult to 
superencrypt with the same system over and over again, which they do.
And "best" case for who?  Not I, surely. Simply putting a "national 
security" clause in this makes the CIA or SS or FBI or ATF or whatever 
above the law, regardless of the reasons.  I certainly don't want these 
organizations above the law.  I remember (well, not really.  But I've 
read about) J Edgar Hoover, and I don't want a repeat.

Archie didn't completely and blindly trust the government. Ozzie and 
Harriet, yes. Edith, probably.  Archie, no.  (ObGunPunks: remember the 
episode where Archie got to do the TV editorial about gun control? :-))
