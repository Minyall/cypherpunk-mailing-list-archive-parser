Intel produced an "encrypted EPROM," for use in coin-op game machines and
in similar applications, in the early 80s. My voltage contrast lab was able
to use our machine (which I invented and my group then developed and
deployed to major sites within Intel) to read the internal data streams out
from internal nodes, thus demonstrating that the system had only moderate
security. Enough security to stop an attacker from attacking a specific
instance of the chip, but enough security to prevent attacks completely.

Does this qualify as a documented case, coming as it does directly from the
guy who lead such a scavenging attack?
