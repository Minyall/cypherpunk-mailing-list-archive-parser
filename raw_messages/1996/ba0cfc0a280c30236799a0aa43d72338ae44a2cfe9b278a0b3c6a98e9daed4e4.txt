First off, this is _not_ a criticism - c2.org provides wonderful services,
and I'm budgeting to buy more from them.

However, I'm curious. Consider a reasonably worst case, in which ye
jack-booted thugges come through the door unannounced, scoop up everything,
and haul it off for examination.

The question is, how much would they get? How much information about c2
users would fall into the wrong hands?
