That the key belongs to the person(s) assuming the identity of
"Toxic Avenger". When someone signs my key, they are saying that
they believe that the key belongs to me, a person who has the
identity of "Kevin Prigge". Since I am a real person, I can 
prove that some other entity knows me as Kevin Prigge via some form
of identification issued by the state, and I can prove that I 
control the key. For a 'nym, there is no identification that is
issued, which may be the point of having an 'nym. The best that
can be said is that the user@someplace posting with a 'nym of
"whatever" controls the key, which is all I'd be certifying with
my signature on the key.
