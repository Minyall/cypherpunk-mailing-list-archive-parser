I would really like to see a remailer that is somehow blinded.

I don't know enough about how mail paths are generatered, but is it
impossible to conceal the origin of remailer postings?

Postings made to remailernym@alpha.c2.org would be spit out somewhere but
without accountability?

Impossible?  Would do wonders defeating traffic analysis.

I'd consider running a remailer, but after listening to the response to
the anonymous poster a while back, it sounds like there are few if any
simple options which do not require major time and effort to setup and
run.
