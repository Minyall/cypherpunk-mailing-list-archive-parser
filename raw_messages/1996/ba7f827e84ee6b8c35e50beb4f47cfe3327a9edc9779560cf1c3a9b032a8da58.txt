I don't really see the use of this complicated scheme.  The main
problem seems to be that if M floods remailer R with messages to B,
and A sends a message to C through R, then it will be clear to M that
A's message was destined for C.

Rather than divert messages, then, I propose that for each input
message there is a 10% chance that a piece of cover traffic is
generated.  Thus, if M sends 50 messages through R and sees 6 outgoing
messages going to remailers C, D, and D, he will now know which
messages correspond to the message that A send through.
