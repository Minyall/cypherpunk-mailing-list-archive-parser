They have started mentioning the product on their web pages and provide a 
link to the beta site for sign-ups etc.  Since 6.x I have not yet 
experienced a product crash, except with a disk full condition which was 
reported to them earlier today.  BTW, would you be interested in setting up 
a secure channel for testing?
