FYI:


[...]
   Esther Dyson, president of high-tech publisher EDventure
   Holdings Inc. and chairwoman of the Electronic Frontier
   Foundation, a high-tech civil liberties organization that
   is a co-plaintiff in the lawsuit, calls the Georgia law
   "brain-damaged and unenforceable," and adds: "How are they
   going to stop people from using fake names? Anonymity
   shouldn't be a crime. Committing crimes should be a crime."
