I missed nothing, I simply don't agree. It seems to me that the US
military is much more the agressor than the defender. Just who is it that
you are believe you are defending against? What year do you live in?

The military is NOT the defender of laws, that is the job for the civilian
police. Are you really that confused? I actually live in Canada where I
enjoy the same or more freedoms that you do, funny thing though, we don't
find it necessary to have a large military force to `protect' us.

What the fuck is this? When did the play end on broadway, mid-seventies?
Do you have a point? I thought not. The only reason I pointed out that it
was the movie is because I am not certain that that line IS in the play.
You see I practice something called honesty, something you might do well
to learn about yourself.
