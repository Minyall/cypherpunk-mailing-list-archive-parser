Except that last I checked (2.0.6) it was completely insecure.  The
DES-encrypted filesystem ignored your password and always used a key of
all 0's (which is a weak key in DES, to boot).  I've been touching it up
to do DES and IDEA _right_ (CBC mode within each block, IV based on block
number), and plan to put in some simple stego as well.
