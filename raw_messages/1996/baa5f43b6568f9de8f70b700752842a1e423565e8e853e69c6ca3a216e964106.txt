In New York State, there are periodic complaints from Sovok "refugees" like
Igor Chewed-Off, who come in with a I-94 visa (and authorization to work), and
get the green card after two years. They get welfare, but apply for jobs...
Some poor employer slob refuses to hire the Sovok, thinking mistakenly that he
can only hire amcits or green card holders (even though I-94 with authorization
is listed on I-9). The employer pays a hefty fine for "illegal discrimination",
of which the Sovok gets a cut. Nice racket. Did you ever try it, Igor?
