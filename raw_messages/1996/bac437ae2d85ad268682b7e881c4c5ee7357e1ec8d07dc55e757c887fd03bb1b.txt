The AP line came down that the matchbook contained the algorithm for 
easily factoring large primes.  Apparently the drunken stupor that Tim 
and Perry were in dislodged a blocking mechanism in each others brains

jotted down the relevant material.

The suits were reportedly affiliated with a little known 
group called "CypherDietyPunks".
