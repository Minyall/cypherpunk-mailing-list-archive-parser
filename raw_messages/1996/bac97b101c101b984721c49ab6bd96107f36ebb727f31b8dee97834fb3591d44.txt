Here's a question:  Why can't we do stings OF POLICE, not by police?  If 
they can mail porno to people and have them arrested, why can't we identify 
thug-types on the net, email them porno (perhaps from out of the country, to 
keep the sender legal) and then break into their houses and arrest them?

What?  What's sauce for the goose ISN'T sauce for the gander?
