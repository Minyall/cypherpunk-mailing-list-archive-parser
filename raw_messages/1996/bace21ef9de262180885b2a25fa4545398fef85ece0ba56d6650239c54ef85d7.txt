Wrongo, Mr./Mrs. Argumentum ad Nauseam.
My computer is in fact in MY home, and my access is SOLELY through GTE.

Perception is everything.  And I never made a comment about "binding" anything.
Therefore, there is no misunderstanding.

And the people who agree with you are the only intelligent/clueful people on this list?
Your contention is acknowledged and rejected.

The only fact you've shown to demonstrate that it's private is that John can manage it
"anyway he wants", and/or shut it down at will.  Well, the owners of Denny's can shut
their places down whenever they want to too.  Matter of fact, the whole government can
resign tomorrow and tell you to do it yourself.  Imagine what would happen in the L.A.
metro area if the truck drivers who bring in food decided they didn't want to do so
next week....

Works for you.  Which is all you care about.
