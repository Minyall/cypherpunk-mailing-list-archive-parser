how about a new term for all the various enemies of cyberspatial 
advancement? the censors, the luddites, the spooks, the politicians,
the demagogues, the rabid media (all of which there seems to be no 
shortage of lately):

"cyberteurs" engaging in "cybertage"

now if we can only get a strong stigma associated with the words and
label all the enemies with it. I think it could really stick. a sort
of reaction by cyberspatial citizens against all the encroachments
and disrespect.
