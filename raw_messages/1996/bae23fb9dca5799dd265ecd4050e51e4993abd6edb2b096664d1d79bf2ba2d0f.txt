My understanding goes with along with your statements.
I got asked a question the other day and that person emphatically stated
you "must" register the algorithm with the NSA(for domestic use).
I was not aware of this even for exporting software that has cryptographic
capability. If you export software do you have to "register" the
algorithm? Or maybe I should ask - are there any situations where you do
have to register the algorithm? For export I'm only aware that the
strength of the algoritm has to be equal to or less than 40-bit DES.

I think he was getting confused with GAK.
