	Double spending using ecash isn't possible, but why so?  Is it 
because of the verification protocol?  Or is it an implication of the 
isueing intricacies?
	And how about tracing, is it merely unfeasable that ecash 
spending can be traced, or is it mathamatically impossible to trace?
	Any explanations or pointers would be extremely helpful.
