     You are missing something.

   One can earn interest on money, or gold, or oil, or pork bellies, if
   one -  puts it at risk. Typically by lending it out.

 In our curent FDIC system, there is created  the myth, that bank 
interest is given without concomiitant risk.

The laws of economics are like the laws of physics. They apply, no matter 
what anyone says about anything. There is no free lunch - nor risk-free 
interest.
