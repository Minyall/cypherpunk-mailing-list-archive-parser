I don't know what part of America you're talking about. San Francisco?
Most of America is still to the right of you on a map, and close to 95
percent do exactly as I say.  Maybe you got your statistics from the
same media outlet that was working the OJ case.  There, they said that
"x-percent of white people think he's guilty" (usually 70 percent or
thereabouts), while I, Dale Thorn, found it to be just about 100 percent
anywhere in the country (except maybe the Bay Area, where they still
believe that a rotten little piece of crap called the Altair was the
first personal computer).

A lot of B.S. has been discussed for several decades.

These last numbers - "less than 50%", "complete errors like 95%" are 
splendid proofs of what I said in the first paragraph above, that most 
people (like yourself) are totally controlled by their programming.  
Unless, of course, you simply wave it all away with a magic wand.

BTW, if you understood my argument, it wasn't so much about specifics of 
religion et al (which could be easily misinterpreted), it was about how 
people act entirely on their past programming, mitigated to some extent 
by incidental circumstances.  If you're inclined to give too much weight 
to the incidental circumstances, remember the first thing they tell you 
when you join the CIA: there aren't any coincidences (of any real 
significance, anyway).
