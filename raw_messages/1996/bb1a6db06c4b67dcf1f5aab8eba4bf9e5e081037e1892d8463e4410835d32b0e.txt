> The real power of Universal Avatars comes from the inclusion of
> other capabilities into the system. First, consider the implications
> of embedding a public key, or Netscape certificate, into the
> Universal Avatar file. By introducing secure communications, the
> avatar can effect instantaneous financial micro-transactions
> seamlessly in a virtual world. For example, an avatar could walk
> through a virtual mall and transparently purchase items. Since his/her
> profile is under the strict control of the user, s/he could declare
> an interest in modems. Virtual stores could then automate the process
> of discovering where the potential customer's interests lie, while
> keeping the customer's personal information strictly confidential and
> email address safe from spamming.
