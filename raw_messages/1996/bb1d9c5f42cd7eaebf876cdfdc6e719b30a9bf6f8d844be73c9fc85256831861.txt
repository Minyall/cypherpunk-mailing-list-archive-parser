I am a funny sort of person. I don't believe that governments should
be able to do anything that individuals cannot. If it is bad for me to
steal, it is also bad for a government official to steal. If it is bad
for me to listen in on my neighbor's phone calls, it is bad for the
government, too.

I have no evidence that becoming a member of a government agency
grants one absolution from sin. By my book, murdering, invading
privacy, and all the rest are bad, and I see no reason to expect that
just because you've been "ordered" to do them they become good.

I suspect that mass surveilance of the entire U.S. population by the
government could in fact dramatically reduce crime. Should we do it?

I suspect that I could substantially improve my position in life by
listening in on other people's phone calls and reading their
mail. I might even be able to stop crimes directed against my person
by doing so. Should I do it?

I do not mean to pretend that there is an absolute ethics. I merely
claim that I do not find in my mind an easy distinction between the
acts of a government official under color of authority and the acts of
any other individual.
