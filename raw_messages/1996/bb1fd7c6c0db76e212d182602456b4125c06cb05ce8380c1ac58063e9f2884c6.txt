! Vulis, you've already earned your Kook of the Month laurels. It's nap 
! time.

Since you know that is Dr. D, why did you blame the harassment of
Ingrid on Rev. Ron?!?????  It looks like you did it to pin it on the doctor,
or more likely, you saw the opportunity to harass Rev. Ron, even
after you feigned praise of him!  It's the same damned header, IDJIT.

Of course, I never saw the headers for the unidentified harasser to
the Zgrams list, was that the same header, too?  It looks like you did
it or you know who did it and you want to compound harassment on to
nswpp!  How Gravesian!  Is Dr. D your friend your talking about?  Dr.
D, defect, defect!  He's a jerk, jerk!
