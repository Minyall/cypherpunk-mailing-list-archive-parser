It's even deeper than this really.  Opponents of the bill say it says X.  
Supporters of the bill say it says Y.  The bill actually sounds more like 
X than Y.  There is very little incentive to make the bill anything like 
Y.  The bill could probably be a straight forward X and still pass.

Well, it facilitates them, but it takes with the other hand at the same 
time.  It does not facilitate strong unescrowed crypto exports.

If it was just amended to facilitate crypto exports, it would not pass.
