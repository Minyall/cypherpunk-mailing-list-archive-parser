The real; answer to all of these points is too simple.  

"Because they can"

A lot has to do with percieved value.  If consumers would have 
thought that the prices were way too high, then the market would have 
dictated a lower cost eventually.  I think that the price of CDs vs 
tapes is more a marketing issue than a technical one....
