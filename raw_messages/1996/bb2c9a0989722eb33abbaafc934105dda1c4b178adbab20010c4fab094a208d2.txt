Memory is the only way that things like iterated prisoner's dilemmas
become interesting.

I'm afraid, Phill, that you didn't read what I said. Unilateral
disarmament is stupid. Multilateral is not necessarily stupid.

Try creating a breed of Humans that don't want to have children and
see how many generations you can get them to live for.

Try creating a breed of Humans that like walking in front of cars and
see how long they last.

There is a reason humans do things like agressively defending their
children with their lives if need be. There is a reason humans resort
to violence when their place in the gene pool is threatened.

Some of this stuff is plumb obvious to anyone with half a brain,
Phill.
