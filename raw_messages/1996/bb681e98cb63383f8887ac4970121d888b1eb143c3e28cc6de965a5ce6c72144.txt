Yup.  Really nifty package that has been out (for unix) for about a
year.  Unfortunately, the author is turning it into a commerial
product, so it may not be freely available in the future.  There is
now a Windows port, but it is entirely a commecial product.  Source is
not available.

Though ssh is on the whole a nifty product, the unix version contained
a number of nasty implementation bugs that opened large security
holes.  These were found because source code was made available.  I
wouldn't trust the Windows version.  It seems inevitable that there
will be some bugs in it, but unlike the Unix version, "good guys" are
a lot less likely to find and report them.
