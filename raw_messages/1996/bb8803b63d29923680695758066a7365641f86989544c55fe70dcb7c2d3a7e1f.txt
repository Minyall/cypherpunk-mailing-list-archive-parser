I'm not sure if anyone actually still cares about getting wordlists, if
not you can delete this now.. :) Someone probably mentioned this anyway,
but just in case.. 

If you have access to a shell, and to the news spool, you can generate
some quick lists by hopping into the directory of any newsgroup that
interests you and doing:

cat * | tr -cs A-Za-z '\n' | tr A-Z a-z | sort | uniq > my-big-ol-wordlist

With most unixes that will generate an alphabetized list of all the unique
words in your source text, converted to lowercase. I've had some problems
with tr on a few machines, however. Adding a '-c' after 'uniq' will tell
you how many times each word occured (useful for grepping out words that
appear too infrequently, or too frequently) .. 

Incidentally, if you're running crack against a particular person it might
be useful to check dejanews for posts by the individual, and generate your
wordlists from that, I havn't had occasion to actually try this but it
seems like a good idea.
