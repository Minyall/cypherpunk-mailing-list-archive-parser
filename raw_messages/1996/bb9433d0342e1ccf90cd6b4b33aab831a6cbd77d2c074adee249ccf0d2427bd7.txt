The manufacturer is going to publish a list of ALL of the public keys?
We're talking one key per chip, right?  Isn't that an AWFUL lot of
keys, like, in the millions range?

Also... with a few million possible keys like this, all you need to do
is to either guess or factor just one of them.

I'm not sure the "approved" bit would go over too well... one idea
would be to license the compiler writers, who would build the
encryption into compilers.  It's still not horribly great, but
better.

Right; the only reason I could see people using this would be for
economical reasons.

Right; once the user loses control of what he's running, then you can
pretty much do anything you want as far as metering goes.

ObGAK question:  Would this be exportable?  I mean, you could be
encrypting god knows WHAT into those .exe's...  Key escrow?  How would
they get the key?!?  I can see the headlines, "Key Escrow Database
Leaked to Pirate Firm"... :)
