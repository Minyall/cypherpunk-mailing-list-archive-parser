I'm going to try this sanding experiment sometime.
When I get around to it, I'll post the results here.
(pressing hard with inkpad and paper)

Shellac or epoxy glue does NOT work, if the thickness is at all managable.
Tried it, The ridges always find a way to get through.
It also provides a weaker bond to dry skin than you'd expect.
The thicker the more likelihood of peeling off.
Even Krazy Glue. (The UL BS is false.)
