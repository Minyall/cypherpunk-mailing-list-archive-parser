Someone just said that NBC's Dateline showed a snippet of 
Shimomura on an upcoming show about rampant cyber-crime and 
that he was the best hope against it, or something to that 
effect. Did anyone see it and get the time and date?


Anyone attend the Shimomura-Markoff lecture at Stanford today?


Is this the media blitz for their pot-boiler? Can't wait to 
slurp it.
