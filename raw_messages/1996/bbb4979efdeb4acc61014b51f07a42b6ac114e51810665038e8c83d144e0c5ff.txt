Sorry to all, but I'm not seeing what would appear to be obvious.
There seems to be a lot of talk about FV "new program" that undermines
security of computer login/credit cards over the net and such like that. I
don't know about you guys, but I wrote stuff like that in sixth grade on
the old apple IIe. It's pretty simple to write a programs that attaches
itself to the keyboard driver and logs the text types, or only logs certain
parts, what is the large deal? As it applies to internet security, I don't
see how it can make a difference. It must be run from the local computer,
at system level. If I'm on my home computer, I know what's running, and
feel safe that a loging program isn't amung them. What would enable a
remote site to pick up my typings.
However, I don't know much about Java, would it be possible to make such an
applet with Java?
