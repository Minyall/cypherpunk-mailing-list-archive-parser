As usual, when someone calls names it is a tip-off that his argument is bogus.

1. Each country can defend its domestic infrastructure without having to
defend the international infrastructure and the international
infrastructure will pretty much take care of itself. Multinationals should
defend their branches on the territory of the host countries and within
their rules, not from the US.

2. The presenting issue here is information warfare against the US.

What is more what you say is false. I did say that there were exceptions to
ITAR for some US companies, which permit strong crypto to be used in their
overseas operations. What is more, for many months now State has permitted
US Cits to take strong crypto out of the country for personal use, if they
agree to some elementary safeguards.

Your comment is yet another example of the juvenile argument ("juvenile" in
the sense that one sees it a lot in young children whose logical
sophistication hasn't yet developed) that if something isn't perfect it
shouldn't be done at all.

Rest omitted. I'm not going to take any more time with someone who lards
his prose with deliberate personal offense and the questioning of motives.
Plonk!
