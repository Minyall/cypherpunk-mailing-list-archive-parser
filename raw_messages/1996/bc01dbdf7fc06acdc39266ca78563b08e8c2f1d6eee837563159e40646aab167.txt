I would counter and say that there is no distinction between free speech and
promoting said speech. How does one say one party has the right to make a
statement and a second party does not have the right to agree? The whole
point of freedom of speech is to prevent limitations on distribution of
information (aka speech, writting, source code, executables, video, audio
tapes, etc.). Even use of these materials (ie running a virus) would not
violate either the spirit or the letter of the law unless it harmed another
person or somehow took advantage of their property (physical or
intellectual) without their prior consent.
