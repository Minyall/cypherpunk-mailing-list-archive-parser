I'm not sure that is necesarily true.  The checks are normally very
flimsy, and near trivial for anyone to break.  I don't think anyone
knows _who_ exports new versions of PGP etc, so I'm not saying you're
wrong either, only saying: we have no way of knowing.

Well, I understand some of the previous (commercial) 128 bit versions
of Netscape leaked, and I presume they were not available from all the
usual ftp sites because they were commercial.

Presumably as this latest netscape beta is freely distributable, once
it's out it will be on ftp.unimi.dsi.it, ftp.ox.ac.uk, etc, etc.

(the US version of PGP is on various non-US ftp sites, I don't see any
reason why freely distributable netscape binaries should be
different).
