  No, it's not my opinion. The subject line is the title of a keynote 
session at the DCI Internet Expo in Boston on October 15-17. The talk 
is being given by a fellow named Jim Sterne, who is listed as 
president of something called "Target Marketing". I got the brochure 
for the show in this morning's mail. You can get further info at 
http://www.DCIexpo.com.

  The description of the talk begins with the intriguing line 
"Computing power allows us to stop treating people like numbers and 
go back to treating them like human beings -- individuals with 
specific likes, dislikes and points of view." But it ends with "Along 
the way, privacy will become a quaint sentiment." So I guess we treat 
people like human beings, but human beings whom we know everything 
about.

  Although this is a paid conference, they give out free tickets to 
the "expo". It's not clear whether the free ticket gets you into the 
keynotes, but that has usually been the case in the past. If you're 
in or near Boston on 10/17, you may want to share your views with Mr. 
Sterne.
