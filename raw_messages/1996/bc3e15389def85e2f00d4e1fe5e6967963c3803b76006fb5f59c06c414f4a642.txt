Talked with Randy of Safe Mail Corporation on the phone.  

Among the stuff he claimed was that

        PGP has the secret key in its public key!

        Found out that not only does this algorithm use 22 characters.  
        The characters are the ones only found on the keyboard.

        SafeMail uses a proprietary Russian algorithm.

        
Not only is this company misquoting it's making up as it goes along. :)
