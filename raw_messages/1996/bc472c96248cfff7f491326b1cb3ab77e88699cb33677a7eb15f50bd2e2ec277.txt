I'm glad *somebody* realized that. I believe there have been at least a
half dozen messages Cc'd to nobody in the last couple days.

Based on other discussions we've had, I believe I've sent Nobody the FAQ
for the alpha.c2.org remailer. Another, minimum alternative would be to
post anonymous messages with a PGP signature. This would at least answer
the questions of whether the Mr. Nobody that posted the Iron Mountain
hoax is the same Mr. Nobody who spews about Dresden. 

If Nobody needs help getting an alpha.c2.org account to work, and he
doesn't trust anybody here, then I recommend whitewolf@alpha.c2.org, an
avowed National Socialist who 1) will not betray Nobody's trust and 2) is
not subject to surveilance, because all messages to him will arrive
PGP-encrypted, to be read offline.

Another Nazi who seems to know a lot about how alpha.c2.org works, because
he traced my friend Erin's nym back with a traffic-analysis spam, is
ralphj@eskimo.com. I would recommend "Dave Harmon," but he had his netcom
account yanked because he kept forging cancels for my and others' Usenet
posts, among other things I can't talk about. I believe the same person
can be reached through the penet.fi pseudonym "Skipper's Hammer," though. 

Hope this helps. At least with a stable nym, we'd be able to flame you for
off-topic posts.
