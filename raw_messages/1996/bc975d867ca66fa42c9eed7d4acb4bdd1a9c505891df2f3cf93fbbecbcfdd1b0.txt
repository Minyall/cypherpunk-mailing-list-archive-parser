So are you saying that by signing a nym's key, you're asserting that you
know _the individual(s) behind the nym_?  If so, would this association
not weaken the anonymity of the nym whose key you've signed?

Furthermore, by signing a nym's key you place yourself at risk.  If you
sign the nym's key with your own key -- or sign using the key of your
own nym, and that nym is subsequently "outed" -- then anyone wishing to
find the individual(s) behind any nym whose key you've signed can
attempt to coerce you into revealing this information, since you have
claimed to know it.
