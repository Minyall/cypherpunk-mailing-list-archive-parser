Another piece of advice for journalists: stop saying the latest proposal
"may signal the beginning of the end of the impasse..." and similar such
puffery.

We heard this about the Lotus 40+24 stupid idea a year or so ago, we heard
this about the IBM key recovery thing a few months ago, we heard this about
the H-P/Intel scheme a few weeks ago, and now we're hearing about it again
with the latest revision of the TIS proposal.

Journalists seem to be just rewriting the press releases of these
companies, all of whom are building the technologies to sell out the
remaining liberties of Americans. These corporations, and the journalist
who tout their stories, are the modern equivalent of the German
companies...you know the reference.
