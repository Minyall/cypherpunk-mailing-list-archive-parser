What is the difference between an small hardware store owner
selling a hammer and a crowbar to a guy that will commit burglary
and
a remailer owner providing services to , say, the same burglar 
who wants to sell his stolen goods.

Would an anonymous phone call notifying the hardware store owner that
somebody will buy tools that will be used to commit a crime
be significant?

Any comments?

Typical govt reasonning:
The first cause of death is life, therefore life should be
outlawed!  Yeah, let make a new law!  It'll be fun!
