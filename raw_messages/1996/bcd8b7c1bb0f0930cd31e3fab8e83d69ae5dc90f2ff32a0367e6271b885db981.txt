goto alt.2600.  Around here we generally can afford
to pay our phone bills :-)  

Also, the network's signalling has changed, and the basic 
Captain Crunch Whistle doesn't work many places any more -
most of the signalling is digital out-of-band rather than
inband audio.  Phreaking isn't impossible (or there wouldn't be 
as many people chasing the Dread Pirate Mitnick), but at this point
you actually need to know what you're doing to succeed at it,
and merely having plans for a device you don't know well enough to
emulate in code on your PC isn't going to buy you much.

  Imagine if three million people voted for somebody they _knew_,
  and the politicians had to count them all.
