The weirdest thing happened to me today. (Nooo, not *that* wierd thing,
something *else*.) A gentleman proporting to be Phill Hallam-Baker (at
least his check said so, and they actually *do* clear...) showed up at the
DCSB meeting and had lunch. Very pleasant guy.  Quite civil, if a little
bit statist, and way too Hegelian for my blood...

Frankly, I think someone's *spoofing* Dr. Hallam-Baker, on the net or in
person. I can't figure out which one's which.

Anyone have some theories on this? Does he have an evil twin Skippy? The
world wants to know.

Will the real Phillip Hallam-Baker please stand up and thottle your evil twin?

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
