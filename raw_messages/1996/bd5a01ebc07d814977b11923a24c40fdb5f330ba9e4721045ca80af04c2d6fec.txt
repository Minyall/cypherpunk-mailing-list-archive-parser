Is there a way to get a .plan file to execute shell script when
it is read by finger??

I'm sure this is an old question, but it seems there must
be a way.

echo \"date\"  or some damn thing that will execute as opposed
to printing.


The fingerD I am working with does not seem to call
a .fingerrc file.
