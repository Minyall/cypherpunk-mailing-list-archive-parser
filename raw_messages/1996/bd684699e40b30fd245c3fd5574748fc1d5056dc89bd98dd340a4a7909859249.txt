Various correspondents have pointed out that X.25 is an "open system" in
that it is not proprietary.  I knew that.  I was thinking more of
hierarchical vs peer-to-peer.  I have been under the impression that
TCP/IP connections are more peer-to-peer between different sorts of
networks (or nodes) than X.25.  Isn't X.25 more of a standard for a
single network?  Don't X.25 networks need someone more "in charge" than
TCP/IP networks, or am I mixing up different layers on the OSI reference
model?  Which gives me an opportunity to post the only mnemonic that I
ever created:
