	<Sigh>, Java: the new 'net boogey-man (next to keyboard sniffers,
of course :).  The functionallity is not there for arbitrary keyboard
sniffing.  An applet can only see kbd events in windows in it's heirarchy,
upto the toplevel window wich is embeded in the browser (and in any 
toplevel windows, but these all have the "Untrusted Applet Window" warning
at the bottom).
