Gee, really? What makes you think so?

Someone has a stylistic spoofing program, called markov, that can produce
output triggering a positive on the MEDUSA test. One of the distributors 
of this program is (or was) qut@netcom.com. 

See the recent posts by "L. Detweiler" in alt.2600, news.groups, and
news.admin.net-abuse.misc. 

This "L. Detweiler" seems to have failed to appreciate how frequently I
write in conscious self-parody, especially as rich@c2.org. His analysis
of the "detweiling" attack is largely correct, but he greatly
overestimated my ego. It'll all come out soon enough, probably about the
time the comet drops under the horizon.

Why not? I think it's a useful term. John Crapper's name will always be 
remembered; why not Detweiler's? I think he deserves that kind of 
recognition.
