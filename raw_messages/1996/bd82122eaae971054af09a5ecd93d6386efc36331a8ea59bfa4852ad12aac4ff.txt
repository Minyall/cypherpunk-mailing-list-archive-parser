The NYT's Cybertimes reports 
(http://www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/week/0219email.html)

that two companies are preparing to offer free email to customers who agree
to be barraged by ads.  Juno and Freemark will soon offer free email to all
(Americans).

And since you can do (almost) anything with email that you can do with the
rest of the net (just more slowly and less conviniently) I guess we don't
have to worry about government-provided public access any more.
