Good faqs have pointers to other good sources of information, even
when they're pretty near authoritative.  I'd point to Schneier,
Rivest, and Blaze as people whose endorsements carry real weight, and
point to the sci.crypt faq for more info.

Other than that, it looked like a good start.  I look forward to being
able to point people to it.
