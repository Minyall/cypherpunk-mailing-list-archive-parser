the malicious type of hacker has the psychology of taking
great glee in tearing anything meaningful down. they don't
necessarily need a plausible reason. the purpose of destruction
alone can be a powerful motivating force. those who destroy
carefully constructed things for fun obtain a sense of power from it.

the point is, when you are sharing your project among a lot of 
elements "out there" on a network, you have to worry more and 
more about "safe computing". when you are working on a purely
voluntary basis, what is your guarantee that everyone who volunteers
is actually on your side? again, a bigger problem the more a 
task is decentralized. one interesting argument in favor of centralized 
computing (I'm not saying it is a definitive argument, quite far
from that of course-- just pointing out that Distribution is
not necessarily the Panacea to All Problems).
