 A million monkeys operating under the pseudonym "Dale Thorn

Yes, this is fairly accurate.  Of course we (most of us) do not
have full Turing machine access to John's computer or to its
peripherals, but we do have access to a few simple functions
which we use with gusto, including broadcasting, subscribing
and unsubscribing, and the other functions of majordomo.


Perhaps you are objecting to the idea that our access to John's
computer is equivalent to, say, our access to our own
computers?  I certainly agree with you that it is not the same
kind of access.

Yeah, there are some (relatively) subtle issues here like "when
is it merely extended causal relation and when is it usage", or 
"what are the details of this implicit agreement that we have
with John" or whatnot, but I'm not sure that those are the
issues that you are talking about.  To wit:

What?  What sly newspeak did I use and more importantly what
great truth am I attempting to conceal?
