Cypherpunks -- 

Atfer much scientific research, I have finally found a way to restore 
any message given only its MD5 checksum. The method is based on the
so called "enthropy restoration" algorithm. I have also written a
libMD5hack library for restoring messages given their MD5 checksums.

I plan to license the library for commercial use.

The price of the library is to be determined.
