Was it just me, or did others on this list get three whopping MS Word docs
sent to them from the POTP snake-oil folks?

Came from one Charles W. Morgan, <charlie@outcomesinc.com>, of "Outcomes
2000, Inc.", whoever *that* is...  Probably somebody trying to give the
Albuquerque Spam King a run for his money, I bet.

Feh!


Cheers,
