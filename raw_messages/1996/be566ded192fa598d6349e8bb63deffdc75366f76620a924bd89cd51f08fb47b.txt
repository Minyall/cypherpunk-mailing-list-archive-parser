Hedging, hedging, hedging - why? I did not noitice this in my first 
reply - in addition to giving you the company if you can break the 
system, we will give you the company if you can establish, through our 
employees or any other method, that we retain any Ocopies of the TPs, 
any! - for very large systems, we maintain a temporary copy to insure 
safe arrival, by excuting the check system menu item - 
it is immediate destroyed upon system notification. Anyone that wants to 
audit us cazn do so, unannounced at any time - subject to payment ofd 
expenses! We do not keep copies, we would not be in business 30 days if 
we did.
