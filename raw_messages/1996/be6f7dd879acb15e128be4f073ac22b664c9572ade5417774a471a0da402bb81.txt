     I am sure that someone will correct me if I am wrong, but:

     The algorythm cannot be considered secure until it has been 
peer-reviewed. They refuse to release the algorythm for review, simply saying
that "you can't break the code" therefore "it is secure". I personally have 
a hard time with the cryptograms in the sunday newspaper, never mind something
that would take a real cryptographer longer than a cup of coffee to figure
out.

     Am I close here?
