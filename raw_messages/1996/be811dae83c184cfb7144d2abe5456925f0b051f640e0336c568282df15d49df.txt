In a related vein, consider the work of a Minnesota folk hero from the
last century named Ignatius Donneley.  Aside from trying to start a
Utopian community just north or our town, he wrote a book "proving"
that Shakespeare was really Francis Bacon. His proof was based on
"decrypting" hints in messages hidden in Shakespeare's writings.

Donneley also wrote a book on Atlantis (available from Dover) and
another postulating that a huge comet caused the extinction of the
dinosaurs. A crackpot, eh?
