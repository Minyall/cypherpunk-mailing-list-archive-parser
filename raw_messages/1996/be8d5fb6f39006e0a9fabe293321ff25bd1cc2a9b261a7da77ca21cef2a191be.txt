Mach != Linux. When people use use this thing, they will *not* be
using Linux in any way shape of form. The drivers and such that you
develop will be completely worthless to Linux proper without someone
spending months to port them, and advances in Linux such as the new
page cache or the upcoming revision of ext2fs may not show themselves
on your "linux" for an equal period of time.

This comes back to my belief that you folks are just trying to cash in
on Linux's name and reputation without contributing something directly
to the cause. Why didn;t you just call it it "OSF/1 for PowerMac" and
include an ext2fs server? Hindsight? Why don't you just port Linux
proper to PowerMac? 

(and how did this get on cypherpunks?)
