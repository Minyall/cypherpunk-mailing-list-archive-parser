I've left the attributation list open because I think my view a majority
one.

The inclinations I had to be involved with or financially support EFF are,
after reading this, entirely quashed.

What is or is not your personal or EFF's official position is meaningless.
It is clear that the personal beliefs of those involved in EFF are
those of compromise, present day politics, and a general lack of moral
fiber.

The political assumptions and the degree of technical invasion that would
make the above scheme possible are either hopelessly naive, or insidiously
invasive.
 
A scheme to make every net goer traceable (albut with some undefined
mechanism to "safeguard" against abuse) is, even in its core requirements,
frightening.

Whatever respect I had for EFF collectively and the individuals working
within the organization is much deminished, if it survives at all.

Yet you address this where exactly, even now in your "apology" or
"explanation" statement?

Perhaps you should have spoken publically but anonymously the first time?
Having not done so, I think you have damaged yourself as well as EFF.

I find the above amusing.
