When Wernher von Braun (if the reader doesn't know who von Braun was, shame
on your teachers. Hint: first human on the Moon.) first became interested
in rocketry, he was a student of music. Classical piano, to be exact. He
got his hands on a book about using rockets for space exploration. To his
dismay, the book was full of mathematical equations. He went to his math
teacher, asking him for help with the equations. The teacher must have been
of help, since von Braun went on to become the single most knowledgable
person in his field. And no, it wasn't piano playing.

There is nothing like some real life challenges to spark a young person's
mind. Today, conducting the experiments that fueled von Braun's imagination
would be a felony. The mere posession of the chemicals he used in his early
twenties is illegal.

This country has set out on a project to dumb the minds of its young. With
great success.
