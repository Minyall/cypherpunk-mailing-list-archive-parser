I agree. I am not suggesting that non-subscribers should be blocked from 
posting to the list. Nor am I claiming that non-subscribers post a higher 
rate of garbage to the list. All I am saying is that I will bounce 
garbage originating from non-subscriber and subscriber alike back to the 
authors. I encourage others on the list choose to do the same.
