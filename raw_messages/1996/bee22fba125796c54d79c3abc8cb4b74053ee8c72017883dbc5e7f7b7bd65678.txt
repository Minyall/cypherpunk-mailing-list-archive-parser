It does. John Gilmore is a proven liar. He has no credibility.

They lack competence in all areas except cocksucking.

John Gilmore rips off software authors. I don't care what the copyleft says.
Gilmore is a crook.

Given your brazen disregard for the software authors, and general lack of
ethics, you probably have an illegal copy already.

Microsoft sucks. I've had plenty of terrible experience with them trying
to rip me off. John Gilmore is worse.

If you don't do much programming, then you can a) use a DOS C compiler,
b) use Perl for NT (free from Microsoft; not that I like Perl), c) use
Visual Basic, d) byte the bullet and invest in the compiler from the same
company that wrote the OS. If you want to learn NT system APIs, graphics
APIs, etc, then you probably can't even call them from gcc reliably.

Fuck John Gilmore.
