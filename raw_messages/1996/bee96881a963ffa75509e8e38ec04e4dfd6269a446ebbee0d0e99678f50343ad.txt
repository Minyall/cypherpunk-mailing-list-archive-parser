No mailing lists that I know of.  There may be sekret ones, though.  The
Scientologists have a member's only list called TNX, but you have to be
very Theta to get on.

Alt.religion.scientology on Usenet is the big source for info.

You might also check out #scientology on IRC.

Ron Newman's excellent web site is at
http://www.cybercom.net/~rnewman/scientology/home.html
You can now do an Excite search of his entire site.
