	There is SSH, more of a rlogin. I don't know if it uses SSL or
not.
	Here is the first bit of the README:

Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program to log into another computer over a
network, to execute commands in a remote machine, and to move files
from one machine to another.  It provides strong authentication and
secure communications over insecure channels.  It is inteded as a
replacement for rlogin, rsh, rcp, and rdist.

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.  See COPYING for
license terms and other legal issues.  See RFC for a description of
the protocol.  There is a WWW page for ssh; see http://www.cs.hut.fi/ssh.

	Compiled out of the box under linux.
