Arun:

I can't give you a definitive answer here, but I'll take a shot.  
Most Internet telephony systems use UDP packets to transfer speech, 
since the lower overhead of UDP (as opposed to TCP) allows for better 
throughput.      I assume (but I'm not certain) that PGPfone works 
the same way.

Unfortunately, most of your other TCP/IP communication will be based 
on TCP packets.  Therefore, it's theoretically possible for your ISP 
to monitor your traffic, watching for large numbers of UDP packets.
