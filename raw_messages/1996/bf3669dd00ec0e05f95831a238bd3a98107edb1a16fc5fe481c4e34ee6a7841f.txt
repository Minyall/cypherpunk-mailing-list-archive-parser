Today the Arizona Department of Motor Vehicles began requiring
proof of citizenship before issuing a drivers license or a state
identification. This policy was established by HB 2154 which passed
this last session (this one slipped passed me).

I am helping organize people in Arizona to oppose this.  Please
send your information ASAP, we need you your help.
