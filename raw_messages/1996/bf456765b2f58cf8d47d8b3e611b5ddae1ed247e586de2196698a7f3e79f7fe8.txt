When you buy Que's current Netscape book (_Special Edition, Using Netscape
3_), the included CD has the US-only, 128-bit, non-export version of
Navigator on it. It's a licensed copy, even! (Of course, the book also has
a small yellow "NOT FOR EXPORT" tag on the back cover, but who's counting?)

For $49, getting a licensed copy of the 128-bit Navigator 3.0 plus a 1000+
page book is a pretty good deal. My hat's off to Netscape for choosing to
put the 128-bit version on the CD, and to Macmillan/Que for bothering to
get the software in the first place. I really do believe that Netscape
wants to get secure software out as widely as possible.

(Disclaimer: I wrote chapter 29 (the intro to JavaScript chapter) for
_Special Edition, Using Netscape 2_. Que reused it, but I don't get paid
any extra. It's a comprehensive book, and the CD has lots of cool stuff on
it too.)
