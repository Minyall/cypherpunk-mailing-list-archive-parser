I'd have to see the bill, but I think it's a good general idea, provided
there's the caveats KNOWINGLY and WITHOUT THEIR [parent/guardian's]
KNOWLEDGE. As much as I hate direct marketers, I don't want them subject
to malicious and arbitrary prosecution because one address out of
thousands happens to belong to a kid. 

On second thought, why are kids different than adults? Selling lists of
women? Gays? Kids aren't the only group subject to harassment.
