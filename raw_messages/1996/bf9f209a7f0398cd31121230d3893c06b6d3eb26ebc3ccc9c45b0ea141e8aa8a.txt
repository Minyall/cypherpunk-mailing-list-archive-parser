Ok, ok... Let me say something, but I don't want anyone to take this wrong. I'm not 
trying to be stupid, but I don't have half the knowledge you all seem to posses. For 
instance what the heck is a TRS-80, DES, or even GAK? I probabl;y know or have heard 
but, I'm not picking up on the three letter words. So, if you could help meout maybe I 
just might be able to start contributing activly to this mailer!
