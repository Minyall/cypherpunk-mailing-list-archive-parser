And there are other equally good algorithms which can also do the job.

A pretty insignificant base actually (at least compared to the internet
as a whole) and supposedly PGP 3.0 will support multiple encryption
methods so maybe the RSA reliance can die the ignoble death it deserves.
One point left out from the original posting is that a Rabin exchange
can use a RSA public key provided that the p and q in the public key are
Blum integers (which also lets you use the public key for probabalistic
PKE, as well as a few other neat tricks), so changing PGP to support
Rabin would not be much of an inconvenience...

Yes, and the most well-defined point is that until September in
the year 2000 you will pay an arm and both legs to use RSA.

A point in favor of non-RSA public-key methods.

You must be joking.  Have you ever tried to deal with RSA lawyers?

True, but Cylink needs to milk their patents for all they are worth for the
remaining 481 days they have left. In a little more than one year they will
not be left with much more than a footnote in the crypto history books.

Best known perhaps, but ElGamal and Rabin have also been studied in depth
(in fact, Rabin is provably as secure as factoring, RSA has not been
proven this secure, it is only assumed that it is.) Most public key methods
fall back to only a handful of real trap-doors, so there is only a limited
amount of vetting to be done (esp. when compared to symmetric encryption
methods.)

Nope, it starts on August 19, 1997.  After that point it becomes possible
to deploy systems using secure public-key crypto worldwide without needing
to pay someone royalties... :)
