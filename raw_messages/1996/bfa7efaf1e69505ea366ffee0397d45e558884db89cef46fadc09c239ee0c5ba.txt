Likely.

Nearly impossible. Why? Because they can only include the public key,
and not the private key, of the GAK authority in the code. You can
encrypt the three bytes of key, but it is very hard for a receiver
other than the govvies to read them. There is no shared secret
information or private information available, ergo, they can't check
their LEAF equivalent.

This is likely where the flaw in the scheme is -- it should be trivial
to drop another public key in place of the government one and foil the
entire thing with minimal effort. All will look normal until someone
tries to use the GAK private key.

Of course, I'll point out that 64 bit RC4 keys are still not
particularly heartwarming...
