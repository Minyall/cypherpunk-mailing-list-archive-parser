The recent issue of the German law journal NJW-CoR contains a
report on the "ICC/BIAC/OECD Business Government Forum
on Global Cryptography" in Washington, D.C., 1996-05-07.

The author claims that the commerce representatives at the
conference said they understood that governments had legitimate
interest in key escrow and that key escrow could have commercial
benefits.

The Japanese government delegation stated that they were shocked
about the American and European plans, because the Japanse
Constitution prohibits mandatory key esrow.

OECD will decide on crypto policy guilelines early in 1997.
