Hello,

We are very curious about security + standard + on the shelf products, because so the market will use more naturally the cryptography.

Do you know if it's possible to use Netscape client (export = 40bits RC4) on an external SSL layer (i.e., with full encryption, RC4 long keys or IDEA)?
Use extra-US implantation (SSL-Leavy or AppacheSSL, etc.) the IDEA option?
It seems that IDEA is no longer supported by SSL 3 (in the cipher suite we see IDEA with RSA but not with D-H).
Are rumors on additional algorithms (e.g., Safer SK128, Blowfish, etc.)?

On the S-HTTP side, are some non-US implantation (browser or server) available or some US-freeware that is smuggled out?

Thanks for your answers.
Jean-Paul
