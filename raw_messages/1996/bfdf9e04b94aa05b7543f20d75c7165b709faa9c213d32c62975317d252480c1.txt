I could see an easy possibility for sting operations with the added 
feature that you can have assassinated all the supected assassins (ie anybody
that may have come near whatever surveillance there may have been).
Why bother with courts and trials? 

I still think assassination politics is self-terminating.

Don't you mean supply? Stores and physical companies are easier to target
than consumers. But the only remaining environmentalists or for that

Usenet flamewars, editorials and talk shows just don't seem dying for, imho.
