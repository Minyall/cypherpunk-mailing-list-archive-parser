I'm watching Jim Bidzos being interviewed on CNBC...mainly about Leahy's
bill (he's in favor of it)....(One of the benefits of having CNBC business
news on all the time while I'm here online.)

He thinks it's a good bill, good for U.S. industry, good for
California...says some of the language in the bill still provides for "key
escrow" of some sort (I think he means the criminal use of crypto
provisions....).

He still thinks customers absolutely do not want any other parties to hold
their keys ("You don't give copies of the keys to your front door or your
filing cabinets to the government now, so why should you just because the
medium changes from filing cabinets to computer form."--paraphrased).

No further word on RSADSI going public, though. (I'm constantly surprised
that this hasn't happened, what will all the later-comers going public, and
the general hyping of "Internet security" (not that it isn't important,
just that it seems that any company with these magic words in its name or
prospectus zooms through the roof on IPO).
