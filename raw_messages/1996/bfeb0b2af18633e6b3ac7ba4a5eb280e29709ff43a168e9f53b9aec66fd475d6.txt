I think something like the first one would be a little bit better. In my
mind I see something similar to the "ESMTP" message appearing on
connection to the mail daemon - "SSLESMTP" if you will. Then client could
issue a "ENCD SSL" command (or whatever) and it would go crypto. I already
have used telnet and FTP clients that does something similar to this, and
they work almost transparently....

Have you looked at SSL? It allows different algorithms to be used, etc.
etc. (although the certificate & key distribution method uses x509, which
may be a pain...?). The SSLeay library is a freely available
implementation of SSLv2.

Just MHO,
