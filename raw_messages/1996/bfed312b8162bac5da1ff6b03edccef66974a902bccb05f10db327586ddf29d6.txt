This is a dangerous position to take.  Many people have killed themselves, accidentally, thinking "the gun isn't loaded!"  

This said, I see nothing wrong with fixing and improving the bill and only then supporting it.

If the Leahy bill "has not a chance in hell" of passing, then what's wrong with CORRECTING it.  Given this assessment,I doubt whether such changes would reduce its chances.

BTW, remember that one of the reasons its chances are rated as "not a chance in hell" is that the two constituencies who might normally support this bill, the crypto/software businesses and ourselves, see its promises as being weak and its negatives as being large. Without them, who else is there to support it?
