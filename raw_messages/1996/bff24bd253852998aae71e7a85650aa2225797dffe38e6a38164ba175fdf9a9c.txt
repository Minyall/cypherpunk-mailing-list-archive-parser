I remember reading this file somewhere...it was satirizing either 
Microsoft or IBM, and in a very serious manner, described a revolutionary 
new compression program that would reduce any file to a size of one 
byte.  However, in order to decompress the file, a larger file containing
all of the information of the original file needed to be attached to it.  
Fun to read...
