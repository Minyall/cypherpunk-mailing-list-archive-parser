Theoretically Simon is right. Nevertheless one-time pads have been broken
through trial and error when they have been reused either out of laziness
or force majeure.

It's not a "monkeys in the British Museum" problem, since when you hit the
right key sequences both encrypted text streams will fall cleanly
out--otherwise the chances are overwhelming (given a decently long run)
that one of the two streams will contain garbles or more likely be complete
gibberish.

It's a pretty simple computer program--all you need is a decent test for
plaintext so you don't have to examine most of the test decryptions.
