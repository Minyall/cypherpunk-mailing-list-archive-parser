Easily disproved.  You can shout a logical proposition/exposition or
you can whisper it, it's just as clear and relevant (if it's really
logical) either way.

Decorum, on the other hand, is somewhat nebulous, which I suppose is
attractive to some....  If it doesn't "feel" good to some subscribers,
they'll ignore it, which must be your point, eh?
