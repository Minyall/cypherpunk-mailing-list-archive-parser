That's another good approach, though a second-string objective compared
to having full-scale terminal remailers running everywhere.
But it's clearly a strong fallback position, and might be easier to
get people to adopt and not turn off.  It does depend on the availability
of a list of working remailers with the correct feature sets,
plus adequate distribution of either PGP keys or some S/MIME-related equivalent.

One way to do that is to parse Raph's list appropriately (and check
signatures on that); another is to have some centralized (sigh) DNS server
do a round-robin distribution so that random.remailer.net picks a
random known-good remailer to deliver through, perhaps also delivering a PGP
key.

I'd far prefer a distributed solution, but this does let people volunteer
to take heat for a little while and dispose of their remailers if they
have to.  In particular, it may be useful for winsock remailers that
are willing to connect up and be a delivery remailer when they're connected
and disconnect when they're unavailable.
