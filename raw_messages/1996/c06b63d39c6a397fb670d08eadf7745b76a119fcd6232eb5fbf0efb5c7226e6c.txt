	As far as I was aware, the manner of currently judging the age of 
people in nude photographs consisted of a usually doctor administered 
examination (of the picture) where the genitals and other age 
characteristics of the BODY were taken into account.  I don't think a 
person's face ever was, or ever should be, a factor.

	Very true.  Next there will be laws banning provocative pictures of
adults dressed in child-like garb or acting out child-like sexual 
fantasies (the infamous "spank me Daddy!).
