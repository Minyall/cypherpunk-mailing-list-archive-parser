I will, however, have to point out, that the IG test was not originally 
developed to measure the response of mentally defective patients to anything.

The first IQ test was developed to gauge the academic progress of school 
children.  That is why the scores are calculated according to age.

Yes, they were at a later date used for what you mentioned, and many 
other things at that.

I agree with everything else you said.
