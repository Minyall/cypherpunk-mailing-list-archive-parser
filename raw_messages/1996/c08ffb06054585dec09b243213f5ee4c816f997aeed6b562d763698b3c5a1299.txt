By sending me unsolicited mail, you have invited the associated expense of
having every recipient bounce the message back to you (maybe sending a courtesy
copy to your postmaster).  If you don't want to wade through 20 megs of mail in
one day, don't send unsolicited email.  I hardly consider this abuse.  If you
have no ethical problem with sending people unsolicited junk to me, I have no
problem sending it right back to you indicating that I don't appreciate the
email.  Sounds fair to me.
