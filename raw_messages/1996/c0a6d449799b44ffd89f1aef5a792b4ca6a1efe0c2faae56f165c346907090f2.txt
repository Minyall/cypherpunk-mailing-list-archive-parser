I have decided to offer a $50/month Unix/Web/POP account that is
good for 50 MB/month of traffic.  After that it is $1/MB of
traffic.  To open the account an initial account balance of $300 is
required (from which monthly and traffic charges will be deducted). 

See http://online.offshore.com.ai/  for more info and to open
an account.
