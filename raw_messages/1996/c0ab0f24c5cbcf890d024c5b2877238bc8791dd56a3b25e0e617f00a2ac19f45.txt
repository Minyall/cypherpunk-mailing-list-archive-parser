I looked at your site with Netscape 3.0 with my Mac. I use 18 point font
which is larger than the default. I like more pixels per character. The
text in the left column is thus truncated. Some web pages that use frames
somehow cause the text to adapt to the available space. I don't know how
html manages this issue.
