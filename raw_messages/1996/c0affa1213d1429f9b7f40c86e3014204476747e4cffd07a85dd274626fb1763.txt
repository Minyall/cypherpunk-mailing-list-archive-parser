Really? The only way I know of forcing a one-time pad is to use a hardware
QM-based random number generator to generate every possible decrypt, thus
creating a number of universes equal to the number of possible keys. Since
you can't tell if you're universe is the right one, one should always
verify the information obtained against a second source. IANAL, so I can't
say if such a decrypt would count as probably cause.
