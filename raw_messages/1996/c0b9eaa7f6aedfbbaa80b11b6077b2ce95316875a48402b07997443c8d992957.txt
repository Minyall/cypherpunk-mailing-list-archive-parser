The above is a nice ideal.  You should of course get a "really good" consultant,
and even better, get one who's "real honest".  But my guess is those guys cost the
most of all, or at the very least, require the most research to find.

The ideal of capping the cost is commendable as well, however, when the consultant
finds midway through the project that his initial estimate (made as carefully as he
possibly can) is way too low, he will now have an incentive to lie, cut corners, etc.,
*particularly* if the customer looks like one of those antsy types who might withhold
payments and so on.

My advice:  Get a consultant to find a good IT consultant.  Seriously.
