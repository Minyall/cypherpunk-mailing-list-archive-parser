ALTERNIC.NIC is a couple of kids with a few Linux boxes.  It's rather amusing,
but they did go through a lot of trouble to make it look good.  Sure,
the new TLD's work if you use their name server.

I thought about actually registering NSA.TEL and MCI.ATT with them for
shits and giggles.  I love the TLD's they have ... BSA, XXX, CAT, DOG ...
it was a good laugh, but it's way past April 1st.
