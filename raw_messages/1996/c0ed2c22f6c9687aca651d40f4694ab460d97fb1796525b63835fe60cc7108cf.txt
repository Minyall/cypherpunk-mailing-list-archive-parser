The problem, as I see it, is that you can have too much information. 
Information takes up room, takes up CPU cycles to process and store and
retrieve, and the worst part is, it takes a human to evaluate it.  No
computer in the world is going to be able to evaluate incoming humint for
reliability.  That takes a human, and I suspect that it will be that way
for quite some time.  The more information you gather, the worse the
problem gets, until you have this massive database of information, all
indexed and stuff, at your fingertips, but it's useless, because you can't
tell whether it's real or BS or disinformation.

"Past the wounds of childhood, past the fallen dreams and the broken families,
through the hurt and the loss and the agony only the night ever hears, is a
waiting soul.  Patient, permanent, abundant, it opens its infinite heart and
asks only one thing of you ... 'Remember who it is you really are.'"
