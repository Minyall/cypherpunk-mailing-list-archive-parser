	Before anyone complains of a lack of crypto relevance to this,
Bernie S is the guy who brought Clipper phones & actual clipper chips
which he convinced Mykrotronix to send him to the HOPE conference in
NYC two years ago.

	These clipper phones added a new argument to the long list
against clipper, and that was the phones barely worked, despite
Bernie's efforts.

	He also gave away one of the two clippers that he brought,
which was destroyed with a small explosive device, showing the truth
of the old saw about there being few problems not solvable with a
suitable application of high explosives. :)

	If any of our writers could be at his sentencing, a little
press attention for the guy would be real helpful.

| 
| I just found out that Bernie S. will be sentenced this Friday morning
| at 9 am in Easton, PA for the crime of removing batteries from a tone
| dialer several years ago. This is defined as a victimless misdemeanor
| for which the judge in this small town (under considerable influence
| from the Secret Service) set bail at $250,000. He could get two years
| in prison at sentencing. Press attention could be very helpful in
| avoiding a sentence as irrational as the bail setting - right now the
| only influence these people are getting is from the Secret Service and
| they want to put Bernie S away for as long as they can. If you're not
| entirely up to date on this story, finger bernies@2600.com for all of
| the details.
| 
| If you know of anyone who will cover this story, please get ahold of
| them right away so they can plan on being there. If anyone is
| interested
| in going, let me know so we can hopefully fill some cars from NYC.
| 
| Sentencing is scheduled for Friday, January 26 at 9 am
| Courtroom 5
| Northampton County Government Center
| 7th and Washington Street
| Easton, PA 18042-7492

| case # 2173-1993
| The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania vs. Edward E. Cummings
| Misdemeanor 2 - tampering with physical evidence
