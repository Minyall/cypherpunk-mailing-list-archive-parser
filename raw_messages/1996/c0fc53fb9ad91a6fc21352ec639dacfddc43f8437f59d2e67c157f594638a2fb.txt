Didn't see either of those flicks, but saw "The Cable Guy" a week 
ago. Actually has more 'net relevance, even though no one there uses 
the 'net.  If you imagine the utopian 'everything delivered by cable' 
(phone, TV, 'net, video games, shopping, etc.) and mix with the power 
a psychotic and corrupt cable installer has, the plot has potential. 
(It's actualisation was something else, though.)

The movie is apparently such a flop that it turned out the group of 
friends I was with were the only people who wanted to see it that 
day, so we had the theatre all to ourselves.  A rare opportunity 
indeed... I only with the movie was worse than it actually was so we 
could have made it into a kind of MST3K thing... but it actually held 
our interest.
