All of the Libertarian blah about "let us do whatever we want" is just great, huh?

What if I want to live in a dry county, and some "new" people move in and want to
start up liquor sales?  I guess I have to move to get away from these people, huh?
I get tired of running away, and I say, if you want liquor, porno, etc., go somewhere
else for it.  San Francisco would be good.

So what's the problem with alcohol and liquor?  Somebody is gonna hurt themselves?
Who gives a shit? (unless they hurt someone else, of course, and they usually do).

And please, let's not fall into the con of believing that Chris Reeve or Mr. Brady (of 
Brady Bill fame) are the central issue in welfare initiatives, once the government gets 
involved.  When the government gets involved, it's after they've already studied the 
pros and cons (i.e., how much profit can we make, and what's our liability risk?), and
Brady and Reeve and all the other lifty-blinkys can go take a hike as far as Joe 
CongressGraftPerson is concerned.
