A lot of people talk about Dining Cryptographers networks, but I'm not
aware of more than an occasional test implementation - the concept is
simple, but getting all the details right is a lot of work,
including things like collision detection, and there aren't a lot of
good uses for the things to motivate development, even though they
are basically cool.  

One design approach is to use IRC; another is email.
IRC probably requires that all the participants be on simultaneously,
or requires a coordination system to handle whoever's on right now.

Rather than doing Base256, just XOR the bytes; you get the speed of
doing things a byte or word at a time, while still getting bitwise changes.
