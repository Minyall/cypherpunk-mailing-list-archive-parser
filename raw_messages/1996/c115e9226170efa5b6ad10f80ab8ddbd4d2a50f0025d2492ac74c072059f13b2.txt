  If I wanted to export an unexportable program, I would put it on my
machine
as 'happyface.zip', and then make sure that god-and-everybody spread the
word
that it was available under that title.
  I don't believe there is a prosecutor alive that can convince a jury
of twelve
mostly non-technically oriented people that someone should be put in
prison for
not knowing the content of every single non-text file on their machine.
