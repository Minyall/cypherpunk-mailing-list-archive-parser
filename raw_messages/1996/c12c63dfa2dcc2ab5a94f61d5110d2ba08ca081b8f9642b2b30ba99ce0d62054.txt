A list such as this? I hung out with the radicals at Kent State in 1970,
hobnobbed with KKK guys in S.E. Tennessee, spent time with the ultra-
liberal crowd in the west L.A. area, and associated with Liberty Lobby
(Carto, IHR) people for a while as well.

You might be surprised at my politics, but then again, what is my
politics?  You can select/accumulate a point of view, but I'll wager
that you can get a better understanding of people of all stripes if
you spend time with them, rather than reading about them.  Ideas are
important, they're great to have and believe in, but don't let ideas
lead you into supporting the great massacre machine of current-day
politics.  It's a fool's bet.

Uncle Miltie said it best at the end of a 90-minute comedy special on
PBS:  "What's it all about?  Life."  (followed by an extremely funny
quip about an uncle doing life in Sing-Sing).  God bless Uncle Miltie.
