It's kludgy, I agree, but that's the way the example PGP translator for our
mailer that some of us are using works right now. If someone rewrites that
part of it, I'm sure we'd all be happy to switch. Dunno if there's an easy
patch with ResEdit. (It's for the Mac.)

In my own case I used it to clearsign my first few posts here to avoid
somebody popping up and claiming a spoof. I don't plan to do it regularly.
