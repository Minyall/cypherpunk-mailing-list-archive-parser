What does your six-year-old have to do with my TV?

But what about *my* TV?  Why should I be forced to pay for something I
don't want just because you want it for yourself?  [ Why does this
seem so obvious? ]

Oh, OK then.  Parents should be given access to incendiary equipment
as a tool to destroy the studios that produce offensive material.

Parents should be given guns and ammunition with which to kill anybody
that gets in the way of their success at raising their children.

Parents should be given unlimited amounts of cash so that they will be
able to achieve success in raising their children.

Give me a break.
