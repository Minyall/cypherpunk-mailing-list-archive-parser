You can't prove a negative.  The best IPG could say is that
it can't be broken with current technology.
Next week someone might come up with a new way
to break ciphers that renders the IPG algorithim breakable.

You point could have been that the same problem exists
for proofs- that next week someone could come up
with a way to prove, for all time, that an algorithim
really IS unbreakable.  So, to cover that posibility
I should have said "it's currently impossible to
prove an algorithim unbreakable". :-)
