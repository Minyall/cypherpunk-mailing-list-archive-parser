Actually, there were excellent reasons.

First, there was no evidence the Iraqis had any ability to use GPS of any
sort (I suspect the odd unit existed in Iraq, but not enough of them to be
useful in any meaningful sense.)

Second, the military bought a huge pile of _consumer_-grade GPS units,
e.g., from Trimble Navigation, to fill a shortage of military-grade units
(because of the rapid build-up in ground forces).

The reasons for turning off S/A made perfect sense.
