I thought I'd contribute some noise to the cypherpunks list too, so here
goes. Why not just subscribe to the PGPdomo list, and see what the 
traffic is like for a couple days? Its not like you will be locked into 
the mailing list forever.

FYI the traffic on the PGPdomo list has been very low lately. I haven't
received a message from the list in a few days. But then again there is
even more 'noise' on that list because every message I've seen posted on
it talks about PGPdomo, the mailing list, getting PGP software to work,
etc.. From what I've seen people just sign up to test it out with a test
message, and thats about it. Even with mkpgp for pine its still a bit
inconvenient to use, I think thats the reason for the low-traffic.
