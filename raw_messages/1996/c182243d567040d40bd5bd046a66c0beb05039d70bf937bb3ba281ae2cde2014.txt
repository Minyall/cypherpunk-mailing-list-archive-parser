Actually, Declan, it's not.  "info cypherpunks" in the body of a message to
majordomo@toad.com yields the welcome message to the list -- the closest
thing to a charter available.  The subjects of censorship and free speech
are neither mentioned nor alluded to anywhere within that document.

The subjects of censorship & free speech do bear some relationship to the
list's expressed subject and are certainly near and dear to most cypherpunk
hearts.  The government cannot prevent us from discussing the implications 
of privacy enabled by strong crypto.  

Free speech & censorship may even be interesting, entertaining, & important
topics -- hence their consistent recurrance in discussions.  But the above 
assertion is factually wrong.
