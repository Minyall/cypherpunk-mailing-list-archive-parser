I am assuming that you mean that DSS has a phone line attached and can
call home. If this is merely a two way satelite communication it isn't
useful for this purpose.

You mean, perhaps the pirates would have to distribute keys over the
internet or some such? How horrid.

The problem is, as I said, insoluble. You cannot defend against
hostile users of the system because each user gets the same encrypted
data stream.

And could be updated to millions of people getting the signal
illegally via the same mechanism.

No one said it wasn't subject to being tracked down, although the use
of offshore packet laundries might make it hard. Cellphone fraud is
subject to being tracked down, too, and yet it happens to the tune of
billions a year.
