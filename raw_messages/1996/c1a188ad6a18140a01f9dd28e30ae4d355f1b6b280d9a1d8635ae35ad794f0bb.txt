The problem with the PGP keyserver at jpunix.com has been corrected. It
turned out to be a corrupted keyring. The keyserver is once again
available via email at pgp-public-keys@jpunix.com as well as by WWW from
www.jpunix.com. The WWW interface uses Bal's PGP WWW interface. I
apologize for the downtime and the inconvenience. On the up side, I didn't
lose any key requests during the downtime. 

 John Perry - perry@alpha.jpunix.com -  PGP-encrypted e-mail welcome!
 WWW - http://www.jpunix.com
 PGP 2.62 key for perry@jpunix.com is on the keyservers.
