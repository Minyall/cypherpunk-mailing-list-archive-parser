This is correct.  I believe there are some UNIX flavors under which U.S. PGP
can generate 2048 bit keys.  However, most only allow 2047 bit keys.  The
international version does not have this bug.

I really don't see the point of using a key larger than 2048 bits.  Any larger
key would actually be harder to factor than brute forcing the IDEA keyspace.
Very little security would be gained from using a key larger than 3000 bits.
Of course, one can always argue that improved factoring methods would require
that an RSA public key be longer than 3000 bits to have equal security to
IDEA.  However, I doubt that factoring methods will improve that much.  A
2048 bit key should be more than enough security for most applications.
