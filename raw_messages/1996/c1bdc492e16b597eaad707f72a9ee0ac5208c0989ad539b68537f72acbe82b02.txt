BTW, whatever you do, don't use the "Anarchist's Cookbook" as some sort of
reference for explosives.  The boneheads who wrote that section of AC didn't
even seem to know about the Munroe Effect, the original basis for the
concept more commonly known as "shaped charges."

It goes downhill from there.
