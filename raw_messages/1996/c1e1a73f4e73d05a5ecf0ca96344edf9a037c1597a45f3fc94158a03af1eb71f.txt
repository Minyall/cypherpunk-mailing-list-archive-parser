There is no requirement that you list a home address just as there is no
requirement that you have a home.  A mailing address anywhere on earth is
sufficient for tax purposes.  The form *says* home address but no one's
done any time for not putting one on the form (right Brian).  Proving that
you had another home than the one listed on the date you filled out the
form is beyond the capability of even the federal government.  The
instructions even say "use P.O. Box only if the Post Office doesn't deliver
mail to your home" but don't say anything about mail receiving services and
so forth.  If you know how, you can even wander into most rural post
offices and get a P.O. box in an area that doesn't have home delivery
without living in the vicinity or proving it.  Addresses are much too
slippery things to control very well with the US model.
