Well, in Europe you could just buy a 40$ hardware (DCF-77 receiver) which
syncs with the standardized broadcasted atomic clock. you could sync the
stations every second with an accuracy of better than 10^-3 secs, like a
GPS, only much cheaper. (although, you wouldn't know you geographic location ;-)
