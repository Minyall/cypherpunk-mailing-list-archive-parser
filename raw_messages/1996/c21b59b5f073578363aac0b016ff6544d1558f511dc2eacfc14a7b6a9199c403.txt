DSA is based on El-Gamal, not the other way round. Although it is likely 
that a future version of PGP will include these algorithms the problem 
arises from the Diffie-Helleman patent and not the RSA patent. When this 
expires in 1997 it is certain that many products using public key 
cryptosystems will be avaliable in an unrestricted fashion.
