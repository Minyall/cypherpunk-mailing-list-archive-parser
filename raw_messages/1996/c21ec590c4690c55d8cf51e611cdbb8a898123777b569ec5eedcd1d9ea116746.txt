    I have never been able to cause more than a mild performance 
degredation by pinging a Windows 95 machine with large packets.  When 
testing the idea I kept increasing the packet size until the machine no 
longer responded, but the machine still had TCP/IP capabilities (in terms 
of transmitting data and forming connections).  Ping flooding is another 
matter though.  You probably could cause a larger performance drop.
