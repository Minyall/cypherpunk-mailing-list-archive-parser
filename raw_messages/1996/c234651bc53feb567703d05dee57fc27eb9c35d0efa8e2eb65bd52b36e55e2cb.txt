So would you be willing to pay $50.00 for this message you sent to  
cypherpunks?  If there are a thousand recipients and each one charges $0.05  
for the priveledge of you sending it e-mail....  It seems like such a scheme  
would not only cripple spam, but public discussion lists like this one.
