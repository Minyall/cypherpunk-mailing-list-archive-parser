   US prosecutor attacks bank secrecy laws

   By Clay Harris

 Mr John Moscow, assistant district attorney for Manhattan:

 "Bank secrecy statutes in international finance are used by
   crooks, tax evaders, securities fraudsters, and capital
   flight fellows; they are used by narcotics dealers. But
   they are not needed by honest folks engaged in honest
   transactions."

Now the last time I looked, 'Capital Flight' was as legal as church on a
Sunday.  Or is this a proposal for exchange controls.  Is this guy a state
or federal prosecutor?  He was also unable to come up with legitimate
reasons for $3 Billion to go from Egypt to the Bahamas.  I can think of any
one of a number of legal reasons, one being "International Tax Planning."
