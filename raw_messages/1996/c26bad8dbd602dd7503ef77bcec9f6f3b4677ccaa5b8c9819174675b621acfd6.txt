You missed the fun part of his post - it's that ping packets return the
data they were pinged with, so the US-end host is re-exporting components of
PGP.

given that it pings scarcely reach the machine's consciousness, much less
the human users', since they're handled by ICMP rather than by a user-space
TCP or UDP
socket.  (Obviously, if there's a sniffer around this is slightly different.)

Is it possible to send out forged ping packets, pinging machine B with a From
address of C (fake) instead of A (real), so that Alice can talk to China via
Bob?
If so, it might be an interesting method for traversing some firewalls,
and also (if you write a ping-collector program) for back-channel
communications.

If you want to really abuse the protocols, 53 bytes probably fits into the
64 you can send in a ping, so you could implement ATM-over-ICMP :-)
