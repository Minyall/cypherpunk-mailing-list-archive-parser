	As I understand it, ecash shouldn't be withdrawn until shortly before it
is spent.  If the RSA algorithm is broken, then then banks could refuse the
withdrawal (and depositing) of money as ecash.  The remainder of the money in
each users' account would have to be withdrawn through conventional methods.

	Of course all the outstanding (between withdrawl and deposit) ecash
could be a problem.
