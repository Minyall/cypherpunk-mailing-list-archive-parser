I have seen the text of the speech.  The wire service accounts wildly,
wildly exaggerate.  This is a non-story...except for AG Reno's assertion
that it would take the government a year to break one DES message with a
"supercomputer".  She presumably believes this.  We know the number for
known plaintext attacks, but assuming you don't have a known plaintext,
what's a more reasonable assumption?
