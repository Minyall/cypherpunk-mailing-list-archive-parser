Has NE1 heard of these things? Supposedly you plug it into your printer
port and it shows you your brain waves so you can try to reach "alpha"
waves or something. I think they cost around $500.
If it`s for real you could do some neat things with it; how bout your
computer waking up when you wake up...
	that terminator 2 plot comes closer every day....
NEway if anybody knows anything about it let`s have it.
