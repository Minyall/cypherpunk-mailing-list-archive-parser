Things are sufficiently different that such a comparison might not be
meaningful anyway.  For example, subtracting subsistence level food, and then
figuring tax rates would give a different answer. 

The amount of work it takes to provide basic needs now is clearly
very low by historical standards.  Government is big by historical standards.
