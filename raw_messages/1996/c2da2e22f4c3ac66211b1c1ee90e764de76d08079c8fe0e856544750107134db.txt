  As the quote went "It goes something like this...Not *exactly* like this
  but something...".
  
  What netscape does is to receive a signed public key, encrypt the session key,
  & return *that*. The session is then encrypted with a fast symmetric algo.
  (RC4-40 Netsape/export, IDEA - PGP). So PGP/scape would do exactly the same
  thing with trivial changes to the monkey-motion.
  
  Now Government approved PGP/BE - something to strive for 8*).
