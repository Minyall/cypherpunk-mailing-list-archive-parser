My point is not about the variance of seals and certificates (I have at 
least 6 different ones prove it from 4 different states). That is a 
given. It is that prints have been a generally accepted practice for some 
time now. IF you want to make the case and go back to the early days 
(pre-WWII), then people like attila and a few others don't have them - 
and I'll concede the point on that basis.

The information I received has come from inquiries to folks I know within 
the AMA, several different hospital adminstration staff in various states 
- whose job it is to handle such affairs, and few other people who make 
it their business to know such trivia. IF the information is in error, 
I'll gladly accept correct input. Next time, don't be so quick to accuse 
without inquirying to context. I'm not J.Bell.
