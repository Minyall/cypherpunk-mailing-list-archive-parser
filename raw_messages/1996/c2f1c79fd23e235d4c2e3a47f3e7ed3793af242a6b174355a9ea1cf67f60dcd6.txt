Am I the only one to notice the striking similarities between the actions of
the SG gubment (kill kill kill) and the self-appointed censors who keep
inventing new classes of 'inappropriate' Usenet articles for which they
forge cancels? First they forged cancels for any materials which was
reposted too many times, then binaries cross-posted in non-binary
newsgroups (supposedly cross-posting wastews bandwidth), then any
articles with "cracking" information on breaking copy-protection...
