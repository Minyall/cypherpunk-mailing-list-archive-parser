 My use of "assert" in the above paragraph is quite different. "Tell"
applies to the act I'm discussing. "assert" refers to your comment about
the act. As for your complaint about "should", it and tell are consistent
with my meaning which was, to be more precise:

Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth Edition:

"tell...1. count, enumerate; 2. to relate in detail, narrate, give
utterance to;
3. to make known, divulge, reveal; 4. to report to, inform; 5. order,
direct; 6. to find out by observing, recognize.

I used meaning 5 in the comment you asked about.

As to your tone and subsequent remarks, this conversation is now closed.
You may have the last word. To be sure I don't inadvertently continue it
with you,...

Plonk!

David
