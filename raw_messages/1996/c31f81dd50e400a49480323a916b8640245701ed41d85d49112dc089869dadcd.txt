Here's a bit of the US license agreement for the ecash software that some
of you may have missed:

> The downloaded software is licensed only for and will be used only for
> your internal testing as part of the aforementioned experiment, subject
> to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and will not be
> sublicensed or made available to any third party or used directly or
> indirectly for revenue generating or commercial purposes.

Note that last clause.  It seems (probably due to the client using RSAREF,
or something like that) that using the ecash software "directly or
indirectly for revenue generating or commercial purposes" is illegal.

Someone might want to fix that...
