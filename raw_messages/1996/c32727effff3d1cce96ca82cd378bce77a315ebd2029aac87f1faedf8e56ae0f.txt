Very true, but many totalitarian countries don't try to hide it.

Q: are surveillance tools (sophisticated analysys and search engines, 
miniature cameras and microphones and other electronics) under the 
same countrols as crypto? de facto controls or on paper only?  It 
would seem that 'emerging democracies' in the East Bloc can obtain 
sophisticated Western tech to strengthen and hide surveillance 
systems (perhaps in ways that even J.Edgard Hoover would have found 
repulsive, if that was possible).  I wonder if anyone has any stats 
about foreign countries or orgs purchasing such equipment.

Yet another arg for liberal crypto-export rules, perhaps.

Rob.
