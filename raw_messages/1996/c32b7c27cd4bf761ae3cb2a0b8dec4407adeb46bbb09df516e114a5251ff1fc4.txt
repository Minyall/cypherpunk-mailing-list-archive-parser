Did anyone read the cover article in last months US Wired? About why Walter
Wriston , the ex-head
of Citibank, is acting like a cypherpunk????

I can't believe that a man responsible for countless third world deaths is
being called a cypherpunk
by Wired!!! Citibank is a major player in the third world debt
crisis...this seems to be news for
Thomas Bass, who interviewed him...then Bass goes on to ask if "Walter" has
made any "bad loans"
ie to dictators and other nasty sorts....jeez sorry but there's naivity and
there's stupidity

....seems like very few people know who or what cypherpunks are - good or bad?
