Sorry about the press-release'ish language - twas not my intention.  I
would say (b), with happy customers and (a) being the goal.  The service
we provide incurs significant expenses, mainly because of the bandwidth
involved, and we just need to make sure the cost of these expenses is
being recovered in a fair way, before we grow any more.
