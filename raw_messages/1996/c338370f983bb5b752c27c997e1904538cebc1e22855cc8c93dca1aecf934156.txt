Not really.  What about the `unbreakable OTP' system challenge that
went through this list a couple of months ago?  ``Break our algorithm,
and we sell you the company for $1''.  The algorithm was broken, and
the vendor slithered away never to be heard from again (but did not
sell the worthless company).

It's a good metric.
