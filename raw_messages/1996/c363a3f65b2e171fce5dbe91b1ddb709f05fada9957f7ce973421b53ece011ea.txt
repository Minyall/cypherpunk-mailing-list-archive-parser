I note that the cypherpunks subscriptions are down to 1262 as of 18 Dec.,
compared to 1299 on 30 Nov., 1353 on 04 Nov., and 1361 on 12 Oct.

Is there an assumption that we really have politics as usual, nowadays in
the U.S.?  Or could it be that there has been a fundamental change, where
the leadership has been decapitated via assassinations, both literal and
of character?

Out of curiosity, I asked around myself, beginning with some entrepreneurs
who made it up the hard way.  I expected the same as c-punks, i.e.,
"the hell with those bastards", etc.  No such luck.  The White Folk here
in Orange County (those who are doing well, which is most of them) think
this is a great idea.
