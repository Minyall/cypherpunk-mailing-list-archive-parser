Pardon my French, but you mus be fucking stupid or somehing.  How many
universities use UNIX platforms?  How many companies use UNIX platforms?
Sun, DEC, and SGI don't stay in buisiness by building cheap Windows boxes
ya know.  There are 13948 _registered_ LINUX machines, not to mention the
unregistered ones.  Don't tell me that Cray's were designed to run MacOS
or Windows 95.  UNIX isn' NEARLY as dead as Apple is.
