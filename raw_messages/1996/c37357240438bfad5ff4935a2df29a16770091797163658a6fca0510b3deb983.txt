Wow! If we could get you to get all the ATM terminals to contribute spare
CPU cycles to DES-busting, this'd be really great!

I doubt customers would mind having to wait an extra second or two while
the ATM finishes whatever it's doing. (And maybe if the DES bust is
successful while a customer is waiting, he could be awarded with an extra
$20 bill.)

Better than a DES-busting screensaver.
