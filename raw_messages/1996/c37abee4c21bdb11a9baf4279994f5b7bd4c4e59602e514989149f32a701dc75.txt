With you so far.  (Though Holmes is by no means the litmus by which
today's legal world tests its process).

Now you jumped the argument a bit.  There is a difference in holding
someone to a reasonable standard generally, and defining several standards
based on the experience of the person to which the standard is being
applied.

This latter approach is often called (jokingly by some) the Objective
Subjective Standard.  (Objective standard being without consideration of
the view of the individual being judged, subjective including that view,
and object subjective being the consideration of what the general class of
individual would do without consideration of the individual's specific
view).

(What would a reasonable virus writer do is distinct from what a
reasonable Bob Dwyer, Ph.D. Computer science might do is distinct from
what a reasonable person might do).

Many courts reject higher (or lower- there are arguments for this 
too) standards of care for experts than for lay persons or other
non-experts in tort cases, prefering to impose the "reasonable person"
(Reasonable man for those of you who went to law school before 1985)
standard universially.

If there is interest, I will post exerpts of the arguments on both sides
of this issue with the header [Noise].
