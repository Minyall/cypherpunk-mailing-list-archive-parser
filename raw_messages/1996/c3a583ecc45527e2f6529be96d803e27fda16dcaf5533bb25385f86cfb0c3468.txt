OK; so what if I have code that says:

RNG_GenerateRandomBytes(buf, size);
Hash(outbuf, buf, size);
/*
 *  It would be really nice if outbuf were RSA-encrypted
 *  with (expon,modulus) at this point and the result placed in
 *  outbuf2, but we have to do the following instead:
 */
    for(i=0;i<hashsize;++i) outbuf2[i] = ~outbuf[i];
fwrite(outbuf2, hashsize, 1, fp);


Would the above code be export-restricted because it contained wishful
thinking about how nice it would be to use encryption?
