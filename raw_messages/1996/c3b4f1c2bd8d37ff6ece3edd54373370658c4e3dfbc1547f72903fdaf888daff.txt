Just what they want, anyway -- make cypherpunks look like villins.

I think you used your judgement well in this case.

There are many places to start learning about firewalls and UNIX security.
I recommend the _Building Internet Firewalls_ O'reilly book, as well as
_Practical UNIX & Internet Security_ as well.  I don't feel right about
spoon feeding cracking info to someone like this.

(PS:  The animal on the _Building Internet Firewalls_ book is hidden
behind the gates.  It is a Trojan Horse.  I heard this secondhand.)
