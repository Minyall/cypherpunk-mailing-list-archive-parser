During the Free Banking Era, banks and companies issued their own
dollars.  I believe that at that time the dollar was defined in
terms of a certain weight of gold.

The value of any dollar you might be holding was related to the
level of confidence in the institution that issued it.  Books were
published which recorded the "exchange rate" between each kind of
dollar.

This is very similar to Congress licensing private mints.
