I just took my first flight with a laptop (USair), and, having heard
stories like the above, was wondering how "on" the laptop would have to
be (past the powerup password check?  I hope they're not expecting
Windoze...).

My laptop was in my backpack, which I had oriented so that the large
face of the laptop was vertical.  It thus presented a very small cross
section to their X-ray machine, and they didn't even ask me about it.
