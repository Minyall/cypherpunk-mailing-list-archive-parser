I'm looking for more information on the KOH Virus, a 'helpful' virus which
kindly asks to infect your system and encrypt all of your data. It spreads
to floppies (upon request) and to other systems, encrypting all files. 

I read about it in Boardwatch magazine, which surprisingly states that the
U.S. government forbids the distribution of all cryptographic programs in
binary form; source code can be freely distributed.

Please point me towards the source/binary, or further information.

a 0)(cons(integer->char(modulo a 256))(u(quotient a 256)))'()))(define(s a)(if
(null? a)0(+(char->integer(car a))(* 256(s(cdr a))))))(define(r a x n)(cond((=
0 x)1)((even? x)(modulo(expt(r a(/ x 2)n)2)n))(#t(modulo(* a(r a(1- x)n))n))))

           "SGI and Linux both run Motif and X11.  They both compile c++
                cleanly (using gnu g++). They're the same!"
