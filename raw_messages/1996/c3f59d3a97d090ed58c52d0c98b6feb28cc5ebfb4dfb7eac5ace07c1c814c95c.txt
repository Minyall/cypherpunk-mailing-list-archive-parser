Actually, they call it the Molson Web Canadianizer, but it looks like an 
anonymizer to me.  You give it a URL and the Canadianizer grabs the URL 
and adds some funny canadian modifications to the page, and sends it back 
to you.  It changes all the links to link through the canadianizer, also, 
which is convenient. 

This page originally allowed you to specify a url, but now it seems they 
only allow you to click and grab a random page. Specifying the address to 
connect to in your browser will solve this though.. Heres the URL:


http://www.molson.com/cgi-bin/cize?url=http://www.your.site.com/the/url
