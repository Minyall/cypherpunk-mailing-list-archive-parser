This is the sort of bullshit that gets companies in trouble.  Netscape has
a good record of responding to and fixing security problems.  Why should
they feel the need to do spin control?  This borders on lying.

If the hole is there, hackers will distribute toolkits that will let even
comparitively unskilled people exploit it.  Here in Chicago, there is a
group of hackers that teaches organized classes on how to break into
systems, and they give their students toolkits.

Anything you can do with a computer can be automated.  If there's a 
difficult way to hack into a machine, someone can put it in a box that 
makes it easy.
