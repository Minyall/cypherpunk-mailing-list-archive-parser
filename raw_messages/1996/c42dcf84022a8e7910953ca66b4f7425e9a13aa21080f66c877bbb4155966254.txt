I put a copy of the stuff that I found at http://www.dole-kemp.org/ at
http://www.c2.net/~campbell/www.dole-kemp.org/

Basically, there was very little to the content:  a couple of pages
and a few images.  The link to the Clinton-Core page was through
http://www.dole-kemp.com/ (Note .com rather than .org) where one of
the links there redirects immediately to
http://www.cg96.org/new/index2.htm
