No, no, this is all wrong. There's a guy named Lance Deitweller and he has
fun posting as different people and posting under different names. Sometimes
Lance's different personalities (he calls them "tentacles") even argue with
one another!

These posters have been definitevely shown to be Lance's tentacles:
Alan Olsen (Lance posing as friend of vegetables)
"Dr." David Sternlight
Igor Chewed-Off
Jim Bell (talk.politics.assassination)
Black Unicorn
"Tim May" (Lance is pretending to be senile)
Vladimir Z. Nuri (Lance's parody of a Brighton Beach Sovok)

None of these people are real in any sense. It's just Lance playing games.

As for the creative misspellings of my family name, Igor Ch. used to have
a collection: Vulvis, Vilus, Vul(gar)is, what you get when you cross a
vulva and a penis, etc, etc. Igor will probably post whatever I missed.

ObGodwin: David C [no dot] Lawrence is a Nazi.
