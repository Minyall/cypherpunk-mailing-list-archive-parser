This instrumentalist conspiracy theory is a bit of a leap beyond the facts. 
They were spammed. The content of the spam was political. They responded
quite stupidly. There is no evidence that they were looking for "an excuse
to muzzle their students." 

They should "clarify" the policy, which everyone who would be expected to
enforce it opposes, within two weeks. Commercial speech might take longer.
