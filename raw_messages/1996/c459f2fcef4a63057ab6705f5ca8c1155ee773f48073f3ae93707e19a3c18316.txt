How about this idea for improving the remailer network:

Every remailer is marked as either IN or OUT, not both. An IN remailer
accepts mail from anybody but remails only to other remailers (IN or OUT).
An OUT remailer never remails to another remailer, only to final recipient
addresses.

If an IN remailer finds itself as the last one in the chain then it picks
an OUT remailer at random to send the message through.

This way there would never be any abuse complaints on IN remailers because
they are invisible. When an OUT remailer is taken out nobody gets hurt
because OUT remailers will never be used in reply blocks.
