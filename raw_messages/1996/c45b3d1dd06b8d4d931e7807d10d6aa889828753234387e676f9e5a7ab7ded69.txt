     As long as you are enforcing it on everyone, I don't think you'd have a 
problem, but to force some one from cooking food for homeless people, and 
allow a family barbeque, is IMO wrong. If it is unsafe/unsanitary to cook 
food in a certain way, it is unsafe/unsanitary. Selective enforcement is 
wrong. 

     Force the yuppies on a sunday afternoon barbeque to get a permit and 
see how long the law lasts.
