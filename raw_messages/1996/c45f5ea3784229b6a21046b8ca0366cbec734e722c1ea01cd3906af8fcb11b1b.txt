We should not cut the Administration slack on the basis of some
carefully spun comment by Al Gore's handlers.

We're going to win this one for ourselves.  The fact that the White House
has begun the process of backing away from their own case through ol' Al 
should not, and will not, change my mind.

If you're going to give them credit for anything, give them credit for
directing the Justice dept. to state that they were opposed to Exon's
ideas very early on in the game.  (even if that position became amazingly
low profile when faced with the certainty of the rest of the telecomm bill)
