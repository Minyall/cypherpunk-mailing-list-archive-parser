I've posed similar questions to friends and aquaintences.  The
working-class stiffs (who can't easily hide from the IRS) feel taxes are an
unwelcome but necessary burden in order to provide the blanket of
government protection they feel exists.  They resent and oppose widespread
tax fraud.  Self-employed tend to be more open to 'alternative' income
structuring.
