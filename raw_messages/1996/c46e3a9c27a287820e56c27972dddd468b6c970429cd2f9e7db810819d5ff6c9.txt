MSP (Minneapolis/St. Paul) security personnel have let my work laptop
through security 3 times in the last couple of months.  In the past
year, I have carried it through Kansas City, Atlanta, Louisville,
Dallas/Ft. Worth and San Antonio without anything more than an x-ray
screening (which would only turn up a non-laptop, anyway).  On the
occasions I've seen somebody else getting the "boot scan", it's never
gone past the BIOS screen.  Airport security personnel, as a class, are
completely ignorant about computers.  I've gotten more flack for a knife
in my belt buckle. (a lot more, actually, but that's another story...)
