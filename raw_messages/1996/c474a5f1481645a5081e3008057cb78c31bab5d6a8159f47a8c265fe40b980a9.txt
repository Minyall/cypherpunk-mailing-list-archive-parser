Hm, how about using two public-key algorithms simultaneously (ie,
providing signatures made using two algorithms with each coins)?  This
way, if one algorithm gets broken, there would be supposedly enough time
to make a transition to another method or at least honor the issued ecash.

Just curious.

Another question: what happens to the ecash issued by a bank if it's
secret keys get stolen?

Thanks,
