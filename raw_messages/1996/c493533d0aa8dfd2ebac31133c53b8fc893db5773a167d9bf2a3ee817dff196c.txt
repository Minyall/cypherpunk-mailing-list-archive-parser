Has anybody out there done any significant analysis of the RC4 stream
cipher?  What I am interested in is the expected cycle length of the 
standard implementation (256 byte state table)?  Working with the reduced
sizes, the cycle length appears to grow exponentially, but I am unsure how
to verify this.  

Have there been any other results surfacing besides the reports on weak keys?

thx.
