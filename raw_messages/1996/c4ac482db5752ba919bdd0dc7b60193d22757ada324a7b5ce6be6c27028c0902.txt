The URL would still be visible in your ISP's http log and, in som cases, to
other users of the ISP. You'd have to cont on low traffic and little
interest from other users in your ISP from browsing the world-readable bits
of your home directory.

A case of an ISP closing someone's account because of an objection to an
unliked gif was sent to Declan's fight-censorship list a few days ago.
