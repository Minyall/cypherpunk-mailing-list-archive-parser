I've made Decense v0.10 alpha available publically. There's a few
non-critical things to be fixed and plenty of features to be added.
I have other obligations at the moment, so I can't spare anymore time
right now to polish it up. If you're a perl hacker, take a look at it.


The Decense Project homepage is http://www.clark.net/pub/rjc/decense.html
You can retrieve the tarfile there.

Have fun, and Write Code!
