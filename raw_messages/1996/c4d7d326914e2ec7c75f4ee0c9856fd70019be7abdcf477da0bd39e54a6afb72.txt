Someone or something bogusly subscribed a bunch of people to the
cypherpunks list.  Please don't post any more messages running down
the "newbies".  None of these people subscribed; they were victims of
a nasty prank.

I just removed 237 people from the c'punks and c'punks-announce lists
who appear to have been subscribed by email forgery.  I probably
missed a few.  For the folks who are getting this message and who don't
want to be on the cypherpunks list(s), it's easy to unsubscribe.  Send
email to:

	majordomo@toad.com

that contains these lines:

	unsubscribe cypherpunks
	unsubscribe cypherpunks-announce

Sorry for any hassle,

	John
