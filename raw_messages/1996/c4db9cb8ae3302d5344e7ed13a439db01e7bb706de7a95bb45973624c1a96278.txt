I'd have to disagree on that point.  Monitoring cellular traffic requires
nothing more than a cellular phone, and some software which enables
you to follow calls through the cells, for a total cost of about $500. 
This is exceptionally trivial with an Oki 900 and a ctek cable (which 
interfaces the fone with the computer).  
With this software you can monitor individual cells, choosing to "lock
on" to a call made from a specific number, or to a specific number.  You
can follow calls, and record any dtmf digits.  Also the caller will never 
be made aware that he/she is being listened to.  
A sophisticated land line wiretap that will not be detectable by the 
average citizen will cost well over $500, plus you have to install it 
without the target knowing, etc.
