I've just seen a note to the effect that the (Australian) Senate Economics
References Committee has recommended, in their recently tabled report
quaintly entitled _Connecting You Now...Telecommunications to the Year
2000_ the establishment of a third party body for the management of public
key authentication.

The Committee has also recommended the establishment of a national
authentication system to be recognised internationally with credibility with
the legal system - True Names, most probably.

Any c'punks closer to Canberra with the real goods?
