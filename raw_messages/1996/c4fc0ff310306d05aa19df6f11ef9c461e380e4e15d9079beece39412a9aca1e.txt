I am looking to find code so I can set up a "re-webber"
similar to www.anonymizer.com.  I thank Sameer and c2.org
for nicely putting a service like that up on the Net, and
am willing to pay a fee if necessary for this code.

If Sameer's code is not available, what is needed to do
a "re-webber"?

I apologize for my inexperience in this kind of stuff.

Thanks very much in advance,
