Those of you interested in the notion of randomness may want to check out
"On the Effective Definition of 'Random Sequence'", a paper written by
Michael Levin, Marvin Minsky, and me in 1965.

For a paper copy, send a SASE (78 cents worth of stamps) to me:
     Rollo Silver / PO Box 219 / San Cristobal, NM 87564

If anyone can tell me how to post a highly formatted file, with equations,
on the Internet, so that anybody can read it, pls let me know! That would
be preferable to a paper copy -- but I don't know how to do it.
