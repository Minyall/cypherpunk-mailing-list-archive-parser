If you have another 386 or 486 lying around, you could install Linux and
Ian's encrypted loopback code on a remote box, then NFS or Samba the
filesystem over.  For protection, you could modify the vlock command to
lock the console (and not unlock it), and disable inetd.  Then, unless
someone has the permissions to access the files through the network, the
files are inaccessable ;-).
