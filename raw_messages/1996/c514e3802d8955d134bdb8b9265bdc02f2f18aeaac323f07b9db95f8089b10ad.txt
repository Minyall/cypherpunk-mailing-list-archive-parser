I suggest ignoring Reply-To: etc and requiring a return address inside
the signed region of the mail, otherwise someone could intercept the mail
(suppressing the original) and resend it from his account and the results
would get sent to the interceptor.
 Another idea would be to extract the return address from the PGP userid
which signed the script.
