	Despite its lack of popularity with many cypherpunks, I'm
occaisonally a fan of FV.  Yes, they blow big chunks in marketing.
Yes, they're selling a cheesy hack to move credit cards.  Yes, they
sit on merchants cash for 90 days.

	But..

	I can set up a client account for $2, a merchant for $10.  I
can set up the client account in literally three minutes.  I don't
need special software distributed in binary for machines I don't
have.

	I don't like it, but the low tech cheesy solutions often beat
out better stuff because they are cheap & low cost of entry.  Not to
start a religious war in this area, bit witness wintel.

| Hello. I've been off the list for quite a while now, so I'm not up to 
| date on the current ecash schemes. My company (a major internet service 
| provider with a lot of web advertising clients) is looking into which 
| digital cash method would be best to support for use on our customer's 
| web pages. The head of the web department has taken a look at several, 
| and is torn between Mark Twain's stuff and Cybercash. I was wondering if 
| people who have looked at these systems could give me a rundown on the 
| major differences. I know that Mark Twain is nice and secure (or at least 
| I *think* I know that) but Cybercash is signifigantly easier to use. Any 
| comments would be welcome, and to keep list volume down (I assume it's 
| still as busy as ever) I'd be happy to recieve replies via direct email, 
| and sumarize for the list.
