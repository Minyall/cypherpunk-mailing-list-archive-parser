For the less sophisticated remailer software that uses variable-size
messages and (optionally) PGP, the remailer script needs to feed the
plaintext passphrase into PGP to decrypt the remailer's private PGP key.

Mixmaster, which includes its own set of crypto routines (currently using
RSA with 3DES as I recall), allows you to compile the private key passphrase
into the executable, and wipe out the source code. This obscures the
passphrase plaintext from (very) casual observers.  

The fundamental problem AFAICS is the difficulty of getting a program to keep
a secret from an observer. If the program doesn't actually _use_ the secret
(in the way that the secret is useful, e.g. as the basis for a symmetric
key), then it seems you can attain an arbitrary level of "security through
obscurity", because you can encode the secret however you want in the code.

But if a program is capable of possessing and using the secret without
human intervention, then anyone with a copy of the program can do the same.  

Bottom line: if you can crack (say) the 8-character Unix passphrase for a
remailer account, you have full access to the remailer's secrets and all the
opportunities that presents. Good remailer account passphrases are
important.
