Just to give everyone a reality check here, I routinely use encrypted
links across the net, often internationally. A houseguest of mine used
3DES from my apartment to his office in Finland for days. No one has
as much as sneezed at any of this. None of it is the least bit unusual
or illegal to begin with.
