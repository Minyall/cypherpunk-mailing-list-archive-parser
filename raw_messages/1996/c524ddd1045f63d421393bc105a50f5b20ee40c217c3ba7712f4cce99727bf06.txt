     An interesting thought:

     One of the things that the entertainment electronics industry is pushing
is the "Set Top Box" that attaches to your idiotbox and allows you to 
use the internet over either a POTS line, cable modem or whathave you. Problem
is, there is no local hard drive. No way to store sensative data (even a hot
list). With the encrypted filesystem stored on a remote machine, and using 
something like SSH written in a Java like language (NOTE: Of necessity MUCH 
more secure) to "Mount" the SFS over the network... 

     Something like this could make the author a decent amount of money. Makes 
me wish I were a coderpunk.`
