Probably the CIA officers are linguists or analysts, maybe even 
cryptographers, who will be doing that they do at Langley and 
other US stations: processing foreign (non-US-citizen) 
intelligence coming into the country from a variety of sources.


These roles would fit this paragraph of the article:


   To keep tabs on such potential foreign threats, around 25
   CIA officers will be stationed alongside officers from the
   Defense Intelligence Agency the National Security Agency,
   and the FBI at an "all-source" intelligence command post to
   be established at an undisclosed location in the Atlanta
   area.


Any CIA officers or agents or contractors here want to comment, 
top secretly? We're all compartmentalized, yes?
