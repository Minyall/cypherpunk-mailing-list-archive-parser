If I wanted to intercept a laser beam I'd spray an aerosol mist
into the beam and look at the scatter.  On a dusty or humid day I
might not need the aerosol.

Why not just encrypt the link?  Then anyone can tap and it doesn't matter.
I'm in the process of building a tightbeam microwave link that can carry
2 Mbps over 50Km.  Anybody got any gunn transceivers they don't need?
