Point well taken.  Most people who are in the market for a Web server,
however, are cognizant of the fact that along with Netscape, Microsoft, Open
Market, O'Reilly et al, Sameer has been for some time now selling a well
regarded product: namely, his proprietary version of Apache.

I guess my point was that, notwithstanding Sameer's estimable commercial
software offerings, the *news* is that 
he has, to repeat myself, abandoned the anonymity business with respect to
many of his traditional public Internet services.

Certainly, no slight was intended.  I "like strong crypto", so I naturally
look forward to stuff from C2Net that, in your opinion, I'll "love."
