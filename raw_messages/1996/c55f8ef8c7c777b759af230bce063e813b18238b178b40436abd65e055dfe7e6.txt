The "encryption" built into PMail is - and the author admits
this - crap.  He wrote the encryptor interface, which is
essentially Message XOR Password, as a demonstration.  Then
the JN PGP interface was written.

Mild understatement.

Been there, done that.  It's a nice combo, but could
be a little better.

Been there, done that.  It's also a nice program, but
nowhere near a full featured mail client.  That's
by design, as I understand.
