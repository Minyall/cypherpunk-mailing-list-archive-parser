Peter Junger posted some assertions about how something becomes "public
domain" as far as ITAR is concerned. I asked a triaging question to clarify
his concepts for myself, and to resolve what seemed to me to be at least a
lack of clarity in his assertions. He didn't respond; instead of a rational
response to a polite substantive question, he asks about kill filing.

Does the sequence of events tell you anything?
