For that matter, is issuing unix and tcp/ip commands an act of speech
even when cracking into someone else's computer?

(I realize this might be made moot by having to read the output and 
violating the target's privacy, but then the act of cracking, in itself,
might only require commands standard on all machine, that also have 
standard and therefore predictable responses, entailing no privacy loss.)
