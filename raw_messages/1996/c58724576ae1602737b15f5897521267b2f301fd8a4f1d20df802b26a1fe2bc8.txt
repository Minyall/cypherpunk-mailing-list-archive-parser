And, indeed, it is not likely to be who suffers in the job market as a
result of Dr. Vulis' rants and raves and generally insane postings; my
situation is secure, but I understand that Vulis has joined L. Dettweiler
on the "List of Unemployables" passed around Silicon Valley.

I strongly doubt many computer companies in the Silicon Valley will be
willing to hire him or his consulting service as his antics have received
publicity.

He may have his "NetScum" list and Web page, but it's his name on the list
of folks not to hire.
