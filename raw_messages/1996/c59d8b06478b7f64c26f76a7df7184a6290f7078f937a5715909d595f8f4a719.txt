     With the execption of those twits flaming Mr. May, there is noise,
and there is NOISE. The noise here is more valuable, insightful, and thoughtful
than the signal most places.

     I joined this list primarily to lurk, as I had been told that it was 
primarily techincal in nature, and I don't have much to add at that level. I
was pleasantly suprised to learn that the content was much more than just 
technical. There are many of us who _can't_ code, but "we" can think about 
the protocalls at a different level, and we MUST understand the implications
of the technology that "we" are assisting to deploy. "We" must understand what 
"we" are unleashing, to do less is irresponcible.
