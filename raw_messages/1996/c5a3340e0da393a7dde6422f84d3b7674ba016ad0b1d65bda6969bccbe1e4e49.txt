I am considering getting regular Cypherpunks meetings going in the Portland,
OR area.  If anyone is interested in such a thing, please drop me e-mail.

I have gotten some interest from a few friends and so I am sending out the
request to the rest of the list to see who else is interested.

Ideas for a local meeting place would also be appreciated, as my apartment
is way too small.  (And not the same time and place of the 2600 meetings.  I
am alergic to video cameras.)

It would also be a chance to meet some of the people I see on the list who I
know post from Portland...
