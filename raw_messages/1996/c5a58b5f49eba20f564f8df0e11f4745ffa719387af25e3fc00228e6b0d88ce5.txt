Oh Oh. I said bad things about Americans...in trouble now.

Anyways. Here are some figures:

"In the 20 year period between 1970 and 1989, the external debt of
developing nations grew from
$68.4 billion to $1 283 billion, an increase of 1846 per cent. Debt service
payments increased by 1400 per cent and were in excess of $160 billion by
the end of the 80s."

by the way most of this debt is concentrated in South American.
