Jean-Francois, your comments are inspired!

As a member of "such media" in that I still publish articles on dead trees
-- I have articles in fall issues of Wired and Playboy, for instance -- I
rejoice in your reasoned suggestion that you deny me and my ilk access to 
the Net.

But wait! I connect through wired.com, eff.org, or *.edu accounts. How do 
you plan to kick me off my "ISPs?"

No, you're not out to lunch.

-Declan
