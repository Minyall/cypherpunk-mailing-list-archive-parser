The alternative is constant monitoring, though of course this risks
traffic analysis.  If you ping yourself daily, using some random-path
random-delay chain of encrypted remailers, then you can tell if
your nym still works.  To reduce traffic analysis, the remailer system
needs lots of remailers and lots of cover traffic, and you need to use
the remailers a lot so your mail to them doesn't look regularly scheduled.
