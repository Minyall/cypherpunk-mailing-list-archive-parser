An amplification mechanism will usually couple the signal to the vacuum, 
and introduce vacuum noise.   Another way of thinking of vacuum noise 
is that amplification mixes the state of the signal, with the (unknown) 
phase of the universe at infinity.

Of course any statement in words about quantum mechanics is necessarily 
false, so the above statement is a metaphor or parable, rather than literal
truth.
