Haven't there been some worked examples of information warfare that make
this fear and the need to deal with it legitimate?

As I recall my background reading in the public press, wasn't the etiology
that we figured out how to do some pretty nasty things (the Gulf war was
one presenting occasion) to enemies' info infrastructures to threaten their
entire social system. Then, as I understand it, someone smart said
something like "If we can do this to them, then someone can do this to us."
and we were off to the races.

It's the military and counterintel community's job to think like this and
act to protect us. I don't think imputing selfish motives is dispositive.
