Key Distribution Centers, the center of Needham-Schroeder and similar
key management protocols, like the Kerberos protocols. If you don't
know what these are, you have no business talking about the "problems
of key management" because you know nothing about the field of key
management.

The difference between us is that you are pretending to be a doctor
even though you have no medical training and are about to go out and
butcher live patients, pretending that this is just business as
usual. Some of the rest of us have devoted many years to the study of
this field, which actually does have a substantial literature and lots
of skilled professionals. Anyone who says "We know very little" has no
business writing code and selling it to the public. You are doing
nothing less than putting your customers businesses at risk, and in
some cases their lives. You deserve the worst.

Don't worry. Whether we waste any of your time or not, I assure you
that people like me *will* lay waste to your company and its sales if
you are indeed peddling junk, which is the most obvious assumption to
make here. I personally am sick of companies such as yours pulling the
big con on ignorant customers. You have not heard the last of any of
this -- believe me. If the lot of you end up convicted of fraud it
will not surprise me. I repeat -- you have NOT heard the last of
this. As I said, I'm a libertarian. I believe it is up to the
community, not the government, to track down and stop the activities
of glorified con men such as yourselves. You *will* be stopped.
