If you think someone's a fuckhead, please just put them in your
KILL file and get on with your life.  You don't need to announce
your discovery to the rest of the group- we either agree with
you (and have killifiled the fuckhead) or we don't agree that
he's a fuckhead.  Your announcement will sway no one's opinion.
All it does is add to the noise.

Thanks.
