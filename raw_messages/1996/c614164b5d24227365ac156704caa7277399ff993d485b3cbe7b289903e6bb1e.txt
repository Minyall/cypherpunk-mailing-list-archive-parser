    Hmmm... Well, the 384-bit Blacknet PGP key was cracked in just a
    few months.  How?

Factoring a 384-bit number is not equivalent to searching a 384-bit
keyspace.  Consider that there are 78498 primes less than 1000000.
This means that you can do a brute force search of a keyspace of under
17-bits to find a prime factor of any composite number less than
1000000000000 -- a bit under 40 bits.  I've done this to verify the
results of an implementation of the Rabin-Miller primality test on
relatively small numbers.  I'm not sure how many primes there are with
192 or fewer bits, but it's far fewer than 2^384.

There are better techniques around for factoring large numbers than
this sort of brute force testing.  While I didn't follow the thread
very closely, they probably used the quadratic sieve or number field
sieve algorithm.  See Schneier's _Applied_Cryptography_ for more on
factoring, including references to more detailed works.
