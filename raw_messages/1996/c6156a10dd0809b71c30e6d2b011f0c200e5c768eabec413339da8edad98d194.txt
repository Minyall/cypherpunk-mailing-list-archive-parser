My apologies for any misunderstanding in my original post.  I was merely 
trying to point out IBM's historical compliance with govt suggestions for 
the design of the S-boxes.  Please excuse me if my facts are adrift.

My point was that this may shed light on IBM/Lotus' acceptance of the 
40+24 work force reduction scheme.  IBM may be receptive to working with 
the government yet again.
