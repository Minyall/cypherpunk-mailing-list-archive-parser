San Francisco TV channel 4 (the NBC affiliate) will broadcast a
"news" segment on hackers "they can access your computer and
ruin your life" at/around 9:00 PM this evening (Friday, July 26).

I'm sure it will be as informative, educational and unbiased, just
like the rest of the Olympic coverage.
