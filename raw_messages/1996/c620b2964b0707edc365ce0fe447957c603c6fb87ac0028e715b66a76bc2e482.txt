The word "gaijin" literally means "foreign person". Many Westerners like to
think that the Japanese use it in the same way as the Grand Dragon of the Ku
Klux Klan uses "nigger", but it ain't really true. They use it when they mean
"nigger", but they also sometimes use it to mean "honorable nigger".
