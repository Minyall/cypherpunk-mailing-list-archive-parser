Hi, I have been reading numerous threads on digital cash, and I have some
questions I would like discussed.

currently when someone does extortion (kiddnapping too), they have two 
choices;

1-pick up the cash personally (or via a stooge)
2-transfer the funds via bank

Both ideas are bad, in that you stand a good chance at getting caught.

I was wondering, what if you demanded payment via Ecash, through nym 
servers, aliases, etc.  From what I understand, it is just like cash, ie: no 
record of transaction, but you get the added bonus of not having to meet the 
other party-like a fund transfer.  Once you have your 1,000,000 Ecash, you 
could dump it on a disk, and close your internet account (unless you really 
really trust your privacy technology).  And I also think that you would have 
the option to cash this into real funds at either the Mark Twain bank, or 
likely somewhere in the Caymen Islands (maybe through those online gambling 
houses).

I am hoping that this will spark some discussion, and maybe slow down the 
dlv, TM spam war.

Also, I was only wondering about this for mere discussion reasons :)
