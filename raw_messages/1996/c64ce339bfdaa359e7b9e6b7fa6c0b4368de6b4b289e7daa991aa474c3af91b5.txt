Few armed blacks were lynched.  Like--none.  

In any case, posession of machined metal is in no way comparable to
lynching.  Massed armed attacks on people simply because they are alleged to
have possessed machined pieces of metal the size and shape of fifty-cent
pieces (the reason for the BATF attack on the religious community outside of
Waco) *is* comparable to lynching.
