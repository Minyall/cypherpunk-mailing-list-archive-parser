In that case, why do you think that an RSA system would be better
implemented as a matter of necessity than a Rabin system?

You didn't hear what I said.

There is no proof that RSA is equivalent to factoring -- only a strong
belief. There may exist ways to break RSA that do not involve
factoring. Rabin, however, is provably equivalent to factoring.

Meaningless and unimportant.

Again, false. RSA has no proofs of security, and other systems have
far better proofs. RSA also leaks small bits of information like
parity that other systems do not leak. This is not to say that RSA is
bad, but its choice over, say, Rabin, at least for encryption, is
fairly abitrary.
