A little bit off topic, but some years ago some guys at our university
were working on a project called "Cryptographic module for digital
communications". I don't know if they ever finished it though, but it
might be of some use to someone out there.

The project aim was:

Create integrated circuit (further CryptoChip or CC) capable of key
exchange and generation using modular exponent based cryptosystem and
block encryption using IDEA cipher. The ideology behind CC is based on
having the minimal amount of information inside the chip and guaranteed
block cipher encryption rate above 10 Mbit/sec. 

They have an old web page at: http://www.pld.ttu.ee/cchip/cchip.html
