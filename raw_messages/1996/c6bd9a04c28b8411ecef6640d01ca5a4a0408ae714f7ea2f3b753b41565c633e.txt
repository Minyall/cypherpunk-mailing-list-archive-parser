NIce try at a segway, but this reasoning is nothing more than bullshit.

I get so tired of hearing the same press/DNC derived crap after 3 days...

Limbaugh is giving up the show because it is run in syndication. 
Syndication is not a profitable format with the ensuing satellite blitz 
on the horizon. 

Limbaugh is a buisnessman and a commentator. He earns a living. He will 
do what is necessary to leverage his marketability to make the most money.

Since you've gone to college, I'll have to explain it to you: It's called 
capitalism - look into it...

So tell that to G. Gordon Liddy...

You fail to acknowledge the simple fact that a segment of society that 
feels not only disenfranchised, but that the system is irrepairable will 
stoop to whatever means they feel is necessary to make their point. They 
don't care what other people think - just what they believe in. 
Discrediting is a non issue.

Welcome to Yugoslavia. The last riots on the tele over there didn't look 
any different than pictures the BBC showed of Serajevo during the early 
days of the country's demise.
