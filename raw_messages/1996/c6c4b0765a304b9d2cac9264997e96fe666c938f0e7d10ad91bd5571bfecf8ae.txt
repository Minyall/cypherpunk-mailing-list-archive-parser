Does there currently exist a system which permits webservers to restrict 
access to clients who have a given certification?

What is the current certification practice?

How easy is it to certify a given client?

Are webserver certifications sufficently secure today?

What are the best servers to use for secure web pages and certification 
currently in the United States?
