OK, Perry, I just have to give up on you. It's hopeless. You claim I
mischaracterized your position on Java and scruffies/neats when in fact I
never mentioned either your name nor the connection of my points to Java. I
point this out and you reply with some smartass comment which is completely
disingenuos.

Just as when you claimed Java applications can't do file i/o, and several
people point out that you are wrong and that it is _applets_ that you must
have been thinking of (and not even always for applets, by the way).
Instead of admitting you were wrong, or misread the post, you just say
"Same difference."

It's pointless to try to have a discussion with you. Which is too bad.

I suggest you wait until you see what I have to say on this before jumping
the gun by assuming you know what it is I'm going to say (or that someone
saying "application" must have really meant to say "applet").
