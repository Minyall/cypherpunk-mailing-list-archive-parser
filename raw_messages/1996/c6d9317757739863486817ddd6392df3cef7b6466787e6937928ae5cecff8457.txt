>AOL BLOCKS JUNK MAIL SITES
>America Online is blocking all electronic mail sent from five Internet sites
>that have been used to send hundreds of thousands of unsolicited messages to
>AOL customers.  In turn, Cyber Promotions Inc., which is associated with
>three of the sites, has accused America Online of hypocrisy for "censoring"
>commercial messages sent from other sites but allowing AOL itself to sponsor
>commercial promotions.  AOL dismisses the charge as an "apples and oranges
>comparison."  (New York Times 5 Sep 96 C2)

	There's been a court suit to stop AOL from doing so, which appears
to have gotten a temporary injunction to that effect... I'll forward the
details.

>CHINA SCREENS OUT "SPIRITUAL POLLUTION" ON THE NET
>The Beijing government has begun blocking as many as 100 Internet sites that
>offer material the government deems unsuitable for its citizens -- including
>dissident viewpoints from Hong Kong and Taiwan, sites sponsored by U.S.
>major media organizations such as CNN and the Washington Post, and sexually
>explicit sites such as Playboy and Penthouse.  An official described the
>blocked sites as suspected purveyors of "spiritual pollution."  (Wall Street
>Journal 5 Sep 96 B12)

	Hmm... funny similarity between Chinese objections of "spiritual
pollution" and ASEAN objections of "cultural" problems, isn't there?
