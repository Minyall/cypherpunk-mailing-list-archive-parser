If I'm not mistaken, the point here is that you can always choose NOT
to go with filter XYZ, and instead, purchase services with filter ABC.
It is still not perfect, but then, that is the point.  We do not trust
any SINGLE entity.  However, if I have a choice of entities, then I am
willing to try one, and let them abuse me in the short term.  Simple
free market principle says that a filter will show up with me needs
sooner or later.

If the filter is the government, I have no direct choice.  I have very
very indirect choices, but I cannot just shut off the service if I don't
like it.
