   1-10-96. NYPaper:

   "Group Urges an Internet Ban On Hate Groups' Messages.
   Joins in Move to Censor Offensive Material."

      Citing the "rapidly expanding presence of organized hate
      groups on the Internet," a leading Jewish human rights
      group yesterday began sending letters to hundreds of
      Internet access providers and universities asking them
      to refuse to carry messages that "promote racism, anti-
      Semitism, mayhem and violence."

      A sage says, "It is not possible to end idiocy by
      censoring it. The best response is cellular."
