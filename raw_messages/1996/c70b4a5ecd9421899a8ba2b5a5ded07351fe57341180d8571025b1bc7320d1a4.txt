If you are looking for a program that can log into your pop server,
scan for PGP messages, retrieve and decrypt them, then try Private
Idaho.  If you are looking for some combination of programs that can
handle your e-mail and provide PGP functions, then there are lots of
option.

Take a look at:

There is a collection of PGP front-ends for Windows, many of which do
what you seem to be looking for.
