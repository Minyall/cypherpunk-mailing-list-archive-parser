While musing over a roulette table, and noticing the preponderence of
electronic games in the various Casinos in Stateline, NV, a thought
occurred: does anyone know what sorts of random number generators those
electronic games use, and how (if at all) they are measured and regulated
by the Nevada Gaming Commission? They might have something to teach us.
