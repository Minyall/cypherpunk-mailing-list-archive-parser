This is a great example of why we need organized people like Greg to 
help express an alternative viewpoint.  As Greg and myself, and the other 
lawyers on this list know, there are often multiple sides to any 
legal argument.  To have this be the only voice regarding Law and the 
Net would be a bad idea.

I do favor its general intent - to take the formation of policy out 
of the legislative venue.  I do not think the major interests listed 
will have my interests at heart.  Mom and Pop ISPs, Web Consultants, 
the HTML Guild, the ideas of GPL may not even be in the consciousness 
of some of the larger organizations (I remain to keep my hope out for 
Netscape).

I would like to propose a professional response to this organization 
in the form of a Law Review type of organization.  I know there are 
enough lawyers on the list to set this into motion.  I would like to 
know what kind of interest there would be before I put the great deal 
of effort it would take into such a project.

Let me know.

Matt
