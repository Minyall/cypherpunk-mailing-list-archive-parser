Do you operate a malicious remailer? Have you just recieved a message from
a person, encrypted for another remailer? Want to know who this person is
communicating with? Bomb the next remailer in the chain or do whatever
else to force it to reveal it's keys. Once that's done, you can peel away
that layer of encryption and then go to work on bombing the next remailer
in the chain to obtain it's keys. Repeat until you've peeled off all the
layers of remailer encryption and can see the final destination address. 

Tell us, what have you done with the _real_ Adam Shostack? ;P
