Sheesh, are y'all really that shy, or did y'all (like me) assume that
someone else was going to take care of it?

I sent direct mail describing the problem to the two dca.com addresses on
cypherpunks. One of the two messages bounced, and I forged an unsubscribe
for that address. I guess we'll see if the problems stop. Since nobody at
dca.com has responded to this for a couple days, and since their
postmaster is asleep at the wheel, I don't see how anyone can complain.
