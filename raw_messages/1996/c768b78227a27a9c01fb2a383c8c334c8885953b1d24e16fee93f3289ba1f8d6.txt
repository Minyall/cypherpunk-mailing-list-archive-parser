"Dimitri" can always telnet to smtp ports of various sites and use them
to forward his mail to remailers. If his ISP blocks him (via a router
filter, for example), then he would notice. A schizophrenic mind can
imagine a situation where USENET Cabal would try to fool him and try to
stand in the middle between him and all smtp servers, emulating their
responses, but that is not terribly feasible.

Also, some people regularly (via crontab) send anonymous email to
themselves, just in case. They would notice when they stop receiving
them.
