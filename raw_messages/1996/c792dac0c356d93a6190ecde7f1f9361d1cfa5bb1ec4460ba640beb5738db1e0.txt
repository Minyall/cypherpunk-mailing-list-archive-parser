Anyone who mistakes the lack of "repudiations" for AP on the list for some
kind of tacit approval is not getting the whole picture, IMHO.  

Is this how journalists do their research nowadays -- "give me some info or
I'll write something really bad about you that you'll regret?"  Cool.  I
guess I thought there might still be some kind of pursuit of the truth
involved.

I personally don't have the time or energy to contribute to the AP threads.
That != approval for the idea.

I hope you include your above quote in your piece.
