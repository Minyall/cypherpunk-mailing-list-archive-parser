I think a URL is probably a good solution.  But if we're using 
URLs, lets create a scheme for public keys.  If needed, this could be
either abbriviated, or dereferenced with a key exchanger (similar to
SMTP's mail exchangers).  Defaults would also allow for a good deal of
shortening.  And URLs have the user interface advantage of becoming
common, and understood.  Who gets on the net today and not the web?


key://ftp.clark.net/pub/u/cme/cme-current.asc
key://ftp.clark.net/pub/u/cme/cme-longterm.asc

or 
key://gateway.acme.net/pub/s/telnetd.asc

abrieviated version:

key://acme.com/~telnetd/
