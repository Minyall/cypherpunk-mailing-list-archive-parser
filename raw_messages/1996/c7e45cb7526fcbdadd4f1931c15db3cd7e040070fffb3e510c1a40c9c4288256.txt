Timmy may decided to rant about crypto for a change. As always he exposes his
complete lack of knowledge.

So, demonstrate. Pick up conversations on cellular phones, transcribe
the embarassing ones, post them to Usenet via anonymous remailers.

Sniff the e-mail passing through your site and post it anonymously.

That'll make the news and make people aware that they need privacy.

The pressure from insurers might work in strange ways. E.g. in many
locales the law mandates 10% off car theft insurance premiums for cars
that have certain kinds of alarms. According to most authorities the
alarms are totally useless, but almost all cars in NYC have them, and
they go off in the middle of the night when someone walks by the car -
truly stupid.

Similarly the companies that insure doctors for against malpractice
suits might say one day that all patient records in a computer must be
adequately encrypted in the case PC gets stolen - or they might mandate
that nothing is encrypted w/o some sort of GAK escrow. And this won't
even be gubmint-mandated.

It's because you're an idiot.

That's good.
