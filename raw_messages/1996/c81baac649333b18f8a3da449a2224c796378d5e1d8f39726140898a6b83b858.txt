Yet another Offshore/Privacy provider is online.
Try http://194.157.210.14. If you're running First Class
Cleint set the network address to 194.157.210.14 port 3004
and create your own userid when you're online.

Cypherpunks/cypherpunks is a valid login, but has a daily
time limit of 30 minutes, so you might want to create a
new identity.
