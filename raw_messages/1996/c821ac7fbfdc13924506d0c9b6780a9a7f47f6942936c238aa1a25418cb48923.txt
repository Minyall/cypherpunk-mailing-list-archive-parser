poor timmy laments that no one responded to his latest
gedanken masterpiece. I am very pleased to be the one to  
relieve him of his loneliness.

imho, it's a very warped kind of mind that insinuates some evil is no
big deal because greater evils exist in the world. 

it's an argument I see often among the libertarians 
around here. "what's the big deal
about murder? govt's do it all the time. everyone should be able to
murder anyone if govt's do it. why, the right to 
murder people is an inalienable right!!". of course the arguments
are never made in this language-- the fun is spotting it in the
rhetoric.

ah, an even more warped mind that not merely condones it but
"looks forward to it"

careful, timmy, your slime is showing!!

(it would be fun to debate you publicly some day on your true beliefs, but
alas, you never bite. oh well, I stay amused well enough..)
