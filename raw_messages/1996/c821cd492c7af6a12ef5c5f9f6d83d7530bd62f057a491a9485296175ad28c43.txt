This takes "cracking Netscape security as a new benchmark" to a whole new 
level.

What does this have to do with Netscape? This is about brute-forcing
40-bit RC4.  While Netscape does deserve flogging with a wet noodle down
to the seventh generation for their initial press response, this singling
out Netscape is annoying me a little.

OK, well, in that case.

This assumes, of however, that collecting encrypted communications,
feeding them to the computer with 100% efficiency, electricity, labor,
etc. are completely free. 

I hope everyone recognizes this as more old news and ICE marketing. In a
fantasy world, the press et al would see this and clamor for the
revocation of ITAR.
