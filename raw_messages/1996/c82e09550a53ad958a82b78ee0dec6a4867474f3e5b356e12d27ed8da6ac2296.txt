    Your kidding, because someone set up PGP to a large key your assuming
their doing wrong and the guy's going to get busted. Wow. I set up a long
key myself but never have used the silly thing, that mean I'm guilty too.
(Gotta go, a black helecopter just landed in the back yard)

    Not if he keeps the passphrase to the key availiable to all. The original
poster did mention it was to only his wife at home who was a risk. A psudo-
random alph-nummeric key of the size he claims can't be memorized so it has
to be on the h-drive or a floppy.  He may as well fess up now to the Mrs before
she publishes all cause she's in.
