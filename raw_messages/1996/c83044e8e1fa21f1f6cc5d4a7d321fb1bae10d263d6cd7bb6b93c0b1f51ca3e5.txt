It seems to me that if the government REALLY thought it could push GAK by 
convincing the public that it was wise, it would at least prepare a redacted 
version of this briefing that it _could_ present to the public,  if 
different than the "eyes only" version.  After all, would they risk losing 
it all by NOT telling at least part of the story?  Or is their failure to 
publicize all this because they realize that spilling the beans (even only 
some of them) would actually make it _less_ likely that GAK would be 
accepted by the public, rather than more?  I think the latter is much closer 
to the truth.

That depends on what you mean.  I know a free-lance movie scriptwriter who 
is working on a story along related lines.
