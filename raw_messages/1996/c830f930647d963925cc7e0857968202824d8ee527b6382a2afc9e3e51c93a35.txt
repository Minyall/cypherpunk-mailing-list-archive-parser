So sameer is a deep-cover plant... but for whom? I know it's not the CIA, 
because they're too stretched at the moment (ever wonder why all those 
voice mail systems keep putting  you on hold - it's because they don't 
have enough agents free to monitor all calls, and it woudn't be the NSA, 
because it'd be too tacky). I reckon it's the spirit of Vince Foster 
inhabiting his body. It all fits together too neatly
