I think it was mid-late 80's, actually. I remember reading about it in the
LA Times and Newsweek. I'm sure I could dig up a dozen references in Nexis
if you want. 

The proposal was not to monitor all or political literature, which was
more obviously protected by the First Amendment, but rather technical
literature on certain subjects, such as supercomputers, nuclear physics,
toxicology, and of course (relevance) cryptography. The FBI specifically
wanted to know who was reading Applied Cryptography.
