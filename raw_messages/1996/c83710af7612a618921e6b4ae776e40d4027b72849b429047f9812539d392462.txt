As this is one of several such messages this clown has sent us, despite
unsubscribe instructions having been posted several times in the last few
weeks, I am bouncing all of his inappropriate messages back to him (though
I am being careful--and I urge you all to be careful, too--to cut out any
cc:ing of others).

If you feel this jerk's posts are inappropriate, you might decide to do the
same as I am doing.

(Again, be careful to review the To: and cc: fields before sending, to
ensure that the list does not get spammed by your actions.)
