I'm enclined to agree with you.  It is a bit embarasing for people on one
of the newsgroups that encourages free speach like this one does to ask
someone, basicly, not to speak because they don't agree with our
oppinions.  Personally, I'd like to welcome David to the list.  I'm sure
we need some, well.. out of lack of a better word,  opposing, views. So
far I've seen more flaimbaiting _AT_ him on this list than _BY_ him.

That is a little bit of the "I'm afraid of your oppinion" approach, isn't
it?  Then his pseudonym would probably just wind up with the same
reputation, and people would start comparing him to himself.  Thats more
likely to make a mess thant to solve anything.  He has his views, I have
mine, you have yours.  Learn to live with it.
