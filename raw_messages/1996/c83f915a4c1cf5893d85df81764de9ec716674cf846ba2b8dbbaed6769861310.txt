This thread has very little cryptographic relevance and has degenarated
into a full-scale ethnic flamefest.

Neither Germans nor Americans nor any other nation are inherently evil.

There are certain things that German government does which many on this
mailing list find distasteful. There are certain things that the U.S.
government does which many on this mailing list find even more distasteful.

We should seek to help those Germans who seek to circumvent the laws of
their country which we find to be unjust and unfair, just as we would
have helped the "dissidents" in the former Soviet Union or the anti-Nazi
Germans in Nazi Germany.
