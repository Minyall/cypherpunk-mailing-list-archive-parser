There has (fortunately!) been a big crackdown recently on the illegal pet
bird import trade, something akin to the slave trade of the 19th century for
those of us who like pet birds.  One of the methods people use to import
birds is to wear special vests full of pockets for rare bird eggs.  If the
person who wrote this was coming in from SE Asia, especially Australia, then
this was very possibly the meaning of the question.
