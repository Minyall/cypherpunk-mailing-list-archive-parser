I can send all newsletters signed by myself, but claim that they are
produced by different numerical models for predicting (or derivatives')
returns. This way, even though I send out contradictory advice, I
could always say that I had several experimental programs.

It seems though that the market for advise newsletter has been saturated
by people who give random advices and hope to hit a jackpot, like
Garzarelli did with her "sell" advice before the '87 crash.

So my letters would be hardly noticed.
