tcmay:

You're coming perilously close to actually calling for the 
killing of a  federal judge. My recollection is that a couple 
of folks have been arrested  and charged for calling for the 
killing of judges.

Any half-wit falling for Bell's agent provocateur setup will do 
hard time, or maybe get popped by his twitchy TLA watchers.


The son-of-a-bitch's baiting with pigeons, no question. He's 
too myopic to see he's setting up falcons for gutting by 
high-circling eagles, who'll claw him too. Bell's going down 
blind-sided with his gulls, all easy prey.
