Any particular reason someone called this SHA-2 ?  It sounds a whole lot like
the revision of the original SHA, called SHA-1, that came out quite a while
ago. (FIPS 180-1)  This is rather old hat unless they're making a _second_
revision to the standard, in which case I expect there would have been much
more noise made about it.
