Thanks; that's what I thought.

Never believe anything you're told by tech support. It was pretty clear to
me that the poor undereducated sod had the words "compression" and
"encryption" confused. NTLM isn't perfect, but it's difficult enough to be
secure enough for MSN. You're not doing anything IMPORTANT on MSN, are
you? 

Due to Win95's open memory model, there's probably some system call that a
virus/trojan can use to ask politely for the username and password; in
fact, isn't it the same API that has already been demonstrated? But if you
let such a beast on your machine, all bets are off anyway.
