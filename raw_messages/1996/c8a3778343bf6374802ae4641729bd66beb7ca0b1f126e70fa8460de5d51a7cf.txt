Seriously, it's very doubtful.  The Logos character is too lame to be
Gilmore.  Remember the Star Trek, Trouble With Tribbles, where the
Klingon says "...but Kirk, he's not soft.  He may be a swaggering,...",
and so on.  Whatever Gilmore is, I hope to God it's not Logos, or we're
in big trouble.
