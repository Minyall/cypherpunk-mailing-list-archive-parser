In a family law case a few years ago, (I am afraid I cannot give the 
citation) a man with a well known tendency to violence suffered some
remarkably unjust decisions.  Some people involved in these cases met 
violent deaths.  Their cars exploded, etc.  Suddenly it became 
impossible to enforce previous family court judgements against this 
man because judges refused to hear the case.
