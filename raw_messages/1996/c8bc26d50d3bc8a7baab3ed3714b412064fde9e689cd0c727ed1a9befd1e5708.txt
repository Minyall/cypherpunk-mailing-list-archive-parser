Democracy has run amok in this country. There is no hope for reforming at
the ballot box, as democracy only makes things worse. Only a crypto reign
of terror can purge this land of the scum.

Just how would this take shape in "real life" - what would constitute this 
reign of terror; how do you envision such an event in action?

And which are the scum who would be purged?

Follow precedents of the anarchist tradition: Name a target, build a
bomb, light a fuse, heave it, run like hell -- into manacles of the
provocateur's payers, then to gallows. Wait a generation, repeat.
