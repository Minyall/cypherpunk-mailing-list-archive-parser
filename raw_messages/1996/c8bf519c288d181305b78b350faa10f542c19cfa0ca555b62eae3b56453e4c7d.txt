   No surprise when we consider what the alternative is for the media to 
concentrate on. Can we say felonious misappropriation of FBI files?

What a godsend these crashes and Olympics are for the Clintonistas and 
their fellow-travelors in the press. A plausible story to talk about , 
long enough so that there is not time left in the Cartoon News show, to 
ask, why is the White House running around saying that no one can recall 
who hired Craig Livingstone.

Oh wait, the dead guy musta done it. Yeah, that's the ticket.
