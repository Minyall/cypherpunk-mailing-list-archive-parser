There seems to be some confusion about the facts of the case, i.e., whether
the pictures really came from a case that was solved. I assume that that
will all be cleared up, but I'm not laughing anymore. 

I can imagine some kid gleefully accepting such pics to put up on a
grotesque page as an anti-censorship demonstration -- and then finding out
that he had the only evidence to an unsolved crime.
