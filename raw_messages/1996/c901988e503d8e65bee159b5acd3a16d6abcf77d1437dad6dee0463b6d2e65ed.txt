You made a mistake in buying Netscape commerce in the first place, but
don't despair! You can still get Apache, an excellent web server, and
an unencumbered SSL module that you can use without restriction
outside the U.S. (if you want to run it inside the U.S. you need to
pay a fee because of the patents on RSA).
