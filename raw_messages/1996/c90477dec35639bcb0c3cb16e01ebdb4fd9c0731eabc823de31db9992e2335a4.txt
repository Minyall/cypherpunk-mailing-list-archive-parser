Replacing trade unionists by national socialists? An interesting Freudian slip.

The use of encryption in civilial life should as ubiquitous as it is in the
military. The distance from weak crypto to strong crypto is much shorter than
the distance from no crypto to some crypto deployed. Deployment of crypto
takes a serious investment in the infrastructure (such as procedures and
protocols for key distribution), but this investment can be recycled for the
next, stronger, crypto.

Instead of writing code, "cypher punks" verbally abuse anyone who's actually
capable of writing code and proposing new programs and cryptoschemes to
supplant or complement the short list of "cypher punks"-approved apps - recall
Don Wood, literally drowned in obscenities by Paul Bradley.

Instead of encouraging the deployment of crypto, "cypher punks" whine about
the export controls - the circle jerk practices by the punks and their friends
in USG designed to make each other feel important. But in reality neither
punks nor the export controls are relevant. Copyright and libel laws are
irrelevant on the Internet. Child porn is punishable hardeer than strong
crypto, yet there are tons of it on Usenet. USG and other governments are
irrelevant. So are the punks who battle them instead of deploying crypto.
