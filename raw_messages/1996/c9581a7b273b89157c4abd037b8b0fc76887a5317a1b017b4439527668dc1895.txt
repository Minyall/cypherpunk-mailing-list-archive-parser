How does one verify that an IP address is coming from a U.S. site?
How do most FTP site (e.g. those which carry crypto) determine the
origins of a connection?

It seems to me that if the NSA/DoS is serious about keeping crypto
strong for U.S. internal use, then they would help establish a
method for U.S.-only interchange of this sort of software.  It is
clear, however, that they do NOT have an interest in helping with
this identification effort as it will thwart their own efforts at
tapping U.S. (er ... oh gee ... they're NOT suppose to do that,
right?  okay, they must not be doing it then ...)
