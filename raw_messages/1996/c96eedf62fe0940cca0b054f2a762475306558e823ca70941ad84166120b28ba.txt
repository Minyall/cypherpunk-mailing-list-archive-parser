I agree with the first point.
My english is not sufficient to understand point three.

Govts have no powers on other govts.
So why in the hell would it be the job of govt to regulate commerce with foreign 
nations?

They might help their citizens (seing that their rights and terms of any contract are 
respected, but calling what they do "regulating commerce btwn nations" is an euphemism
for holding international businessman on a leash!
