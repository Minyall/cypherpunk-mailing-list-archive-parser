I think that traffic analysis can be best defeated by powerful filtering
rather than any kind of multiple sending.

Eventually, (as the number of messages to a particular party increases
beyond the number of distractor messages sent with each mailing) it will
be possible to note the statistical difference in the number of messages
send to the random 20 people and the actual recipiant.  A mail bombing
will still reveal the true identity of the addressee as the 20 distractor
address will be randomly selected each time, and the addressee will not.

Instead, one might suggest, the same 20 people should be sent to as
distractors.  Unfortunately this leaves the actual addressee open to
disclosure when he/she responds to alpha forwarded messages (you were
assuming all internet traffic would be monitored, thus the response timing
would be a major clue).

I think the real answer to this is going to be open access pools.  All
encrypted messages will be left in a collective pop account, accessable by
anyone at all.  An agent could easily be written to poll the pop account,
download the entire queue of messages and locally decode and make
available only the ones addressed to the addressee.

I suspect the best policy would be to purge the pop account once a month
of messages older than 2 months.

Traffic analysis will reveal who polls the pop account, but not much else.

I suppose this could even work today if someone wrote a clever agent to
poll alt.anonymous.messages.
