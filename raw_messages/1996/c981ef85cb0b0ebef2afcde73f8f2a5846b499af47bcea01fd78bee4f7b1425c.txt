Sorry, dear, but complaining isn't going to change it, and simple telling people
to shut the fuck up is going to go nowhere.  If you want solely crypto relevent
material, subscribe to the filtered list.  I mean, come on -- you know this list
is suseptable (sp?) to noise and spam.

Besides, people suggest to me that you are the anonymous mailer.  So maybe you
should keep a low profile on this.
