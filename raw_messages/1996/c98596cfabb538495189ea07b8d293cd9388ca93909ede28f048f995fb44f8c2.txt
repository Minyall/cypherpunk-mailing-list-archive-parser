Is there any indication that the GRU or Chinese or Iranian intelligence 
(I think these are our only foes nowadays who have blue-water {to mix a 
metaphor} spook services) could do better than the Japanese did in 
sigint'ing against human speakers of Navajoe?

Is the Navajo language still extent among draft-age men?  Life in the 
Southwest has changed considerably since 1943.
