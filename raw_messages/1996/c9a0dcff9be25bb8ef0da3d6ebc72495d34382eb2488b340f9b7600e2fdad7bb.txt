COMPUSERVE MAY PULL ADMIN UNIT OUT OF GERMANY
CompuServe's administrative operations in Germany may be
transferred to another country because of proposed German
legislation that would make Internet companies block access to
pornography, neo-Nazi material or extremist pictures or writing.
CompuServe says it does not want to be in the position of having to
"censor" the Internet.  (New York Times 19 Nov 96 C5)
