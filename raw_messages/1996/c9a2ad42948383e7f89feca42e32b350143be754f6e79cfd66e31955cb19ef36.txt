 LOOKING FOR A GREAT GIFT IDEA? The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service
 (SVR) announced yesterday that it is releasing a six-hour long CD ROM that
 tells the stirring 75-year history of Soviet and Russian foreign
 intelligence. The CD ROM will be released in Russian and English versions
 and sell for about $120. It promises to provide buyers with access to SVR
 headquarters, and contains interviews with dozens of heretofore mysterious
 intelligence officers described as having helped shape the existing world
 order. (Itar-Tass, Interfax, July 16)
