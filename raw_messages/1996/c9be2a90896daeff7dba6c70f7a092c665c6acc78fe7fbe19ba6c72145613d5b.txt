I'm aware of the three main disk encryption programs SFS, SECDRV, and
SECDEV, but I need to find a solution that works with Windows 95 32bit
or Windows NT 4.0.

I'm currently using SFS 1.17 and Secure Drive under Win-95, but am
unable to continue to work in dos compatability mode due to severe
performance hits.  I am open to commercial products that have passed
peer review, but know of none.

If anyone could suggest a solution (outside of switching OS's), I
would be *most* gratefull.

Please respond to the list, as I am a subscriber under another
account.
