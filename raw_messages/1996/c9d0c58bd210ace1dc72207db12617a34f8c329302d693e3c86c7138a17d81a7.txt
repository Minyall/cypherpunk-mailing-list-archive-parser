I don't want to throw water over what I think would be a very useful
thing to have done, but I'm really skeptical that current "net"
computing power with general purpose processors is up to this.

My back of the envelope calculation, making some generous assumptions
about the implementation, suggests that such an effort would require
somewhere in the range of 10,000 and 50,000 CPU years on general (100MHz
or so Pentium) processors.  This is well beyond any distributed computation
I'm aware of ever having been done, even adjusting for "Moore inflation".
While feasible in a "complexity theory" sense, it's really not realistic
yet.

Even if it were feasible, what would we use as a challenge key?

Personally, I'd rather someone finish up the Wiener ASIC to the point where
it could go out to fab, get some prototype chips made, design a board around
it, and publish the design, from board layout on down.  This would be a
great Master's project, and some of us (maybe me, but I'll have to check)
might even be able to scrape up enough funds to buy enough chips/boards/etc
to build a modest size machine (say, that could exhaust a DES key in 1-6
months).  Initial engineering costs aside, the marginal cost of each
such machine could be well within the budgets of, say, a medium size crypto
research lab, and would make a scary enough demo to convince even the
most trusting management types of the risks of 56 bit keys.
