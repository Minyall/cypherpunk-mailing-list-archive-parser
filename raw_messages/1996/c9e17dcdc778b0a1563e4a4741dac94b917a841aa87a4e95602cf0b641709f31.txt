I'd like to agree, but I'm afraid I can't. Notice that many years of
widespread use of currently illegal drugs in the US has not translated into
widespread willingness to say that the drugs should be legal. Nor has the
experience of decades of black markets turned into widespread Russian
willingness to allow a lot more freedom: what they call "profiteering" and
punish heavily is mostly what we call "wholesaling" and regard as an
essential part of mundane distribution.

Cognitive dissonance is really, really easy to come by, and hard to remove.
