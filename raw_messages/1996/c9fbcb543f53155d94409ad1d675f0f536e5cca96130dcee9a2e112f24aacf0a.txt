From todays Baltic News Service newswire (my free translation):

According to the ministry of finance of Estonia, they will not give any
licences or permission to organize Internet gambling or lotteries in
Estonia. 

The reason given was, that arranging lotteries on the Internet would take
the activity outside from Estonia. According to the news, the only
Internet gambling licences given out are in Liechtenstein and Ahvenamaa
(part of Finland).

My question is: how easy it is to get a licence for Internet casino in
either Liechtenstein or some off-shore country (Belize, Bahamas etc) ? I
believe Belize was one of the first to sign legislation on Internet
gambling, does anyone have more information about the costs and
requirements?
