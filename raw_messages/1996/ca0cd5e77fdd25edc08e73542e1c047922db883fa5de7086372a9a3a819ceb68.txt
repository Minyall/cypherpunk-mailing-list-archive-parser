There have been inquiries on the source of the "Toad Hop" 
material, some from places to which it was forwarded.


As noted on cypherpunks earlier, the material is directly from:


   Jonathan Littman, an investigative reporter, has published
   "The Fugitive Game: Online With Kevin Mitnick," Little
   Brown, 1996. 381 pp. $23.95. ISBN 0-316-52858-7.

   It is a dramatic recount of Mitnick's exploits; the pursuit
   by Shimomura, Markoff, telcos and Feds; the bust and
   Markoff's tales; The Well controversies and disputes about
   what really happened; suspicions of Shimomura and Markoff -
   their complicity with TLAs, their movie and book
   dealings, their disputes with hackers and journalists. What
   Mitnick was telling Littman while a fugitive.
