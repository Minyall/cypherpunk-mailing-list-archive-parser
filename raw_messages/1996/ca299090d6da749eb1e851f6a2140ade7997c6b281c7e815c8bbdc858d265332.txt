"WorkHorse's interface is pretty ugly and the rendition is buggy, but the
SSL connection does work: I got through mbanx's "Sign in" link
at http://www.mbanx.com/banxing/5welcome.html , whereas MSIE and NS3 were
kicked out due to their 40-bit RC4 limit."

Microsoft has a 128 bit version of their Explorer available.

You have to jump through a few hoops, but they have it.
