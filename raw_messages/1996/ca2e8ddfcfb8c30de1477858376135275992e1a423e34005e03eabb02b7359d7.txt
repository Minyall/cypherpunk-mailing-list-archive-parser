As much as I like the Extropians, personally, they haven't
got a clue how to implement practical social systems.  It
is trivial to set up a wagering system that works--and you
don't need all the "polycentric" blah blah.

a)  I proposed that a bet of $100 which Jim Bell ignored.
    That should have made you sit up and take notice.
b)  Unicorn has the 50Gs and I'm confident he would have 
    paid up if necessary.

This is a non-sequitor.  Anyone serious about winning
WOULD make such a bet.  Do you really think that a legal
scholar as good as Unicorn would just shoot from the hip
without knowing he had it in the bag?
