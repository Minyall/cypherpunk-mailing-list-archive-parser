But of course, cleartext passwords have their own problems.  You really
need to make use of the fact that there is a computer at both ends so you
are protected from replay attacks.  With that caveat, passwords work fine
(except for the difficulty of remembering a bunch of them vs. the
insecurity of using the same one multiple places or writing them down).
