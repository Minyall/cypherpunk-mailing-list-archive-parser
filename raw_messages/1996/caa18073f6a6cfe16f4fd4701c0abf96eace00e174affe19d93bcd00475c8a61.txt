Wait, a lack of response on this is a meaningless metric, yet a lack of
response on this list is enough for you to make a judgement about the
nature of weaknesses in wiretap law?  Meaningless or meaningful?  Which is
it?

I think medication time passed without notice at the "Nuri" residence.

Uh, where was this exactly?  I think it was you who grouped yourself in
with Bell and then attributed the idea to me.

When did I attribute anything of the kind to you?  All I did was quote
your "new direction" in wiretap case law intrepretation which is neither
new, a direction worth going in, nor good legal intrepretation.

And we seasoned lawyers, three of us last I counted, told you that you
were an idiot for suggesting it.  I guess we hurt your feelings because
you turned around and asked for a "civilized" lawyer.  (Read: one who will
listen to your ranting).  You wanted a legal opinion, you got more than
one. Now go away.
