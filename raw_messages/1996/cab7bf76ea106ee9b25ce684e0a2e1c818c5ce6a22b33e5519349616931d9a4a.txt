Although I didn't change the title of this thread, I must disagree.

This is a brilliant move by the government.

They hold a (small) carrot out to industry:
	You can export marginally stronger crypto for 2 years, _if_ you develop a 'key recovery' system. 

At the end of the two years, they tell computer companies:
	Either you implement your system, or you stop exporting your products.
	If we don't like the system that you come up with, we won't approve it; and you can't export your (by then) existing products any more.


The computer industry has to pay the costs for developing this system, _and_, since they developed it, it is really hard for them to complain about the details of it.

Somebody in Washington has a lot on the ball.

And lots of people are falling for it:
    Apple, Atalla, DEC, Groupe Bull, HP, IBM, NCR, RSA, Sun, TIS, and UPS, to name a few.
