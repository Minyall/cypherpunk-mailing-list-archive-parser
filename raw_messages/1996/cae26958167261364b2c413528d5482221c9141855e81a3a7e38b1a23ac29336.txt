So?  What does this have to do with the price of fish?

Are Informix campuses "highly decoupled economies".

The fact is a company like Informix has a campus in India, and
it has campuses in the US that are largely staffed by Indian teams,
and it will pay big bucks to get its people out of India, even
though it has to pay them more than ten times as much in the US.

An Indian programmer doing the same job for the same company is
more than ten times as valuable to that company if he is not 
subject to the power of the Indian government, as proven by that
companies actions.

Plainly Informix does not like the power of the Indian government,
which is no surprise as a few years ago just about every company on
earth utterly detested the power of the Indian government and would
not touch the place with a ten foot pole.

Under democracy, people get the government they deserve and 
get it good and hard.
