	Java has local disk access.  Java _APPLETS_ are not allowed to
access local disk (among other things) if the class is loaded from a
network source.  A class which is loaded from local disk has no such
restrictions.

	You are just a free to grab the Java class files for an applet
and store them on your local disk as you are a CaptiveX component and let
them have full run of your system.
