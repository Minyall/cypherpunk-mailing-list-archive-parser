It seems that bit fiddling involve a direct connection of two 
partners having each one a TCP/IP Stego adapted kernel to work .
This is a direction to study , but we can't forget those who can't 
directly connect with their 'stego' partner . We can't forget also 
those who can't hack their kernel .

Any comment welcome
