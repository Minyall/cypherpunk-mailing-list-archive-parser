Until you try to bring your laptop back across the border.

On a recent trip, I was actually stopped at customs and asked about my 4
year old Dell.  Of course, I had purchased it in the US, but I didn't even
want to think about the .. er .. things that I had on the hard drive.

Linux with pgp, cfs, ssh, and a number of other interesting packages
installed. 

Should I have been worried?

yup
