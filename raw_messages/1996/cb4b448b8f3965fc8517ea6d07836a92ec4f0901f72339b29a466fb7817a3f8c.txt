What ******I'm******* afraid of is another Richard Davis coming after my daughters.

In case you don't know, he's the fuckhead who killed 12 yr old Polly Klaas 
after abducting her from her bedroom while her mother slept in the other room.

The man had been in and out of custody for years for violent crimes, and always seemed to get out.

Davis did not use encryption, a computer, the Internet, PGPPhone.  He used her panties.

Internet, encryption, anonymity: bullshit.  
Get the fucking child-murderers off the *streets*
