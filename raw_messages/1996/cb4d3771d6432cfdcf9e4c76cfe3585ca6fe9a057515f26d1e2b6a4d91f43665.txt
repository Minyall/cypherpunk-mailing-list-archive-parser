A handful of cyperpunks hardly constitutes "widespread polititcally
motivated disobedience".  In any case, the demonization has already
begun; they point their fingers at the four horsemen of the internet
at every oportunity.

What I object to is anonymous activists who perform acts at no risk to
themselves which make it harder for those of us who are trying to bring
strong crypto to everyone.

The first step is to create at least a strong minority.  A handful of
cypherpunks can be largely ignored.  We have to get the general
public using and educated about strong crypto before civil disobedience
will mean anything.
