   Are you sure it's a bug in the DOS version? When I did a pgp -kg in my 
   UNIX shell (US version 2.6.2) I also entered 2048 bits and it too 
   created a 2047 bit key instead.

   Why is there a limit to the size of the key anyway? It's too bad PGP 
   doesn't support any size key (within reason).

Regarding the unix version, what sort of processor is the machine
running?  We noticed on a 486 running linux, with a vanilla MIT
release pgp, that it made 2047 bit keys when prompted for 2048.
However, after compiling the same code on a SunOS 4.1.3 it had no
problems making a 2048 key, though it took significantly longer due to
differences in the how the operating systems function.  Also, most of
the unix machines I work on now are running hacked versions which will
handle up to 4096 bit keys, so I could handle all of my keys
relatively painlessly (and because I was curious about the code in pgp
itself). 

In any case, that's about all I know on the topic, check the
architecture of the machine your shell account is on, and if you have
access to a sun, you might try it there.  If you really want larger
keys just poke around in the code, it's not that hard of a feat to
accomplish.
