Don't archie servers already pick up the anonymous ftp fairly well?
Also, aside from no-robots conventions, you can build a cgi program for
access to files that might be more effective at blocking searches
while still preserving access.

Also, it wouldn't be hard for a web-crawler to follow ftp links,
as long as the root of an anon-ftp site is pointed to by a URL somewhere.
