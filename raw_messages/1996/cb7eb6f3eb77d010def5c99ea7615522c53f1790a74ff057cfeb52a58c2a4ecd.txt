I signed up for this Internet service through GTE.  I haven't got the 
foggiest idea what a "email bomb" is, nor do I care.  I can't possibly 
be doing anything illegal by logging on to this service and receiving 
and posting email to cypherpunks, and if someone else is, why are you 
telling me?

I don't know what you're talking about.  Maybe if you dropped the 
"Computerese" and wrote in plain English, I could understand what you're 
saying.  Are you saying (by analogy) that if someone posted my picture 
on a milk carton claiming I was lost, that I'd have to write someone a 
letter of explanation to say I wasn't lost?  And how do I *really* know 
I'm not lost, anyway?  I'd prefer that you just leave me alone.

Well, this is all quite fascinating, but it's not what I signed up for. 
Are you suggesting that I would be obliged to witness against someone? 
I've been in court before, and I know how lawyers like to insist on Yes 
or No answers, but it rarely works for me. I just get so confused....
