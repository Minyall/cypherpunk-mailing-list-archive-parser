Well, for those uninformed out there who believe that you can penetrate an NT box using NTFSDOS, the problem remains that security in windows NT is a combination between the filesystem NTFS and the actual operating system, NT.  NTFSDOS only allows reading the drives, not writing to them.  NT also keeps the security registry keys/information in approximately 25 areas, not in 1 password file.

So..

ya can't "erase a password file under NT" because they don't exist.

There's my 2 cents for this 60+ letter a day mailing list.
