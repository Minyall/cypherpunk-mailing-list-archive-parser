Of course Igor does.  As does Dimitri.  And John has the right 
to kick him off if he so desires.  What igor does not have--and 
never did have--was a right to arbitrarily use John's resources
contrary to John's wishes.

Perhaps Igor did not understand my point, or I did not make 
myself clear enough.  I was illustrating the only way someone's 
freedom could be lost given the current controversy.  

Ironically, giving Dimitri the boot has benefited the Cypherpunk
list in at least two ways.  It has vastly lowered the level of
ugly flames and personal attacks.  It has also provided us with 
a wonderful opportunity to explore such concepts as censorship,
freedom, rights and property.  I much prefer it when this list
is a forum for ideas rather than a outlet for spoiled tantrums
by the emotionally challenged.
