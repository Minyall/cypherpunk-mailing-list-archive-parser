Dear BA'ers,

For those of you in the group who are interested in crypto gear, I have 
posted two files to the BA archives which discuss the KL7 off line crypto 
unit and the KWR-37 online crypto receiver. To obtain the files, send a 
message to:
 
listprocessor@theporch.com

In the body of the message type:

get boatanchors kl7.crypto.unit
get boatanchors kwr37.crypto.receiver

The second article is the one which will be submitted to AWA Old Timers 
Bulletin. BA'ers get to read it first.
