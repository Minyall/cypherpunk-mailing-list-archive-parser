I agree.  With the aim of enforcing True Names, this might also get
tied to an internet drivers license (and your fingerprints (the
physical kind), social security number etc, much like car DLs (from
the other thread)).

Yeah, kind of wrecks all the current uses of forward secrecy, DH in IP
link level encryption; temporary RSA keys, and DH used by SSL, and so
on.

The fact that these things are currently in world wide use on a large
scale presents the US law enforcement with problems.  They'd need to
"unpublish", and recall a *lot* of software.  Some of the non-US folks
might not be so keen to do a GAK enabling downgrade.
