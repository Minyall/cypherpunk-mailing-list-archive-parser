As far as I know, DES is DES, domestic or export.  If your DES
interoperates with domestic DES (or popular implementations available on
non-US servers), then you have DES.

It is THE standard.  The political reasons are complex, but the bottom line
is that large governments and other large organizations can brute force 56
bit keys.  As far as the US government and the US banking system are
concerned, this ability does not reduce bank transaction security since the
US government can get the details directly from the bank by legal process.

Most cryptographic experts recommend Triple DES, encrypting the data 3
times with 3 different keys.  If the middle encryption runs DES in decrypt
mode, the system can be made compatible with single DES by using the same
key 3 times.  The US government has never, to my knowledge, licensed the
export of a Triple DES system.
