At the December NIST Key Escrow/GAK export meeting, Mike Nelson said that
there are rules that allow US companies to "easily" export strong encryption
to their overseas operations. The important (key :-) idea
is that the export is to protect the corporate assetts of US companies.

He seemed to imply that exporting, say PGP, for internal corporate use
was fine and easily done.

Other folks later claimed that this wasn't quite as easy as he claimed.
