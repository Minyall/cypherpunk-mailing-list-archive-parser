PGPfone works over POTS and IP. It was not originally designed to work
over IP.  The issues raised in my first post apply to modem/modem
connections and IP based implementations. The issues raised in my second
post apply to IP based implementations only (that's not quite true, but I
don't want to go any deeper into it).
