	What are the major differences between the various Mixmaster remailer
codes, especially in terms of the logistics of running a remailer? I'm
particularly interested in aspects related to A. running one by someone not
particularly familiar with UNIX (e.g., me) and B. a remailer accepting/sending
mail only from/to a limited list of addresses (e.g., only other remailers).
	Thanks,

P.S. I'm planning on starting up a remailer, probably on Lance's machine (to
take advantage of his expertise) sometime this summer. I do want to get PGP for
the VAX before then, and the MIT site doesn't appear to have this code.
