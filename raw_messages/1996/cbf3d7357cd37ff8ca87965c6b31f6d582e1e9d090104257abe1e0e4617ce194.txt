Heard on the radio today that AOL will be donating service for a year 
to the first 2000 schools that ask for it, as part of their contribution
to Net Day.  (For those of you not from California, an industry-led group
has been coordinating volunteers and materials to wire up schools to the net;
tomorrow's effort will be installing inside wiring so that schools that
have computers will be able to get hooked up.)  

Does anybody know if there's an AOL-friendly version of PGP that we can 
donate to the schools, to help teach kids about proper encryption?  
If nothing else, some of the cut&paste interfaces will do, I suppose.
AOL is fairly friendly about pseudonyms, and remailer support is
a no-brainer except for documentation readily understandable to kids.
