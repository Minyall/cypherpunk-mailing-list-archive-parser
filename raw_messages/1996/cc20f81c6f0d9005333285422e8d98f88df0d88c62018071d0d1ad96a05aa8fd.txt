   1-30-96. TWP:

   "Defense Memo Warned of Israeli Spying."

      A DoD security office issued a confidential warning 
      in October that the Israeli government was 
      "aggressively" trying to steal U. S. military and 
      intelligence secrets, partly by using its "strong 
      ethnic ties" to the United States to recruit spies. 
      It described Israel as a "non-traditional adversary" 
      in the world of espionage, noting similar
      intelligence "threats" from other close allies such as
      France, Italy, Japan, Germany, and Britain.

   "Relaxed CIA Covert Action Rules Urged."

      A private, blue-ribbon task force is urging policymakers
      to consider allowing the CIA to resume sending out spies
      posing as American journalists or members of the clergy
      and lifting the ban on certain covert actions such as
      those designed to prevent terrorist attacks or support
      the overthrow of hostile regimes.
