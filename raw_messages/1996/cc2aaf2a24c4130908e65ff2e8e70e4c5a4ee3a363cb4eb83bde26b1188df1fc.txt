In Applied Crypto, it talks about thermodynamic limitations of brute 
force attacks.  I did some calculations and it looks like it will take, 
given a perfectly effecient computer, the combined energy of 509,485,193 
average supernovas to brute force a 256 bit key. I was just wondering if 
there are any theoretical ways around this. I am just talking about 
plain brute force here, not attacking other weaknesses.
