Hello Everyone,

	The corrected (downed remailers deleted) type2.list/pubring.mix
combination is available on jpunix.com. This list now contains only
remailers that have responded to pings sent out by myself and by Raph. 
I'll automate this shortly to insure that the remailers on the list
actually respond to traffic. 

	Apologies to ecafe for saying it was down. It was poor eysight on
my part.
