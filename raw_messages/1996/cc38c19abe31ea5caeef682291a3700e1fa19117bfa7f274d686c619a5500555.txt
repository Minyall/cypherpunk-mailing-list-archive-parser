Smalltalk was in fact the first object oriented language to ever be
tweaked enough to be useful (smalltalk-80 is where JIT came from). 

Self is a completely different kettle of ball-games; it's older than java,
and based on a totally different conception of OOP. The only major 
language Ican think of that's from the same family is newton script. Self
does away with the concept of classes, and instead uses prototypes to
inherit from. The main design principle seems to have been: create a
language that's as slow as possible, then see how well you can optimise it
:)
