Thanks -- I wasn't sure if the story ever was going to run, since Doreen
interviewed me for it a month ago.

In other news, a dozen volunteer net.translators are just about done
with the English version of _Le Grand Secret_. I expect it'll appear on
my web site <http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~declan/le-secret/> when complete.
