I accept that that's one way of going about things, but I challenge
you to demonstrate conclusively that it is the only means to generate
political interest in opposition to a law.  I happen to disagree with
this, and I refuse to accept the wacky notion that by explaining to
somebody that what they're doing is in violation of a pointless stupid
law, and explaining why it's only through wide exposure of that
pointless stupidity that the law and others like it can be struck
down, that I am unwittingly strengthening the law.  Balderdash.
