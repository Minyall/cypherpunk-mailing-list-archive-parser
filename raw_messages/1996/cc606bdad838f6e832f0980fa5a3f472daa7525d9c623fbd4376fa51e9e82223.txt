'scuze the diseased marsupial for askin' but isn't the npa the "area code"?

NXX-NXX-XXXX, where the first three are the NPA (Numbering Plan Area, or
"area code") or Service Access Code (800,500), the next three are the
central office code, and the last four are the line code? 

See the E.164 standard, NANP sub-section.

While you're at it, look around for some statutes on toll fraud.

God, I love Juno.  ;)

We now return you to your regular non-crypto stupidity ...
