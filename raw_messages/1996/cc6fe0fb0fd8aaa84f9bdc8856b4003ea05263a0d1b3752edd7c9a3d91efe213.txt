Why don't we have people's access to government? We could require officials
to include remote shutdown devices when they renege on promises, line their
pockets, start wars to get re-elected, betray public trust by cruel neglect
of their sworn obligations while strutting and bombasting -- damn fools
interrupting my X-rated sleazy cheating schemes to fuck my neighbor's dog,
or ferret, or mudhole; god, I hate my momma's favorite fuck-up, poor little
me, please, world, help me get off Ritalin and wheat germ and my
lead-filled ass. Now, off to Sunday school to pray not to burn in hell. On
second think, fuck it, com 'ere pooch.
