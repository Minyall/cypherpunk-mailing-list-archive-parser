Don't we already have a list of anti-crypto cypherpunks? That should
definitely be added. I'll write the FUCKING STATIST section.

Cool. In retrospect, I understand that much of what you've been saying in
the last couple months was intended ironically. At least you didn't say
something really over-the-top like "fuck you and your high horse too."
Someone might have taken offense.

I disagree. Anything that bundles together Canter & Siegel, the Family
Research Council, the Church of Scientology, and overzealous prosecutors
in Mannheim and Cincinatti is bound to be so all-encompassing and vague as
to be meaningless. It's like discussing "the Internet Party."

Be sure to talk about Usenet censorship at NIU, those censor-happy
homosexuals at Harvard, those Stanford speech code prosecutions, the
involvement of the Wiesenthal Center in the Zundelmatter, the theft of
conservative newspapers at Stanford and elsewhere, the censorship of, in
the News & Observer's words, an "unconventional view of the Holocaust" at
UMAss Amherst, the censorship of soc.history.war.world-war-ii, the elusive
Eric Carr, those violent threats against David Irving at Berkeley, the
coverup of the number of bits in a byte, and other urban legends.

Nonspecialist idealogues are dangerous. They tend to be sloppy with the
facts. Look at Noam Chomsky; he's an embarrassment to any serious
researcher on US interventionism in Latin America.
