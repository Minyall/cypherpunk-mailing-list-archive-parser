   "Privacy and Data Collection on the Net."

      There are still a few eccentric souls who gamely try to
      hold on to what lingering shreds of anonymity they
      possess. They never fill out questionnaires; they give
      their Social Security numbers only to their bank and to
      their broker. They encrypt their e-mail; they bypass the
      supermarket discount card that links identity to
      purchases; they pay cash for medical procedures they do
      not want known; and they wait patiently for e-cash to
      become a reality. Joining these hardy individualists are
      privacy advocates such as EPIC and Net groups like 
      cypherpunks which believe in untraceable communications 
      and in the technology needed to achieve it.
