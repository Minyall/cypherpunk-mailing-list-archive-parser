This all seems really silly to me.

Are people on this list not sophisticated enough to be capable of filtering
his posts if they don't like to read them?

What's to stop him from using reailers or nymservers?  Are you going to
block them, too?

By doing something like this you give him far more attention and
encouragement than he deserves.  It's a big mistake, IMHO.
