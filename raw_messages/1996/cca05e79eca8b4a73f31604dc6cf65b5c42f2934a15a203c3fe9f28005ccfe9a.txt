You probably should.  There's more places to 'sniff' information than
just from the network.  An example is the Streams-based tty snooper.
It pushes a Streams module between the tty and the shell.
No encryption program can protect that, as it has to be in
the clear unless you can do RC4 in your head. :-)

The program I'm thinking of (sorry I forgot the name) lets the operator
both read and write to any tty session on the machine.
