I don't use AOL and ask others not to use it because they practice censorship.
(A service where one gets a TOS warning for saying "I'm horny!" in a chatroom
desribed as "Gay&Lesbian Sex discussion" deserves to be boycotted.)

However AOL would probably please their customers if it allowed them to filter
their incoming e-mail according to user-specified rules. E.g., if you could
choose to tell AOL that any incoming e-mail matching certain criteria should
be dropped on the floor, at no cost to you, I'm sure a lot of AOL users would
be very grateful and would use this feature. Ditto for other providers.
