No.

The U.S. rarely inspects outgoing stuff (I've never even seen an
international departure area that has the facilities for Customs
inspection). Unless tipped-off that some crime they are investigating is
involved.

Even if it ultimately gets established that printed books can require
export permits--something I don't expect--the enforcement of such a
situation would be problematic in the extreme. They might stop a cargo
pallet from being shipped to Slobostan, but not individual books carried in
luggage. "Don't ask, don't tell."

On the Taiwan side, though, they may wonder why you brought an expensive
U.S.-printed copy when you get the special rice-paper edition of "Applied
Cryptography, 2nd Ed." for the equivalent of $2.25 in Taipei's book stalls.
