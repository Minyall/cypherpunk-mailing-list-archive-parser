Which years?  The very definition of the Christian God encompasses all 
ultimate things, including the ability to make the Earth look like it's 
billions of years old, with *all* "evidence" in place.  There are some 
fascinating videos from Mt. St. Helens(?) which suggest possibilities 
not found in the common literature....

There can be only one point here (outside of a purely religious 
discourse), and that is that religion is a matter of faith, not of 
physical proofs.  Those spiritual beings can walk in your world (by 
definition), but you can't walk in theirs, or at least you can't prove 
it to the average cypherpunks subscriber.
