Something like that, yes.  Anything to where someone watching cannot 
tell what a person is reading from a web site... even better if one 
cannot tell who is reading it. Anonymizing proxies would also be 
nice.

There's also less worry about secure transactions, since if 
everything's encrypted it's harder to tell if a transaction is taking 
place, viewing porno or subversive or religious, literature,  or if
you're just reading something mundane.

So much for vaporware, though.

So is fast-than-light travel, but only if it's implemented.
