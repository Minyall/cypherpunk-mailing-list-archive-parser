Okay, I just checked with Wizards of the Coast, and here's the story.

Netrunner is indeed a card game. As part of the intro publicity, some demo
games will be run on the Web. (No, no info about that at the moment.) The
rest is the intersection of overenthusiastic publicity folks and clueless
reporters. "Go, marketing department, go" were the exact words of my friend.

However, he also says that the game is an exceedingly cool one, and that
those of you who like the collectable card games should check it out.
