Yes, it would be rather impractical for _that_ particular application.

The one place where this might be practical is on highways where these units 
can be placed fairly sparsely and still have a 

Even so, I think that non-police applications are more "interesting."

That's based on a certain source model.  You know, a specific capacitor in 
series resistance to limit the current.  However, if the current was induced 
from a low-impedance circuit, damaging currents might flow even if the EMF 
within a certain shielded loop in the car never exceeded a few tens of volts.

No, Tim, remember that I'm postulating an _inductively_ coupled system.  
Loop on ground, loops in the car, etc.  Magnetic coupling.  Conduction 
through car tires would be irrelevant the the functioning of this system. 
Wouldn't hurt it; wouldn't help it.

(Side note:  BTW, car tires are not non-conductive.  Check it out someday 
with a ohmmeter.)
