     If Iran, the IRA, etc. wanted to pay me to host a web page that 
described their goals and methods, I would.  

     I believe in free speach, and that means even if I disagree. 

     Then again, the only reason I am not a terrorist is that the government
hasn't YET defined hate speach directed against the government to be  
terrorism.
