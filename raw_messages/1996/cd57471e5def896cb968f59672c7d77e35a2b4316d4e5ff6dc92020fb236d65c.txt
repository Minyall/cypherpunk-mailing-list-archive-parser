Voiceprints can be done on a modern PC with a D/A sound input. The
software is, essentially, FFT, various kinds of digital filtering
and windowing, and display. Linguists (my "real" profession) have
a generally low opinion of voiceprint analysis.

For an excellent introduction to the technology, read Alexander
Solzhenitsyn's "First Circle." (The linguistics is accurate.)
