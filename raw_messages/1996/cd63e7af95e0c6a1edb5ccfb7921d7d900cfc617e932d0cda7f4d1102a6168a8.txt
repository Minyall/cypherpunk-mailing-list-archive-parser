Prove it?  Thats like saying "prove that the sun is bright on a sunny
day".  Its completely obvious.  If somebody has a new idea on how to
attack their algorithm, it might work.  Then the system will have been
broken.  You never know when somebody will come up with a new idea, so the
best you can truthfully say is "it hasn't been broken *YET*".  As I
remember, this was mentioned in more than one respected crypto book,
including "Applied Cryptography" (Schneier).
