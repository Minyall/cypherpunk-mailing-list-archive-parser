We all complain how the media are actively ignoring the crypto issues
during the campaign.  Here's a chance for us to quickly do something with
some impact beyond our group.

I'm looking insert an (1000-2000 word) op-ed piece or letter to the editor
in my local Sunday paper presenting a non-technical,
Libertarian/cypherpunk, view of the present crypto situation, our
objections to the government's proposals, etc.  Does anyone have a
suggestion on where to find such an animal?  I'd rather not spend the next
day or two writing one.

Perhaps we could coordinate a plan to have the same piece inserted next
Sunday in various newspapers.
