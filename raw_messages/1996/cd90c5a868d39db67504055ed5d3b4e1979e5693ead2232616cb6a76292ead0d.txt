Unicorn's response was inadvertently hilarious.  He says that wiretapping is 
"firmly entrenched" in law-enforcement, but the truth is that it was 
"firmly entrenched" long before it was even legal!

Ironically he said it, despite the fact that wiretapping is comparatively 
rare.  Perjury, "drop guns," faking and planting evidence, accepting bribes, 
strongarming suspects, and similar techniques are probably far more commonly 
used than wiretapping ever was, but I don't see Unicorn describing those as 
"firmly entrenched" even though that would be an accurate characterization.
