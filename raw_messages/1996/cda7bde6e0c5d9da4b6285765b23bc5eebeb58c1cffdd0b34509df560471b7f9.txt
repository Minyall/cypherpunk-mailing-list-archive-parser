Not true, I've been detained by Canadian customs for doing just that.
Everything went reasonably smoothly thanks to the customs officials 
lack of knowledge of NAFTA.  However, one of my travelling partners 
had trouble with customs due to ...hmmm... their lack of knowledge of 
NAFTA.

That's a good rule for things other than customs dealings.

I was asked if I had any eggs.  I still don't know why.

Never use the airport in Ottawa, Ontario from out of the country.  
Fly to Detroit and get on  a bus.  Drive across the border to Windsor, Ont. 
 Then, you can fly to Ottawa and not deal with customs at the airport.
