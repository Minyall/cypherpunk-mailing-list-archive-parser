Hey, let's build faster and faster fiber-optic networks. Let's create 
bandwidth so cheap that it won't even pay to meter it.

Yes, the world's problems will be solved if we have more and more people 
talking longer longer and longer on the telephone, sending each other 
more and more pages of faxes and e-mails, creating more Web pages, 
playing virtual reality games. Anything and everything must be done to 
encourage people to occupy and consume bandwidth.

Now that's progress, don't you think?
