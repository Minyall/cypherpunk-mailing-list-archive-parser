My original post, "US calls for measures against Internet porn" was a
satire. The entire point was that, by changing a few words in the
"China calls for measures against Internet porn" story, a statement by
a totalitarian communist regime could be made to look like official US
policy. Obviously, the project was a success, as people are taking it
seriously in spite of the fact that it had telltale clues, and that
the original source was revealed.

The exact changes were:

BEIJING -> WASHINGTON DC
China -> The US
State Council -> Clinton administration's State Council
Communist Party -> Republican Party
Xinhua news agency -> the Associated Press
personal computers in China -> modems in the US

That's it. None of the actual words quoted from the statement were
changed. Frightening, isn't it?
