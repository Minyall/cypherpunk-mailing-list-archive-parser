Probably because cookies aren't explained well to the 'lay public'.

Yep, it's a good alternative to stuffing a cookie in the URL and
running everything through a CGI script.

The objection I have with cookies are that they can be used to pass
information between servers.  And they're being used to track where
browsers go (see http://www.doubleclick.com for an example, theyre
not the only people doing this).

Editing the cookie file doesn't have any effect while the browser is running.
You could visit one Doubleclick-infested site and get one of their
cookies then go to another infested site in the same session.

A better method is to be able to selectively accept/send cookies from
certain sites while blocking them from others.  As it happens
I've written a program that does that.  See
http://www.lne.com/ericm/cookie_jar.  It's still got some bugs
but it generally works ok.  Note that you need access to
a unix shell and perl to run it.

It would be even better if browser writers added similar features to their
browsers.  My program is a kludge.

Servers in that position would encrypt the data sent in cookie, no?
