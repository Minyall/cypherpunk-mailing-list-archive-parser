This is correct only in the first part, it is true that good 
cryptography has never been documentably broken through weaknesses in 
a real random source.

The netscape attack was on the PRNG used in netscape, the proverbial 
state of sin. I don`t know what PRNG netscape used in the broken 
version, can anyone tell me what they used, and whether it was the 
PRNG or the seed that was weak, also I would be interested to know 
what they are using now in terms of the algorithm and seed...
