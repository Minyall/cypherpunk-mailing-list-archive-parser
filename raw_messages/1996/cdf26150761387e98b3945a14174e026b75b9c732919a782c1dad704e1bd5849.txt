There are several algorithms I've seen that allow for blind execution
of arbitrary code and verification of correctness given the usual
cryptographic assumptions. Their problem is that they are absurdly
inefficient. But their existence suggests the possibility of efficient
algorithms (or at least a good paper deriving lower bounds on the
complexity of such algorithms).
