It's the usual - if you want commercial jurisdiction, 
	40 bits unescrowed
	64 bits (16 escrowed) 

Above that, you'll have to go through state on a per customer basis 
(which I don't think is that easy to get if software is being shipped 
outside the US, and is definitely going to be expensive.)
