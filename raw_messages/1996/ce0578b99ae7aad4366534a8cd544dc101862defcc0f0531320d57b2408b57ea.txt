Incorrect.
Several states do not bother to print infants at birth.
Several hospitals do not bother to follow state guidelines in those states
which do so require.

It is one of the great advantages of the United States that no
standardized procedure for person identification exists.  Seals and
certificates vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  Cross the border to
a state and a hospital birth annoucement is enough for a drivers license,
cross again and 4 pieces and a note from mom isn't enough.

Be careful with disinformation please.
