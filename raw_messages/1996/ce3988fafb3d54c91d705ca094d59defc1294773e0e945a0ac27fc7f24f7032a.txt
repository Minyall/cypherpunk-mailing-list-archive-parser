Indeed, signing is something I shouldn't forget (having harassed Senator
Leahy on the same subject).  I will offer two observations on the subject:
(1) Many posts signed by the same key define a personality.  The key is
"key", not the email address, but they become associated. (2) When in
doubt, ask the poster via private email.  This method reduces to the levels
of trust I described in, "What am I trusting the receiver with?"

N.B. I don't sign my posts because I want "implausible deniability".
