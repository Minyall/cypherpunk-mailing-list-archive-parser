anon.penet.fi actually used a 486/66 running FreeBSD.

You don't need a monitor at all.  Since we're assuming that the remailer
is a dedicated machine, and you'll do your real work on another computer,
just plug a null modem cable into the serial ports and use a terminal
program on your other computer.

$500 tops.  8MB is probably okay, 16 might improve resistance to mailbombs
a bit tho.  You can get 486 motherboards for under $100 nowadays.
Do the math: used 486 MB+CPU: $100
                    16MB RAM: $150
            case+powersupply: $50
                    100MB HD: $20
               HD Controller: $15
      Dual 16550 Serial Card: $15
              28800bps Modem: $150
                             ------
                              $500

And if you really want to run a remailer, I can sell you most of the above,
and I'll even throw in a 340MB IDE HD with Linux+remailers preinstalled!
(Yes, I'm serious.)
