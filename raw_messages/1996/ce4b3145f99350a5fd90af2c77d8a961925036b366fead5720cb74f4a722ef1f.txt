     There is a "class" of insurance (and I am sure that someone will cornect
me if I am wrong) whose name I forgot, but it is more or less "Calamity" or
"serious accident" insurance. It doesn't cover things like sore throats, 
physicals (something you might want to look into, they can catch things before
they get serious, and you are getting along in years), simple stitches &etc,
but does cover things like getting nailed by a drunk driver, as presumably
accidental shootings by black clad ninjas. 

     Consult your local fraudmeister for more information.
