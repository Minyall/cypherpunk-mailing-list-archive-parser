There is no way to know for sure, since Mondex won't release the specs, 
but just about everybody I talk with that knows at least something about 
their system agrees that if you crack a Mondex card, you will likely be 
able to mint money. Since Mondex allows transfers from card to card to 
card, it may be a long time indeed before the breech is disovered. If I 
were a Mondex issuer, I would be worried. Very worried.
