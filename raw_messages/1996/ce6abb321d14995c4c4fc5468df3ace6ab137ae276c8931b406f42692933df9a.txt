Just so we are all clear about what HP is up to: in August, 1996, I
attended a presentation by HP's policy person. He was touting the
anti-four horsemen properties of HP/TIS/unnamed other's "voluntary" "key
recovery"  system. When I pointed out to him that voluntary GAK could not
possibly defend against criminals using strong crypto, since such
criminals are unlikely to register their keys with the "escrow" agency, he
replied: 

"There are many 
possible interpretations of the words 'voluntary' and 'mandatory'."

I am willing to testify to this under oath.

I don't know what dictionary HP is using. Orwell himself must have 
written it.
