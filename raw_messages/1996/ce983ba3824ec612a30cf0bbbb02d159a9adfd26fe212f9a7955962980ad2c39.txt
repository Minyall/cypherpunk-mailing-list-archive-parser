In other news, Holocaust Revisionist mgiwer@combase.com (Matt Giwer) has
been *openly bragging* about getting a political opponent kicked off of a
conservative Texas ISP. The main difference between the French and Texas
cases being that the information on Rack Jite's web pages was true, and
the information on the Holocaust Revisionist sites is not. I guess that's
not important, though, since by definition, Political Correctness only
targets the right.
