Uhh, I'd like a second opinion please doc.  Are you suggesting that
whenever anybody with cryptographic expertise (like, maybe, anybody on
this mailing list) leaves the country we're in violation of munitions
export laws?

Is somebody who knows how to build a rocket in the same boat?

This sounds fishy to me.  I don't recall reading anything to suggest
that export of cryptographic software (or any other munition) requires
that the stuff be *used* outside the US for an offense to be
committed; why should export of a cryptographer's wetware be any
different?  Either the expertise leaves the country or it doesn't, I'd
think.
