I, for one, am interested in running untrusted code.  If I can run
untrusted code, I can greatly reduce my exposure to Trojan horses and bugs.
 It bothers me that if I run Microsoft Word, it can trash my MacWrite
files.  Even if I get these programs from reputable dealers, in original
shrink-wrap boxes, so I have good reason to believe I know who the author
is, I am still exposed to these problems.

I should note that Java's one-straitjacket-fits-all approach to running
untrusted programs is not adequate to satisfy my desires.  However, it is a
start, and it does run in todays complex Input Output Control Systems that
have been misnamed "Operating Systems".  (If it can't enforce a security
policy, it isn't an Operating System.)

I would rather use technological means to prevent damage than legal means.
