Yes, a silly mistake on my part, which shows I should proofread even
the little messages before posting them. :)

Gleeful readers are filling my mailbox hoping to be the first to point
out this unfortunate error.

S/MIME aside, I was under the impression that the term "Triple-DES"
referred to the encrypt-decrypt-encrypt operation using two 
distinct keys, proposed by some for adoption as the successor to 
single DES. 

Has this usage now changed in favor of the three key version?
