I've put up a list of remailer front ends, sorted by platform, at

http://yakko.cs.wmich.edu/~frogfarm/free/crypt.html#private

I welcome all additions. Right now, I have links to Private Idaho (Windows),
Yet Another NewsWatcher (Mac), and PGPMR/2 for OS/2 (requires MailReader/2).

Nym servers and cpunk remailers are poised to take off, if those who wish to
use them are capable of learning. The rest of us can either try to teach 'em
in a non-condescending manner, or continue to work on front end utilities.
