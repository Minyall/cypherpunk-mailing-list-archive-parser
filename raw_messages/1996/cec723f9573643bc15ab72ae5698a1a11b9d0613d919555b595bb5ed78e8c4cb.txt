Since declaring victory, Unicorn has said far less about the
wager than has Tim.  When it comes to wasting bandwidth, Tim
might consider removing the boulder in his own eye before 
going after the mote in someone else's.

As far as I can see, the wager had its intended effect.  I
only hope that future undocumented pronouncements are dealt
with as effectively.
