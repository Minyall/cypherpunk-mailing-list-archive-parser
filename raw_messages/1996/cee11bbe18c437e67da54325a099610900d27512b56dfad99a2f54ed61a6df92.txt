"... In Germany they first came for the Communists and I
didn't speak up because I wasn't a Communist. Then they came
for the Jews, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Jew.
Then they came for the trade unionists, and I didn't speak
up because I wasn't a trade unionist.  Then they came for
up because I wasn't a trade unionist.  Then they came for
Catholics, and I didn't speak up because I was a Protestant.
Then they came for me-and by that time no one was left to
speak up..." Pastor Martin Niemoller
