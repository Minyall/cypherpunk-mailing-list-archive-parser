Certainly. EFF regularly compromises with our allies, e.g. on who will 
run a particular web page, what a campaign icon will look like, where an 
event will be held, etc.  We're just not in the habit of compromising on 
legislation, since we are not in a position to give or sell anything, 
particular the rights of the public and of individual citizens.
