I should have done some more research first before going off and whining.

It seems that at least two Stanford graduate students, one in business and
one in engineering, are involved with the project. I guess they thought,
"Look, the Yahoo guys just got millions of bucks. Let's do the same
thing." 

They will be receiving an excellent education in "knowing your target
audience" and "good design." Also "intellectual property," "public
relations," and a few other subjects.
