Flood Warning 
 
by Jason Fairlane 
 
 
This program scans a host to determine which ports are open,  
or listening for connections. Once a list of receiving ports  
has been compiled, the program then floods each of them with 
the specified number of SYN packets. 
 
Don't use this software without permission. I'm serious. It's  
very very very bad. This is probably one of the worst forms  
of Denial-Of-Service attacks there is. No one will be able  
to connect to your target's machine. It's bad. 
 
[Code follows.]
