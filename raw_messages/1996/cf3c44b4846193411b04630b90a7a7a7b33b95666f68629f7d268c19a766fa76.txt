	It's an interesting idea. One wonders if EFF would be interested in
such a sponsorship? One could even add, say, an ACLU promotion to the end of
messages without getting cash from the ACLU - this might encourage them to give
more backing in case of a legal dispute. (You scratch my back, I scratch
yours... I'm not meaning to be offensive to the ACLU, BTW.)
