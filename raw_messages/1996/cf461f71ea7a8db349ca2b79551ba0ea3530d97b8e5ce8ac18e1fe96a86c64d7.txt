|      and the verdict is... NetMYTH!  I checked the cite in the article on 
|      cyberterrorism... no such article ran on 6/2/96 in the Times 
|      (London)... nor, in fact, in any newspaper available on Nexis... 
|      just thought I would let you know...

I've met Winn Schartau and a number of the people mentioned in the
article at a conference in Brussels about Information Warfare two
weeks ago.

I've also seen the article that is referred in the message from
Winn, and here is the URL for it.

Alternatively, you can access it through

http://www.the-times.co.uk/

going through a brief registration process etc.

Also, I've meet the journalist, Peter Warren, at the conference as
well. We even went for a beer! :-)

So, I'd definitively say there is too much real-world details
to it for me to believe it is a NetMYTH.

PS. I'm not a netMYTH either, and I do exist. :-)
