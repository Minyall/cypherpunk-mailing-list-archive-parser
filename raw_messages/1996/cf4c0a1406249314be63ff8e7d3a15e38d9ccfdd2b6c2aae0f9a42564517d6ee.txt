The only reason I ever used to use them was their lack of censorship. 
If they go ahead with this blocking, I doubt I'll ever use them again.
Of course it's the principle, not the fact that I have nothing better to
do all day long that download porn :-)

They'll mean 3,000,000,000 (Brits hardly ever use billion to mean
million million).

I doubt it.  A friend of mine, a demon subscriber, sends over a Gig of
email every day.

I think there are in the order of 100,000 subscribers, so this would
make the average 30,000 email message - definately not realistic.
