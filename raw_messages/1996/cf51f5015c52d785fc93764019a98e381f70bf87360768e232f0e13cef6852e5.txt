	Just a stab, but maybe this might work:  Get two picures of
with both at minimum sufficient size to carry the message.  Use the
lsb's (or any bit for that matter) of the second image to XOR with the
message before stego'ing (L'eggo my S'tego :) into the first.  Of course
you'ld have to arrange which bit in the pad image will be used, how to
associate the images, etc. before hand.
