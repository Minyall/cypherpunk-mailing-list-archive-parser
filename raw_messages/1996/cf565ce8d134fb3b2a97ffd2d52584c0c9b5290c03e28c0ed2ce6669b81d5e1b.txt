Two funny rumors:

1. Supposedly the DoD users of GPS have access to the accurate positioning
information at all times. (Not sure how this works - the accurate data is
encrypted?) During the Iraq war in '93 they didn't have enough equipment
to take advantage of this, so they turned off the S/A and gave everyone
(including the military users) accurate GPS on commercially available GPS
eq. Then they turned it back on.

2. The DoD is doing a study right now on how to make GPS useless to the
enemy at wartime.

I think figuring out a way to turn off A/S and getting accurage GPS on
commercial equipment at all times would make a nifty Cypherpunks project
- if it really involves breaking some encryption.
