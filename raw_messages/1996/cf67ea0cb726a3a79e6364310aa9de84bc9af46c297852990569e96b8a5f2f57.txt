I can verify this ability of telephone switches and number tracking. From
1984 to 1990 I worked for the University of Texas at Austin in their
Physical Plant Telco shop. I worked on a NT SL-1 based switch feeding voice,
data, and analog signals all over campus as well as interfacing to SWBT's
trunk lines.

I personaly used the system to track on campus phreak and hack attacks as
well as feeding the universities computerized security system. We used a
Charles Rivers 68/35 running building control software. With it we could
track various aspects of the telephone switch and log them offline. We used
the system strictly for input of signals for physical security (ie door
switches, mag-locks, PIR's, etc.) over the dry pair of the switch.

Watch your 6's.
