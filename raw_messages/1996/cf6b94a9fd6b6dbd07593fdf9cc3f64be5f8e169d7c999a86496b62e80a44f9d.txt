crypto@uhf.wireless.net was subscribed to dcsb@ai.mit.edu, and seems to be
directly zinging messages, sans any identification as forwarded material,
straight off of dcsb to cypherpunks@toad.com. I went in and killed this
address from dcsb, but I don't know how long that's going to last.

I forwarded a story to cypherpunks a while ago from Netly News about a rash
of denial of service attacks that're happening on email accounts around the
net. It looks like cypherpunks is part of that attack, and it looks like
crypto@uhf.wireless.net may be involved. Or not. Anyway, I'll send a copy
of the Netly article to dcsb in another message, for everyone's
entertainment on dcsb.

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
