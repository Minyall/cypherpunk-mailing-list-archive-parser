	I'd like to publicly commend Joey for releasing a winsock
remailer.  Having a remailer that will run on 50 million desktops is a
very powerful and important fact, and one that will make it much
harder to destroy the remailer network.  I'd also expect to see a lot
more remailers a year or so from now.  (Technology takes time to catch
on.)
