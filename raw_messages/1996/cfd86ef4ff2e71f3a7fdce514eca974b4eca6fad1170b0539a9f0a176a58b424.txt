The SET transaction spec is now available on www.visa.com (and presumably on
www.mastercard.com although I didn't check).

Highlights are:
        It cops out on the big one - how to identify card users in the first
        place to issue certificates.

        The MS/Visa 'credential' that looked like a certificate but wasn't has
        been replace by X.509
