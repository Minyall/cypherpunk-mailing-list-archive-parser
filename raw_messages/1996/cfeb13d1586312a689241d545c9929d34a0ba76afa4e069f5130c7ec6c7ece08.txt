This assumes that such cases actually exist.  I imagine if 
such a thing ever happened, the NSA would shout it from the 
rooftops for the next three hundred years.

Recollect that the trade tower bombers were caught because 
they were unclear on the concept of a deposit.  Whenever 
terrorists are busted, nobody makes any big secret of how 
they were busted.  On the contrary, the newspaper reporters 
are in danger of being trampled in the rush to take credit.
