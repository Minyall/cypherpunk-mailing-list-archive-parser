The government made this bed, now they need to sleep in it.

Strong encryption and authentication would go a long way towords
making the net safer.  But the NSA wants the market fragmented & weak.

(Strong encryption is not a cure-all, nor a replacement for firewalls.
But it is a needed part of the infrastructure.)

|           [W] ASHINGTON -- Government investigators warned
|               Wednesday that computer hackers cruising the
|           Internet posed a serious and growing threat to national
|           security, with the Pentagon suffering as many as 250,000
|           "attacks" on its computers last year.
