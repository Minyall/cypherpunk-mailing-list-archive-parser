I'm outta step here, I know, but it seems to me that if we're going to go
around advocating anonymity and technology that makes censorship
impossible we'd better grow thicker skins. 

Phil changed the world.  Maybe not as much as people like Roosevelt or
Reagan, but a lot more than most people do.  He wrote a software package
that's in wide use, and which has lots of admirers.  He used technology to
effect positive political changes around the world -- noteworthy both for
the effect and the ingenuity of the strategy.  And he stood up under a
personal attack from the government.  They came at him, but he took it and
won.

he's got a case, he should sue.  But something tells me he's tough enough 
to take it either way.
