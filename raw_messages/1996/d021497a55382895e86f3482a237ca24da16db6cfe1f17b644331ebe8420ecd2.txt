To Moroni: You talk about "my people" and "my religion".  Do you *own* 
these people?  Maybe your church owns their minds, huh?  What purpose 
does big-time organized religion serve other than to control the 
otherwise dangerous and predatory species we call human?

I guess if "your people" didn't kill anyone this year (or this decade, 
or in the last 50 years ad nauseam), then we should pin a medal on your 
chest, yes?  Frankly, it doesn't matter per se what "your people" pledge 
to do or not do, what matters is you, and me, and other individuals who 
*learn* not to kill, and to not have a desire to kill, and so forth.

"Your people" are always going to frighten others and stir up paranoia, 
for the very simple reason that:  1. They're human, and therefore are 
predators, and  2. In a large group like the Mormons, they have real 
power.  And this applies to all such groups, BTW.
