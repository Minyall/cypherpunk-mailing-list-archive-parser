MY invitation to Dimitri has NO topic limitations, Zach's 
suggestion to the contrary notwithstanding.  Do I take it, 
Dimitri, we have a tentative agreement for you to come and speak
at an SF area Cypherpunks meeting at our expense?  You are so
vocal usually.  Why will you not respond to my invitation?  I
consider this rude even by Russian standards.
