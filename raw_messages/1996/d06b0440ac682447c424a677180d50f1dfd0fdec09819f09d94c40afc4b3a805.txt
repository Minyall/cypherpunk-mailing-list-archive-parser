According to HP, the "Polish" part of the term comes from a Polish mathematician whose
name (I can't spell it, and I don't have the .DOC) is pronounced phonetically:
WOOCASHEVITZ.  The "reverse" part apparently means the inventor specified the 
operation before the parameters, instead of how HP implemented it.
