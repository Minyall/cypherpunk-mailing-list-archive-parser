But doesn't the bill grant the right to use encryption? That's my 
point... the Internet and even international phone calls render that 
rule meaningless, since there are other (easier?) ways to communicate 
internationally using ciphers.

Leahy's bill doesn't restrict what media encryption may be used on.

I am aware that (as of now) crypto is banned on HAM, but my question 
is whether one can consider the Leahy bill to lift that ban. (It 
might also be useful for HAMs to get an amendment of some sort to the 
bill...)
