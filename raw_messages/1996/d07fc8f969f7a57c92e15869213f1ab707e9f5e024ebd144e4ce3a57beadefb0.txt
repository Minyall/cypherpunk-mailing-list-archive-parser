Maybe it wasn't made clear that all the pictures have been postprocessed
with an experimental version of PGP* to optically anonymize them, thus
protecting the identies of both the innocent and the guilty without bias.
Software problems triggered by Eric's neckware prevented the anonymizing
process from working properly in his case. Sources tell me that PRZ himself
was in many of the pictures, very nicely rendered as a classic marble and
rought-iron fireplace.
