Security is an odd thing. I have clients who have obvious and very
extreme security needs that do not spend any real time worrying about
security and as a result end up being burned. However, until the day
you are burned, you never think about security and never notice it is
absent. To some extent, it is the job of consultants such as myself to
assure that firms understand what they have at stake and how to
protect themselves, especially by securing their communications
networks with cryptography.
