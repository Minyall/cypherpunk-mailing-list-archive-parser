Not being technically oriented, I may be venturing into deep
water here, but I don't think ANI "pass through" is likely at
all.  When you use a pre-paid calling card, TWO separate calls
and call set-ups are made, your call to the card company and
the card companies call to your ultimate destination.  While 
many (most?) card companies keep records of all calls placed,
there are some who keep no records at all.  Unless this
hypothetical "pass through" capability is somehow built into 
the the phone infrastructure and is transparent to the card 
companies, I seriously doubt the card companes would invest any
resources in doing such a "pass through."  After all, the same
information is available, albeit with a bit more work, from 
their operational logs if they even keep those.
