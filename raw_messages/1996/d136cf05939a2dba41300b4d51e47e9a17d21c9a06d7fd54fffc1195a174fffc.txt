There is *no* more real research that the research I do myself, and know
about myself:  1) I have generally tested in the top 1/000 of one percent
of the population in "intelligence", and  2) I have expended considerable
effort in personal study and experiments with what the human body is
capable of under given circumstances.  I have rubbed elbows with the
world's most well-conditioned people (physically), for one, and have
learned (for two) how to never get sick again (21 years running).

I hope I didn't give the wrong impression - genetics are certainly a
factor in anything human, however, environment has an overwhelming
influence on subsequent development. It's not 100% to 0%, in other words.

I hope I don't regret saying this, but the above study has a far greater
chance of being "politicized bullshit" than anything I'm likely to say,
even when it's not from my personal experience.  Get serious, Igor.
How the devil are you going to evaluate the fairness, honesty, and other
attributes of such a study?  Do you know the researchers?

If you were evaluating the integrity of a University study on the sexual
preferences of a Tsetse fly, there is a reasonable possibility of taint
in such an innocuous study, due to the grant money and how the outcome
data can leverage other monies, etc., but a study of Black -vs- White
IQ's?  I wouldn't read such a study unless I were stranded on a desert
island with nothing else to do.  I'd be better off reading something
more relevant to real life, such as the power struggles between the
ADL and Willis Carto, or Fred Goldman and O.J. Simpson, whatever.
