Coming to a bank near you.

The easy solution includes optional release of high balance and payment
history only to the big three at the customer's option with full
disclosure and customer waiver before the release as to the nature of the
data to be shared with the credit company.

Several offshore banks made the habit of issuing "secured" Gold
Mastercards in corporate names.  Essentially they were debit cards and
could be used anywhere with atms to withdraw cash on the spot.  Most of
these practices were ended by shrewd attacks from the United States (the
U.S. branches of these banks started having undefined and rather vague
license problems and regulatory headaches until they agreed to direct
their offshore branches to stop issuing these cards).

There are several people who are aware that privacy is a marketable
service in credit card banking and insurance now.  In my view such an
institution will exist within 12 months.
