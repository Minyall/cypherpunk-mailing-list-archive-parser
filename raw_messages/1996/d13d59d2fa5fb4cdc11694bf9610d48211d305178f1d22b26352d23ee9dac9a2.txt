I just spent several minutes on a longer response, but on second thought I
think it suffices to say publicly that this was a particularly elliptical
joke, not at Tim's expense, that I retract and apologize for. And I've
received other mail that suggests that my primary assumption was wrong
anyway, about which I'm happy. 

I hadn't meant to post that paragraph publicly anyway, since it was a
stupid bluff. Oops. I've verified that it didn't go the other places I'd
sent a version of the article. 

And now back to our regularly scheduled programming...
