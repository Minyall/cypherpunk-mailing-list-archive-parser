C'punks,

Interestingly, Phill responded to my last message with both a
private one and a public one.  In the private one (which I 
mistakenly believed was sent to the list), he told me that he 
was declining the wager.  As his reasons, he mentioned that he 
was not as interested in money as I appeared to be.  To which I 
replied:

It's not about the money.  Phill knows that, I know that, and so
does everyone else.

He further chided that I could draw no other conclusions then
that he wasn't interested in the wager.  I responded:

Oh yes I can.  And fortunately, so can everyone else.  Better a 
live jackel than a dead lion, right? 

In Phill's recent public post he said:

Notice how Phil again proposes a straw man by making an implicit
analogy between trials by combat, and a wager, the outcome of
which would turn on the actual outcome of events forecast--in the
alternative--by Phil and myself.

Oh really?  Then how come you at first defended it with your
attempted face-saving "GBP" comment?

Really, Phill, have you know shame?
