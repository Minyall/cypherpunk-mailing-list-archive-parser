	That would seem to be a possibility; admittedly, the local copy of
AC has been checked out for the past year, so I haven't been able to take a
look at it. I'd tend to think that if you _know_ the flaw, one could come up
with a better way to deal with it than the generalized method I discussed.
For instance, if the MSB of bytes coming out of a scribble window is too low
in entropy, only use it XORed or whatever with a more-random bit.
