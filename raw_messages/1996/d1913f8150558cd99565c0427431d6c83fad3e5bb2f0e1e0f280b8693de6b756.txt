Ed, I've pointed out to you during our mini-flame war that I've been getting
4 copies of your every e-mail: 2 via the cpunks list, 2 directly from your
box cc:'d to me. You _know_ that I've been getting 2 copies of cc:'s not
passing through toad.com, that the problem is at your end, and not at toad.com,
and you should _not_ send test posts to cypherpunks.

I'm sorry if your recent posting flurry was provoked by my question about what
you have contributed to this discussion besides puerile flames of Fred Cohen.

None of the following:
 * your test posts
 * your lack of understanding of anonymous remailers
 * your inability to configure sendmail
have any cryptographic relevance (other than to discredit your technical
knowledge, which you have done quite thoroughly :)

Please stop polluting this mailing list with test messages. Thank you.

(I wish I could set up procmail on this box.)
