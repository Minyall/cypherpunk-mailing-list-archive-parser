Subject: Encrypted tape archive  solution?

Hi,

I have a linux system and create tape archives every night. Most 
sensitive data files are encrypted, but I want the whole tape archive
to be encrypted just for the peace of mind. 

Is there any simple solution for linux 2.0 that allows to create
encrypted archives?

Another question: suppose I use Matt  Blase's CFS. Is it safe to backup 
the _encrypted_ files, and not the mounted directory that looks decrypted?
(i.e., not the "attached" filesystem).

Thanks,

	- Igor.
