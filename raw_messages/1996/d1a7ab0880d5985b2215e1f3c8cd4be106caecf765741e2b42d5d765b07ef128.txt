I would like people to send me (pointers to) reference information on
how to write WinSock-compliant client software.  Also tools required,
hopefully free/shareware ones.  The particular application of interest
is a "web-crawler" which can log certain information in web pages it
finds.

If such reference information is not available or forthcoming, but
there are people reading this who nevertheless know how to write such
software, they are invited to contact me about contracting to write
such an application for a negotiable payment.

Please respond by Email, as I only subscribe to a digest of the
Cypherpunks list.
