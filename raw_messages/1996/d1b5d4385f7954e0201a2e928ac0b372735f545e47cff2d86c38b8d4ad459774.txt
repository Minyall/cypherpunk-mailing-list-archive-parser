If all you want to be is an asshole, why do you bother with me?
Surely you could pick a more "respected" target, yes?
Looks like you:
1. Don't have anything to do, and
2. Feel insecure, and
3. Feel inferior to me (wonder why), and
4. Don't have any real answers.

To get non-answers from ignorants like yourself, I guess.

I hope you're saying that I'm not on the same wavelength as you and
*certain* other c-punks.  I feel better already.

Yeah, but you're obliged to partake one way or the other.
Ya' know, you and a few other people whine a lot about government
intrusion this or that (when you take your head out of the sand
momentarily), but like selfish little children, you cover your ears
when the news is unpleasant, like that's going to make a difference.

Maybe if you got off your ass and did something worthwhile for society,
things would really change for the better.  But I won't hold my breath.
