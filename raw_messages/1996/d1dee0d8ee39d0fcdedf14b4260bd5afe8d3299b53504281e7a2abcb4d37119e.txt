I've come up with a new term to describe the type of 'improved' security
in the new International edition of Lotus Notes:

'espionage-enabled'

It's specifically built for export, and has a backdoor to enable USG agents
to read the messages more easily. From the viewpoint of a foreign purchaser,
'espionage-enabled' seems an appropriate term.

If we spread this term sufficiently, we may be able to discourage the 
widespread adoption of this half-measure, and increase the pressure for
good, unencumbered crypto.

speaking only for myself,
