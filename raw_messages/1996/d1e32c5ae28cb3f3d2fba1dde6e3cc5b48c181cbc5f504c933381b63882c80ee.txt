Please do not respond on the list, as this does not need to clog it up 
further.

I am 19 years old, and I make 60,000 (verifiable income) per year.  I 
have a 2000 dollar down payment.

NOBODY will give me a loan.  Everyone tells me my credit is fine, and 
yet, I cannot get a car loan to save my life.

I have so far only tried major banks and GMAC finance.

If anyone has any information that could help me find a place in the 
denver area that would give me a car loan (or anywhere really - money 
can be wired from anywhere) PLEASE let me know.

I am trying to get a ~35,000 car loan - so far EVERYONE has just 
straight up told me I am too young (even though I make twice what these 
people make :) )

Thanks...
