I said it recently on another forum: U.S. today reminds me not of Nazi
Germany (which would have existed for hundreds of years if it hadn't
foolishly attacked more neighbors than it could fight at the same time),
but of the former Soviet Union under late Brezhnev, Chernenko, and
Andropov. Nothing needs to be done; just wait for it to collapse and
try not to get hit by the falling debris. :-)
