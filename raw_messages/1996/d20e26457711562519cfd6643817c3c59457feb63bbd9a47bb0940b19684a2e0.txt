The one-and-only Paul S. Penrod once stated:
! 
! This has been done in the past using several vairants (but not in a image 
! program).
! 
! The key to the success is that the application in question has to be 
! compromised to respond to these codes, either by design or by hacking. 
! Either way the individual responsible must modify the execution 
! mechanism, not just the data itself.
! 
! Let's see -current examples of computing items with this kind of a 
! "feature"... magic cookies, macros, OLE, DDE, MS Objects, JAVA, and the 
! list keeps growing.

And not  to forget  the future  of virii.  Modification  of the  BIOS of
parts of the PC platform (motherboard, SCSI interfaces), or the firmware
of drives.  Since these building blocks  are more and more equipped with
flash-like PROMS which  can be reprogrammed, they become  a valid target
for these kinds of programs.
