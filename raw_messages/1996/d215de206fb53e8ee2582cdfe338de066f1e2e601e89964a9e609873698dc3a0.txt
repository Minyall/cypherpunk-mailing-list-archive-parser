We talked here a while back about the Gilbert & Sullivan operetta where
there was a "court exploder" or something, whose job it was to blow up the
king should the monarch become too egregious in conduct. The limiting
factor was that the "exploder", or whatever, was the person who would
inherit the king's job.
