Smart Use for Smart Cards
     
"UBIQ announced that its software has been selected by American Express to
personalize smart cards that will be issued ... for ticketless travel on
American Airlines. ... Airline travelers with these smart card holders will be
able to proceed directly to an airport gate, insert their smart card into a gate
reader, receive seat confirmation, and board the plane without touching a single
piece of paper. 
     
"Traditionally, smart card technology has been associated with user
authentication for computer systems or as an electronic alternative for cash.
This announcement takes the best of both worlds and looks to provide a
potentially innovative use for smart cards. ...

Of course, not having a card may subject you to greater scrutiny at check-in
time due to the reduced tracking ability.
