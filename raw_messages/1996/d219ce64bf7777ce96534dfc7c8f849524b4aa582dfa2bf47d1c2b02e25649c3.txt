It might.  Some people in law enforcement/government would
really like to see that, Constitution be damned.

As currently interpreted by NSA/DOJ et al, yes.
"Pluggable crypto" is not allowed by the people who enforce ITAR.
They might be working towards the eventual police state but
they're not stupid.

NCSA, when they were about to release a new version of Mosaic that
had hooks for PGP, were explicitly told by NSA that they would
remove those hooks before the software was released.


BTW, no version of PGP is exportable under ITAR; they all
use real crypto.   The international version exists because of
patent problems with RSA and the way that those problems were
resolved.  I think this is explained in the README that comes
with PGP; if not, the book _The Official PGP Users Guide_
by Phil Zimmerman (ISBN 0-262-74017-6) explains it.
