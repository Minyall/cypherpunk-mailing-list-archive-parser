Sorry, to beat a dead horse, but isn't this like that thread re:Vince Cate's 
invitation for us to all move to Anguila? We'd still be exporting our 
thoughts in violation of the ITAR. As long as you're American (person or 
corporation) you'd still be commiting a crime by putting strong crypto on 
the net, regardless of where you are, right? (That's what I remember from 
Micheal Froomkin's arguments from the last time this revolving thread came
around).

Of course, if some OTHER company (wink,wink,nudge,nudge) that is not 
incoporated in the US were employ to export a secure version of Netscape 
from Amsterdam, that would be another story (and how would anyone know that
the code, just so happenned to have been written Jeff, et al.?)
Just as long as the portion of Netscape that nominally produces Netscape 
(the software) and distributes it does not call itself Netscape and is 
not a US corporate citizen, that is the end of the game, right?
Anyone got any spare holding companies handy?
