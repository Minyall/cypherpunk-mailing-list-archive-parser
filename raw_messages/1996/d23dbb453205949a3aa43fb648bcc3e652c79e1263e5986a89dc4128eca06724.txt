PGPlib has an interface to encrypt the whole keyring, however that
probably isn't going to be fully implemented unless time permits.
This interface allows you to encrypt the WHOLE keyring in a
passphrase, which includes not only the secret components, but the
public components as well.  However I don't know if I'll have the time
to get to it.

Enjoy!
