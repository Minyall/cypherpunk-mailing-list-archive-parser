I heard an ad on the radio for a free seminar on how to protect your assets
using off-shore banks.  I forget who the speaker is, I think they're with
the English-Irish bank in Austria, or something like that.  The thrust
was to save assets for when you retire and Social Security isn't there
for you.

I'm posting this since off-shore banking touches on privacy issues
and comes up here now and then.

Two dates, Jan 17 (Newton, MA) or Jan 18 (Burlington, MA).
Call 617 663 3299 for more info.
