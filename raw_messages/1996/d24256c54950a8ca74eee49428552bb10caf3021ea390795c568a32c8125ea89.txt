Gee, if we could just prosecute "the govt." under auspices of the
"three strikes" legislation:

Gehlen Deal                   MK/ULTRA
"That 'Bay of Pigs' thing"    ZR/RIFLE
Watergate                     MH/CHAOS
Iran/Contra                   Phoenix Program
BCCI/BNL                      COINTELPRO
INSLAW                        Waco, etc.

Just say "Three strikes and you're (what?)"
