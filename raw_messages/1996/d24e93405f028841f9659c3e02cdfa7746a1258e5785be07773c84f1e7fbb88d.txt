In the recent hearing of the Bernstein case, Anthony Coppolino for the 
Justice Department said:


"We don't care about the theory; we don't care about
the idea Mr. Bernstein has, which was to take a particular type
of algorithm and use it to allow for an encrypted interactive
conversation.  That's his idea.
We don't care about his idea; we care about the
result of what it can do."

Encrypted interactive conversations seem to be something to be concerned 
about...They are afraid of us.
