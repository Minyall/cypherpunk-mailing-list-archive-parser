I don't get it. Why is this bond not saleable like any other? What 
"privately-produced currencies" are a hedge against inflation? If 
this bond is saleable like any other, why is the money unavailable? 
What means "greater spendability?" Is this assumed to be yet another 
government plot because it competes with other offerings and reduces 
the cost of borrowing?

Respectfully.
