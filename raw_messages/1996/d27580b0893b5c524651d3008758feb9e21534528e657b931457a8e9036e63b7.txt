I might have some insight on this after Thursday's afternoon outing to
the Microsoft Web Builder Workshop.  (for those who haven't heard, MSoft
is offering a half-day seminar with major swag... for $89, you walk out
with NT 4.0 server, J++, FrontPage and every instantiation of MSIE)  I
expect to learn some interesting stuff.
