Surely there is at least one good solution to an exceedingly common 
problem -- large assets in the US that are known to the authorities.

Smoke.

The reason that no one publishes "How to" step by step instructions for 
discretely expatriating your money is exactly the same reason as the reason
that nobody publishes "How to" step by step instructions for buying dope.

For example one ever popular method of expatriating money, (or repatriating
it to preferred politicians), is by means of a friendly cattle futures 
broker.

First find your friendly cattle futures broker.

Despite this, many people manage to buy dope and many people manage to 
discretely expatriate their money.
