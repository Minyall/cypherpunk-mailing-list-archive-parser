How about a simple non-technical solution?  Each patient picks a
random pseudonym; the database is keyed off that pseudonym, and the
person's True Name(tm) never appears in the database.  Patients
should remember their pseudonym (or write it down); then they can
add information to the database.

Ahh, anonymity.
