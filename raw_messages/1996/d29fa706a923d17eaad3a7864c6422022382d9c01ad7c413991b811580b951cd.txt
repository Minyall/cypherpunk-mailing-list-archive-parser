Or maybe he is uping the ante.  Tell you what Phil, I'll bet you
US$50 aganist your L25 (in other words, I giving you odds at the
current rate of exchange) that Limbaugh have a nationally TV show
on or before 1 October 1996.

If you are willing to put your money where your mouth is, just
say you agree to these terms in a post to the list.  After that,
we can agree to appoint someone to declare a winner and hold the
money in the meantime.  Any volunteers for the honor?
