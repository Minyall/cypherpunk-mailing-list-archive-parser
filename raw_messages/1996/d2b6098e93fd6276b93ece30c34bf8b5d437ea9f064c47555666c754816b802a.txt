As is par for the course, Tim May's comments are apposite and on the mark.

As for the fellow whose neighbor was blasting "Yoruba 'music'", he certainly
has my sympathy, but amazingly, he seems to feel that that this is something
that we should  all put up with/enjoy to encourage diversity.

Perhaps it's time to revive that "racist" "thang" called decent people and
their sensibilities.
