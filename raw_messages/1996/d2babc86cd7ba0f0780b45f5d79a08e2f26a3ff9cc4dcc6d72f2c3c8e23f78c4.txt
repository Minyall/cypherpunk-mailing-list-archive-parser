	It doesn't take much.  The hard part is configuring a system
	for the user. 

	Plug and Play Crypto applications are required.
	
	Now if the CD-Rom had all the crypto applications, with
	examples of how to configure various things, you are a step
	closer towards the plug & play requirement.

	Depends on your search engine.

	Trial run -- press, say 20 CD-Roms.  Have people
	use them on various platforms, and provide the examples,
	etc, to make it plug and play for the rest of the world.
	
	Then press them in batches of 100,  or 500 to sell 
	/distribute to users.  Market it on a web page, and
	accept the various forms of digital currency, credit
	cards, etc.  

> Hmm, do I hear a volunteer for writing that Crypto Software Web page?  ;)

	Just for the links to each of the crypto software archives?

	It would need somebody playing with alta-vista, etc for
	a while --- or somebody sending URL, and a brief site
	description, to maintain such a page.  

	I started to do something like that a long time ago, but
	got involved in some other projects.  << The relics of
