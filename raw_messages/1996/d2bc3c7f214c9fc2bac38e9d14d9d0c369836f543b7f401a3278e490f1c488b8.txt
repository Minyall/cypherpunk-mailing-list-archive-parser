I've received the following e-mail from an anonymous coward. It didn't
have any carriage returns (I added them).

One of the meanings of "punk" is "young homosexual". There are a lot of them
on the "cypherpunks" mailing list, trying to be social and to make friends.

They think that the "cypher" part is "kewl" and even rant about it, without
understanding the meanings of the technical terms they use (like the
recurrent rant about brute-force attacks on one-time pads). But they don't
know much about cryptography, so when someone, e.g., tries to talk about
elliptic curves, the "punk" crowd screams that it's "off-topic".

Today is Thanksgiving, so I hope you choke on your turkey (or whatever else
ends up in your mouth :-). I'm thankful that I wasn't born in this country,
because Americans are so stupid.
