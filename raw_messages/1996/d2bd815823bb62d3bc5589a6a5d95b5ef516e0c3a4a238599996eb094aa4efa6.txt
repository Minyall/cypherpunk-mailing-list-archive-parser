Sure about that?  The regulation said something like "launch vehicle" or 
"launch," apparently indicating that a "launch vehicle" could actually be 
exported, THEN launched, etc, without violating ITAR.  And since the 
regulation does not go into any detail about the "launch", other than it is 
a "launch" (and does not explicitly prohibit landing subsequent to launch) 
the implication is that there is no prohibition.

I still think the regulation was just written sloppily.
