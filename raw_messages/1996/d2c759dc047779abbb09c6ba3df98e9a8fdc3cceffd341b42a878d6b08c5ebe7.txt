is this kind of crap really necessary? Are you that bored? If you have a 
problem, go to his house and beat him up. As for you Tim C. May, call 
your friends and wait in the bushes for this asshole to show up at your 
house. Maybe the rest of them will get the hint that this waste of time 
is deeply unappreciated.
