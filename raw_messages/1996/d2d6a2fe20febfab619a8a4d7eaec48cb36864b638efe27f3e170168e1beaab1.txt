	Interesting theory.   Maybe even factual.  I don't know.

	Caveat:  After decades of secrecy, the NSA has come out
	of the cold so to speak.  Are we to safely assume that
	the NSA has not had it's major mission changed in a few
	major ways when it came into the open?  

	Suppose the NSA was simply being used as a cutout
	for its replacement, which is even more sub rosa?
