The states are prohibited through the 14th Amendment via the
Slaughterhouse cases, the ability of the executive branch to
violate due process is questionable (from a legal viewpoint, not
a practical one...the President cannot order you placed in jail
unless you have broken a law which requires congress to have
made the law in the first place...)
