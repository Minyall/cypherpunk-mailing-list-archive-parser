See:

http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/beuwolf/beuwolf.html

I had a bit of difficulty connecting with the URL, finally discovering that
it's "beowulf", not "beuwolf". So try:

http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/beowulf/beowulf.html

Also, re pipe bombs, attempting to access the URL
http://sdcc13.ucsd.edu/~m1lopez/pipe.html
yields (as of Tue, Aug 13, 1996(13:31 MDT))
The requested URL /~m1lopez/pipe.html was not found on this server.
