Precisely my sentiment. And as I said in my main response to Omegaman's
points, all Ed the Extortionist has to do is cash in his digibux at the
bank; at worst this involves a trip to the physical site of the bank.

(Yes, he may be photographed by the bank, etc., but the payments are
untraceable, meaning, unlinkable. All the bank knows is that Ed is
redeeming $100,000 worth of digibux, and taking his payment in dollars, or
gold, or whatever. I grant you that having only fully untraceable digital
cash issuer is far from ideal, for various reasons. But I was addressing
the point Omegaman made that having only one such bank would mean it would
or could be driven out of business by other banks...I disagree.)
