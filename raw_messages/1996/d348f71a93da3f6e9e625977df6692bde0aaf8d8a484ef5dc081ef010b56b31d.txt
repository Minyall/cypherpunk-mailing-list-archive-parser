Hi to all!

	i'd like to meet or know people, who read this list and are from Czech
republic. Some kind of cooperation is possible. Conversation even in
Czech (but i prefer English) . Could you send me an e-mail? Maybe we
live several km far from each other and we aren't able to comunicate. 
	i also apologize to all, who are from different state and must read
this letter. Sorry!
		
		Thanks
			ZERO
