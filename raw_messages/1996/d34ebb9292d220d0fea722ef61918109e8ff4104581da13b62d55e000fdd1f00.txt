	Theres a windows version, mac is under vauge development.  SSH
is pretty cool, but the code base is somewhat messy, and its shows
signs of its origins in things like systems calls not having their
return values checked.

	Despite all this, I use it, like it, and recomend it for use
in systems not likely to come under attack by professionals.
