Correct but for a different reason. Re-using the pad does render the 
security useless but the other reason is if we know part of the pad 
AND the ciphertext (and hence the plaintext) or part of the plaintext 
and the ciphertext and therefore the pad, We cannot solve the rest of 
the ciphertext as the pad is true random and the next bits are 
independent of all the previous ones so we cannot predict from what 
we have.

A better definition of unbreakable, IMHO, is that there is no way to 
determine the plaintext given unlimited ciphertext and computational 
resources. Sure, this isn`t a complete definition but at least it 
definites perfect security in an analytic sense.
