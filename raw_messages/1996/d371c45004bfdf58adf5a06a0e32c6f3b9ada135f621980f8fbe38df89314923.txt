Thanks to Raph for his excellent write-up on the IMC workshop "Resolving 
e-mail Security".

Thanks to IMC for sponsoring it and having an agenda, etc.

Thanks to the companies supporting IMC with corporate memberships, too.
hint, hint.

I am also concerned (as many on this list must be) about the 40 bits
and public perception.  If everyone thinks that Damien and the combined 
computing power of France is needed for two weeks to break it, then there 
is more teaching to be done, certainly.

Speaking of teaching, writing up one's notes after a meeting or 
conference and posting them to the list is an excellent benefit to those 
of us that didn't get to go.

ObSecureMail: I got the beta Pronto secure mail, but haven't had tome to 
fool with it yet, then I got a mesage about a bad key or something. 
What's up with that?
