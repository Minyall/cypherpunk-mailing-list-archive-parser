SSH, while a quite useful tool, is not the right long-term solution for
transport layer security - IP security is.

It's also clear to me that for E-mail, you don't want transport level
security for the system; you want "object" security, that is, digital
signature and encryption of the mail message. That way, no matter how many
MTAs the message passes through (and pretty much regardless of how
trustworthy they are) you have end-to-end authentication, integrity and
privacy.
