Policies are statements like:

"code endorsed by any one of the following signatures (say three of 
my friends) can access the public part of my file system"

This is hard. It's probably not going to make it in the first release.
The simple first pass is to say "code signed by x, y, and z" can do 
whatever it wants.

The alias had some trouble over the week-end. It should be working
fine now.
