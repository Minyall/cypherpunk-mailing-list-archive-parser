	I would suggest making an exception for material that the country in
question _doesn't_ want available... you don't want to do their work for them.
Of course, if that it's from a .gov-type site in that country (kind of hard to
tell without the domain, but...), that's another story.

	This brings up the related topic of filtering mail lists the other
way around. There have been times that I've wanted to email everyone on a
mailing list _except_ one or two people. It's massively inconvenient to try to
do this without automated software, for a large mailing list. Therefore, I'd
be interested in majordomo/listserv/whatever modifications that would enable
doing so. Of course, for anything significant having seperately encrypted
messages to each person (as per that thread a bit back on encrypted mailing
lists) would be necessary.
