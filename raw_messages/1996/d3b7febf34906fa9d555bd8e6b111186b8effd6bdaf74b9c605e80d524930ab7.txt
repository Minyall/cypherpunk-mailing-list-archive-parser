But the fact that Java windows are obvious doesn't seem to really speak 
to the question of can they be faked from *outside* Java.

In fact, very distinctive windows for Java are likely to increase the 
success of an attack which duplicates the window decorations perfectly, 
because people will be used to it.

Eternal vigilance, etc.
