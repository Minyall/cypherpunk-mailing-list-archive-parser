	The essential problem with this viewpoint is that the right the
receiver has is to ignore the message. If he doesn't want to receive
anonymous messages, he should set up a mail filtration program that will
do a good enough job of filtering them out. Spammed messages can be countered
with Internet charging (neccessary anyway for the long-term health of the Net),
as can mailbombing. That leaves individual messages that may be offensive
(including, apparantly in his case, offensive by virtue of being anonymous),
but if offensiveness meant someone should have the right to stop the emission
of speech, that would mean the Christian Coalition would have the right to stop
speech on evolution, the PC types would have the right to stop speech on
genetic differences in intelligence (see Stephen Jay Gould for them on this
issue - even leaving aside racial questions which are separate from the
individual ones), etcetera.
