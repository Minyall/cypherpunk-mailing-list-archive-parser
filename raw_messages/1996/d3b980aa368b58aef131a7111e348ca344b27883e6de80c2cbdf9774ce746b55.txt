How do corporations work, in terms of liability?  If the cost of 
incorporating isn't forbidding, I would think a remailer operator might 
consider incorporating a company, and making the remailer a function of 
that company.  That way, any losses are restricted to the total value of 
the corporation; that is, nothing.  Any flaws?  There must be something 
wrong with it somewhere.

Thanks.
