Suppose Alice generates an unsigned coin, blinds it, and shows Bob the
usigned, blinded coin.

Bob then has the bank sign it, and gives the signature to Alice.  

If we use RSA to sign the coin, Alice now knows she has a valid 
coin, because she can verify the coin herself without needing to
show it to the bank.  So Bob has paid Alice some money, and 
nobody can double spend the coin, because Alice, and only Alice, 
knows the blinding factor.

So Alice does *not* need to check with the bank.

Alice cannot do this with your protocol, so we cannot have payee 
anonymity with your protocol.
