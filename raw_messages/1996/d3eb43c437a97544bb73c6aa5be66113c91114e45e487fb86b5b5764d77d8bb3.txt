After following the information on the cda96-l mailing list I have a new
one for you, "The CDA means lost jobs and dead teenagers".

The lost jobs result from content providers going overseas and the dead
teenagers result from the loss of anonymously accessible information about
homosexuality (suicides) and AIDS prevention (AIDS).

OBcrypto - Strong anonymity can save lives.
