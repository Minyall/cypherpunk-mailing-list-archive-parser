I disagree.  While each of us may arguably have a number of enemies, if our 
lists were compared I think most of those enemies can be located in a 
relatively tiny group of people, most of whom exercise government authority. 
 Eliminate them, and a relatively small number of criminals, and it'll be a 
rather safe and pleasant society.

I think that the _need_ will drop long before the supply of potential 
assassins will.  Resignations will occur, and criminals will straighten up quickly.
