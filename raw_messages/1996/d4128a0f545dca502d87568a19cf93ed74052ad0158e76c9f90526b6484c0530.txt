	This seems not to be true.  The design of the S boxes seems to
be to foil differential cryptanalysis, where pairs of similar texts
are encrypted to find information about the key.

	I wouldn't be suprised; major intelligence agencies are likely
to have DES cracking custom hardware.

See Schneier's Applied Cryptography, 2nd ed.

	I'd use IDEA or 3DES.  Again, see Schneier.
