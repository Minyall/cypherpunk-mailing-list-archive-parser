And quoting the entire article by "Logos" without even saying what it is
this mysterious Bill Palmer believes in yet another reason the list is
filling up with junk. If the message was to "LOGOS," his c2 address would
get it to him. If the message was to the rest of us, why so cryptic about
Bill Palmer? In any case, the Logos articles needed to be trimmed out.

I'm not picking on Igor...I just wish people would learn to summarize and
excerpt, and not just forward on entire quoted articles. "Your text editor
is your friend."

Someone once pointed out to me that quoting _at most_ a half screenful of
stuff is best: quoting a screenful or more before comments begin is almost
a guarantee that many people will hit the "delete" key. I try to follow
this rule of thumb, and limit my quotes accordingly.


Just say "No" to "Big Brother Inside"
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't allowed.
