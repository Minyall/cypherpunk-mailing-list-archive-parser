I thought I would take the time to let everyone know that this is 
baseless as well.  Most jurisdictions forbid third parties to reveal 
prosecution inquries to the principal for which they are holding 
documents or other information.  A VERY few have laws on the books that 
require this disclosure.  Switzerland is no longer one of them.

Even if a judge was convinced by the defense not to levy heavy fines 
against a third party who pleaded that he or she was simply unable to 
comply, informing the principal would literally assure such fines would 
be imposed regardless.  Criminal charges of obstruction could easily 
attach.  Obstruction in connection with narcotics cases or other major 
felonies are generally extraditable offenses as well.

Once again Mr. Bell pulls legal analysis out of his rectum rather than 
basing it in fact or research.

With Mr. Bell as a defense attorney, who needs prosecutors?
