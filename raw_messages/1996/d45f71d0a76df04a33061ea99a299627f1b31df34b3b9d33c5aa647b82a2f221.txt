Does anyone know what the equivalent technology is on Microsoft to
Netscape's cookie technology?  Does Microsoft have support for cookies or 
not?  

All of the discussion on the list to do with
cookies is related to Netscape.  Does this mean that if one switches to
Microsoft Explorer one can avoid the problem?  Many thanks.
