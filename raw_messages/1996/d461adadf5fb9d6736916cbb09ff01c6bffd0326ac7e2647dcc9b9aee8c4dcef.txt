	While in general I agree, he never said it was a company. If it was
a government, for instance, I can see it as being ethical; the same for a
government-caused requirement (like the drug war nonsense) or a
government-supported company (like Airbus in Europe, or others supported by
tarrifs.) Since he didn't say, I forbode to answer (mine would have been
about like uni's one of superglue, although I haven't heard the needle idea
before.
