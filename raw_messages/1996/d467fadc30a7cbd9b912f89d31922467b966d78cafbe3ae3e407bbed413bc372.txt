Here's the procmailrc recipe that I use for cypherpunks: 

:0
* ^(Sender|From): owner-cypherpunks@toad.com
{ 
  :0
  * ? fgrep -q -i -f $HOME/.procmail/killfile.cpunks
  /dev/null

  :0:
  $CRYPTO
}


All you have to do add a new entry to your killfile is to add a new
line to te file ~/.procmail/killfile.cpunks which is real easy.
