     A heart attack is (or used to be) a normal way of dying.

     Dying is natural. It is even (in some cases, and from certain 
perspectives) desirable. 

     So are dreamers, so are doers. Poets, Priests and Garbage collectors.
The problem is that in this society parents don't want (largely, painting 
with a BIG BIG brush and painting over some people) dreamers or garbage 
collectors, poets or artists. They want CPA's and Programmers, attentive
little students, of course the kids nature has nothing to do with it.

     Remember a year or so an add for Joop Jeans? A "Yuppie" looking woman
with a baby on a leash (like a dog collar and leash) with the words
"A child, the ultimate pet". That seems to be the position that many parents 
seem to be taking these days. They don't have kids, they have prize 
pedegree Children. These children are expected to behave without training, to
follow rules without being disiplined (funny how that word keeps popping up
in these posts) and to perform in the 90th percentile in everything. 
 
      On the other end we have growing pool of warm bodies whose parents are 
just barely warm bodies. They aren't taking prozac and ritilan to get thru
school, with them it is coke, crack, pot, horse and alcohol. Their parents 
are barely even aware of their existance. 

     IMO both of these are from the same mentality, the attitude of a child 
as a cute little pet.

     What causes this hypertension? Maybe rather than medicating you  
should eliminate the CAUSE of the problem.

     Of course that is more work than just taking a pill.

     Actually, I would.

     I would worry more about a kid who _wants_ speed than one who doesn't. 

     Correct me if I am wrong, but aren't children more sensative to 
chemicals than adults?

     No, the responces indicated that it turned you into a person happy 
to focus on and perform repitive tasks hour after hour. Machine-like 
trance instead of Zombie. Great.
