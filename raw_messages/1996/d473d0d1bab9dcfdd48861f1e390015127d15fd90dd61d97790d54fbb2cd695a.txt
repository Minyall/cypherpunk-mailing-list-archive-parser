Are you saying I've picked on everyone?  I didn't claim to be neurosis-
free, but at least I recognize neurosis and deal with it reasonably well.
If you think any specific point I've made connotes neurosis rather than
an attempt to help someone out or correct a serious fallacy, then feel
free to point it out, and please be specific.  It's not fair to blame
someone who is an active and somewhat feisty thinker for your own
inferiority complex.

Profanity?  I doubt I've been as profane as most of the long-term
subscribers (leaders?) on the list.  Maybe you should check those
posts more carefully.

I/we should seek respect from "news organizations" and/or "the Congress"??

You must have ate something really bad before you had that dream.
