	What is your last comment supposed to mean exactly? Just because
some Islamic militants decide to kill a few people in a terrorist attack
does not mean that the entire believer population of Islam does not have
respect for life. Just who is "we"? Americans? Europeans? All
industrialized nations? Every country except those Third World ones? Uh...
I don't see your point very clearly here... The only culture I can think
of that might now have respect for life are cannibals, and they DO have
respect for life in a way, they don't kill each other (I don't think), and
they do it because it's their lifestyle, but they don't perform
cannibalistic acts out of malice. Correct me here if I'm wrong.
