I'd like to join you on this.  I have sent email to 
wallace@asswipespamnet already as well as left them voice mail for every 
message they sent, they will be charged $500 per message and the next one 
I receive constitutes acceptance.  I've since then recieved about 4-5 
more, which means they owe me $2000 or thereabouts. :)

So what steps do we need in putting some teeth into this?
