Sure *does* matter.  There's no computationally feasible way to
associate one mixmaster message with another.  The only way you can
get a clue is by analyzing who sends mail into and out of the
mixmaster system.  If both of your endpoints are within the mixmaster
system, you have no entering or exiting mail to analyze.  It doesn't
matter if the mixmaster remailers are on the same or different systems.
