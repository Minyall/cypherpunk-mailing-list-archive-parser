An interesting theory, which my experience supports.

I started with model rocketry, and then discovered that it was more fun to blow the rockets up, rather than have them come back to earth. (You don't have to sweat the construction details as much, either)
About the time I turned 21, I lost interest in making exploding rockets and blowing craters in sand dumes.
