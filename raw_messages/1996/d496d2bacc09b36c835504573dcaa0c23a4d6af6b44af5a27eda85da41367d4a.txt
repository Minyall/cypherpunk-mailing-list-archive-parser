  Until now, I'd considered the list as a model of a libertarian
society, with the listowner as the government.  My point is that
if a mailing list (where physical force is generally not a
factor) can't be run without arbitrary sanctions against
members, how could anyone ever hope for a whole society, with a
real, gun-toting government, to run that way?
