I had the same problems when I was working at Xerox in Webster, NY. 
Supermarkets just plain didn't want to accept my passport as valid ID.

More recently, I attended an IEEE conference at MITRE in Virginia. To 
enter the building, they required you to fill out a form listing your 
SSN. The forms were taped to the guard's desk, in full view of anyone who 
was curious.

I was horrified and gave a random number.

A friend who was with me (who in fact is on cypherpunks) dutifully gave
her correct SSN. Oh, and they wanted photo ID. I offered press
credentials. Unfortunately for the lackey, it didn't have any sort of
serial or ID number on it he could record.
