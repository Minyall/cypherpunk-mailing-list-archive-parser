I think there is an even stronger point to be made.  We can be
relatively sure that VISA is not going to go out of business any time
soon.  On the other hand, if an E-mail intercepting virus lost FV tons
of money, FV might conceivably go belly up sticking their customers
with the bill.  With FV, there might indeed be a risk to the user.
