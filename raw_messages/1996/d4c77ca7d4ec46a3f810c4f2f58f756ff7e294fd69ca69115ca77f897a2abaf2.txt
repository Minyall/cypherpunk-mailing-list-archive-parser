It sounds unfair, for sure. However, the whole thing is a fraud based 
upon a myth. FICA witholding is NOT credited to an individual's account, 
or even to Social Security benefits in general. By statutory law, all 
such receipts go into the Treasury's general fund.

So, they are NOT "social security contributions". Period.
