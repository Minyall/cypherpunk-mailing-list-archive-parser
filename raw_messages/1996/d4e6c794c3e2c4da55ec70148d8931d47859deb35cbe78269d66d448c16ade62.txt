Re: The final version of the NRC crypto report is now available!
  The Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB) of the National
  Research Council (NRC) is pleased to announce the availability of its
  cryptography policy study "Cryptography's Role in Securing the
  Information Society".  This report was originally released in
  pre-publication form on May 30, 1996.

  The final printed version of this report can be obtained from the
  National Academy Press, 1-800-624-6242 or Web site
  http://www.nap.edu/bookstore.  The pre-publication version and the final
  printed copy differ in that the printed copy contains an index and many
  source documents relevant to the crypto policy debate; of course,
  editorial corrections have been made as well.

  An unoffical ASCII version of the prepublication report can be found at
  http://pwp.usa.pipeline.com/~jya/nrcindex.htm; the official NRC version
  should become available online in ASCII form in December.

  In addition, CSTB has been conducting briefings on this report at various
  sites
  around the country; if you would like to arrange a briefing in your area,
  please let us know (cstb@nas.edu, 202-334-2605).
