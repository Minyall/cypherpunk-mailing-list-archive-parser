Yahoo has a Reuter's story covering a policy statement from the American
Academy of Pediatrics.  They're concerned about record content 
description labels; they don't think their "strong" enough.

	If the industry does not develop a stronger voluntary
	system, it said, Congress should impose one.

(I wonder if they really said that Congress should impose a 
stronger voluntary system?)

I wonder when people will realize that the threat of Congress imposing
a ratings system seems functionally equivalent to Congress imposing a
ratings system?
