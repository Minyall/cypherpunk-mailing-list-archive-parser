To be fair, I don't see any blathering, just "expressions of concern." The
blathering quote comes from the SPLC, not Clinton.

Clinton, though, is pushing the unconstitutional "anti-terrorism"  bill,
which is all blather, and worse, he's letting the Republicans add an
unrelated rider that emasculates habeus corpus.
