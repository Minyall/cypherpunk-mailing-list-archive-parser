My bullshit detector is starting to pin the needle.

US Customs doesn't care about your political status or leanings. 
They want to collect the proper excise and catch contraband.

There are INS people at passport control.   I am skeptical that they 
would detain a US passport holder for 36 hours. I would like to see some 
evidence that this actually happened.

US citizens can't be excluded from the country, nor have their 
citizenship taken away from them.
