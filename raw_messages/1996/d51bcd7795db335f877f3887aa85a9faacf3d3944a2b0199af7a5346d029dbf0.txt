Thanks to Ed Roback, John Young, and "DN", the NIST draft report is

I will work on making it prettier this evening, but I figured that people
want to get it as soon as possible. Also, as of a couple of hours ago, the 
paper copy of this was _not_ available at the OMB publications
office (the address in Ms. Frye's posting.) I recommend not trying to call
them, as after you spend time working through their flooded inbasket, you
still won't get it.

So, if you want hard copy, print my file :-)
