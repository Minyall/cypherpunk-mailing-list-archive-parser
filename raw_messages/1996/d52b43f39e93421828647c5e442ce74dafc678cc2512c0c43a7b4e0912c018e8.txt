I thought the statement that remailers are supposed to be ephemeral and
common was the answer.  If one is shut down, a dozen spring up in its
place.  Advertising new remailers does become an issue.  What mechanisms
are in place for new remailers to advertise themselves?

I find it interesting that this remailer is being shut down by private
action and not by government.  (Yes, they are threatening government
action, but if they couldn't do that they would find some other threat.)
