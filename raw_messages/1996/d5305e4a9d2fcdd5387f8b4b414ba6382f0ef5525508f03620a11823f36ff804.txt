COMPUTER THEFT, LOW-TECH STYLE

A thief broke into a Visa International data processing center
in California a couple of weeks ago and stole a personal computer
containing information on about 314,000 credit card accounts,
including Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover and Diners
Club, says a Visa spokesman.

Some issuers, including Citibank, began calling customers last
week and have issued new cards.  Others are keeping quiet about
the event and monitoring accounts for unusual activity.

Authorities speculate that the perpetrator was stolen for the
resale value of the hardware, rather than the information it
contained.
