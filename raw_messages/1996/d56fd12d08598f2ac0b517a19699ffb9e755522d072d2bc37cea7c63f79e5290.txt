I have read and reread the documentation that is included with the PGP 
distribution (although my copy is over a year old now), and am still 
trying to work out if commercial use of 2.6ui is allowed outside the USA.

Could someone elaborate for me, or perhaps point me to some up to date 
reference documentation.

TIA - Dave.
