Yikes,

Tell me that conspiracy to break ITAR isn't grounds for becoming
arms trafficker #1

I don't even have the latest version of the shortened Perl-RSA 
code back from the screenprinters.
 
Coming Soon! New fashionable Perl-RSA shirts!

You are now an International Arms Trafficker
 
 Thanks for the munitions package.
 
 You are trafficker number: 1
