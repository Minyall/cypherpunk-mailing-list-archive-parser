You know, it'd be interesting to start loudly reporting such obvious
ITAR violations.  Not, of course, because I feel myself threatened as
a result of this attack on national security, but because it might
make life more difficult for Them.  When They decide to hassle some
well-chosen target (a la PZ) over such stuff, it'd make for
interesting filler if reporters could add to stories paragraphs like
"...dozens of ITAR violations have been reported in recent months, but
until now officials have taken no action, leading many to believe that
Bob Cypherdude is being singled out for harrassment."
