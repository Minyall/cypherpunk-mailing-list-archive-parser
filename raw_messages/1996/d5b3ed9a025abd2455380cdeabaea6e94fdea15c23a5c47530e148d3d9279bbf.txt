Pardon my lack of faith in most crypto implementations, but do you
think it is possible that (in the first version of Notes at least) the
escrowed 24-bits will just be stored plaintext in the executable?  In
which case, a little disassembly, and we can create a hack to enable
all 64-bits.  (Of course, communications from this hacked version will
only be readable by other hacked versions or US versions.)

Anyone else think is probable?
