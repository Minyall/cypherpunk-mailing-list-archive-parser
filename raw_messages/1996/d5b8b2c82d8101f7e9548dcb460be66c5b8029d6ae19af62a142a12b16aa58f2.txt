Subject: What about making re-mailers automatically chain?

Would it be a good idea to have a re-mailer "randomly" decide whether to
send the mail to the destination or to another re-mailer.  If all
re-mailers performed this way, not even the sender would know the path.
The chain could be short sometimes and long others.  Granted, there is a
possibility that every mailer decides to chain instead of sending the
message to the recip, but some clever counter tag could keep the number of
links to a certain maximum.  The "randomness" of this would aid in traffic
analysis, and of course each mailer that decides to chain the mail would
encrypt under the next mailer's pub key.  Any thoughts?
