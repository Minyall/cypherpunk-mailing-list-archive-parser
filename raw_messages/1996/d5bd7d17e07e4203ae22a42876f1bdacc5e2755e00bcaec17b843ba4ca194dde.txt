Here's the actual blurb (from <http://www.radio.cbc.ca> ) from the 11 am EST
report (and it wasn't rebroadcast or elaborated on at 12).
   
   A former employee of the american national security agency has been
   arrested on charges that he spied for the kgb in the 1960's. The f-b-i
   arrested the man at his home in pennsylvania this morning. Police say
   the arrest is important but dosn't compare in magintude to the aldrich
   ames case..,,the biggest spy scandal in u-s history.
