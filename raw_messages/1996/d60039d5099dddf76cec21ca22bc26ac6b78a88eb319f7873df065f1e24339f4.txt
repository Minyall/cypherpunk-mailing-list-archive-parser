	Having style anonymizers that didn't create spelling problems, but just
filtered them out would be a solution to the latter. The former problem can be
taken care of by having many different styles that can be used. For instance,
it might notice that your sentence length variation wasn't enough for a given
style of writing, and prompt you to write some shorter (and/or longer)
sentences - including via breaking up the ones you've written already. One
would use a different style setting for each nym.
