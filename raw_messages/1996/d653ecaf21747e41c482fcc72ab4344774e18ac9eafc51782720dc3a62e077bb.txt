| Snow Crash is hardly scary. You have characterized it as a

	The CIA privatized & selling data to all comers?  An
unstoppable wave of illegal immigration coming to California?  Sounds
pretty scary to many people.  There are other readings, but that one
is there.

	I said as much.  I'm not purporting this as my opinions, just
my understanding of Dr. Denning.
