One problem with using such systems in the US (I have no idea about traffic
laws in Ontario so maybe this was the loophole you mentioned) is that even
with a perfect shot of the license plate the system only identifies a car,
not a driver.  Speeding tickets are given to drivers, not necessarily to
the owner of the speeding car.  Here in the states the easy challenge to
such a ticket would be "it was not me driving when that photo was taken" and
the burden of proof is on the prosecution to prove that you were the driver.
Since some states do not require front license plates the cameras take shots
of the tail end of the car, not the best angle for identifying drivers.
