As I said in another message, and as others have commented, the specifics
of Libya are not the point. The point I was making--and I cited other
countries besides Libya--remains that any U.S. policy regarding sales to
other countries, with U.S. policies built in, must comprehend the reality
that these government will use policy tokens to their advantage, and that
many uses may not appeal to us.

The "rogue government" problem is discussed in crypto circles...one of my
main points is that the U.S. Administration has consistently failed to
address questions along these lines.
