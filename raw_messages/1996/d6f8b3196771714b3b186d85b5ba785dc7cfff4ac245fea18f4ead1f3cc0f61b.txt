I was thinking about how Mixmaster needs a separate message format so it
can make messages a fixed size and add a packet ID.  However, couldn't all
this be done with PGP?  With PGP, the length of the file being encrypted is
encrypted itself, so it would be possible to append random data to the end
of the file to make the message a fixed length like Mixmaster.  Also, the
packet-ID could be implemented by putting a line such as the following in the
message:

::
Packet-ID: foobar

The only other thing that would have to be taken care of is chaining.  The
way I could see this working is to have a header in the encrypted message that
tells the remailer whether it should de-armor the message at the next layer,
append random data, then re-armor, and pass it to the next remailer.  Am I
missing something?
