I've had a substantially better idea.  Hang carbon-fiber bundles from the 
ceiling, which are charged to about 10,000 volts when an intrusion is 
detected.  They'll glom onto anything conductive within their range, and 
anyone with the bad fortune to be breaking into the house at that moment 
_might_ live to regret it.  (resistors could be added to limit the current 
to non-fatal but exceedingly painful levels.
