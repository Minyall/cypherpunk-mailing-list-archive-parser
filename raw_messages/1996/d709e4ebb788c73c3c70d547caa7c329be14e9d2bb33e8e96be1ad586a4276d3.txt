I have to point out that there is no "relative victory".  We have neither
won in whole nor in part.

If he even figures that out... he's probably doing it because some advisor
said it wouldn't make a difference to crypto, and that advisor would
basicly be right.

Not _letting_ you?  Exactly which one is the government saying you _CAN'T_
use?  I've seen you can't export, you can't use in government work, etc...
but never once have I seen a law be _passed_ that said you couldn't use
any form of crypto (and I'd like to keep it that way)

They seem to have learned the habit of cowering before authority even when
not actually threatened.  How very nice for authority.  I decided not to
learn this particular lesson.
