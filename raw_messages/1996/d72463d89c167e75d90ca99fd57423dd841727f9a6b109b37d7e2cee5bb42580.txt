Really?  But you wrote:

Oh, I see, "tell," "should" and "assert" REALLY mean compel.  And
what, exactly, would I, the "teller" be compelling them to do?  I 
now understand how you are able to win so many debates.  I guess
I'd just better give up and take THE PLEDGE, you're just too sly
for me.

Sorry Perry, you were right.

P.S.	For those of you who choose to suffer Sternlight,
	I leave you with this little quote from Lewis Caroll.
	You might find it useful to cite when jousting with
	our sophistic friend:

		   "When /I/ use a word," Humpty Dumpty
		said, in rather a scornful tone, "it
		means just what I choose it to mean--
		neither more nor less."
		   "The question is," said Alice, 
		whether you /can/ make words mean so
		many different things."
		   "The question is," said Humpty Dumpty,
		"which is to be master--that's all."

And now back to David Sternlight for what he really wants, the
Last Word.  :-)
