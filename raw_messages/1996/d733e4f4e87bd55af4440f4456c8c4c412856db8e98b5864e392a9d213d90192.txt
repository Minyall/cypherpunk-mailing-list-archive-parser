Unsophisticated, lacking in real substantative sources for material (scope
is again mentioned, and I find them often dangerously inaccurate, a resort
to the paladin press for reference information is equally suspect in my
view), and while containing some interesting ideas and general outlines,
mostly dangerous to those who do not understand that a little knowledge is
a dangerous thing.
