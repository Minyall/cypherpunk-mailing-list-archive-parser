AFAIK, Netscape does not use sendmail directly to send mail, but instead
contacts a user specified SMTP server and the e-mail is sent from there.
If you set the SMTP server to a fake value, or just delete the field,
the Javascript program will not work.  Of course, you won't be able to
use Netscape mail capabilities either.
