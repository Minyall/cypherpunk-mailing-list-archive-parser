Rough English translations of issues 153 and 154 of _Radikal_, a German
newspaper from-and for-the radikal/autonomous left, are now available at:

http://www.meaning.com/library/radikal/

The newspaper has been banned by the German government.
I have no connection with the organization and had never heard of them
prior to the German government's attempted blocking of xs4all.nl.
