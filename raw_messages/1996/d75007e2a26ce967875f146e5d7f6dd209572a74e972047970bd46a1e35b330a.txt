It won't make a difference either way: if he company does care, it takes
all of 10 seconds to prove that the message could have been fakemailed

As to whether or not they'd have grounds, no, they wouldn't, assuming you
didn't actually edit the quote, and assuming you didn' (and you didn't)
acually acuse them of anything.  You merely quesioned if they were
correct, and if so, how so... which is perfectly inocent.
