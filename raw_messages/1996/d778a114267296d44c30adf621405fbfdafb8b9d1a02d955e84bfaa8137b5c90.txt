	I have written an encryption program called Very Good Privacy for Windows
95/NT. It supports drag-and-drop encryption using the following algorithms:
ASCII (Caesar), BlowFish, DES, IDEA, NewDES, RC4, Safer SK-128, and
Vigenere. After the files are encrypted, the user has the option of
securely deleting the source files using a stream of random text. Very Good
Privacy is shareware with a $5-$10 registration fee. Please note: Pretty
Good Privacy is only "pretty good" but Very Good Privacy is "very good."
