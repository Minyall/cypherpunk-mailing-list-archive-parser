Damn!!

	A corrupted reply block! Anyway, the middleman remailer seems to
be functional again. Give it a try and see if it works for you.

	The middleman remailer will respond to both
middle-man@alpha.c2.org and middle-man@nym.jpunix.com. I will eventually
drop one of the nyms in favor of the more robust nym server. I've tested
it and it works for me. Please let me know if you have problems.
