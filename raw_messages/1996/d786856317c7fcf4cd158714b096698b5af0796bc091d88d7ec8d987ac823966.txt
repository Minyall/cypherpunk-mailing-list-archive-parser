No, it is the truth. The fact is that DT has gone and intentionally broken
*all* routes to webcom.com -- the SJ Merc said 129,000. 

But the point is moot. Try:

http://www-leland.stanford.edu/~llurch/Not_By_Me_Not_My_Views/zundel/pr.004.compuser.html
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/declan/www/Not_By_Me_Not_My_Views/pr.004.compuser.html

Is DT going to block every machine in stanford.edu, cmu.edu, mit.edu, 
uiuc.edu, harvard.edu, berkeley.edu, and so on?

Or from any machine with access to AFS, which includes thousands of 
academic and a few corporate machines in Germany, the following file 
system paths will work. With a simple symbolic link, any machine with AFS 
can become a mirror site.

/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/declan/www/Not_By_Me_Not_My_Views/pr.004.compuser.html
/afs/ir.stanford.edu/users/l/llurch/WWW/Not_By_Me_Not_My_Views/pr.004.compuser.html

Is DT going to block TCP port 80 and UDP ports 7000-7029 from every
machine in the world?
