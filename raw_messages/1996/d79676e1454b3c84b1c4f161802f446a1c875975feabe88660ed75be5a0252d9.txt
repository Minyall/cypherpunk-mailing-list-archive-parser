I don't see how you can have the SS number be both a public ID number and a
secret password.  Perhaps you could have it be one, but not both.  It seems
to me that parts of our society are trying have it be a password and parts
a public ID number.  (Perhaps the same parts?)  Doing both just won't work.

(Using SS as a password is subject to all the stealing and replay attacks
that make passwords a really bad idea for secure identification.)
