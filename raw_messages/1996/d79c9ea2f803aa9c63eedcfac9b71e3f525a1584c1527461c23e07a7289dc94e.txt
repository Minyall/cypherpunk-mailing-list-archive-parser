i'm not sure about any specific laws, but i know the airlines take *any*
talk of explosives VERY seriously...

a few years back, while i was in high school, i was on an airplane with
about 15 other students, returning from an excursion...
one of the other students said something to the effect of, "oh sure...yea,
my cd player is really just a clever bomb in disguise.."
one of the flight attendants overheard him say this, (to another student)
and he was promptly taken to the front of the plane and restrained...they
actually took his cd player apart to make sure there were no explosives in
it...the only thing that stopped them from pressing criminal charges was
the fact that all of the adult sponsor on the trip vouched for him and
pleaded with the flight crew that he was just kidding...

he got off with a SEVERE talking to and a cd player in less-than perfect
condition...
