At a W3C security meeting we were discussing encryption algs to use, not 
suprisingly RC4 came up, Ron suggested that we also include `aledged-rc4'.
Maybe we need aledged-rc2 as well :-)

Then again I thing we might end up with "alledged HTTP" and similar products 
from a number of vendors if we went too far down that route.
