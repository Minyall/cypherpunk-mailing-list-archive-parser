Dale is wrong.  All access to Cypherpunks is via toad.com which 
sits in John Gilmore's home.  (The basement office to be exact.)

And here John has chosen to limit said forum.  It is irrelevant
how many subscribers perceive the list as public.  It is private.
Their misperception is in no way binding on John.

a) "Against stupidity, the gods themselve, contend in vain."
   Some folks just don't have a clue.  Just because they don't
   understand the nature of John's contribution, does not stop
   them from yammering.

b) There are those who do understand the private nature of the
   list, but think that John has made a mistake.  They may
   certainly try to convince him of the error of his ways without
   assuming the list is public.

Since it is correct and unasailable, I believe I will.

Yes.  That's the way it is now, and I think it works very well.
