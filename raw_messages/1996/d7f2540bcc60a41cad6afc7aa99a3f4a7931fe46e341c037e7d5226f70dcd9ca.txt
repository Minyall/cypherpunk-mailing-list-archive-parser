No, folks, Tim doesn't generalize.

Name one "black leader" who has endorsed anything like the straw man 
you're talking about. What we have here are a couple of kooks in charge 
of a politicized school board in Oakland. The word "ebonics" appears 
exactly zero times in Stanford's library catalog and exactly zero times 
in the indices of peer-reviewed academic journals to which I have 
access, including some very "PC" ones. DejaNews had exactly one instance 
of the word "ebonics" before this September, when someone in Oakland 
started making a fuss. The recommendations of the Oakland school board, 
which bear no resemblance to the nonsense spouted here, are no more 
representative of even the most politicized elements of black studies 
departments than certain Bible Belt public schools are of "white 
leaders."
