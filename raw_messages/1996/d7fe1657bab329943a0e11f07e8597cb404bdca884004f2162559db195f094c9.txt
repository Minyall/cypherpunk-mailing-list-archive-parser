Right now, the only solution I know of is to use cookies for browsers that
support them, and do all the MD5-ing yourself. That excludes some browsers,
but you can support those in the totally insecure manner.

   Ken Thompson has an automobile which he helped design.  Unlike most
   automobiles, it has neither speedometer, nor gas gage, nor any of the
   numerous idiot lights which plague the modern driver.  Rather, if the
   driver makes any mistake, a giant "?" lights up in the center of the
   dashboard.  "The experienced driver", he says, "will usually know
   what's wrong."
