That would be 256^N, actually, a somewhat bigger number generally
speaking. I hope your cryptography is better than your combinatorics,
but I (like a lot of others) doubt it.

Why, in your challenge, is your system to be tested by only US citizens?
Why not submit it to the NSA and in 15 days you could get a CJR for
it... then the c'punks in France, Germany and News Zealand could work on
it too, and you will have saved a lot of time.
