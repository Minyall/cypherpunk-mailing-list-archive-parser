I'm trying to persuade the powers-that-be at my employer that we
can use a restricted access, encrypted Web server to distribute 
beta copies of our products (which include encryption) to test sites.
We're mainly interested in avoiding any confrontation with ITAR.
Since we can restrict by IP address, and unlike the MIT PGP site,
will be encrypting the link, I think we're in the clear.

However, to aid me in making the case, I'm looking for other
IP restricted servers to show that this is an accepted practice.
Please drop me a line if you know of any, and I'll summarise
next week.

	thanks,
		Peter
PS:
	Does anyone know of a Domestic strength SSL web browser
which allows you to install trusted roots (Netscape does not meet
these conditions, in any released version).
