A lot of people have asked me this. :-).

Just send me e-mail, and I'll forward it on to my brother, who had them
printed up. He gave the first few away, but the postage on the tube he sent
mine to me in was $3.00, ('course he sent it to me priority mail...), so
he's not going to do that for long if I choke his mailbox...

Anyway, pricing the things so he doesn't lose money's his problem, I
suppose. :-)

Just send me a message saying you want one, and I'll pass it along.


Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
