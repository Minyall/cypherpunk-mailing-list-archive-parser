	Yes. FIrst of all, NEVER run any executable you recieve that is just
attached to an e-mail message like that. Unfortunately, my stupid trackpad
on my laptop slipped and I too ran the file. Your registry has been deleted
and it looks like every file that was not hidden in the Windows directory
(or at least a lot of them) have been renamed and made directories. I
suspect the file information still exists but is messed up. You probably
won't ever be able to get it back. First you need to remove all of the
rogue directories (type dir /w/o/p at c:\windows\ and then rmdir everything
in brackets that looks like it was a file - it'll have a '.' in its name).
You can then reinstall Windows 95. All of your configuration will be lost,
but at least you're up again. I'm posting this to the list if anyone else
has also run this program, but if anyone has any more questions, please
e-mail mrosen@peganet.com.
	Did anyone find out a real e-mail address from this guy. I'd like to
uhhh... cyberbeat him. Oh, and as far as I know, no virus was installed,
though you should check for one just for good measure.
