And IPGs algorithm is not OTP, so what you're saying is irrelevant.

Correction.  If I generate a completely random number, and use it in my
pad, and then generate another random number, and the 2 randoms happen to
be the same, they are still perfectly valid pads; as long as the numbers
were truly random.  Don't get me wrong -- its still stupid to use the same
one twice, and it defies the point, but it is not "not an OTP by
definition".

Stop describing what you write.

This is, as they say, completely irrelevant.
