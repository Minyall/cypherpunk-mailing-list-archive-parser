The Usual Suspects will congregate today at the Tivoli, and may
visit Majordomo's Net Cafe or other sites of interest.  Anyone
who's not hanging out with Steve Jackson, Larry Niven, et al, at
the Lakewood Sheraton is welcome to drop by; send me a note if
you need directions.

N. B. -- The Tivoli was built in 1890 to brew Denver beer, Aspen
beer, Tivoli beer, etc., and is NOT affiliated with IBM!$%#&@! :-)
