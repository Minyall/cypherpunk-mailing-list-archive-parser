I must assume either

1) He is not intimately familiar with the system of U.S. taxation (even if
he is pro-high-tax, calling the current system 'just about right' is
folly).

2) He believes it important to have a confusing and inefficent tax system
for some other reason.

I always tell people who feel tax avoidance is "bad" and that using the
rules to minimize your tax exposure is a bad thing that I can easily
structure their finances such that 90% of their net income goes to the
IRS every year and still not break any rules.
