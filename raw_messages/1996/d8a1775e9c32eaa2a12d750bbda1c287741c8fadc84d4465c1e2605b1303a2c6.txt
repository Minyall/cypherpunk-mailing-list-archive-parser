I haven't heard of anyone ever being indicted for exporting cryptography.  I
should have made it clear that I was refering to ITAR as it applies to crypto,
and not other items that would fall under ITAR.

Quite true.  I was just refering to someone actually being tried and found
guilty of violating ITAR by exporting cryptography.  I'd be very interested in
any references to companies or individuals being prosecuted for exporting
crypto.
