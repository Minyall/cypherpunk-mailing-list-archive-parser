How hard would this be? (and would it work?)

Use an encrypted file system, something like Matt Blazes CFS which allows each
user to set up his own encrypted directories.  The encryption is file by file
so that backups can be made by the system, but the backups are still encrypted.

Unlike CFS, this system would allow public key cryptography.  The system could
write to a directory using the public key, but only the user could read from
the directory.  As usual, to speed things up, the PK cryptography would just be
used to encrypt/decrypt conventional keys which would be used for the
encryption/decryption of the data.  With this in place, when email comes in, it
could be stored in the recipient's directory of the hard drive.  I guess I'm
assuming that the user has a shell account.
