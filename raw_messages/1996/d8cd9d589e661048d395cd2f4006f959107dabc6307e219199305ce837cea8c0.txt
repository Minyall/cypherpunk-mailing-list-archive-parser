Congradulations to Philip, but Phill(boy this is getting confussing) 
is right.

By dropping the case, the goverment avoids a high visiblity case that 
could change the rules.  

What happened to Phillip Zimmermann is unexcusable, but others must 
continue in his footsteps in order to win a decicive victory.
