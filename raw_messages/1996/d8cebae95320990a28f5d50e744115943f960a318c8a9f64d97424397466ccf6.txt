No one had ever heard of Farrakhan, until the ADL starting pumping out
press releases, attacking him by name. But Farrakhan was cleverer than
than Abe Foxman, who makes six figures as the head of ADL; Farrakhan used
the publicity to his financial advantage. Farrakhan now works the college
lecture circuit; even better, he hires sports arenas and fills them up
with lower-middle class blacks who are willing to pay the price of a
ticket, to see Whitey get sassed in public.
