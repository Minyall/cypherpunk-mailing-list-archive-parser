Yes compliance costs are a sore subject. Billing costs are actually
very cheap,(the mainframes are on the floor above me) the
difference between sending a metered bill or a flat rate bill is
tiny. Really tiny (NDA). The local/long distance subsidy was
eliminated at breakup, but long distance companies do have to pay
to use local networks, but as competition heats up these rates are
dropping and new players (competitors) join the table, Or they can
build their own. ;) 

One of the fun turns of events might be that the threat of x-phones
might lead the RBOC's to actually turn into an ISP's! We could pull
this off at amazing speed. (if you can't beat them, join them!) We
are after all one of the four major nodes of the Internet......

Heh heh heh.......
