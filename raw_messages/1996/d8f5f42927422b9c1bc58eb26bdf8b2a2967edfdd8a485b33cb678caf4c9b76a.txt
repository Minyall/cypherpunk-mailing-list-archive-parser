Excuse me?  Here James, have a penny.

That took me all of about 5 seconds.  If you had Mark Twain
ecash it would take you less time to accept that penny that it
takes you to read "----BEGIN ECASH PAYMENT-----" with your slow
human eyes.


Regards,

Bryce

P.S.  That is my "lucky penny"!  It was given to me by Lucky 
Green when he was working for Mark Twain Bank and I was
establishing my cybershop.  We used it to test my shop.  If
nobody takes it (it is marked so that anyone can pick it up, not
just James), I'm taking it back in a day or two.
