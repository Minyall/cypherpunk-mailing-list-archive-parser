Well,

	There were no signs of mecahnical faliure, the plane took off one 
hour late, that means if it was a timed bomb the plane would have gone 
down over oh lets say random VERY VERY deep place in the atlantic ocean.  
The plane was an easy shop for all sorts of shoulder launched SAM's.  
There is a hell of alot of terrorist activity right now, and the 
olympics, I think there is good circumstantial evidance to suggest 
terrorist activty just from motives and oppertunity.


my half a cent...
