If you want to try a wireless network run by a couple of known
cypherpunk types, browse www.fish.com.  Your packets will be moving
over a 2 Mbit/sec wireless network, using AT&T WaveLan
(www.ncr.com/pub/products/wavelan) ISA-bus cards in PC-clone routers
built by KarlNet (www.karlbridge.com).  I think of it as a NAN
(Neighborhood Area Network).  The security is only DES at the
card level, but we hope to layer IPSEC (RFC 1825) on top.
