If it's in relation to a tender offer, they are in deep.  (As, for 
example, if they were hiking up price to deter a hostile aquisition).

Incorrect.

I direct you to Dirks v. Securities and Exchange Commission, 463 U.S. 646 
(1983).

Specifically footnote 14:

"Under certain circumstances, such as where corporate information is 
revealed legitimately to an underwriter, accountant, lawyer, or 
consultant working for the corporation, these outsiders may become 
fiduciaries of the shareholders....  When such a person breaches his 
fiduciary relationship, he may be treated more properly as a tipper than 
a tipee...."

This circumstance is classically refered to as a "footnote 14 insider."

It has been held to apply to lower level employees within the corporation 
who "knowingly trade based on material non-public information acquired by 
virtue of their position within the company."

After 1983, Mr. May may have committed a crime.

The case against Mr. May would be strengthened if a court were to accept 
a misappropriation theory.  (In short, that the employee used information 
intended for corporate purposes [development, etc.] in order to trade 
stock for his gain).  Misappropriation theory, where it is accepted, 
fills in the needed "fraud" element in rule 10b-5 which would impose 
liability on a trader and which is otherwise absent in the case of an 
employee trading as Mr. May has indicated.  While misappropriation theory is 
waning, it is not entirely dead.

Remember that restrictions on senior management as per trading in the 
company's stock are to prevent director and corporate liability.  No one 
cares much if a lower level employee gets zapped because it doesn't open 
the door for greater corporate liability like it would for senior 
management.  Further, you don't want to have to circulate a memo to the 
whole company as to when trading is restricted.  That would be asking for 
trouble.

Be sure to distingiush between corporate policy with regard to 
employee trading and legality.

Or if they were artifically hiking up the price to defend against or 
interefere with a tender offer.
