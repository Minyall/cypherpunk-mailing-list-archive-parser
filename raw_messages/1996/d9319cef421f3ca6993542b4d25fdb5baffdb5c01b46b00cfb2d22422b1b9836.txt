A list of reliable back end remailers (output) could be kept, and
automatically used by the front end remailers. This would allow the back
end remailers to be highly transient, but keep the remailers used in chains
stable.

A remailer would randomly choose one of the 99% reliable back end remailers
for each outgoing message.

This could be done even more disposably using alpha type nyms.
Speaking of which, it looks like my nym server is working:

Send to help@alias.cyberpass.net for instructions and the key.
