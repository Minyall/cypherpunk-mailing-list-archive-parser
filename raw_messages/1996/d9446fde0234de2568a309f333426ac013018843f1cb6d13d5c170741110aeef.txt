I remember after Tiannamen Sq. many protests/meetings help by Chinese 
were semi-secret or they did their best to keep cameras out, or in many 
of the public ones people disquised themselves (from wigs and makeup to 
outright bandanas or bags over their faces) because of fear that the 
Chinese authorities would see them and persecute relatives who were still 
there.
