Igor, and many others who commented on the fact that many characters
are legal in email are correct.  However, with the exception of '-'
and '+', I'm not sure if I'll be changing the body of the guidelines.
My issue is that dealing with a wide variety of characters that are
legitamate, such as "cat ../../../etc/passwd"@foo.com is more
dangerous than only accepting the common case of user@host.net.

The number of addresses such as harvard!adam is dropping as the number
of 'normal' addresses grows.

| In part " V.Code (Security Issues)/3.Data Checking" you say the following:
| 
| `` Data coming in to Acme Widgets should be checked very carefully for
|         appropriateness. This check should be to see if the data is what
|         is expected (length, characters). Making a list of bad
|         characters is not the way to go; the lists are rarely complete.
|         A secure program should know what it expects, and reject other
|         input. (For example, if you are looking for an email address,
|         don't check to see if it contains a semi-colon or a newline,
|         check to see if it contains anything other than a [A-Za-z0-9._]
|         followed by an @, followed by a hostname [A-Za-z0-9._].)''

| That is not entirely correct. An email address is much more than
| that, it can contain "!", several "@" characters (not next to each other
| though), "%", and so on. x400 mail addresses (?) can contain "/", "=",
| and all emails can have "+" and "-" and "_" in them. 
| 
| Some of the valid email addresses are
| 
| user_name@company.com
| alex+@pitt.edu
| mi%aldan.UUCP@algebra.com
| user%host.domain@anon.penet.fi
| host1!host2!user
| 
| Look at your sendmail.cf file for a humongous amount of 
| email parsing rules.
| 
| Thanks for an excellent document though, I put a link to it from my
| intranet page.
