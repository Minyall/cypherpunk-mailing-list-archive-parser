I am currently using the new EPPI DLL for Eudora 3.0.  It integrates PGP
almost seamlessly.  I have had no problems at all ... yet.

it. It seems to me that a downloadable plug-in would be very popular. I
know a lot of lawyers who would jump at the chance to use email but realize
they have to have crypto.

hehe.  I totally agree.  MS = MaSsive Confusion.
