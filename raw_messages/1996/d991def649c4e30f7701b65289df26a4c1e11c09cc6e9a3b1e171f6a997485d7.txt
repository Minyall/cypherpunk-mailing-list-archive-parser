The noise levels around here are getting astounding.

Posts on windows registration wizards, gun control, unemployment,
Kevin Mitnick's underwear, and all the rest are most certainly NOT
doing us any good.

Here we are in the midst of IBM putting espionage enabled versions of
Lotus Notes out (someone should be putting out a hack to change the
embedded public key), Microsoft putting out a crypto API that could
potentially be of enormous interest, activity moving in the Karn
lawsuit, and all sorts of other important events, and YOU DUNDERHEADS
ARE MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT IMPORTANT DISCUSSIONS.

If you want to help the NSA in its mission to stop the dissemination
of strong crypto, by all means, continue posting garbage.
