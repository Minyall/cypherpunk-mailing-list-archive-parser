Surely, I am not expecting that presence of some magic header line would
prevent everyone from archiving all my posts. I am fairly sure that
Dimitri Vulis, for example, archives all my messages just in case.
There is little one can do to prevent that.

I do, however, believe that limiting the availability of archived posts,
even to a small degree, is a valuable thing.
