Another non-rebutted rebuttal.  I care nothing about yours or
Metzgers personal life, this is FAR ramnificated severity.

And, the anology I made CLEARLY was the similarity between 
Co$ and SPLC; And the VICTIMS: WAR and Wollersheim,Fishman,etc.
CO$ AND WAR DON'T HAVE THE SLIGHTEST RESEMBLANCE!!!:

ADL claimed $50,000 was funneled to NA from the beginning.
No proof whatsoever, as they havn't pressed the matter to proceedings.

You mean he laundered the money right before his death, and
his hiers got it all?  WOW!  What a Don!

These say nothing.  SPLC has avoided the net, because
it's two periodicals are so embarrassing to the anti-racists.
You need to go to the library and check up on Klanwatch
for the years 89-93 for the sordid details.

Ignoroid, ALL the Metzger funds are being transfered with
the large mulatto Seraw family as sole beneficiary.
Co$/SPLC political harassment cases are NOT done to
raise funds, but suppress organisation.
