Hi--

we here at HKS.net have today received a cease and desist
letter from the washington post regarding editorial copy 
of theirs that was evidently posted to c'punks and then
abosrbed into our c'punk archives. 

Once the archives are restored (RSN) we'll probably manually edit out
the messages from the archive. We're trying to get the post to give us
URLs for their copies of the content in question so that we can point
to their archives, but their legal dept wasn't sure whether or not
their archives were on the web.

The posts in question date back some time (archive volume 1);
I'm not too concerned about a recurrance (though it would make
an interesting attack), but thought it was interesting 
enough to warrent mention, since it seems likely that the
washington post was grepping the net looking for themselves.

I wonder if robot exclusion on our site would have prevented this? 

Although the legal staffer who sent the letter did come up with a URL
for the offending messages, she seemed unaware of the concepts of
"mailing list" and (semi-automated) archives according to the person
here who spoke to her.
