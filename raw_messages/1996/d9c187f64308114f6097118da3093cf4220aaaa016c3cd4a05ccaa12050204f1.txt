Oh, come on now, Perry - while Friedman has more sense than that,
you've been around the Libertarian party long enough to know people
who call themselves free-market environmentalists who contend that whales
will be best protected if they're owned property, that do-gooder
environmentalists will be free to outbid Sushi Inc.* for them,
and that initial ownership of the whales ought to be decided by
the traditional initial land-ownership method of homesteading.
Personally, I view this as rent-seeking by folks who ought to let
the whales own themselves, and think they've got as little understanding
of free-market environmentalism as the government bureaucrats who
massively subsidize the logging of US National Forests, but they _are_ there.
