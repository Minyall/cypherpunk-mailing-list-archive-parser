Hmmm...

Lets assume 20,000 P100 Years to give a bit more breathing
room. 100,000 machines would be needed to get the thing into striking
distance. I think that is potentially doable. Hard, but
doable. Managing to avoid search failure (that is, having someone find
the key but somehow fail to report back) is the biggest problem, I
think.

If you can manage to do that, then I'd say that the software only
approach could be abandoned. Meanwhile, I think its time to try to
build those DES cracking screensavers for Windows...
