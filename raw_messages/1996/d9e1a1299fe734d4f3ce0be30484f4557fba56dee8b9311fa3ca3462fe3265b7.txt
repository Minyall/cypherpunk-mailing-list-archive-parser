	Much the most likely satellite phone is the widely used INMARSAT
A or C types which radiate continuous narrow band (nbfm or QPSK) uplinks
in L band (around 1636 mhz) at considerable power (multiple tens of
watts)  via antennas with large sidelobes (the fact that the antennas
are small and portable on most satellite terminals mean that they
radiate lots of energy in various directions other than the satellite
because of the limitations of the physical optics involved at such a
long wavelength).

	This would be a sitting duck for an anti-radiation missle.  The
US has had such missle's since the Vietnam era for knocking out
radar sites, one can presume the USSR developed such weapons as well.

	Why the Russians did not use this technology earlier 
remains puzzling ... and why Dudeyev used a satellite phone
which made him a sitting duck is even less clear.
