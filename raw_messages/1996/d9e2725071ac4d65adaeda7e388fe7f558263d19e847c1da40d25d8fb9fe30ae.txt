Sorry to inject a little scholarly research on this topic, but I
would urge those of you who are interested in how this mythology

he's potentially the leading scholar on this subject.  I've read
his book, and Tim probably ought to as well ...

an interview with him at http://www2.ari.net/home/bsabath/950711.html
