Far be it from me to add to this, but this is from FV's

[2] Why don't you use encryption with First Virtual?
 
Encryption is almost always cumbersome and difficult.  And it always
adds an additional step, and something else to worry about.  After all,
even banks and armored cars are subject to robbery attempts, and
sometimes those attempts succeed.  Rather than use encryption, we
decided to design a system in which it wouldn't be necessary.

I, uh, think that speaks for itself.
