"flits" would have an identity irrespective of companies. one
could track them moving through different companies if necessary.
(the "flits" might therefore also have security aspects associated with
them.)  the point is that the data must not be disconnected, it
must be seen as continuous, and I think a flit-like concept is key
to accomplishing this.
...................................................................


Wouldn't this accounting of "flits" require that each of them be assigned a tag?   

Since this would encompass all the "flits" in cyberspace irrespective of who/where used them, whose "flits" would be counted first, beginning where?   

And once one "flit" was attached to a document which was maintained as a permanent structure somewhere in someone's database, that means it could not be used anywhere else, and how would this work for copies made of that original document?  

Once a "flit" was used as a copy and then detached and re-associated with some other document several times, would each new copy carry a record of where it had been previously, so that half of the amount of space of a document would be comprised of the historical record of where that "flit" had been?

Sounds very costly.
