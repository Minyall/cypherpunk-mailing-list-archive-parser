She need not ever have even gotten a US passport.  Additionally, she
probably can't renounce her citizenship until she reaches majority.  Also,
if she is born with a fortune and the Clinton Exit Tax (which declares that
renunciation of citizenship is a taxable event) is in place, she is out vast
quantities of cash for nothing.  The problem is the US tax system which
tries to maintain an extra-territorial reach and encourages renunciation of
citizenship.
