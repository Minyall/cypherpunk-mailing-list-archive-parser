The 29 January New Yorker has an article "Hackworm" that discusses the
Mitnick-Shimomura-Markoff echoing cypherpunks lack of sympathy for the
Markoff-Shimomura P.R. extravaganza.  Article ends mentioning cypherpunks
and John Gilmore specifically, discussion of crypto politics, while not
entirely toe-ing the cypherpunks party line, an enhearteningly informed and
rational treatement.

[An altavista search reveals the New Yorker is at
http://www.enews.com/magazines/new_yorker/, but they don't seem to put the
entire issue online, and parts of the 15 January issue is what you get when
you click on "current issue"]
