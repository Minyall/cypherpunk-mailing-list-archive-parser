I for one reject your premise and your conclusions.  There is no 
indication that government is capable of addressing this "problem"
in a useful way.  In fact, I argue that the situation is at least
partially of government construction.  The government's hindrance of
crypto technology has undoubtedly slowed down and in many cases
entirely prevented the application of current technology to protect
the very systems the government now purports to be concerned about.

(This is not conjecture or speculation; it is fact.  I personally have
witnessed -- and, in some cases, been part of -- the many hundreds of
hours of productivity lost to producing and distributing security software
in ways that protect the company from ITAR violations, or trying to
formulate adequate solutions for the company's non-US customers.)

My message to a government concerned about the dangers of "information
warfare" (and its apologists): get out of the way and let industry work
on security.  Then you can choose from the products offered for your 
protection or develop your own.  But don't sit there and prevent or help
prevent deployment of security technology while decrying the lack of
security.

I don't claim that the current security deficiencies are entirely due
to ITAR restrictions but it is certainly a significant factor, and there
is still zero evidence that the government is competent to help.  Let
them first fix their own problems (e.g. the alleged 250,000 DoD computer
breakins), *then* come help us in the private sector.
