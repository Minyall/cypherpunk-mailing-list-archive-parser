  I think this wrong. Read the definition of "income" before the WWII. 
Wages were considered to be an equal exchange for labor services 
rendered, not a "gain" (income).

    Not so. Govt has been able to print fiat money at will since the Fed 
Reserve was founded in 1913.

     That income tax was overthrown by the Supreme Court as not being 
apportioned amongst the states, as required by the Constitution.

     Technically, the income tax is an excise, not a tax. They aren't the 
same.
