Thanks for the info (and for the excellent book, by the way).

Can you explain in little detail what are these logic bombs?

Also, why these institutions do not install protection from HERF radiation
and TEMPEST-type protection from information leaks? Do they think that
paying ransom is cheaper than all investment in IW-protection?
