And you call them clueless?!  One thing to keep in mind... the ignorant are 
usually aware of their ignorance, the stupid, well...

And just like the clueless ones who fall for "Good Times" memos, you've fallen 
for some misinformation yourself. Single clicks in MS Internet Mail allow you 
to view the contents in the preview window - without opening or executing any 
attachments, while double clicking opens the message in it's own window - again 
without opening or executing any attachments. Try it a couple of times and 
you'll see for yourself. Just because you "heard it on the internet" does not 
make it fact!

To the former I suggest you change surreal to unreal, and as for the latter - 
you might consider taking your own advice.
