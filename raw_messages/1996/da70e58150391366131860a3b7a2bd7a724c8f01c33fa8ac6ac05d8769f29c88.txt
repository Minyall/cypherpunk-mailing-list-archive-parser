Welcome!

I can't tell which of the two authors of ths following conversation is the more 
paranoid, but clearly at least 1 1/2 of them are totally wrong with their 
assumptions about 'agenda' and 'receptiveness' and 'one-upped.' It's so obscure, 
I don't know whether to take it seriously or not.

BUT - if you are serious about submitting, to an international audience, I 
suggest that you first:

	- Read "Information Warfare: Chaos on the Electronic Superhighway"
	- Get the Proceedings from InfoWarCon III, 1995 from 1.800.488.4595

and then make informed opinions and decisions.

We openly ebncourgae and welcome controversial subjects; that's why InfoWarCon's 
are so successful Fromthe sounds of it, no one else would have you.   <BG>

Make it intersting, cogent, contributory to the field, and meaningful. We will 
then take you seriously.

Thyanks for your thoughts!
Winn
