Hello you all!

I would like to make a suggestion that D. Denning; others
who are pro-escrow/clipper; and some of you folks here on
this forum get together for a debate. 

Ideally, this would be real nice on a TV show such as the
McNiel Lehrer show on PBS. Barring that, I would think 
that an IRC chat channel could be set up so that they
could get on line and engage in an on line discussion.

Mark
