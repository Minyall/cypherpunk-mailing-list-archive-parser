Wanna make lotsa money?  Just charge $20 for instructions whenever the
clueless want off the list.  When they email you with their pathetic
"unsubscrive" pleas, get their MasterCard / Visa / AmEx / Discover number and
expiration date.  Call it a "spamming fee" to compensate you for the time it
takes to download and respond to their iggorant [sick] requests.  See you on
the Riviera!
