I'm considering putting together a periodic publication about the technical
and legal aspects of privacy and the Internet. My "business model" would
feature free WWW/email access with a charge for fax or postal delivery. I'm
curious to know if this strikes people as interesting or just Yet Another
Email Newsletter Of No Real Consequence. (no offense taken if it's the
latter.)

Any feedback is appreciated.
