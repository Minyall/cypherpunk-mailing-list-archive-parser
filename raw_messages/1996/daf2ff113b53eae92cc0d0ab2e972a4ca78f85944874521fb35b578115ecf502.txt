I have not found security holes in ssh-1.2.14, which is the version
I've looked at most in depth.

However, I have found things that are disquieting, and as such assume
that clever professionals with time available might be able to exploit
something.

	'Standard' hackers with toolkits are likely to move to the
next site.

| Why do you say "not likely to come under attack by professionals"?
| Have you found security holes in it?
