	   We've made no progress. Phil has lots lots of time and gained
   lots of grey hairs, and everyone who donated to his defense fund lost
   money.

To the contrary, Phil won big.  He avoided going to Federal court as the
defendant in a felony case.  That's what matters most.  Yes, a lot of
time, money and effort was spent reaching this outcome, but none of it
was wasted.

	   The US can still harass people if they want, and make their
   life hell.

Of course they can; they're the U.S. government.  No possible outcome of
Phil's case would have changed this fact.  If the Federal government
wishes to make your life miserable they can always do so.

The legal challenges to the ITAR regulations will continue forward in
the various Federal courts, but that fight will no longer be on Phil
Zimmermann's back.
