I will mailbomb you into SMITHERINES!  And kill your whole fucking

Paul Bradley seemsw to be just another faggot suppporting the
main Faggot, John Gilmore.

A "punk" means you are a WIMP!

I think it is about time for the Freedom Knights to
just kick the fucking shit out of the cypherpunks list!

This is your last warning, punk.

If you get out of line again, both you and your list
will be terminated.
