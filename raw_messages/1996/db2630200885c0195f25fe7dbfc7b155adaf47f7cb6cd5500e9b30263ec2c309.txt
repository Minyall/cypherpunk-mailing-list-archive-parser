PGP KeyIDs are 8 hexes long (formerly 6), and there have been some natural
collisions and it's easy to manufacture them.  On the other hand,
the MD5 hash used for key fingerprints is 128 bits long, and
cryptographically strong.
So birthday-problem collisions occur when you have ~ 2**64 keys around,
which is not a problem, and you can't generate collisions on purpose either.
A 64-bit hash would be more interesting; you get collisions if you have
around 2**32 keys, which could actually happen.

:-)  The main problem is the limitations of hex; keyids like 0xdeadbeef
are available, but it's tough to really trigger Exonization that way.
Using 32 bits as ASCII instead is a bit more flexible.

Yeah - lots of people have been concerned about this.  Keyservers
simplify the problem a lot, since you no longer need to carry a large
number of keys around yourself, but the keyring handling mechanism of PGP
wasn't designed to scale.  Wouldn't be too hard to redesign, once PGP 3.0
comes out and we've got tools to do it - you could use a database or decently
structured ASCII file or files.  And DNS or similar distributed keyserver
can make it easier to find, for people who are on-line.
