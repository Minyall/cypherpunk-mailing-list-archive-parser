I think claiming RPN for Forth is pushing it a little far. Admittedly it is
stack-based (well, two-stack-based), and everything an operator can operate on
is to the left, but the provision of arbitrary stack manipulation, "compile"
mode (triggered by the '[' operator, if my memory serves) and so on make it
rather a different beast.

Incidentally, PostScript is Forth in disguise.

Cheers,

Ben.
