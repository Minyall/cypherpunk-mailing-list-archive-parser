Assume Alice, Bob, and Carol are on abc.com and Xenu, Yak, and Zut
are on xyz.com.  Remailing between Alice, Bob, and Carol doesn't
make appear to make much difference, but it does reduce the damage
if one of the remailer's keys is compromised.  On the other hand,
mail from Alice -> Xenu -> Bob -> Yak -> Carol -> Zut adds traffic
to the system, and makes traffic analysis more difficult,
even if the Bad Guys are watching site abc.com and have stolen
Alice, Bob, and Carol's keys.

The other threat it helps with is that if XYZ.COM gets complaints
about that evil user Zut, she can kick her off (Bad Zut!)
and still leave Xenu and Yak alone; if the remailer service
were provided by the machine owner herself she might be directly liable.
