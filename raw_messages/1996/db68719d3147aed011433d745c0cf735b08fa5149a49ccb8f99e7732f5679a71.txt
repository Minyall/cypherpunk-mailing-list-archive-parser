I trust it won't stun you to find that many, many large and even small
corporations -- including my current employer [*NOT* SecureWare, BTW,
despite the email address] -- actually encourage their employees to buy
stock by offering stock purchase plans as a benefit of employment.  They
even make it convenient by deducting purchases from one's paycheck.

Presumably then, we ordinary employees are so in-the-dark that any
non-public information we do hold is considered non-material?

So perhaps Tim over-simplified by saying that there were no limits on
what ordinary employees could do.  OTOH, it seems that Perry also
over-simplified by flatly stating that Tim's trades while an Intel
employee were "illegal".
