Are you sure? Can you cite references? From my readings on the 1st
amendments, any general kind of speech is legal, even if it advocates
killing certain officials, including us presidents. *If* instead of
general advocacy a person gave specific orders or concrete requests to
kill the prez, then it would not be speech. Please correct me if I am
wrong.
