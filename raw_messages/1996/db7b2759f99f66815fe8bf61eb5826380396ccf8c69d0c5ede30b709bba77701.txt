"Black Widow" was the calling card of a little script called 'latro' that
exploited the stupidity of certain webmasters who put perl.exe in the
cgi-bin directory on PC-based webservers.  The default code to execute
on the remote machine was:


print "If I were nasty, you'd be spiderfood by now.\n";

print "\n\n\t--the black widow\n";
