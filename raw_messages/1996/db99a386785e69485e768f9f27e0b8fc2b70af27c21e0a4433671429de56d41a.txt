	Since the telcom legislation has been passed, I thought it might
be prudent to remind everyone that there is a PGP encrypted mailing list
called cypher-list. It can be subscribed to by sending email to
cypher-list-request@vishnu.alias.net. All messages and transactions are
encrypted. The code is a little buggy but it works for the most part. It
seems that cypher-list would make an excellent platform for discussion on
the telcom legislation and maybe even ways to thwart it. If you have
trouble subscribing, perry@vishnu.alias.net has been very helpful. (he got
me on!)
