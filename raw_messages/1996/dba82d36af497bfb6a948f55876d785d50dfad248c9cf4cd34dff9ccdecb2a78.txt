I was messing around with this a year and a half ago (woulda shoulda
coulda), and my guess is they're using Reuben Donnelly's database. They're
the largest phonebook printer, and they even go so far as to OCR a lot, but
apparently not all, of their competition.

They say 90 million names, and that seems to be the number I was quoted...

Cheers,
Bob
