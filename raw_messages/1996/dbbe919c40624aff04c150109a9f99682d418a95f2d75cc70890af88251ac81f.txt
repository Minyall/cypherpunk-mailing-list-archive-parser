C'punks,

At long last pictures from my costume party are available on the
Web.  The URL is:

		http://www.c2.org/party/masquerade/

Special thanks are in order to Sameer for donating the Web page
and loading it up with all the pictures.  See Sameer for all
your Internet privacy needs.

Bart Nagel spent several hours scanning, cropping, digitally 
editing and sweetening the original pictures I took.  Bart (and
I) want you to contact him for all your *expensive* image editing 
needs.  He can be reached at egon@aol.com or barticus@well.com.

Thanks to Gracie and Zarkov for the use of their lovely homes.

And a big thank you to all the attendees who made the party a
might to remember.
