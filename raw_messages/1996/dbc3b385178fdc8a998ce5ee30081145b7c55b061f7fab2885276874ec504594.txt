I think you missed the main pattern... When a suspect is required to
provide fingerprints, voice, blood and/or handwriting samples, those
things are used exclusively for _identification_.

The only exceptions I can think of are when blood, breath and urine
samples are taken from a suspect to detect certain chemicials in the body. 
But, AFAIK, those exceptions are entirely the product of the recent war on
drugs. 

Just my two bits. IANAL.
