This, it seems to me, is the key issue.  

The Security Department isn't going to have time to test and certify the
applet code for Foo Corporation's fancy merger press release; the risk
arb desk is going to need to see it *right now*.

I hate saying things like "the answer is to educate the users" because
it is as close to a cop-out as you can get.  But educating the users has
to be at least part of the answer - and not just the users.  The
publicity and shareholder relations offices at Foo Corporation need to
know that putting out information for Wall Street needs to be in a form
that Wall Street can deal with safely.  If Java doesn't belong on the
trading floor, it doesn't belong in a press release either.

I suspect that the best way to get the message across would be for a
major security disaster - a big-time hack or perhaps just a Java-caused 
system failure - to take place.

(A near-future Wall Street techno-thriller about such a hack *might* do
the trick, but there's no guarantee it wouldn't just vanish into the
science fiction midlist.)
