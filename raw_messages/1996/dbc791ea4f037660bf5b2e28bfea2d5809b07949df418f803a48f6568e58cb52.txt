: I agree to some extend that our system could be used in a totalitarian country, to make
: certain censorship possible. On the other hand, it doesn't make their job especially easy:

: The whole problem is that you don't trust your government, well I do (till some
: extend). I get the impression that this is a typical USA problem.
