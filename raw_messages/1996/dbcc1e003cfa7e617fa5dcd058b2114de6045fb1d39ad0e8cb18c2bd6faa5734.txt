OK.  I am not on Cypherpunks anymore but this leftover of the mail queue 
landed in my mailbox.  So, please, reply directly.

I just couldn't let this one pass by me without jumping on it.  :)

Your second paragraph is attacking a straw man.  You even included the word
'capitalist' in double quotes (").  The common point between socialists and
theses so-called "capitalists" is that they both use that fact that some
coercion is enacted on a given population to get rich an/or powerful.  

The socialists seek, as a value, power over producers and your "capitalists"
seek to get rich and/or powerfull. But both blank out the cause of the
obtention of their goals: legally exerted coercion (via govt rules and
powers).  To use terms coined by a well known writer, one is a Witch Doctor,
the other is an Attila (morally sanctionned by the Witch Doctor).  They
natures are not opposite, they are simply both sides of the same coin.

I sometimes wish peoples would use words for what they really mean...
