	If I recall correctly, Europe still has a lot of over-the-air
broadcast TV. Moreover, if the device works from signals cosent with the TV
broadcast, it could perfectly well work with cable. Indeed, I had thought it
did - the companies that mainly produce stuff for cable seemed to be protesting
it just as much as the broadcast networks.
