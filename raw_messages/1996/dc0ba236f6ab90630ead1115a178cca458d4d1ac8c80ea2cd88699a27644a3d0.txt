Software and hardware follow different rules.

Free software can often be superior because even tiny contributions by
large numbers of people can all "add up", and software has no cost to
its distribution in free form. A person of limited means who is into
the idea and has good skills and a good concept (like Phil Z.) can get
massive global distribution of their product.

Hardware, however, costs actual dollars, and many people don't have
those in large supply. Connectivity costs, too. Poor folks can't pay
for T3s, at least not at their current prices.
