Fyodor,
 The webmaster and postmaster at plaidworks.com are lonely and
want you to send them eMail.
  They love it when people talk dirty, so they're hoping that 
when you Reply to their postings, you will change the Subject
heading to contain words like COCKSUCKER, FUCK, CUNT, etc.

   The listproc@plaidworks.com in the Mail To: box when you
Reply to the message needs to be changed.  listproc is just
a mailing daemon that plaidworks.com uses to reply automatically.
   You need to change the Mail To: address box to read
either: postmaster@plaidworks.com
    or: webmaster@plaidworks.com
(or put one of them in the Mail To: box, and the other address
in the Cc: box)
   And don't forget to put FUCKING IDIOTS in the Subject: box.

Toto
