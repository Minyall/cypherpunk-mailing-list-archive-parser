The events occuring after the finish of the original codebreakers 
(beginning the seventies, and including public key, Clipper ,etc) and 
covered lightly in the rewrite will be at the center of my book CRYPTO, 
which I am still finishing. Meanwhile, the re-release of Codebreakers 
is a firm reminder of Kahn's awesomeness.
