So people who work on micropayments are trying to reduce that 
overhead.  It is clear to me that it is feasible to do so.  
(Someone have a list of references to published micropayment
schemes that I can insert here?)  IPng headers have plenty of
room for this kind of thing, don't they?
 
 
Also on this thread someone mentioned seeing an icon that says  
"5 cents" and clicking on it to pay 5 cents from their wallet.  
Well, please start your Ecash(tm) wallet and visit 
"http://www.c2.net/~bryce/BuyBAP.html".  Click on the dime.  
Better yet click on the pair of quarters.  As a bonus you 
actually get a copy of 'Bryce's Easy PGP', too!
 
 
(Sameer's the one to blame for this new threat to our national
security/children's innocence/community standards/etc.  His
"Ecash(tm) integrated with c2.net" system underlies my
cybershop.)
