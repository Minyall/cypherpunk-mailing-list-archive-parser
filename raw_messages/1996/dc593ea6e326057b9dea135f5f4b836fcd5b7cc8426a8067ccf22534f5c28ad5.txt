Can you say B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T ???

Man, this place is like a bunch of guerilla fighters preparing for war.
People are really on edge.  Make one wrong move and everybody starts
shooting.  I'm afraid that sooner or later it could be real bullets too.

BTW, Netcom splits its newsfeed between two servers.  Currently the
netcom.*, comp.*, and rec.* are all on one, and everything else is on the
other, although they move them around every few months.  Occasionally one
or the other server starts acting up, causing the respective heirarchies
to be temporarily inaccessable.
