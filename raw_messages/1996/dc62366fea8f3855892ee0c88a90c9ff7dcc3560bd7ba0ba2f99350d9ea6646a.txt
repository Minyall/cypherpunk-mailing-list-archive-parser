	I would like to conclude this Ebonics issue. The main problem is
understanding. Some people have bad accents, either Southern or Ebonic,
both of which are often difficult to understand. I am not disputing the
fact that everyone should learn a standard language, but I object to the
racial undertones of the messages - that black people are stupider than
white people, and gross ignorance of environmental conditions. Whatever.
