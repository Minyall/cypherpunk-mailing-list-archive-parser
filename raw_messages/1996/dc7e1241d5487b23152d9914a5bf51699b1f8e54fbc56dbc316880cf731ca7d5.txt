Security through obscurity is no security at all.

As for PnC (actually, the scCryptoEngine beneath it), we get the 40 bits 
from the 56 bits by nulling out the high nybble of every other byte.

Would you mind telling us just how you expand the 40 key to the 56
bits needed for DES? (Security through obscurity has a bad rep on
this list). For many  methods of doing so, 40bit DES is NOT
secure against a motivated individual's attack.
