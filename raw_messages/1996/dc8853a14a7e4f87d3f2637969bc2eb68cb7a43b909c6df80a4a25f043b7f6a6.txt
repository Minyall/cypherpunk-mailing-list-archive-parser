By request, I've created a new DCSB mailing list,

	dcsb-announce@ai.mit.edu

which will be for DCSB-related announcements, only.  The ability to
post to the list will be restricted by Majordomo.  Subscriptions are
for folks who can't/don't/won't paw through the talk on the normal
DCSB mailing list and digest, but would like to hear about upcoming
lunches.

Because the lunch announcements will be sent to both the dcsb-announce
and dcsb lists, there's no need to be on both.

To subscribe, send an email

	To: dcsb-announce-request@ai.mit.edu
	Subject: irrelevant

	subscribe

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To unsubscribe from this list, send a letter to: Majordomo@ai.mit.edu
In the body of the message, write:  unsubscribe dcsb
Or, to subscribe,           write:  subscribe dcsb
If you have questions, write to me at Owner-DCSB@ai.mit.edu
