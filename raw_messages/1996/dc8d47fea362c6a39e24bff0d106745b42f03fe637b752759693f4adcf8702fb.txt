Well, it's been about 20 years since the Stockhausen/Soundstream digital 
reprocessing of the Caruso recordings (other artists as well), and it 
would make sense that "they" can do exactly what you suggest, and very 
well indeed.

If you recorded the debates yourself, and if you could do the analysis 
(much easier than faking anything), you'd have something to compare to 
the talking-head versions from TV.  Unfortunately, the major media will 
not likely present any voice-analysis info unless it's done by one or 
two of the nation's top labs, which (it goes without saying) get most of 
their work presumably from government agencies.
