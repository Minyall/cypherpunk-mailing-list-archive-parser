If you stego too many bits in a figure, it may become apparent.

24 bit color has more data, therefore its easier to hide random data.

Not really.  If you make sure there are no predictable headers, and use a
good encryption algorithm, it is almost impossible to tell the presence of
a hidden file unless you compare a file untouched with the one with data
in it.
