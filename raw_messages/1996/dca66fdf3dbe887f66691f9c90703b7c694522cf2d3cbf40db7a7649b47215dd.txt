This is a a bad example:  drugs are a destructive, negative thing, and 
practical experience with them makes people wary.  Freedom, on the other 
hand, it a good thing and experience with it will bear that out.

Having said that, there is a lot of support for legal and non-violent ways
to distribute drugs.  I would be surprised if it doesn't happen in 20 or
30 years.

I'll have to defer to you on this -- I don't know the ins and outs of
commerce in Russia.  But my impression, as an uninformed layman, was that
the experience with illegal capitalist trading in the black market had
preceeded (and softened them up for?) legal capitalist transactions above
ground.
