Can someone explain what, if any, effect this might have on domestic
use of encryption?  When they say relaxing export restrictions in
exchange for escrow, that still just means escrow for exportable
products (which they are hoping will be almost everything), right?

Is there any danger of domestic encryption without escrow being
outlawed?

Thanks.
