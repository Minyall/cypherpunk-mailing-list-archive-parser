The language of the new regulations supports this view. It seems to me that
the USG wanted to ban easily scannable text, but wasn't sure how to best
define "easily scannable". This is a property that is difficult to define.
Once they come up with a workable definition, expect the regs to be amended.

As Michael Froomkin has noted, this will require an act of Congress. I
expect the administration to send a pro-GAK bill to Congress in 1997.
