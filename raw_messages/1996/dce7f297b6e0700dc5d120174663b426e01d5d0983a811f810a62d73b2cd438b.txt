	Is there some interest in a meeting of Canadian Cypherpunks? If
you are a Canadian (or an American who is fortunate enough to live near
our sainted shores ;-)) send me a private E-mail message.
	Because Canada is such a big country, I propose that we start 
with a meeting in Toronto or area. If there is enough interest, I will 
arrange for a meeting place.

Regards, 
Tim Philp
