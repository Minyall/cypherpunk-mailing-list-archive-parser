Right, absolutely.  But let's face it, by now you believe it's me
anyway, or the real nsb@nsb.fv.com would have spoken up and argued with
me.  On the other hand,  if I start routinely PGP-signing email, then
the value of slowly brute-force cracking my private key goes way up.  If
FV is successful, for example, you could spend a few years breaking my
key, and then forge apparently-slanderous signed mail from me to you as
part of a lawsuit.  This would be far more believable, in a court of
law, if I routinely signed everything than if I didn't.  

I don't routinely sign things because I think it is asking for problems
with retrospective forgery down the road.  I might, however, consider
routinely signing things once I can easily incorporate a digital
timestamping service like the one from Surety into my signature.

I sincerely hope that you will gain it back when you realize that not
all "hype" is without substance, and that we really have unveiled a
genuine, previously-unrecognized, and extremely important flaw in
commercial mechanims that purport to offer security through the software
encryption of credit card numbers.  -- Nathaniel
