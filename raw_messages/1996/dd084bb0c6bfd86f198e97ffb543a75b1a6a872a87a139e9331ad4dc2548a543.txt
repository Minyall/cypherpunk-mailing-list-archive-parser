Vulis, the archives speak for themselves.  Lie all you want, anyone with 
half a brain can do a net search on the word vulis and see the lying crud 
you've posted all over the net.  It's that simple.

Translation (since you are clueless) "Nice try NSA mole, but try harder 
next time."  Maybe you need to take some propaganda lessons from your NSA 
masters, it appears you are perhaps rusty in such techniques.
