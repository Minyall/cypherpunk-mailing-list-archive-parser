There are certainly legitimate arguments about the level of use of
Ritalin or other drugs, their benefits & their costs, but this straw
man is just ridiculous, & betrays the author's lack of knowledge.
Unfortunately a similar misunderstanding is reflected in the writings
of 1 or 2 others on this topic too.

Parental (or other) control is not at issue at all with add; self
control is the main problem.
