Willis Carto, a man who is more discredited in the U.S. than most (he
is alleged to be extremely anti-Semitic, although Mark Lane says not so),
says that "Capitalism is generally just as much an enemy of Free Enterprise
as is Socialism" (quote approximate), since both promote monopolies.

I think you all know of the potential dangers of Populism (Carto's
preference), so perhaps the "Devil is in the details", as they say...
