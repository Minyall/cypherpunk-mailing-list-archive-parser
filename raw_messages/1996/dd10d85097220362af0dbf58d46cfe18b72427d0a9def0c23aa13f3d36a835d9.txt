In a "briefing" on TWA 800 when one of the reporters tossed Big Jim
Kellstrom (Deputy Director in Charge of the New York Office) of the FBI a
softball question about what he needed to fight terrorism; he took the
opportunity to call for full funding of the Digital Telephony Bill.  He said
the usual about how bad guys conspire and we need to tap.
