A late April Fool's joke, methinks? Arguing that in "several billion years"
the "temperature" of the universe will have anything to do with
computation....well, your physics is all wrong.

The approximate figure, kT, for the minimum energy in a conventional bit
flip, can be reduced by simple cooling. Not a problem. And what the
so-called "average temperature" of the Universe may be in, say, 10 billion
years, will not affect computation. Fusion will still occur, stars will
still burn, sunshine will still produce heat. And so on.
