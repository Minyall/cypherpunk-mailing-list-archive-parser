Of course, in my opinion the "The State currently exists" observation is  a 
problem, but I believe it's a solvable one!

Even better would be to simply stop the state from collecting the records in 
the first place, right?

Perhaps the better question is, "Can this be done _WITH_ legislation?!?"  
Legislation, by its very nature, tends to serve the interests of the 
government first, and possibly some of the citizenry trailing a bit behind.  
Remember the saying, "When the only tool you have is a hammer, you treat 
every problem as if it were a nail."  "Solving" the problem by legislation 
inherently tries to convert actions into crimes, or at least punishable 
activities.  Needless to say, it won't be GOVERNMENT people who get jailed 
or dissuaded.

A market and technology-based solution to the problem inherently involves 
cooperation, rather than confrontation, because the market has no inherent 
way to coerce people into acting
