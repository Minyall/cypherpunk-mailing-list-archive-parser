When I used to read the list over hks.net (still down, eh?) I would 
change my name (and sometimes address, for quasi-anonymity) with no 
problems... you just have to do that *before* you try to reply.

(Free)Agent newsreader will let you do that as part of the reply as well. 
It'll still show the path and machine that sent news, but it allows 
you to change From:, Reply-To: and Sender: fields.
