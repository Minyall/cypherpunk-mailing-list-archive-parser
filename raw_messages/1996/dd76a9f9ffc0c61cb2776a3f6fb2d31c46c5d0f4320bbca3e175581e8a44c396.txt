Apparently, a fire underneath one of the main towers on the CA-OR border 
was the cause of the problem.  Now that may not sound like too much, but 
the lines were carrying at least 3000Mw of electricity, enough "to power 
3-1/2 Seattles for a day" (quote from local newspaper).  My guess is that 
when there is a problem involving that much power with no place to go, 
the safety systems shut everything down to prevent damage.
