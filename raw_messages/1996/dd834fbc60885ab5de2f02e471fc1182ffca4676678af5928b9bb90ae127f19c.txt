They can of course outlaw possession and distribution of code not legal to
import into the U.S., regardless of whether they can find out who imported
it.

Imagine your reasoning modified to cover a very relevant current law:

Origninal:

"Redistribution of this software would have to be legal, if for no other
reason than nobody could prove it was imported illegally."

Modified Version:

"Redistribution of narcotics and other drugs would have to be legal, if for
no other reason than nobody could prove they were imported illegally."
