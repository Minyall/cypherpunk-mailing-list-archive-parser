I believe Jeff Cooper calls it "Hoplophobia - (1) An irrational fear of tools.
(2) By extension, an irrational fear of weapons or things which may be used
as weapons."

" Hoplophobia is, after all, not a reasoned position, but rather a mental
aberration. Being basically emotional, it is a feeling rather than an
examined forensic position. " J Cooper.
