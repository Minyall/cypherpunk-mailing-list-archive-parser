Huh? Oh you mean Applied Crypto 2. I was asking about Puzzle Palace 2 by 
Bamford, which I saw listed in AC2's bibliography. Can't seem to find it.
I was just wondering if it's worth ordering. (Maybe I wasn't clear in my 
last msg.) 

Btw, anyone know what else Bamford's been doing since he wrote Puzzle Palace 1,
in '82? Any other books, articles? He's a Washington lawyer, right? I 
hear the new edition has a collaborating author; anything on him? Curious.

TIA.
