For the web-impared interested in complaining to the SEC about the
twits who keep sending us "big invenstment secrets," I submit the
following, from http://www.sec.gov/consumer/seefraud.htm

Seen a Potential On-Line Fraud?
Tell Us About It!

We want to hear about securities fraud appearing on-line, by telephone or in the mail. The specialists in the SEC's
Office of Investor Education and Assistance can also answer your questions or help you to try to resolve your
complaints. 

You can reach the SEC by calling (202) 942-7040 or by visiting our web site at www.sec.gov. Look for our e-mail
address, which will appear shortly. 

You can also write to: 

     Securities and Exchange Commission
     Office of Investor Education & Assistance
     450 Fifth Street, N.W. Mail Stop 11-2
     Washington, D.C. 20549 

If you have seen a potential on-line investment fraud, call the SEC's Internet Fraud Hotline at (202) 942-4647. 

To reach your state securities regulator, check our state government section, in your phone book, or call the North
American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA), Inc. at (202) 737-0900
