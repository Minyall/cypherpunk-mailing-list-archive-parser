I'm considering the use of PGP for bank operation in central Europe (and yes, also in France, but there -normaly- only for interbank fund transfers).
I have seen the PGP API stuff, but I don't know where and I haven't seen any commentaries by users.
I don't know the current state of the PGP 3.0 effort and the intermediate results, nor the respective relation of PGP API and PGP 3.0 (which has also an API).
Thanks for your advice,
Jean-Paul
