This is what I use:

        tar -c --block-compress --sparse --atime-preserve
--use-compress-program /usr/local/bin/destape  .

and /usr/local/bin/destape looks like this:

        #!/usr/local/bin/bash

        if [ -z "$1" ]
        then
                gzip | /usr/local/bin/des -bE3
        else
                /usr/local/bin/des -bD3 | gzip -d
        fi

I also back up the des/gzip/tar to unencrypted to the start of the tape
too.
