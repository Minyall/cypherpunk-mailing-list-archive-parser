This reminds me of something I read about the race in the '50's and the '60's
as to whether the US or the USSR would launch the first satellite, the first
man in space, etc.

The US claimed that a nation's sovereignty ends a few thousand feet into
the atmosphere, so they had the right to fly the U2 planes at about 20K ft.

The Soviets supposedly kept claiming that everyone's airspace extends many
miles beyond the atmosphere, so if any US spy craft flying above Soviet
territory will be shot at.

Eventually the Soviets launched the first satellite and the first man in
space who, for technical reasons, had to fly through the space which the
USSR formerly recognized as other country's airspace. Then they suddenly
forgot about their claim and didn't even object when US remote sensing
satellites flew over the USSR some years later.
