Preface: Having weathered the storm of personal attacks, I've concluded that
most of what is on this list _right now_ is of insufficient interest to what
I'm currently working on to continue, so I've unsubscribed (there's too much
traffic to let it be). I will see the occasional posts copied to me and
respond, Posts allegedly from me, if not signed, are forgeries until I post
a signed notice that I have rejoined the list.

Thanks for listening;
David

Close. For "designed to prevent" read "not make available from the US", and
for "folk" read "foreigners".

There's no earthly reason the US should assist foreigners in thwarting US
intelligence efforts.

As readers know, I am opposed to mandatory domestic key escrow.
