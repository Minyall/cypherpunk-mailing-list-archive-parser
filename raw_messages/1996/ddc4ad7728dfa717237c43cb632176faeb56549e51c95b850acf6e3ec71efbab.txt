That's the crux of my point.  The spammer's fundamental motivation is money.
People who don't want to receive bulk mailings won't spend money with the
spammers.  However, many spammers don't see it that way.  "What's in it for
me?"  ie. who's gonna pay the spammer for NOT sending his bulk e-mail just
because some folks don't want it.
