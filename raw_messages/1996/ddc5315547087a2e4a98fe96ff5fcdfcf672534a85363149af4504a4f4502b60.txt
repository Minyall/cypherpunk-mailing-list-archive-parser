Supposedly in redlining the bank discriminates based not on the race of the
loan applicants, but on the location.  If they're unwilling to lend money
to buy a house in a "bad neighborhood" at the same interest rate they use
in a "good neighborhood", then chances are that they don't look at the
identify (race, income, etc) of the customers - only at the address.

I hope you're not suggesting that a bank should accept a house as collateral
without knowing there that house is. :-)
