The only problem I see with this approach (from the government's
perspective, and assuming that the only state interest is in immigration
control -- you can all stop laughing now) is that the government can't
revoke citizenship. There are several reasons they might want to do this:
an erroneous or fraudulent application, a political-driven expulsion, or a
resident-driven renunciation of citizenship (usually for tax/inheritance
reasons).

Of course, the real reason they want this proof of residency is for work
authorization, which means income tax, which means database. And heck,
since we already have a database, why not track child molesters and
deadbeat dads the same way. Or anyone else we don't like, for that matter.

The replacement of income tax with sales and real estate taxes -- despite
the fact that such a move would be incredibly regressive -- would be a
very good thing for freedom.
