A collegue of mine is taking a position where he will be recommending
secure communications technologies to various big money clients.

He asked me if I could drum up some contacts for him.

Do you have a fact sheet on Piermont I might give to him?

He could be in a position to generate significant business for a
consulting firm which really knew the ins and outs of strong encryption.

I'd also be interested for my own reasons.
