Geezzzz, here we go....

One of the blessings of c'punks was that it was not 'worthy' of the time
of several professional flame-baiters who are fairly well-known on the
'Net, in particular, David Sternlight.  Now, however, that seems to have
changed.  If everyone thought things were weird around here with
Detweiler, just wait until you see DS's stuff....

Aside from the now-infamous "Who is David Sternlight, REALLY?" and "Who
does Sternlight REALLY work for" multi-generational, gigabyte-consuming,
bandwidth-devastating threads [search usenet archives for several YEARS
worth of traffic on these subjects] that have already graced the Internet
(note that Sternlight actually had his OWN usenet newsgroup), there's the
fear that DS will start a flame thrower exchange with anyone, regardless
of topic.  AND, he'll keep posting about it.  Relentlessly. 

After seeing what happened to sci.crypt (it was essentially wrecked for
anyone without killfile capability), I'd caution the c'punkers
(particularly the more vocal ones) to NOT TAKE THE BAIT.  It's only
natural that Perry, Jim, and the others be the first to take exception
to DS's stuff.  It's probably only going to get worse as DS is the
consummate flame king and he is at least as relentless as Detweiler.

God bless 'em, but it's time to add another line to the c'punks net.loon
warning file.
