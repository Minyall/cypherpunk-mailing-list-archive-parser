Could be several things.  The IRS has (as of my visit in early 1996, anyway) adopted
the "hitman" technique of auditing, with specific per-hour $ goals, like traffic cops.

I'd guess at three things here.  1) Anyone hawking a product or engaging in barter, etc.
who is not paying the maximum tax, and  2) Studying certain aspects of net behavior or
usage for tax purposes, and  3) Trolling for fraud.
