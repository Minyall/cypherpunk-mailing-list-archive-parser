	Ya know... This is getting old! It seems like RSA Data
Security can't control their own site. It only seems like yesterday
(actually about 2 years ago) that another one of their "RC" algorithms
was published to the Usenet thru anonymous remailers. Can't they
secure their own site against break-ins? If they want to be the
prima-donna site for encryption with all of the "copy-written" crypto,
you would think that they could protect their own resources better.
