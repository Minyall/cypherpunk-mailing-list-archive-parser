The new federal parole guidelines that will ban some cons from the nets
will also ban them from posessing crypto software which will also make
virtually any computer use impossible.  "Main Justice" does say that with
the Klinton Admins plans for universal access counter this proposal since
the cons will have access at schools, libraries, etc. (not to mention
Internet Cafes).
