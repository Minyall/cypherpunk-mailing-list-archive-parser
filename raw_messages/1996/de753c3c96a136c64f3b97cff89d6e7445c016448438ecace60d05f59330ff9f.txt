Hmm.  Sarcasm?  Cannot definitively say, but I'll guess it is.

Assuming you are accusing me of such, you should probably point out
specifically where I said such a thing.  (If I did, it would be bad
grammar or some such, and I would certainly retract it.)

You might be missing the mark too, but I thought the subject was
giving a gun to every child who enters school, not YOURs or SOME
EXPERT 6 YEAR OLD's special case.

Yes, if every child was truly an exemplary God-fearing Christian,
I would probably have fewer objections to giving every child a
gun.  After all, they would NEVER use it in a fit of rage or
jealousy or any such sins ...  Right?

Death is permanent.  A child is prone to accidents.  Maybe those
of you who are just too "special" and "talented" don't need such
paternalistic frameworks, but I know my child cannot tell right
from wrong, good from bad.  He will get better over time.  But I
don't want another child to pay for my son's less than full
maturity by getting shot.
