Exactly my point.  I believe interactions between individuals have 
far more to do with our (dis)inclinations towards brutal behavior 
that governments do.  Governments have little influence over human 
attitudes.

I agree, actually.  I don't see an increase in these types of crimes 
because of the existence of anonymous payment methods.  What TCM and 
others have argued is that getting away with these crimes will be 
much easier due to anonymous payment schemes.

I would argue that anonymous payment protocols are not necessarily 
any easier for the foolish criminal to fuck up than current methods 
of payment for, ahem, services rendered.

Only if untraceable anonymous digital cash becomes a ubiquitous 
(and easy-to-utilize) standard will such crimes be more difficult to 
catch.  (TCMay says only one such system is necessary.  I disagree 
and will get back to this point in a later message)

I think you're reading a little more into it than is there, but 
that's your perogative.

I'm not in favor of legal mechanisms.  I think social mechanisms are 
all but inevitable. (more on this later) I don't think it's necessary 
or even desirable to build in orwellian schemes.  

The government's desire to limit untracability has far more to do 
with taxation than the four horsemen scenario.  Yes, I've heard of 
memes.
