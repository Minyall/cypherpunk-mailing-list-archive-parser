Umm, isn't that "Time flies *but* aeroplanes crash"?

Subhumans (the Brits).  12" EP of the same name.  Bluurg records.

But, yes, my vague impression is that there is more press coverage
(I get all my news from Auntie Beeb, who hasn't been as vociferous
about it.)  But to most insular American types, terrorism is still a
novelty.

BTW, I wouldn't say that officials discounted terrorism -- you can bet
Kallstrom is sure hoping that this isn't "just an accident"!
