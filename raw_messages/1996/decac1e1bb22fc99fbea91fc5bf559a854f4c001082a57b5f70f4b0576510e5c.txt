Yikes!  Don't lend it the credibility of calling it "proposed".
Someone might think you're serious.  "Suggested" is as far as I'd go.

Anyway, you computer creates the IP packet, but then sends it to your
ISP's router.  That router *always* makes changes to the packet header
because it must decrement the time-to-live field and recompute the
header checksum.  The ISP's router software would (in the scenario I
suggested, but deplore), based on to whom it's connected, set the
drivers licence flag as it sees fit.  When a PPP account of a "minor"
sends a packet, the router always inserts "minor".  When the account of
an adult sends it, it inserts "adult".  When the account of a partner
who has contractually accepted liability for the flag's setting sends a
packet, it leaves it alone.
