Could you elaborate ?  I haven't heard of any known interaction
effects between a strong encryption algorithm and a distinct strong digital
signature algorithm (with or without distinct keys), although such an effect
is certainly conceivable. 

Using "bare" RSA for both encryption and signing, problems can of course arise 
because signing with a private key amounts to decrypting the plaintext to be
signed with that key. Thus you can be tricked into decrypting some
ciphertext by signing it. But this is the sort of problem addressed by the 
crypto object format standards like PKCS. No-one recommends using "bare" RSA.

Actually, using separate keys for signing and encrypting is another way to
avoid this issue.

(I disagree)
