And here's another data point I learned at CFP.

<HEARSAY>
Kawika Daguio (Federal Representative, Regulatory & Trust Affairs, American
Bankers Association) mentioned that the Stamp Payments Act (or something
like that) forbids "open" currencies in amounts less than $1.  It seems
certain casinos have been hit with this, when other businesses in the
area started accepting their chips as "real" money.
It seemed to me that he thought that ecash (Digicash's version) wouldn't
fly in the US.
