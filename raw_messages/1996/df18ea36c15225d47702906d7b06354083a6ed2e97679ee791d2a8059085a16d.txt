I keep hearing references to 'proxies' as a method of anonymity.  The only information that I've been able to find, deals with firewalls on networked systems.

Are 'proxies' applicable to personal PCs using browsers, such as Netscape?

Would appreciate any info or leads to information sources.

Thanks in advance,
