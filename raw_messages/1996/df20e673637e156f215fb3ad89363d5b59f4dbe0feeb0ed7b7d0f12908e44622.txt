     I pledge allegience to this flag and THE REPUBLIC for which it stands.

     REPUBLIC, GET IT? Rule by LAW as opposed to the tyranny of STUPIDITY 
called democracy.
     ITAR _may_ be based on laws passed by congress, but since the NSA has
yet to try the ITAR in court, and only uses it to threaten business with,
we don't know how the courts will interpret these rules, much less the laws
that give UNELECTED OFFICIALS the authority to make LAWS. 

    Yer an idiot. Not just for what you wrote above, but for just about 
everything you've said since you started posting. I had never read any 
of your writings before, and they seemed rational so I was inclined to 
give you a chance, even tho' I disagreed with you. 

    You have proben yourself to be a facist, and AFAIC there is only 1 
use for a facist. Ballistic testing.

     Yes, I do know what a facist is, and no, I am not comparing you to
The leader of Germany during WWII.
