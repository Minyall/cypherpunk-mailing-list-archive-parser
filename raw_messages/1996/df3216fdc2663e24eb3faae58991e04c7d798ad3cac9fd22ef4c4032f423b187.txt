Yes, subject says it all. anon.penet.fi was a whole lot worse than
cypherpunks remailers. It provided clueless users with no real security,
because it stored return addresses and did not use chaining and
encryption.

Maybe closing of anon.penet.fi will spur real interest from the unwashed
alt.sex.* masses to the truly secure remailers.
