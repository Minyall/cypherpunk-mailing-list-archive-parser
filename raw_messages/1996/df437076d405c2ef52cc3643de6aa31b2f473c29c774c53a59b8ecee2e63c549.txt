I'm glad to report that a large number of people have now taken the
pledge not to reply to David Sternlight's posts.

Remember, replying to David almost never serves any useful purpose --
he is almost totally incapable of admitting he is wrong, and almost
everyone disagrees with him already. By replying to him, you simply
continue to encourage him to fill the mailing list with junk.

Don't feed the Sternlight. Take the pledge.

Perry
