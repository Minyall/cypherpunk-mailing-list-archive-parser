Since corrupt officials are likely to have more anonymous cash that
phreedom phighters, guess who will win.

Also, think about this: lots of people have someone they'd like
to assassinate but do not actually do it because of lack of anonymity
and associated hassles (like dealing with assassins non-anonymously,
abundance of traces, possible confession of the assassin and so on).
With your assassination clearinghouse these hassles go away. I think it
would present an excellent prospect for reducing the population.

Maybe *that* will help the whales and trees, because of the effect on demand.
