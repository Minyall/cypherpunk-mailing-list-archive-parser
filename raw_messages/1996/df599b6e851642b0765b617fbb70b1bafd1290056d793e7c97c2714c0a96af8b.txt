I got it too.  And since I am a new subscriber, I thought it might be the
normal traffic.  The Welcome msg *did* say the list is high-traffic.  Still,
I was aghast--300 all at once, another 100 just in the last hour.  Is that
typical? (Please forgive such a question from a newcomer to the list.)

I'm just posting this to see if there's something wrong with my mail  filter
- it dumped a ton of messages from this list over the night, and  I'm trying
to figure out why the !@%$# it did that.  Sorry for the  interruption.
