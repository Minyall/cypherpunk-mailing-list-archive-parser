One further note is that some servers insist on having the Client identify
itself as "Mozilla" or some other Big Browser sponsored tag.  And there
may be trademark problems if you try to use one.

I suppose you could do:

Client: Mozilla 30b5 is a trademark of Netscape

and see if it lets you through (much as earlier mouse drivers said "This
is not Copyright 19xx Microsoft" with the copyright notice the correct
displacement in the driver).
