I think it might be.  Many of the D.C. and Virginia rental agencies I
tried had big signs indiciating they didn't accept check/debit cards.
(Note that the minimum age for car rental varies by region too, suggesting
that corporate policy adjusts to the market needs/risks).

Yes, I managed to entirely controvert the "no check card" policy at
Enterprise because the teller was clueless.  Unfortunately, depending on
this kind of thing if you have no credit card can be tricky.
