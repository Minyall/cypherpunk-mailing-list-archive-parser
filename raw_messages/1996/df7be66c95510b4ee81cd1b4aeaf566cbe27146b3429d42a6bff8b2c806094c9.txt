And when this $2 B is defeated by encryption, look for dramatic, drastic,
and draconian restrictions on crypto.

(With the Internet Phone deals--even Intel is entering the market--why are
there no widespread uses of PGP or S/MIME? Yes, I know about about PGPhone,
and also the Nautilus product, but none seem to be used by anyone I know.
Maybe we should spend some time talking about the practical realities of
these tools.)

We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, we know that that ain't allowed.
