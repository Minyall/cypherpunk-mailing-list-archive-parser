    INTERVIEW OF THE PRESIDENT BY TOM BROKAW OF MSNBC
            The Roosevelt Room, July 15, 1996

          MR.  BROKAW:  ....
  You and I have been looking at another question from
the Internet:  Does Chelsea net surf  and,  if  so,  how  do  you
protect  her  from  inappropriate  material?   Does  she  use the
computer pretty handily?

             THE PRESIDENT:  She does.  I  don't  think  she  net
surfs a lot, simply because, at least during the school year, she
has too much homework at night, for several  hours  every  night.
But  she  does  some.  And, honestly, I can't protect her in that
sense because she knows so much more about it than I do.

             But one of the things that we're trying to do  --  I
think  with  the  support  of everyone -- is, first of all, get a
case up to the Supreme Court so that they  can  define  what  the
First  Amendment  requires  us  to  do  and not to do in terms of
legislation here.   And  then  we  need  to  find  some  sort  of
technological fix.

             During the break  you  said  that  Mr.  Gates,  Bill
Gates,  said  that there's at least a possibility of developing a
log --

             MR. BROKAW:  Yes, they've got a  log  built  in  now
that you can go in and check on.

             THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, so the parents can  see  what's
been  called  up.   And,  of course, we're working on this V-chip
with television and with the entertainment industry supporting us
with  the  rating system.  So there probably will be some sort of
technological responses here.  But then parents like me are going
to  have to assume the responsibility of becoming literate enough
with the technology to work with our children and make sure  that
we and they make responsible choices.
