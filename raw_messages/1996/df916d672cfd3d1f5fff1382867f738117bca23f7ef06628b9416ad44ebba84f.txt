The same way the Second Amendment has been turned into a shadow of itself
by creative lawyering.

("The Founders did not mean to include AR-15s and .45 Automatics as "guns,"
as these did not even exist in 1791. Likewise, cellular phones did not
exist in 1791, so the Fourth Amendment could not possibly apply to them.
Have a nice day.")
