Personally, I paid my way through uni...full fees. I took out a loan 
when I developed cancer to pay  for it (as the health insurance was 
not finalised for aproval - so they got out of paying). The few 
months I was unemployed after I left the military because of a 
confict of interests I earned money by doing whatever I could get 
(even though I am an engineer I have worked in a petrol station). So 
why and for what reason sould I have to pay several 10's of thousands 
each year to support others. I have never taken help from the 
govenment, I do not feel I should have to pay as well.
And what am I paying for...to protect the status quo. I believe that 
there is more than enough help for ppl available. They just need to 
get off their butts and work.
