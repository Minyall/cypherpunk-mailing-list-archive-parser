In Siskiyou County, the names of the foreman of the Grand Jury (local) 
are printed in the newspaper on appointment.

You don't need to know the names. Go to the courthouse and ask the deputy 
Marshall to "give the foreman this letter".  I'd have a "straight" 
looking person do it, since the deputy isn't  *required* to assist.

HEck, you could probably just address a letter to "Foreman of Grand Jury, 
Federal Courthouse".
