Be careful, Leahy's bill sucked. I don't classify it as "pro-crypto" at all, 
although if you believed those organizations that initially supported it you'd 
come to that conclusion.  So somebody following your analysis (blindly) 
might have inadvertently embraced a clunker, concluding that supporting 
SOMETHING was important for the reasons you listed.  

And while this may appear to be paranoia, I suspected that that the whole 
reason for the Leahy bill was to get the "criminalization of the use of 
encryption" section on the books, the one truly awful part of the bill.  The 
funny thing is, it almost worked!  Didn't it, EFF?!?


 Burns' bill seems to be at least moderately acceptable, in that it appears 
to remove most restrictions on crypto export.  Further, I don't necessarily 
share your pessimism that these bills won't pass.  Not this year, of course, 
but possibly next year.
