Hey all-

 I was in the local Barnes and Noble Bookstore and I saw a book that
 looked interesting.  It is called The Ultimate Spy Book written by
 H. Keith Melton and it contains a large wealth of information about
 the writing and breaking of cyphers from the time of Queen Elizabeth
 to the NSA.  It is about $30, but it is well worth it...
