I am not sure that I believe this line of reasoning my self, but here goes:

The US government is "owned" by its citizens.  Therefore US citizens should
have a high degree of protection from their government.  However, non-US
citizens do not enjoy this same high standard (not being "owners").  They
perhaps should enjoy a similar standard in relation to their own
governments.

Another way of putting it is that while gentlemen do not read each other's
mail, gentlemen read non-gentlemen's mail.
