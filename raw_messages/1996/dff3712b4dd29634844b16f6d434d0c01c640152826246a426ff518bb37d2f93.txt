Heinlein used a few nyms.  His best stories were published under the 
names Robert Heinlein and Anson Macdonald.  The Heinlein/Macdonald split 
came about because John W. Campbell didn't want it to look like 
_Astounding_ was being dominated by one other, though the quailty of the 
stories was about the same. (All but a couple of dthe Future History 
stories were published under one of these names, but I don't remember 
which).  Heinlein used other nyms for stories of lesser quailty, or 
stories he sold to other markets in genres other than sf.   He created 
one nym to sell off stories that he described as "stinkeroos", and went 
so far as to get a separate PO Box in the name of this nym so that it 
couldn't be associated with Robert Heinlein.
