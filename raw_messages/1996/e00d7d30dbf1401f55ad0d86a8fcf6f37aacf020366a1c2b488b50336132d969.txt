::
        for instance, I read a lot of liberal hogwash lists [know thine
    enemy].  there are lists after lists about lists. sorting out the
    precisely cut and trimmed info is hard --and there is not time to
    read a man who is being paid by the word!  

    good summaries with pointers is essential.

        john provides an extremely valuable service by covering a broad
    spectrum of sources.  since I read others, I am considering using
    the auto-respond features of procmail to do the same.  however, I
    sure wont cover as much ground as john does!

:: The most lazy of us will hardly even light up our browsers
::for a maybe-interesting URL.
::
        unfortunately, that is too true --even when your mail browser 
    will pass the URL to the browser which is often in the background
    anyway.

::The problem is off-topic or quasi-on-topic forwards, including EPIC/EFF
::kind of announcements. 
::
    hard to discern sometimes

::And all forwards would benefit from a personal
::comment by the forwarder (at the beginning of the mail, NOT after the 10
::screens document) where he explains what is interesting cp-wise.

        ABSOLUTELY!  always put your comments and the "pointer" out front 
    --even if you are planning interline comments.
