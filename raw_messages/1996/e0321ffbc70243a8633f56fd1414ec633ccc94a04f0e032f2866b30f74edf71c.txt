The problem with people too used to dictatorships is that they grow
so accustomed to taking those favors and incentives which are dictated to
them that the freedom (and responsibility) of "financial gain" seem like
too much work.

Much easier to just work for food.  "The all-knowing General Pinoriega
would have given us money if we needed it."

Of course the result is an increased dependence on the state.

Market economies which approach true "free market" status provide no
foothold for regulation.  You cannot really have one without the
other.  (Note the coming backlash against free speech and free markets in
the United States).

The free market will ever be the only real path to free speech, because,
in essence, it is free speech.

Free speech does not, however, require that all speech be universally
broadcast to each and every citizen on the planet free of charge.  That's
"subsidized speech."

Consider long and hard if that is the path that you would like to take.
