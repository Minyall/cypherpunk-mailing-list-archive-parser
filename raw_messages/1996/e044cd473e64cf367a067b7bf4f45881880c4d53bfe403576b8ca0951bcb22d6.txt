Talk to your credit card company, explain to them the whole story,
refuse to pay these unauthorized charges. You should get satisfaction.

The moral here is, however, that nothing beats putting things down on
paper. You SHOULD have sent a letter of cancellation, I'll bet dollars
to donuts that the contract you signed stated that you would send
cancellation notice IN WRITING.
