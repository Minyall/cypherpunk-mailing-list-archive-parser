Exactly. I arrived at the solution the same way. Note that there is another
assumption needed--that the selection of a proposer is by lot at each new
stage. If the ordering of proposers is known in advance, a different
solution results.

A further assumption is that a certainty gain of 1/n of the total sum is
preferred to a 1/n probability of gaining the entire sum and a (1-1/n)
probability of gaining nothing..
