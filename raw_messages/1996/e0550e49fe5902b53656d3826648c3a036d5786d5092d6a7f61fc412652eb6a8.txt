I was wondering about a couple of things regarding the Psion Series 3a 
personal organisers.  (According to the manual, you have them in the USA 
as well! :)

Firstly, anyone know what kind of encryption is done on documents and 
spreadsheets held on it's internal disk?   It only allows a 10 character 
password, and claims to encrypt the whole file.

Secondly, I presume that as the encryption software is apparently 
embedded into the system (ie cannot be extracted), I won't get arrested 
when I wander through US customs next time.

TIA - Dave.
