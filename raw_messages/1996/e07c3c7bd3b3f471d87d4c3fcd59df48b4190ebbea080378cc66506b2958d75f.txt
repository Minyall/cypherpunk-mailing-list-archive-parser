Just as a quick thought - given the prevelance of Web Browsers - has 
anyone considered writing a Java Applet that would could run key space 
searches and factoring in an easily distributed manner.

This would seem to be a 'reasonable' way to gain access to more CPU power 
- even though the Java code would not be as efficient as a native app. 
Perhaps as a supplement to the more 'traditional' methods that have been 
used in the past.

Mark
