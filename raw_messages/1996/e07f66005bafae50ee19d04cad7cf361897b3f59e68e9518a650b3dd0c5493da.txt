Hi,

I just recently downloaded copies of Blowfish & Ghost.

Does anyone have any experiance with these two algorithims?

How do they comare to RSA, DES, 3DES, IDEA ?

I can across a post awhile back that mentioned that they were using Blowfish in
PGPPhone. Can anyone confirm this?

Does anyone know how they are using Blowfish and why?

Thanks,
