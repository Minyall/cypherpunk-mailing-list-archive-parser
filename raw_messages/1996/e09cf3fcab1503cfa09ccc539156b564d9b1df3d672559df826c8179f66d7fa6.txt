Yes, a large and widely distributed message pool would seem to be a way

Yes, I suppose the actual transmission would be robust, if no mistakes 
were made. As you pointed out - if you can make the first hop secure (or

The only problem is that you're the only one turning up w/

there with wider use of ecash ...).
