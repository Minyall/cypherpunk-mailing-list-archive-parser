As I said here before, cypherpunk (and DCSB founder) Peter Cassidy, who did
an article in the last Wired on the Bernstein case, just did a story on the
NSA's involvement in the digital telephony bill in this Sunday's Sacremento
Bee.

Pete says,

> I spoke with an editor at the BEE. The story takes up most of the front
> section of the FORUM section. Headline screams:
> SILENT COUP IN CYBERSPACE
> US Intelligence Agencies Threaten Businesses and Personal Privacy.

Since this story is also supposed to hit the wires, it would be interesting
if it goes anywhere else...

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
