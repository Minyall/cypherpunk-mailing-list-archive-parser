To quote the editors of phrack on this: "Hey, he submitted it and we published it".

If Dimitri wants to deny submission it's up to him. Plenty of people regularly
publish stuff in Phrack using either their real names, or aliases that are
so well connected with their real names as to be inseperable.

Cypherpunks are not hackers, don't confuse the two.
