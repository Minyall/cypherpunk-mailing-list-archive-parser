Oh, I don't think it's impossible or even unlikely that at least some of the
groups lumped together as "contras" were involved in drug smuggling, and I
think it's reasonable to have different views regarding how much money was
involved and who knew what when (my view is very little, and medium). What I
object to are conspiracy theories along the lines of: 

1. The Reagan Administration used the Contras to smuggle crack to the US in
   a deliberate attempt at genocide against Black people. (I heard this a
   lot, though seldom in so many words, on KPFK in the mid-80's; the SJ Merc
   series certainly has this as a subtext.)
2. Clinton was a CIA agent involved in the Contra drug-smuggling CaBaL. He
   was involved in anti-war protests only as a CIA informant. (This is the
   suggestion of the Morris book.)
3. Anything involving the Kennedy assassination, Donna Rice, or Elvis.

4. Anything where vague unsupported asserions are thrown out, followed by
   a Hmmmmm (sorry).
