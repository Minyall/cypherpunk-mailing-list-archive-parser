Why not consider what the consequences will be?  Do you seriously
believe that this will make the government stop enforcing ITAR?  Do you
believe it will make them change the law?  No.  What it will do is make
them remove our permission to distribute this stuff.

As for your claim that not breaking the law supports it, I must remind
you that Jim Barksdale has testified before congress on several
occasions about how braindead ITAR is.  Just because we don't fight it
the way you want us to doesn't mean we support it.

A lot of people have been downloading the Mac version.  What was the
problem you were having?  If you're not seeing the NoCookie problem,
please try again.  I think we've got most of the other problems licked.
The Solaris versions are for Sparc.

You are wrong.  We are worried that our permission to provide these
products will be withdrawn.  If we could do it legally, we'd let anyone
download it who wants it.  But we can't.
