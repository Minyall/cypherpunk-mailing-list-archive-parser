There is an advisory around where the ISPs say that
they think it's not possible to block urls.

And even if they figure a way out to do this,
this mailing list proves (mirrors) that it's not
possible to stop the flow of information.
But the German Government doesn't seem to even
understand a bit how the inet works.

The Germans. I don't like this evil German bashing.
(which is quite obvios in some mails, although I
think not in this one, but I had to say this)
Some of us (some may say most, I'm not) are quite normal and
there are even some cypherpunks around :)

And as there are lots of ISPs in Germany (as in every
other country) they won't get everyone to resctrict the access
to some pages.
