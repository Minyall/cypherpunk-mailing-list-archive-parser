Then they will get sued by SeaWare saying it conflicts with their trademark

Maybe someone should go into the business of "Trademark Collision
Insurance(tm)".  It seems that no matter what you do, everything(tm) is
trademarked nowadays.  

(TCMAY(tm) and "Cypherpunks(tm)" are a trademark of "Tentacles R Us(tm)", a
division of "Evil Incarnate International(tm)".)
