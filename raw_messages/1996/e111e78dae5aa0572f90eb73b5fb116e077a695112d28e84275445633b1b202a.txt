Hi

Is there anyway of finding the clock speed of the CPU on a Sun workstation?
As far as i know it can be found only by rebooting the machine and using
module-info? And I believe that the module-info does a no-op loop for a
a known number of times and calculates the time taken.

I would like to know if there is anyother way to finding it.

Thanks!

Ashfaq
