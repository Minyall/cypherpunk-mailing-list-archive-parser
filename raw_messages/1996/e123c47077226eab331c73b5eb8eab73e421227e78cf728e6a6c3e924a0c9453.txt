That's very interesting, especially considering Deutsche Bank has signed
on to be an ecash mint (http://www.digicash.com/publish/ec_pres5.html)...

I don't get this worry about counterfeiting.  It would seem to be harder to
counterfeit ecash than paper cash (though, admittedly, it would be harder to
track, but it would almost certainly have to be an "inside job").  Maybe
the journalists are just misinformed, or possibly the banking people?
