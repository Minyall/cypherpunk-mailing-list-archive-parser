What is the use of 128-bit server, as there are still no 128-bit WWW
clients freely available in Europe? (Workhorse has 128-bit SSL, but the
client is still far from perfect).

Of course I believe that SSL server with source code available is still
much more secure, as your own consultants can have a look at the code,
that's why I personally would rate Apache-SSL higher than commercial
applications like Thawte consulting Sioux.
