   The Wash Post today reports on a new study of U.S. arms 
   export policy, presented to the White House on Friday, and 
   to be formally released next week. It primarily addresses 
   killing-type arms and proposes greater U.S. restraint 
   of export of advanced armaments rather than promotion to 
   buttress the defense industry. 
 
   One of its recommendations is to form all regulations 
   governing arms exports and intelligence-gathering into 
   "single, coherent framework." 
 
   If anyone has seen this report, does it address crypto 
   export? 
 
   A copy by E-mail or fax (to 212-799-4003) would be 
   appreciated.
