    They would get your phone number and information on their bill 
regardless of whether they have ANI/CID/etc.  That comes from the phone 
company and not from their own systems.

    Not necessarily.  I get charged a flat 13 cents a minute for all 
connects to my 800 number, regardless of where they are calling from.

    There is a big difference, and change in the way they could operate 
their records, between having instant access to your number when you call 
or having access to it when they receive the telco bill at the end of the 
month.
