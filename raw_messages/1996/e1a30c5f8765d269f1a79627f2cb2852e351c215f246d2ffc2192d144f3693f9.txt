	Of course if they're simply denying all traffic to a given
network, a different port isn't going to make any difference. :)

	I think the restriction on port 79 (the finger daemon port)
was because there still are a lot of fingerd's with buffer overrun
holes and it was just too easy to use netscape to exploit them.  Jeff
or another of the people from NS probably can give the full explanation.
