You're actually quoting from an inspired bit of trolling. See my recent
message: "Ernst Zundel impersonator on Usenet"

Whatever he is, Zundel is not an anti-Nazi. He's perhaps the world's
leading holocaust revisionist, and is now living in Canada. He's
well-known to our northern neighbors; his trial for speech crimes went
all the way to the Canadian Supreme Court. His web site is at:

       http://www.webcom.com/~ezundel/english/

But I agree with your basic point. For trying to censor the Internet,
German prosecutors are amazingly ignorant idiots.
