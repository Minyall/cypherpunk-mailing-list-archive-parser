Does anyone have a pointer to any good discussions on how to build programs
with encrypted license keys?  ftp.csua.berkeley.edu used to have such a file
(/pub/cypherpunks/cryptanalysis/license.asc.gz), but the archive hasn't
been accessible for a few days.  Although I remember this to be mostly about 
how to crack such schemes, it has lots of useful information about how they
are designed in the first place.

	Thanks,
	  David
