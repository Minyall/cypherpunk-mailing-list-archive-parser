-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

This message is sent from an evaluation version of FTP OnNet32 2.0, which has PGP-
compatible encryption built-in.

This software is distributed from http://www.ftp.com/mkt_info/onnet32/mail/mail_dl.htm
which doesn't have a hell of a lot as technical enforcement of ITAR goes.

You may download the software through the Anonymizer, www.anonymizer.com,  if you
wish.

Unfuckingbelievable.

By the way, encrypting and decrypting large messages with OnNet is about 10 times
faster than with Private Idaho/PGP for DOS on my P6-200 running NT 3.51. The
user interface is pretty good, too.

Somebody pinch me.
