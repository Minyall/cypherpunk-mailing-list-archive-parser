			What is a toad machine? 

In the spirit of John's evolutionary programming post, I submit that
cypherpunks and all its components (on topic posts, jya's news reports, sheer
paranoia, clueless newbies wanting to join or leave, Klaus! VFP, flamewars, 
perryflames...) constitute a dynamic and evolving optimizing computational 
(enough fuzzy words for you?) system of which we are the calculators. 

Think of toad.com as an input/output box to interface us cells(not to 
mention a strange attractor for every cook on the net). We have a 
topic (or goal) of cryptography and anonymity, codewriters to give us 
something other than politics to talk about, a persistent random noise 
function to increase diversity, and Perry as a factor of noise limitation.
Obviously massively parallel. Is this a genetic algorithm, a semantic net,
or some other model? I dunno. As I hear the *plonking* sound of killfiles 
closing in on me and my inane post, I wonder...where will it go?
A topic for further study.
