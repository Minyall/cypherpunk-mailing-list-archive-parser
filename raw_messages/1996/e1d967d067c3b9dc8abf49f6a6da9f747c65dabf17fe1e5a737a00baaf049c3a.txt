This kind of thing disgusts me.  We already know 512-bit keys are weak.  As
I recall, I was told that 512 bit keys could be cracked in 20,000
MIPS-years.  If the ballpark formula holds that adding 10 bits doubles the
security, that merely means that 640 bits is 2**(128/10) or 8000 times
strong.  While obviously better than 512, it is not ENOUGH better to make me
confident that this is a long-term secure length.  768 or 1024 bits should
be considered the minimum.  A deliberate design of 640 bits makes it look
like it's intended to be crackable in 5-10 years, much as DES was suspected
of a similar design decision in limiting its keylength to 56 bits.
