BWAHAHAHA!!!

Here's a URL for a *highly sympathetic* piece on Weaver that complains
that, "I will be happier when the press stops demonizing Weaver -- in
subtle and not so subtle ways -- in news stories and editorials. He is
referred to so consistently as "White Separatist Randall Weaver" that one
would be forgiven for assuming that his parents gave him the first name
"White,"  while "Separatist" was some old family name handed down from his
maternal aunt":

Here are some *highly sympathetic* URLs that mention that Weaver was a
white separatist/Aryan Nations wacko:

A slightly more balanced piece from the New York Times:

 http://eagle.tamu.edu/~carlp/Liberty/Weaver.Case.NYT.html

FWIW, the Anti-Defamation League, which I am *well aware* has said sily
things about militias and skinheads in the past, mentions Weaver in this
report:

I have also heard Weaver cited quite favorably on the Stormfront list,
which has repudiated Timothy McVeigh because his friend Terry Nichols has
a Filipino wife. This makes McVeigh a Race Traitor by association, of
course.
