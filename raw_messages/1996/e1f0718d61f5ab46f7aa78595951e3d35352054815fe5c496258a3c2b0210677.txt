Digital watermark protects copyright

Scientists at the NEC Research Institute in Princeton
believe they have developed "a fundamental enabling
technology" for protecting the copyright of images and
music on the Internet.

They have developed a secure method of producing a
digital watermark, an invisible code that identifies the
owner, which is permanently embedded in the multimedia
data.

Attempts to remove the watermark would be virtually
impossible without degrading the image quality. Moreover,
counterfeiting would be almost impossible, says NEC. the
Japanese electronics company.

The digital watermark is designed to be used in
conjunction with cryptography, which limits access to
encrypted data to legitimate users.
