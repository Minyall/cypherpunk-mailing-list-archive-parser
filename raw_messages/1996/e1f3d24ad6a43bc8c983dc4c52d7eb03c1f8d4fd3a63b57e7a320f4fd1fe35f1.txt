This is not something that will wind up being used by the average person at
home.  It will be used by the small businessman/woman who needs to do some
credit card transactions on-line.

The media is so hyped on this "credit card on the net" train of thought that
any credit card encryption scheme will be presented as if it is for the home
user.  Just another case of the media not understanding the technology they
are reporting on...
