These are important, and damaging changes to the regulations.  My
thanks to Lucky for pointing them out.

Previously, authentication technologies, signatures and integrity
checkers had specific exemptions.

I suggest those journalists who lurk here call companies like Digital
Pathways, McAffee, Symantec, and see if they are aware of these
proposed changes.
