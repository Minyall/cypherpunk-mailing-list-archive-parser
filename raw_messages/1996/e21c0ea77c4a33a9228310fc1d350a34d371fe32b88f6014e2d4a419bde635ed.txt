    I guess I would have to ask you why you think hackers would be 
interested in these projects in the first place?  Your typical hacker 
would care very little about such a project and in fact may be interested 
in seeing it succeed.  

    However, I do feel that you may have a valid point when switching 
"hackers" to "opponents of the research."  Anyone with an interest in 
preventing or slowing down the progress in such a project would be more 
dangerous in my mind than your average hacker.  

    Preventing that from happening would be necessary if it is decided 
that such a threat truly exists.
