wow, what a ringing endorsement for cryptoanarchy, and quite Mayesque
in its style.

CRYPTOANARCHY!!! GO FOR IT!! IT PROBABLY WON'T BE ANY MORE
BRUTAL THAN THE WORLD IS ALREADY!!!

>So cut the crap and go ahead and argue for or against that thesis.

the cryptoanarchy thesis IS crap. everyone with a few brain cells to rub 
together is capable of seeing through this machiavellian dystopian trash
masquerading as a rational political philosophy.

anyone heard of "memes"? cryptoanarchy is a virus of weak minds without
any defense mechanisms. the cpunk list is the principal vector..

I'll be sure to check that out. I certainly wouldn't want to prejudge

assassinations, etc.
