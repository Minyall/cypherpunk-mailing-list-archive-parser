Count me in:
Good reason to get the XT (!!!!!!) and the 12Mhz Vendex286 out of the garage ... 
We can throw in the Mac too if the code's portable.
And the 486-100.
And you can have McArthur, the P-133, after bedtime.
And the 486-20 portable, why not?
I'm also available for assembler coding/optimizing on a limited basis.
Excellent project!
