OK, you put off the list.

In the event your are asking to be unsubscribed, surely you must know by
now that instructions for doing this are posted on a regular basis.

Alas, those who most need the instructions are the least likely to notice
such instructions, either here or in the orginal sign-on message they
received.

The clueless are doomed to wander cyberspace forever, asking those they
meet to unsusribe them.
