Today at the IETF DNSSEC working group, the group reached consensus to send
the last of their batch of drafts for publication as a RFC.  This action
breaks the logjam and will allow DNSSEC deployment to proceed.

John Gillmore was given a round of applause because he, "Kicked our butts
to get this thing out fast."  He was the only person so honored.
