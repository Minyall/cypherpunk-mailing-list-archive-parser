Yes, Dale is missing something, not the other way around.

(a) What John did was NOT censorship.  Dale's sloppy choice of 
    language to the contrary notwithstanding.

(b) Nobody on this list gave up any freedom.  And we are still 
    the beneficiaries of John's largesse, not his victims.

(c) Freedom has been defended not limited.  If Dimitri or even
    a majority of Cypherpunks could overrule Johns control of
    his own resources, then there would have been a loss of
    freedom with dangerous implications for us all. 

Would Dale be so tolerant if Dimitri were loudly using abusive
language towards Dale's mother and others in her own livingroom?  
Would he accuse her of censorship if she asked Dimitri to leave?  
What would he say if she kicked Dimitri out?  Enquiring minds
want to know.
