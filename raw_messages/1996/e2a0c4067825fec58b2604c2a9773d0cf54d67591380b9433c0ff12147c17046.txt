Sure something's fishy. Look at the technological capabilities they
have, and we're not keeping up with them. One example:

L.A. riots, 1992. 6,500 or so fires, unknown arsonist(s). But very
convenient for clearing certain properties if you're putting in a new
freeway or subway tunnel, and you don't want to have to fight with all
the riffraff who might be resistant to getting up and moving.

So how do you light all those fires? Do it the hard way - plant the
stuff (6,000-plus times!) and hope nobody catches your guys, or light
'em up from satellites, using "new experimental" focused energy. Gosh,
Mr. Bill, would they do that? Guess it depends on what you're willing to
believe. Remember what Tom Wolfe wrote about? "The reason the folks on
the East Coast (circa 1700's) were such easy victims for the pirates was
the fact that they couldn't comprehend just how vicious and ruthless the
pirates really were." (quote approximate).
