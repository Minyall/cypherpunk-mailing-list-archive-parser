I would have suggested even being as nice as "We'll do the same as MIT
does with PGP's distrobution, or RSA does with RSAREF (just so you'll
know, RSA's FTP basicly has a readme file that says "the files in subdir
of a dir thats -r+x to you, so if you're a citizen go to
dist/usaRANDOM_NUMBER_HERE", thats it).  Then make them explain why
Netscape should be any different.

Something which has to be done sometime, sooner preferably.
