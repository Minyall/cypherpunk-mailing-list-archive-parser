Did y'all see the NBC (I think, got this from a friend) ad for the new
monitoring system for cars?  It's based apparently on the lo-jac 
(spelling unsure) technology, but expanded so the monitor can locate the 
car anytime immediately, and can determine all car statuses such as 
whether the engine is on (and the monitor can kill that), how much gas 
is in the car, whether the windows are up, roof up, everything 
basically.  So if they want to detain somebody, they turn off the 
engine, put the windows up, lock the doors, and have someone come and 
get you (you're locked in until they get there, see).

BTW, this is a reality now.  This was an ad for a current service.
This apparently is part of the reason why all cars now are moving in the 
direction of more electronic features, all of which can be put under 
centralized control.
