I don't think it has to do with complacency.  US support for "dissidents and
revolutionaries" was definitely not based on revolutionaryism, nor on
"cold-war" policy support for democracy, as Noam Chomsky likes to drill into
our heads over and over.

I know that Intel has succeeded in forcing the "Linux Inside" logo and stickers
off the net on threats of trademark infringement suits.  I have a feeling "Big
Brother Inside" would make them even more upset.
