   4-15-96, W$U:

   "RSA Data May Be Sold in Stock Deal."

   Security Dynamics Technolgies, Inc. is in talks to buy
   closely held RSA Data Security Inc., the dominant supplier
   of privacy technology for the Internet, for stock valued at
   about $200 million.

   Industry executives said Security Dynamics may hope to
   combine its proprietary technology with standard encryption
   software from RSA, which could yield products that can be
   used with a broader array of computer products.

   Some of RSA's partners may be taken aback, since few are
   familiar with relatively obscure Security Dynamics.

   The largest single RSA shareholder is Addison Fischer,
   founder of a Florida security-products concern called
   Fischer International.
