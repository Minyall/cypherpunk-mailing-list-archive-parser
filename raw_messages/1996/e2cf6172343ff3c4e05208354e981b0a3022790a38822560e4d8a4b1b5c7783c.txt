Agreed completely.  I didn't mean to imply that the author was
malicious, merely that it well-illustrated the "social engineering"
approach to getting users to run untrusted code.  What I was saying is
that someone who *was* malicious could have used the same approach as
the attack vector for getting our credit card snooper (or other nasty
code) onto lots of consumer machines.  This came up, in the discussion,
because most people on this list seem to believe (correctly, I think)
that the hardest part of the attack we outlined is the initial infection
vector.  -- Nathanielx
