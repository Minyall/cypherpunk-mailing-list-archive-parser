Thats RC4, and it isn't neccessarily better than RC4, especially if
the RC4 key length is reasonable. No one really knows the strength of RC4.

I'd guess that anyone who consideres their messages to be worth more
than a few hundred bucks a pop has cause to worry, because thats the
upper limit on the cost of cracking DES keys these days.

I'd say it is unsuitable for anything approaching a valued corporate
secret today. Personal use? Well, the threat model there is all
important. Certainly your cousin can't crack DES keys -- yet.

DES should not be recertified. I have no opinions on what the
government will do.
