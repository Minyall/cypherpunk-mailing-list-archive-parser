I studied the "imperfect shuffle" thing in my Randomized Algorithms class
last year.  If I remember correctly, an "imperfect shuffle" is something like
this:

Cut the deck into two piles, left and right.  The number of cards in
(say) the left pile is distributed binomially.

Drop one card at a time to form the new deck.  A card is dropped from the
left or right pile, with probability proportional to the number of cards
remaining in that pile.
