I found today Netscape Navigator 3.0 AKA Netscape Navigator Atlas 
available for download from Netscape. Things of interest for this list 
are client or personal certificates, have a look at Options->Security. I 
do not have a WWW server with client certificate support right now, so I 
can't tell if it is actually implemented in the beta.
