Cypherpunks,

   This is to announce the general opening of the cypherpunk Web chat
server. It is at:

      http://kiwi.cs.berkeley.edu:5080/

   For added privacy, there is an SSL version at:

      https://kiwi.cs.berkeley.edu:4433/

   I wrote this server to experiment with asynchronous stream
transformation programming techniques, and for fun. I hope it is of
some benefit to the cypherpunks community.

   Enjoy!

Raph
