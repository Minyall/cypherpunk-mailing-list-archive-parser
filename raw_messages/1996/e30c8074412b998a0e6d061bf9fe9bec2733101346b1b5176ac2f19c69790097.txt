I agree with you to this point... Personally, I don't encrypt or even sign
anything I send out, unless there is a reason to. For most of the mail I
send out, I don't care if third parties read it, and most of it is so   
unimportant that if it were altered (highly unlikely) I wouldn't care. In
fact, I can't recall the last time I encrypted a message (but I've signed
a couple recently).

Now that's just plain un-cypherpunk of you. If people want to use PGP, let
them use PGP! There are so many scripts etc. out there to make using PGP
almost transparent, so decrypting your mail shouldn't be any harder than  
pressing a couple keys and typing in your passphrase. (I know, the
passphrase is the killer.)

Whatever happened to "Cypherpunks write code" and getting crypto out
there? It's not enough for it to just be out there, people have to feel
free to use it. Making your pgp key "no longer very accessible" doesn't
exactly support that goal.


Sorry if this is the 1001st reply you recieve.
