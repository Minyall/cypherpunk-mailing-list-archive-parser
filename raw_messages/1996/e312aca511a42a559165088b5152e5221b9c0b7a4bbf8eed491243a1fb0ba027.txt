1) I strongly suggest that SSL is *not* in its current form the right
   technology, because internet phone type tools probably use UDP, not
   TCP.
2) I strongly hope that Netscape tries to move the product towards
   standards based mechanisms like the IETF's RTP protocol, which are
   in widespread use, rather than pushing yet more proprietary
   systems. Proprietary is bad in this instance. I believe, by the
   way, that several existing RTP implementations have encryption in
   them.
