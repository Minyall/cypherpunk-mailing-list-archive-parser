= 	Does anyone have some code that will search a dictionary, and
= tell me *quickly* if an arbitrary chunk of text is in the dictionary?
= Pre-indexing steps are fine, as is using big chunks of disk for hash
= tables.  The point of course, is to check arbitrary possible plaintext
= that a test decryption produces.
= 

	for this purpose, the OLD unix code starting with V6 20 years ago has a speller with  
a fairly comprehensive dictionary.  The code is small. about 15 years ago I broke it out and  
rewrote it as linkable libraries to handle multiple dictionaries. I know I have the code  
somewhere --probably on MIPS 2000 tape or Sun 3 tape...  the code also contains excellent  
prefix/suffix codes, etc.  I do not remember spending a great deal of time doing the  
conversion, and it was straighforward to convert it to a callable library (or even a .dll).
