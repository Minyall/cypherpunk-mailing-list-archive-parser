Neat idea, but it might be hard to get many users to understand the
interface.  I'm surprised no one's mentioned that this week's beta of
Netscape Navigator (3.0b5, available in U.S. or export strength) has a
configuration option that let's you see an alert box before your browser
accepts a cookie.  It's a little hard to find...  (Note to Jeff W. or
other Netscape folks:  maybe this should move from Network: Protocols to
Security: General.  Makes more sense to keep all the "Show an Alert
Before" choices in one place.)
