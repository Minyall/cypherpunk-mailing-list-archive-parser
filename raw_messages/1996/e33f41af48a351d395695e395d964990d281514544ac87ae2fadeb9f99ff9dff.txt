However Paul Bradley's own rants, such as the recurrent discussion of
"brute force attacks on one-time pads" should convince everyone that
Paul Bradley doesn't know anything about cryptography and is unwilling
to learn.

As a teacher, I'm used to getting a class full of people who don't know
much about the subject at the beginning of the semester and learn a great
deal about it by the end of the semester. If you've never taught, you
can't imagine the feeling of accomplishment and personal satisfaction that
comes with it.

I get occasional assholes who are unwilling and unable to learn. I've never
seen a gang so dense as the "cypherpunks". Not even on Usenet.
