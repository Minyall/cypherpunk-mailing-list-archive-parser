The author of the Iron Mountain Report was interviewed on PBS a few weeks
ago. It was a really over-the-top parody published in 1967.

A quick AltaVista search turns up several references to the Iron Mountain
thing being a hoax, and at least two militia-type conspiracy wacko pages
insisting that it's true.

Every once in a while, I get mail asking whether I really have contacts in
Sendero Luminoso, since a bit of satire I wrote was quoted in the Web
Review (which made no attempt to contact me before printing the satire as
my position). 

Truth is far more fragile than fiction.
