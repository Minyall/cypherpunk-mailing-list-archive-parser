It is generally acceptable to sign a key after seeing a very easily
forgable driver license. Even if you have seen the person before on TV, a
similar looking actor could be substituted, the true person could be
brainwashed, and what if the person has multiple personality disorder?
Should Jim's public key become invalid once John or Alexis have taken over?

The PGP web of trust is a practical solution for an imperfect world. Yes,
someone might have wrapped Uni into a bubble. But that would have to be
some damed good bubble for it to last so many years.
