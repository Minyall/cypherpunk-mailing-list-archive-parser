I disagree, I think AC is a pretty scary book for the kind of people who
need the Snake-Oil FAQ.  I think the primary target audiences are IS 
professionals who are considering integrating crypto into their data
communications and end users who want to send encrypted mail.  Neither
of these groups is going to embrace crypto if you toss them a tome
like AC.  And what is the primary goal here, if not to promote widespread
use of crypto and educate about what makes good crypto good.  We have to
approach the non-believers on their own ground ;)
