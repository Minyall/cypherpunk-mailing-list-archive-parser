You got my position completely backward on this.  I've always supported 
Carl's arguments in the past on this issue (for example see the tread 
"subjective names...").  You may be thinking of what I said about the 
cost of defeating traffic analysis.

The natural state of the Net seems to be a kind of semi-anonymity.  
Trying to push it in either direction (complete traceability or 
anonymity) is costly.
