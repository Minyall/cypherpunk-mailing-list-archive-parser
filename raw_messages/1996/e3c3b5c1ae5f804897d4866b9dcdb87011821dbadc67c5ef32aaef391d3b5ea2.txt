I'm not sure where you got these figures... Hitler had 12 million people
killed in death camps alone, about half of whom were Jews. I've heard estimates
of 100 mil killed during the cultural revolution alone. This doesn't even
begin to include the _war dead, which would be relevant to your thread.

As for historical parallels, these guys were pussies compared to the
Mongol invasions, or for that matter Roman conquests.
