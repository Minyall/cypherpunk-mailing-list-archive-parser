Add in the cost of a bank vault and the ability to provide any key
to an approved law enforcement agency (i.e., one that provides you with
a legitimate search warrant for the key) with a 2 hour response time
(24/7/365). Also, you will have to take in keys as they are provided.

Hmm, the SecureCard (tm) I use to dial into my office system generates
one key per minute. Assume there are a million out there. Assume keys
are 64 bits (8 bytes) + 64 bits of card ID. 16 Mbytes/minute is,
according to the back of my envelope, just under 1/4 mbyte/sec, so each
of those floppy's will fill up pretty quickly, and you'll need a really,
really, big safe to put them in.

Of course, Jim probably knows this.
