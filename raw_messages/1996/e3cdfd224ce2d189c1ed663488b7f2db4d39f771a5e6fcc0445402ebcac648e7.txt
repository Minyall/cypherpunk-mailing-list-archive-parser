   10-27-96. NYP Book Review:

   SECRET AGENCIES
   U.S. Intelligence in a Hostile World.
   By Loch K. Johnson.
   262 pp. New Haven:
   Yale University Press. $30.

      Johnson, formerly assistant to Les Aspin, aims to
      explain what the dozen American intelligence agencies
      actually do with $30 billion a year. Absent the cartoon
      heroics, it's not far from Tom Clancy. Mr. Johnson
      avoids mushy reflections on the human costs of covert
      action -- this book is clearly meant for policy wonks --
      but does note that "the long-term consequences of covert
      actions have seldom been foreseen -- and have often
      proved detrimental to the United States."
