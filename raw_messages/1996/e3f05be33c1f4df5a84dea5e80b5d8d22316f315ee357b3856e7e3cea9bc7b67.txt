Ouch - that's a slightly scary piece of code, though it should
probably work ok if you get the details correct for your operating
system.  It patches the binary to xxxxxx out the strings "frameset" and 
"noframes"; I suppose you could do something similar to kill Java.
I'd been expecting maybe a web proxy that would eat frame requests,
which could be adapted to kill of Javascripts as well.
