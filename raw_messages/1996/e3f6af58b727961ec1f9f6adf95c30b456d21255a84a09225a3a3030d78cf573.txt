True, but as I understand it, there was also a hacking involved: they took
the original software, modified it (what I would also call hacking) and made
it freely available: that is what made the messageries possible. If I'm
using the technical terminology wrong, thanks for the correction.

I'd love to find out exactly what happened.

The protestors of Tiananmen Square will be back. Next time, 
the battle will be fought in cyberspace, where the students 
have the more powerful tanks...
