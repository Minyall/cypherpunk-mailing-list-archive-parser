Once again I'd like to remind everyone that I run a customized filtering
service that drops off a single message in your inbox every day or two,
consisting of what I deem to be the most entertaining and informative posts.
I also remove any non-topical rants that don't include useful information.
This way, your overworked mail filters will never again have to deal with
the Perry and Tim show.

To subscribe, send a polite message to the human behind this address.

Tell your friends 'n neighbors you read this on the evil pornographic Internet
"Where one burns books, one will also burn people eventually." -Heinrich Heine
People and books aren't for burning. No more Alexandrias, Auschwitzs or Wacos.
