I am trying to get some code from <ftp.csua.berkeley.edu:pub/cypherpunks>.
I get:

ftp> get README.MIRRORS
200 PORT command successful.
425 Can't create data socket (128.32.43.51,20): Address already in use.

Any suggestions to how to get eliptic.src and elliptic.doc reported to be
at <ftp.csua.berkeley.edu:pub/cypherpunks/ciphers>? I searched AltaVista.
