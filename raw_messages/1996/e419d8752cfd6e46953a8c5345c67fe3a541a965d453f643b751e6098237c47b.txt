Only stupid guerillas who have forgotten why they got in the biz.

P.S.	Here we have a perfect example of a win-win-win
	situation.  Larry gives himself an attaboy for
	getting my response ("*any* response").  I get
	to poke fun at his rationalization.  The list
	gets another data point on this fruitcake.

P.P.S.	Well, almost perfect.  My friend, Perry, for
	whom I have a great deal of respect will not
	appreciate the noise.  On this point, I have
	agreed to disagree with Perry.  I would still
	gladly take 100 more Perrygrams in exchange 
	for yet another Detweiler rant.  Perry makes
	a great deal of sense.  LD is a loon (oh yeah,
	and a great guerilla warrior...yeah right).
