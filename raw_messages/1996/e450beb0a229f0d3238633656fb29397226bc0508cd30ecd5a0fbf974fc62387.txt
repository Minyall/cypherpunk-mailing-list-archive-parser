I still believe this issue is a prime candidate for testing the 9th and
10th. There is nothing specific in the Constitution which allows the
government to control crypto technology (or any technology actualy) which is
contrary to the 10th. Per the 9th it should be left up to the states or the
people to decide. The current group of issues as mentioned in a post by Tim
May earlier today are all related by these amendments. The precedence of the
legislative and court bodies in this country ignoring these amendments may
be at an end.
