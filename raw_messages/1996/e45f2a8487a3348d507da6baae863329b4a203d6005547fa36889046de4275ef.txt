Of course, you can also do this with CompuServe or any service that uses
phone verification.  I opened my CompuServe account in my True Name but with
the phone number of one of my mail receiving services.  They wanted a
similar callback scheme as above.  I went to my mail receiving service,
called the CIS 800 number and they called me right back.  I was friendly
with my mail services so had no trouble.
