indeed. and Who is doing the most to make sure that the technology
necessary (strong widespread crypto) to make porno on the net a 
non-issue? if the governments of the world weren't such a bunch of 
collective paranoid pricks, i believe we'd be in the process of 
implementing global encryption on the internet and private networks 
as well. 

the public needs to be informed that thus 'failure of technology' is 
completely unnecessary. one of the things that _really_ pisses me off
is that the very same people who are restricting the access of crypto
technology are the ones who are screaming that they need to restrict 
other fundamental freedoms because of the their own stupid policies.

writing this, it is obvious that their policy is entirely reasonable
and in fact necessary if it is your fundamental goal to restrict freedom.
i believe this to be the case when considering governments in general, 
and the u.s. govt. in particular.
