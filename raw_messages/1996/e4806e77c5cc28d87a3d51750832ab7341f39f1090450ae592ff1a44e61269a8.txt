It's this fluorescent goopy stuff, very sticky and tough to handle; I 
hear it smells *awful* too.  They have to use big compressors to pack
it into the laser tubes.  That's one of the reason lasers require so
much power.

Curiously, the popular novelty product "Silly String" is in fact a 
scaled-down "domestic" version of real laser technology.
