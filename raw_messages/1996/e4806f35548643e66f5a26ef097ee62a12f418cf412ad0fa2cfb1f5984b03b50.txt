Excerpts from internet.cypherpunks: 23-Apr-96 Rabbi Hier Testimony by

The Simon Wiesenthal Center and the ADL would love to outlaw anonymity
on the Net. Here's some info on their attempts to restrict online speech:

The EF Canada web pages also detail how the SWC has been trying to get
the Canadian equivalent of the FCC to regulate the Internet. The ACLU
reports at the URL above how the SWC has tried the same trick here in
the U.S.
