Many people put "[NOISE]" in the beginning of the "Subject:" header to filter
out non-crypto related posts.  However, this does not work too well, as many
posts labelled as noise are really quite interesting, and many off-topic posts
are not labelled as such.  This kind of labelling also gets annoying because
it screws up subject threading.

If you really want to kill-file all noise postings, just remember to also
kill replies (lines beginning with "Re: [NOISE]").
