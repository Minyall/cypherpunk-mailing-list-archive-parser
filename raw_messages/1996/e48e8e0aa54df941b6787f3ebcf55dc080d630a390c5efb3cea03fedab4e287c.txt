   One also needs to keep in mind that, contrary to the great gun-packing
debate going on in the conference, not everyone is so quick to vocalize
whether or not they are 'packing'.
   It's similar to asking your opponent in a poker-game what he's 'holding'
when it's showdown time. Would you really trust his or her answer, no 
matter what it was?
  To me, the only real answer, in either situation, is a 'shrug'.
You've got to pay to play.

  I don't know if fuck@yourself.up had any problems as a result of his
escapade, but if he did, I would suspect there is a good chance that
they were caused by one of the more soft-spoken people on the forum.
  I've bounced a lot of wild-frontier bars in my time, and it has
been my experience that it is a truism that,
  "The quiet ones are the guys you don't want to mess with."
