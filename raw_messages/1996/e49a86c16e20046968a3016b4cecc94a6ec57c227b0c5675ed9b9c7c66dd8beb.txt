Sam Kaplin's account @warehouse.mn.org is apparently gone, but his address is
still apparently subscribed to cypherpunks. Some combination of the headers
placed on outgoing list mail by majordomo@toad, and the mail-return header
interpretation policy enforced by the mailer daemon @warehouse, is causing
list mail bounces to get routed to the original message sender. (Arguing over
which site is "at fault" should probably be done somewhere like the 
list-managers list, or much better still, between the sites themselves.)

A week or two ago I forwarded a bounce message to cypherpunks-owner@toad, and
my mail bounced. I asked Eric about it and he told me he hadn't been able to
get into that account for a while (he's the list manager :). Maybe that's been
rectified now. In lieu of that, the most expedient solution to these things
is usually a well-forged unsubscription request to majordomo@toad for the
bouncing address. I think Anonymous claimed to have taken care of that a
couple of days ago, but apparently they didn't succeed.

(Sam K. announced a while back that he would be effectively dropping off the
face of the net....)
