Disregarding the high-falutin' diction, why not?

Certainly, expose everything they do at work, but I don't see that 
tracking someone down personally serves any purpose.

I strongly disagree, and the fact that it's a government is irrelevant. 
Everybody deserves privacy: criminals, government employees, and people
you like as well. Of course, you have the right to investigate any person,
in keeping with the law. Public figures must give up some privacy to help
ensure that they are not involved in blatant (I did say blatant) conflicts
of interest, and they lose certain points in libel cases, but it should 
not go beyond that.
