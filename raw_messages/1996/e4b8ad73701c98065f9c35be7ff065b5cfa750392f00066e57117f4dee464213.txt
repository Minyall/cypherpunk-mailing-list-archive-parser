[Overseas Headquarters brings to mind the French Foreign Legion.]

The Agency does lots of things domestically to support their
'overseas' charter. 

They pay the Skunk Works to design U-2's & Blackbirds.

They run (or did...) a rather large training operation at Camp Perry.

They keep safehouses for defectors; sometimes expensive ones. [There
was a great story in the WSJ a few years back about a white elephant
of one they wanted to sell...]

They have a rather unique warehouse of James Bond-ish gadgets. I
once met the logistics guy who had to account for it all, even when
he had no idea what much of it was!

They have domestic field offices.

(BTW, it's worth wondering what restrictions there'd be if it were
not for an ENORMOUS turf battle between them & Jill Edgar Hoover.)

But they don't even keep their own domestic guard force; that is all
FPS, same as NSA.
