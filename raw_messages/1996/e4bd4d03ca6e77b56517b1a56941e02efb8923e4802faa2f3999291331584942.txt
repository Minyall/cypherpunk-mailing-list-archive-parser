The recipient of the message is right in the "To:" header of the message.
If you anonymously remail a message, however, only the last remailer in the
chain will know to whom the message is encrypted, but the last remailer can
also just read the "To:" header.  I don't find this to be a problem at all.

You could just encrypt a message to different key ID's seperately, rather than
in one pass of PGP.  The would have the effect of Bcc.
