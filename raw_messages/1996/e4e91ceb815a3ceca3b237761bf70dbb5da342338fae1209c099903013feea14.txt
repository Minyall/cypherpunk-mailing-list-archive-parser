The people of the USA fortunately disagree. Its no coincidence that Limbaugh
has been unable to continue his tv show after his coverage of the OKC bombing.

It is not socialy acceptable to call for the murder of Police officers in most
countries. By doing so you are discrediting yourself and those who support you.

Troops were sent into Northern Ireland originally to protect the Catholic 
minority from the protestants. The two communities have been murdering each
other for centuries and there are bigots on both sides who think that the
events of three hundred years ago "prove" that the other is evil incarnate.

Do you support the "punishment beatings" performed by the IRA. So far this
year they have committed grievous bodliy harm against 270 people. They have
also murdered 4 people. There have been no deaths from police or army use
of firearms in that period. Your assertion is therefore false.

If you want to discuss the politics of Ireland you should at least visit the
place. You will find remarkably less sympathy for your romantic visions of
bloodshed amongst the people who have to live with the consequences. The
British people have little sympathy for either side and would quite happily
leave the two sides to slaughter each other if it wasnt for the fact that
the majority of the population wish to remain British and have voted to
remain so in regular referenda and national elections.
