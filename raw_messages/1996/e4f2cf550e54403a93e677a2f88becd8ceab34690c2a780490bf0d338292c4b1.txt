Space sounds different, # is sometimes backspace, @ is sometimes kill-line,
and control characters often do strange things.  Those are the only characters
I avoid, though.

For example, if you're using a teletype to change your password on a UNIX
system (or it _thinks_ you _might_ be using one), and use a password of
"O&]z@d#4", you've just set your password to "4".  Control characters are
worse: ^S to lock your terminal, ^D to disconnect -- no fun.

It's hard.  I'd really rather have longer pass{words,phrases} so that there's
the potential for lots of entropy without requiring line-noise for passwords.
