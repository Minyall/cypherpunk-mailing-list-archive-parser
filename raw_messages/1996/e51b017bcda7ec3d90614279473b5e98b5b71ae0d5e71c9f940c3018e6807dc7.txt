Hi all

I can just see the FBI screaming "we need weaker encryption to combat
terrosism on US soil" with nasty effects -- it seems all to many people,
lawmakers included, will be only to happy to sacrifice their privacy that
the FBI can better combat these terrorist acts (which could *of course*
could been prevented had only the FBI been able to read their encrypted
mail...)

Somehow I got the feeling watching CNN that the FBI was given a shitload
of ammo. Call me cynical but the Reichstag fire comes to mind... 

Later
Mike
