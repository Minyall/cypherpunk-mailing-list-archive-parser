 Why is it that governments always seem to be so self-congratulatory
about allowing the citizens to be 'free' to do those things that the
government 'allows' them to do?
.....................................................


Not to start a thread specifically on government bashing, but Toto'
statement is so on-target about the kind of attitude which emanates from
what regulators say and do.  It is their underlying assumption that only
they have the moral discernment to determine the parameters of
propriety; which makes them think that no 'underling' has the right of
self-determination.

It can be seen in statements they make such as as:  "there are no
provisions in Super Legislation Bill 200A.666.b.32xy.450z for individual
exemptions from voluntary contribution".   
(well, excuse Me! <g>)

So this means that an individual can feel "free" to act only when these
people feel magnanimously generous enough to allow it.  No reference to
Reason or Logic in the way things work in Reality, only that an action
is inhibited or allowed "because this piece of paper says so".
Therefore from their perspective and their re-definition of "person",
Human Motivation derives its validity solely from their "provisions" for
it.   All other determining factors are Prohibited by Law.  

How can you argue with that?
