Section 1(f) of the Federal Income Tax Code provides:

(f) Adjustments in Tax Tables so that Inflation Will Not Result in Tax
Increases.-

(1) In General.- Not later than December 15 of 1993, and each subsequent
calender year, the Secretary shall prescribe tables which shall apply in
lieu of the tables contained in [the tables which define the tax brackets]
with respect to taxable years beginning in the succeeding calander year.

(2) Method of prescribing tables.-  [The tables] shall be prescribed-

(A) by increasing the minimum and maximum dollar amounts for each rate
bracket for which a tax is imposed under such table by the cost-of-living
adjustment for such calender year,

(B) by not changing the rate applicable to any rate bracket as adjusted
under subparagraph (A), and

(C) by adjusting the amounts setting forth the tax to the extent necessary
to reflect the adjustments in the rate brackets.

[deletions]

This, at least, has been considered.
