<sigh> Big Brother comming to a bank near you.

Does anyone understand the implications of a society moving to an
electroinc cash based system??

All trasactions will be recorded, moitored, tracked & analysed. This is
not just the government that one has to worry about but corporations also.

Insurance industry:

- Gee Mr. Jones seems that you buy too much junk food & red meat. Our
actuaries say this makes you a "high risk".

- Gee Ms. Smith you speend too much money at the bars. Our actuaries say
you are a high risk for DUI & accidents. 

Company Employment:

- Gee Mr. Thompson you spend too much on beer & cigarettes. Oh yes we
don't like the magizines you read either.

IRS:

- Well, well, well Mr & Ms Washington our records show that you spent
$50,000 last year but only declaired $35,000 care to explain where the
extra money came from??

And the bueaty of this system is the crypto. Every transaction you make
has your crypto signature. No deniability. Your John Hancock on every pack
of ciggarettes, case of beer, every Playboy magizine, every book you buy,
any charities or political orginizations you contribute to. Every intamate
detail of your life in someones computer somewhere.


Ahhhh... What a Brave New World we are creating!

P.S. For those of you dreaming of anonymous e-cash & the crypto anarchy of
the future; do you really think the government & banking industries are
going to give up controll of the curency regardless of what for it takes?
