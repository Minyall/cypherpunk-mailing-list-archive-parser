The weapons and the gold are property of US taxpayers. We should not give
anything to the Austrians. If they are too stupid to quietly maintain an
emplaced civil-defense network, let them not come crying to CNN when it's
their turn to be Chechnya'd. 

The russkies have more balls than the US Congress. I bet Ivan won't be 
meekly handing over anything to this Vranitsky fellow.
