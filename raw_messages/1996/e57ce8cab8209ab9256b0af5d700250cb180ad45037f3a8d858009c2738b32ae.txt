	Did MS mention how the crypto DLL's would be "protected" from 
surreptitious tampering?  What I'm wondering is if it will be possible
to "drop in" a new (signed) crypto.dll (that just happens to
forward cleartext to the DLL author, or perhaps uses intentionally 
deficient (or just fixed) keys) when installing, for example, the latest
game craze distributed on the Internet?
	It would seem to be fairly sketchy (and dangerous) to allow drop-in
crypto engines if those can be replaced with *ANY* other crypto engine at
any time (note for the paranoid: Imagine "NSA the Game" for Windows(TM) with
the new "Send the Feds a copy" encryption DLL--that last part in fine print
of coures :)
	I am hoping that they do have some for of protection against this
that hasn't been mentioned yet, but this kind of jumps out at me when I
think of drop-in DLLs (anyone ever see how well the WINSOCK.DLL scheme
works? God Forbid that an encryption scheme be subject to the same problems!)
