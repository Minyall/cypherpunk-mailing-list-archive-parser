I remember seeing an item on TV that had mentioned an acid bomb (it was a
news report about a public access TV show that was showing people how to 
make bombs).  In this example, some common chemicals were mixed together, 
tightly closed, and moments later an explosion occured.  They never said 
the chemicals, for all I know it could have been lemon juice and baking 
soda in a sealed container, a la Dry Ice bomb...  It didn't look like a 
bomb of mass destruction, more of a loud bang and a smallish explosion...
