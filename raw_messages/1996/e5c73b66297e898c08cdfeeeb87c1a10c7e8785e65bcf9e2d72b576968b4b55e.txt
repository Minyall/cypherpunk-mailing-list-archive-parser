i realize this is an obvious problem.  although this is a weakness,
i'm not sure it would really matter.  if a person was going to be
doing something on the net they expected would generate a lot of anon
traffic they could notifiy the remailer operators.  this has other
weaknesses related to forgeries but there's only so much that can be
done...

obviously this is not going to be an easy problem to solve.
