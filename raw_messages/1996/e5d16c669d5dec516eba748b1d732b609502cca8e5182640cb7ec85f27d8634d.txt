If I might dare a crypto-related comment as well; it also requires an
absolutely trusted third-party to manage the funds and issue the ecash 
used to pay the murderer, (sorry, fortunate gambler).  The reason why the 
third party must be trusted by both the payers and the gambler, and thus 
cannot be anonymous (only at 'best' pseduonymous) should be obvious.
