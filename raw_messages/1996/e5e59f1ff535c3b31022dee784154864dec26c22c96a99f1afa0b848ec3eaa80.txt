It was made by Mykotronx, using tamperproof programmable gate 
array chips from VLSI, though I don't remember whether they were
entirely programmed at Mykotronx+NSA, or whether they were
mostly mask-programmed at VLSI first.

On the other hand, if you _want_ to make a DES-cracker,
at the time Clipper came out, VLSI was making a 192Mbps DES chip,
and they may have faster stuff now.
