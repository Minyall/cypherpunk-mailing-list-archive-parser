A number of people on this list will shout in unison, Schneier!, and they'll
probably be wrong.

For an absolute beginnger I'd suggest Abraham Sinkov, Elementary
Cryptanalysis, MAA: New mathematical library, ISBN 0-888385-622-0,
and Lawrence Dwight Smith, Cryptography, Dover, ISBN 0-486-20247-x.
If you want to learn more about the history of the field, try to
get the hardcover (unabridged) edition of David Kahn's _Codebreakers_.

(It might be a worthwhile project on run Kahn's book through an OCR
and to place it on Internet. :-)

If you want to understand the communication theory that underlies
modern cryptography, check out Dominic Welsh, Codes and Cryptography,
Oxford, ISBN 0-19-853287-3.

If you're teaching an undergraduate C course and are looking for examples
of badly written C code, then get Schneier's book. :-)
