Bear in mind that the current system imposes more than just income tax and
that the United States, unlike most other countries, taxes worldwide
income and compensates with an immensely complicated foreign tax credit
system.

Accounting costs as a result of income taxation do not bother me.
Accounting costs as a result of a deduction based, multi-tiered,
progressive, and supplimented system of income taxation are silly.  The
income tax system in the United States has been driven since the post war
period by the effort to implement policy through the congress' power to
tax rather then the simple need for funds.  Allowing special interest
groups to drive a system of taxation is hardly fitting the goal of
"minimizing these costs."  The income tax system in the United States thus
fails even your test.

Exercise for the reader:  How many de fact laws are implemented by an
tax which would be unconstitutional to pass directly?

I don't recall ever asserting this.

Then the issue that divides us is the definition of fairness.

That's a pretty arrogant (and fairly incorrect) assumption.

Sorry, I just don't agree with you here.  If black markets exist, even
florish, without crypto, how exactly is it that you think they will not be
easier to run and maintain and shield from discovery in the presence of
encryption?

The amount of resources which would have to be dedicated to tax compliance
enforcement under your scheme would be staggering.  I don't doubt that
taxation (if it comes to this) will go down kicking and screaming, but if
you can think of a way to regulate offshore markets in information futures
without invading the country hosting the exchange (note that there is a
case that even this can be defended against by the market) I'd like to
hear it.

You don't see the privacy worries in mandating data providers to count
bits and report to a central authority on their findings?

It's clear you're unconvertable.

We should take this discussion (if it continues) to e-mail.
