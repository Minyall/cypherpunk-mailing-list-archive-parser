At least they had more sense of humor than USDoJ and made the
hacked page available from their website. To compensate for lack
of humor at USDOJ, I made their page available at 

http://www.algebra.com/~ichudov 

(follow the links). A tarred archive is available from there for 
downloading.

P.S. I am very surprised by huge number of hits to my usdoj page. I wonder
where are the links to my page.
