This reminds me how many years ago (I think this was under Reagan, or maybe
even Carter) I went to U.S.V.I without any papers at all, not realizing that
it's "abroad". When the time came for me to get back, I was shocked to see
some security people checking the papers of the people getting on the plane
to N.Y. I explained the situation and they let me in with no papers.
