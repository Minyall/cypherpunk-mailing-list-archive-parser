The PGP Library is currently under development.  I have a draft API
document, but it is not complete (I still need to finish documenting
the key management functions).  I'd like to get it to a state where I
can "publically" release it soon -- then again I've been saying that
for a while.

If you have more questions, you can contact me personally via email.
