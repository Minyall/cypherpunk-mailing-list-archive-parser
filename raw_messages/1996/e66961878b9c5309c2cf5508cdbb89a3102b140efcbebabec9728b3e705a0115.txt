Hallelujah!  The current college system is a fatcat and indentured
servant system - the tenured staff (and not necessarily the ones who
provide the most service) at the schools suck up the big bucks, and
the grads "owe their soul to the company store", just like the serfs
of a bygone era.  The more things change....

Actually, when I first came to L.A., there was a pretty good college
system, where most kids with minimal finances could go for cheap, in
some cases nearly free.  But this was taken over (co-opted) like so
many other programs that can be turned into cash cows.
