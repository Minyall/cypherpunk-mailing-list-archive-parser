I could tell you who it is, but then I'd have to kill you. So let's just
stick to publicly available information. 

According to the root DNS servers, which as we know are controlled by a ZOG
defense contractor, alias.net is an alias for alpha.jpunix.com, and
anon.lcs.mit.edu is indeed the same as nym.alias.net. alias2-dom is said to
get name service from Sameer and company, but that could be a trap. 

Obviously, they've infiltrated pretty deep, but thanks to you, we know to
be careful.

Then again, this could just be FUD from another Fucking Statist. Who
knows? 

Somewhat more seriously, wouldn't it be nice if the various remailers signed
each other's keys?
