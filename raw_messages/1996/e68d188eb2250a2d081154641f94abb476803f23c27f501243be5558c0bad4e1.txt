Hi

Apologies if this is too much of a beginner's Q.

Does anyone know how to backup a "SecureDrive" partition onto tape 
quickly and easily.

HPACK is really slow.

PKZIP and then PGP is slow.

RAWDISK, seems to be quite complex (perhaps I am just stupid!), and I 
am terrified of making some sort of terrible mistake.

I have about 100MB in the partition.  I have a pretty out of date 
computer which is a 386 33MHz running Windows.

Any ideas and all the best.
