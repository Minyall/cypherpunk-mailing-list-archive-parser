The more I think about Senator Leahy's public key, the more I keep coming
back to a point I only alluded to before.

How do we know the key is actually his key?

The key is only self signed.  It could be a fake.  If, as I have assumed,
its primary use will be to sign public statements posted to the net, how
will we know they are actually from Senator Leahy, and not some impostor?

I strongly urge the senator to join the web of trust and get some other
signatures on his key.
