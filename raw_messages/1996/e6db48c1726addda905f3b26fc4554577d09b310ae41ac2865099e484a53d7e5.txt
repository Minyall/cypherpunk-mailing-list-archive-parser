www.anonymizer.com got a nice plug in David Plotnikoff's column in today's
San Jose Mercury News.  He quotes Community ConneXion's motto, "Because on
today's Internet, people do know you're a dog."  He also mentions its
similarity to anonymous remailers.  His capsule review:

"On the upside, it's very easy to use and it supports gopher and FTP
transfers as well as Web pages.  On the downside, it's predictable slow and
pages, bracketed top and bottom with Anonymizer banners, often don't
display quite right."
