Since I'm in an especially patriotic mood today, I've just uploaded the 2.7b
beta
release of Private Idaho (which started out life as a Windows PGP shell, but is
turning into the "mother of all privacy tools" shell).

Significant new additions include:

Automated install application - no more installing and updating new releases of 
PI by hand (many thanks to Colin Tan for writing the Setup application). The
install 
application comes bundled with PGP QuickStart, a utility for helping new users 
download and install PGP.
 
Expert and user modes - for new users, user mode provides a limited set of 
commonly used commands. Expert mode gives you access to all of the commands.
 
Steps - again, another feature for new users. Step-by-step information on
how to 
perform common tasks.
 
Change nym account reply blocks - easy way to change nym reply blocks.
 
Anonymizer support - support for C2's new anonymous Web browsing server. 
Select a URL from any text within Private Idaho and your browser will
anonymously 
access that Web page. 

Mixmaster support - support for Mixmaster type 2 remailers. 

Variable word-wrap length - select window size, 65, 70, or 75 character line
length.
