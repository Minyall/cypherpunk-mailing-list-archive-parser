Not true.  Pressing ctrl-reset jumped to the interrupt routine pointed
to by the vector at (I think) 1010/1011, if the contents of that vector
checksummed correctly with the contents of the next byte (1012), and
otherwise reset the computer.  It certainly was possible (and useful)
to trap ctrl-reset.  Also, even when a reset occurred, not all of the
memory was cleared, so you could in fact keep code in memory across
a reset, if you could arrange to have it run on the other side of the
boot.

As you pointed out, it was very easy to write viruses for the Apple ][.
The "slave" disk layout contained two blank sectors (.5 K) within the
DOS image that get loaded into memory.  The designers may as well have
labelled it "put virus here".
