Are you sure about that?  "If they pass a well-drafted statute," the 
president couldn't just declare a "national emergency" (similar to all of 
the other "national emergencies" we are under right now) and send that same 
message to the key-keepers demanding they send their databases?

Given the massive misbehavior of government in general, I'm not at all 
confident something like this couldn't happen.

I'm waiting for the first indication that these GAK systems will include 
some sort of government-fraud-preventative measures, possibly an irrevocable 
allowance (or even a requirement?) that any key holder can publicize the 
fact of any key request at the time it is made, or after a minimal time like 
a couple of weeks or so.  That way, government abuse of the system would be 
revealed, beyond the control of the government.
