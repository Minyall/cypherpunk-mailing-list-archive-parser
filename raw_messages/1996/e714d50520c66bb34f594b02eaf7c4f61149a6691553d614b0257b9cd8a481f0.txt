     Tell that to the person on the recieving of the terrorist bullets/
gernades. 

     The idea is have a very simple policy about terrorism/guerilla warfare/
lone kooks shooting shit up. They will be eliminated. No other changes 
will be made. No midnight house to house searchs, no pograms, no
concentration camps, justa  simple rule. You shoot at armed people you will
die (remember this was in the context of terrorist attacks against military
and harder targets). 

     It is done _immediately_ if not sooner. 

     Possibly it would have the side effect that people in a crowd would 
take down the guy next to them that was pulling the gun becasue they 
know what will happen if they don't.
