Lying assholes like Ray Arachelian have no sense of shame, or they would
have committed mass suicide a long time ago. Can Tim May play Jim Jones
and lead his flock?

It's indicative that most of the "cypher punks" who contribute to the
only crypto-relevant thread on this mailing list in weeks - rather lame
protocols for limiting free speech - are homosexuals.  They want a
forum where they can lie and forge and flame and libel (as Ray Arachelian
does now), and where there victims will be prevented from responding.
No wonder Ray Arachelian has already accused me of "homophobia",
a sufficient reason for the cocksucker John Gilmore to unsubscribe me,
even though I said nothing about Ray's sexual perversions.

Pathetic impotent liars.
