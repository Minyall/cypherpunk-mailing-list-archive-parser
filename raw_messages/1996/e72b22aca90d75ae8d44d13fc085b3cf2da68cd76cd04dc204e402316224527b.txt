Actually, I recommend systems based on threat and comfort.  If the
system is protected (ie, behind a firewall, on a compartmentalized
network), I use ssh, no problem.  I use ssh even where I'm not
comfortable with it because I'm more comfortable with it than with the
alternatives, but there are times when the "No remote access" option
is more comfortable than ssh.
