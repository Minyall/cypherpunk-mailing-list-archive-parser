	<OK, OK - I know.  The needle on my troll meter is pegging
at about 15 on a scale to ten but I can't let this one pass>

	Yeah right...  And what drugs where they on?

	Uh huh...  Sounds like a direct quote from Ms Denning to
me...  Never tell the truth well a lie will do.

	They've tried to paint Phil with that brush too often.

	I was at Interop '94 and was talking with Phil after a session
on the clipper chip when one of the government lackies (don't remember if
it was Ms Denning herself or not - I think it was) went into a tirade about
this.  Acused Phil of supporting terrorists, drug dealers, nazi's, child
molestors, - the whole "four horsemen" nine yards.

	No matter how often you bury one of their red herrings - IT STILL
STINKS TO HIGH HEAVEN!

	It's still a crock of SH*T and it still STINKS TO HIGH HEAVEN!
