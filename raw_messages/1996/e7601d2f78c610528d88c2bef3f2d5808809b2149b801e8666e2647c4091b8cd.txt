Anyone have any connections with the alternative/underground rock
scene. I have been reality surfing it here in the L.A. area
and am looking for people who are interested in coming along to assorted
indsutrial/techno/gothic/rave places.

Also, are there any cybernetic developments related to this scene

I was thinking of something along a program which would
be used when employing the mini-monitors (which you wear like
sunglasses).
