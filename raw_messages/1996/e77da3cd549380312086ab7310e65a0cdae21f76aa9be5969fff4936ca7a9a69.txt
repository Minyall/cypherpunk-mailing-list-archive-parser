In the latest PowerPC news it is reported that OSF is porting Linux to the
Mac with the support of Apple.  Apple has a web site -
www.mklinux.apple.com that discusses this and has a link to the OSF site.
In my book, this is a GoodThing(tm).  Of course, being a huge fan of both
the Mac and unix might put me in the minority ;-)
