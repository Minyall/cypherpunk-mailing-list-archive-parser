It seems to me that Microsofts plan is carefully and ingeniously
designed to fail:  They will do their best to restrain the export 
of real crypto, but alas, in the end, they will regretfully admit
that they failed.  Some evil person will have illegally exported 
real crypto after they signed it. Too bad.  How sad.
