My name is Andrzej Adamski, I'm from Poland, Nicolas Copernicus University
. I would be very grateful for getting hints where to find  information on
the current EU encryption policy/ legislation.  What about present
developments in the area of the European  infrastructure of pubic (sic) key
look like?

Adam, the best place to start your research is at the "Cryptography in
Europe" website:  
 
 
http://www.modeemi.cs.tut.fi/~avs/eu-crypto.html  
 
 
To see the wider context, visit the "Crypto Law Survey" website  created by
Bert-Jaap Koops in the Netherlands, at:  
 
 
http://cwis.kub.nl/~frw/people/koops/lawsurvy.htm  
 
 
The EU and EC seem likely to cave in to pressure (blackmail?) from the
American  
spy agencies and impose "back doors" on any  strong encryption package.
Unless Europeans stand up and insist that privacy of communication is an
essential human right.

I would welcome some input to shape the following IT technology. The
technology is a physiological biometric based upon the detection and
comparison of subcutaneous blood vessels, essentially bar-code reading of
people.
