The friend and colleague of your whom you know says much about you. Yet
another Net Loon. You action of posting a 48K spam to this list in attempt
to get me upset has resulted in a single, half-felt yawn.  Others may be 
pissed at your attempt at spamming me.  I give not a shit.

My original message to you stands: Vulis, grow up.
