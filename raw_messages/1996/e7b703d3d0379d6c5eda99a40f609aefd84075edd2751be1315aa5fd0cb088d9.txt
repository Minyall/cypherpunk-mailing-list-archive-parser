I broke the story about how much Digital Telephony would *really* cost in 
CyberWire Dispatch more than two years ago.  The price tag in my piece:  
"... at least $2 billion..."  In that Dispatch I wrote that the Clinton 
White House had made the decision to support the bill based on a flawed 
cost/benefit analysis study the FBI had done.
