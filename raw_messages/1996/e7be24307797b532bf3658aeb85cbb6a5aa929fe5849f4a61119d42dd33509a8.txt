Subject: Penet-style web remailer?

	As a result of scanning through the Nando Times'
(http://www.nando.net/nt/) Infotech section, I came across a piece on email
with the following address: http://noah.pair.com/anon.html. It appears to be
sort of a penet-style anonymous remailer, only without return messages. Anyone
know anything else about it? Of course, given the number of web interfaces to
fully anonymous remailers, I wouldn't encourage anyone to use it.
