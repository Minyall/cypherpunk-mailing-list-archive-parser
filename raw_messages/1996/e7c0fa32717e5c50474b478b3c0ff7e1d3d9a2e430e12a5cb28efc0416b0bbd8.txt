The group of 7 in question are definitely not `wannabes'.  They are
about as knowledgeable a group as you could find outside of the NSA.

The report discussed the length of key needed for *symmetric*
crytosystems.  As this pertains to PGP, it uses a 128 bit session key
for the IDEA symmetric algorithm.  Not 2048.

Their recommendation was for a *minimum* of 90 bit keys for data
that must remain private for any length of time.  Given the calculations
they stated, this seems reasonable.
