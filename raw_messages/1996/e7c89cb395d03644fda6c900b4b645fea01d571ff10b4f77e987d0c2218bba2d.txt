I agree with you, but it could also be correct.

Since the char array is allocated on the stack as an auto, its contents are
not guaranteed. So i[5]='\0'; is needed as the first statement.

And of course it will never include a 'z' because the '<' will not permit
it. Replace all the '<' with '<='.

Plus there is the small matter of non-ASCII character representations
breaking the increments and comparisons.

Oh, and don't forget that main() returns an integer. This will generate at
least a warning from the compiler, since the code does not return anything.
It may well return a random number or something that will be interpreted as
an error code.

(also less than a minute's work)
