Pittsburgh Press vs Pittsburgh Human Relations Commission (sex specific help
wanted advertizing outlawed).  Various Fair Housing Laws ("we don't rent to
your kind here" punishable by confiscation of property).  Civil Rights Act
of 1964 (verbal expressions of discrimination in the course of employment,
housing, or service in public accommodations punished in numerous ways).
Expressions of ill-will towards the President or members of his family
punishable as threats in circumstances where similar comments made about
anyone else would not be actionable.  

Note that work is a big part of most people's lives and there are
substantial governmental restrictions imposed on speech in the work place
with fellow employees and customers.
