I found some more information about this on Cylink's web site.  Check out
http://www.cylink.com/products/security/passport/.  I'm surprised not to
have seen more publicity about this, since it seems to be a fairly big
move on Cylink's part.

Apparently Cylink is only licensing their SDK at no cost, not the actual
patents.  Does anyone want to speculate on why they are doing this now?
