That's what I said.  There are however a few cases where it may help.
Two that spring to mind are the brute force factoring of the
BlackNet key - this may have been faster if half of the potential
factors could have been ignored due to wrong key lengths (although I
suspect this depends upon the factoring algorithm), and the other
is that of identifying low quality keys with a small factor (perhaps
generated by low quality software).

Again, I would say this depends upon the factoring algorithm.
