	So what happens if somebody in Singapore publishes a list of

	If the person who publishes the list of Singaporians who beat up
	Chinese immigrants the previous week is not in jail for publishing
	that, then what is he in jail for?  The individual is publishing
	factual data, just data that the Singapore government has been
	trying very hard to keep out of the hands of the population of
	Singaporians in specific, and the world in general.

	IOW, you don't give a damm about freedom of speech -- which is
	what I suspected was the case all along.

	You're just one of those people who says pretty words, without
	meaning them.

	National security is a hole that makes a mockery of anything which
	allegedly protects freedom of speech.   

	The slight modification in Singapore's freedom of speech law means 
	that all speech is acceptable, so long as the writer first 
	self-censors, and secondly doesn't offend any jerks in Singapore,
	and thirdly doesn't offend any jerks in the neighbouring
	countries, and fourthly doesn't offend the current despot in
	Singapore.  << A statment which makes this message illegal to

	Still want to claim that Singapore practices freedom of speech?
	Or do you want me to start citing religious, political and
	serious literary works of merit that are prohibited under 
	Singapore's alleged freedom os speech statute, that bans any
	speech that might be controversial?
