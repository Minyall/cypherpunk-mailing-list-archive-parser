The passphrase only does one thing for you, which is protect your
keyring in case someone gets it. Since you keep the passphrase on
line, you are actually less secure than if you used a memorable
phrase.

BTW, since the passphrase is used to hash into an IDEA key, more than
128 bits of input entropy would be wasted.
