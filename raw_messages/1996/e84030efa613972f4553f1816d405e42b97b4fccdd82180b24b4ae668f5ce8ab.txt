It is important to consider cultural factors when deciding how groups will react
to differing standards of legal and permissible actions. For example, a brief
summary of the basic tenets held by some different European cultures are given
below:

British: Everything is permitted, unless it is forbidden.
German: Everything is forbidden, unless it is permitted.
France: Everything is permitted, especially if it is forbidden.

Au revoir,
