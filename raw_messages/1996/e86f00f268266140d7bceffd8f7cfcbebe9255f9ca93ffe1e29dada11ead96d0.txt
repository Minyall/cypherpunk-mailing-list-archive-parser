First, reply to every message posted to the list, asking "How do I get 
off this list"? 1500 people will get each and every message, and if all 
of them respond, maybe the incomming mail will fill up the com-pute-er at 
your place, until little ones and zeros run out all over the floor. Your 
system administrator (god, to you, mortal) will then delete your account, 
solving your problem. If this doesn't happen, go to the place where they 
keep your comp-ute-erz and open the door. This make take some force, as 
the system administrators (gods, to you, mortal) do not like you playing 
with their toyz. Find the mail server. If you don't know which one is the 
mail server, don't despair; just start with the biggest thing with the 
most blinkin' lights and work your way towards the smallest. Take off the 
coverz of all of da mail serverz, and find the cypherpunks wire. It is 
probably one of the red ones, or maybe black, or something. Use a pair of 
wire cutters to cut the cypherpunks wires, and all wirez that look like 
they might be cypherpunks wirez. Be sure to leave your wristwatch inside 
one of the mailserverz when finished. All good system 
administratorz (godz, to you, mortal) do this when dey werks on da 
mailserverz. When you are finished, stand under the smoke detector and 
light up a smoke. Wait for the halon system to discharge. You will not be 
bothered by any more cypherpunks mail.  :)

OR, you could just send a message to majordomo@toad.com,

with the following in the BODY, not the SUBJECT:
