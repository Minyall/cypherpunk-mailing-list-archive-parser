Has anyone figured out how this merger can work, particularly when
British Telecom will be the surviving party, when those MCI employees
concerned with the security of communications will not be able to
disclose any cryptographic software or technical data to their
employer, or to their ``foreign'' bosses and colleagues, without first
getting permission from the Office of Defense Trade Controls under
the ITAR?
