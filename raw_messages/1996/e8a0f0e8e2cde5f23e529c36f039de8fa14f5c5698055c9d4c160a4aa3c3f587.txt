I've been receiving multiples copies of threats of frivolous lawsuits in
connection with Sandy Sanford's kind offer to address the San Francisco
Gay and Lesbian Cypherpunks Meeting (and Meating). Therefore I'm regrettably
forced to postpone taking advantage of said kind offer until Timmy May is
actually indicted for possession of controlled substances (to wit, Ritalin)
and/or sexually molesting two feline minors and/or practicing cryptography
without a licence. (Given Timmy May's total ignorance of cryptography, I
find the latter to be the least likely.) Hope to see you all then,
                                                            Dimitri
