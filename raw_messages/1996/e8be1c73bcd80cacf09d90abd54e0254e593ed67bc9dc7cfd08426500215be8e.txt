Anonymous User had a question over PZ's politics. 
 
PZ has posted to the list and thus has, I believe, his address available to
list subscribers. 
 
How did PZ answer the question privately when Anonymous User posed the
question to PZ on private e-mail? 
 
If Anonymous User did not first pose the question to PZ privately, why did
he post it to the list publically?

PS: I'm likely to have some followup on these questions, but wanted to pose
them to AU first.
