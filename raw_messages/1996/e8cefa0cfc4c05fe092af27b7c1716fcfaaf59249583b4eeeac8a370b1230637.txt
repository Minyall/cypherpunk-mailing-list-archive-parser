However, what about an UNCOOPERATIVE escrow agent? (one who insists on 
signed paper, or for that matter insists that the judge himself shows up.)   
Or one, at least, who sites himself in Borneo, on the top of a 4000 foot 
mountain, with a 386 laptop computer and a box of floppies, and who promises 
2 hour services to anybody who shows up?  No email, no fax, no phone, no 
light, no motor car, not a single luxury....oooops....sorry about that...not 
even radio.  

Moreover, if the escrow agent is out of the country, can any domestic laws 
force him to divulge keys?
