An article in today's (Tue, Nov 19, 1996) New York Times described
how British intelligence had early information of the slaughter of
European Jewery through the decryption of German radio messages.
(Although not noted in the article, this is presumably Ultra
decryption of Enigma).

The information was not acted upon, and the article offers
a number of reasons, among which was a (not unreasonable) fear that
doing so would compromise Ultra. The article also notes that
the decryptions were kept so secret that the information was
not available at post-WW2 war crimes trials (such as Nurenburg).

I suppose that this could offer a counter argument to the NSA FUD
"If you only knew what we know."

Martin.
