'fraid not. ADD has an organic cause, and can be detected
with reproduceable biological tests.

Admittedly, ADD is nonfatal, and I will agree that the analogy breaks
down there. I will also agree that it may be overdiagnosed -- that is,
misdiagnosed by sloppy practitioners. That does not mean it isn't real.

Why eliminate the people with endocrine problems? You need not invent
a new syndrome. The folks with severe deficits of growth hormone are
an actual group, and are a perfectly fine group to give growth
hormones to. Now, you are correct that some people might abuse those
hormones, and some lazy doctors might diagnose a statistical outlier
as someone suffering from dwarfism. However, that doesn't mean that
growth hormone isn't needed for the people whom you choose to dismiss
in your first paragraph as though they were not a valid place to draw
the analogy.

Has it occurred to you that many of the children in question are happy
being medicated, as are many adults? In any case, who are you to tell
other people what's good for them?
