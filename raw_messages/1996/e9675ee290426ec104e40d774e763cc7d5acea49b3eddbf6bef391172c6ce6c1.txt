I believe that in California, you may have a PO Box on your 
driver's license, but the state has to have your "real" address
in its records.  As noted, some people forget to update this 
information when they move, and others list their lawyer's 
address with the state.  Presumably, that should satisfy the 
legal justifications for requiring an address.

That may be the preference, but I just use my e-mail address on
my checks.  If more is required to cut a deal, I can choose to
add more information by hand if I am willing to do so to do the
transaction.
