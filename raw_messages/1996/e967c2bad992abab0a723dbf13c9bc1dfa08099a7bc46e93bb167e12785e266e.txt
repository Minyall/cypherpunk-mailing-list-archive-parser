Your text was not line-wrapped or whatever.  All your other postings were
as far as I know.  BTW, I think you're confusing practicality and what's
good for one individual with what's good long-term for everyone.

Perhaps, giving Gilmore the momentary benefit of the doubt, he had his
back against the proverbial wall in some sense, and he did what he felt
he had no choice but to do. Who knows? The point now for many subscribers
is not whether Gilmore had to make one of those damned-if-you-do/damned-
if-you-don't decisions (which we're all glad *we* didn't have to make),
the point is now to look at the fallout, and whether Gilmore is going
to make additional comments/justifications on this list, or whether he
will simply clam up with that old-fashioned hillbilly stubbornness that
my ancestors (for example) were quite famous for.
