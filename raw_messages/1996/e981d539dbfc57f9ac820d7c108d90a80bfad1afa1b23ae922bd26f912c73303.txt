Folks,

When people decide to copy other mailing lists on messages they send to
Cypherpunks (or vice versa), we often get flooded with insults and spams
from people who don't share our views. (While I have nothing against trying
to recruit others to our views, in my opinion this is best done by
judicious writing of essays for _them_, tuned to their interests, and not
in mindless spamming of every list that might have a passing interest in
some of the topics.)

We already have enough traffic here, and don't need replies from a bunch of
other lists, be they libertarian lists, digital commerce lists, human
rights lists, or java lists.

The latest example of this is the rantfest invvolving these players:

------
From: Jack Hammer <jh@teleport.com>
To: jim bell <jimbell@pacifier.com>
Cc: Rich Graves <llurch@networking.stanford.edu>, cypherpunks@toad.com,
        nwlibertarians@teleport.com, hammernet-l@teleport.com,
        libernet-d@dartmouth.EDU, liberty-and-justice@pobox.com
------

I recognized Bell and Graves, but not the others. And I see no reason why
our list should be dragged into flames about "fart sacks" by people on all
of these other lists.

This was the final straw, and I have no choice except to add Bell, Graves,
Hammer, etc. to my filter list, which I will now proceed to do before
sending this message off.

[Done]

Words have consequences. So do flames.
