Subject: New Remailer (hidden)
Message-ID: <199605200332.UAA10885@infinity.c2.org>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain


NOTICE:

	A new type of remailer has just gone into business! It's
called a "hidden remailer-in-the-middle". The address is
middle-man@alpha.c2.org. This new type of remailer uses a combination
of Lance Cottrell's Mixmaster remailer and Raph Levien's premail
program.

Advantages:

*	The remailer is completely hidden. Attempting to discover the
actual identity of the remailer site is virtually impossible.

*	The remailer uses both Type-I and Type-II remailer technology
for handling remailer traffic.

*	Random remailer chains are selected separately for every
outgoing message.

*	The remailer is designed to answer to a chained nym.

*	All Mixmaster administrative commands are also chained through
multiple remailers. (i.e. remailer-help, remailer-key)

How it works:

	The actual address of the remailer is hidden behind a chained
nym. The plan is for the reply-block for middle-man to change
approximately every 48-72 hours. This will be transparent to the net
but will help to foil traffic analysis. The new remailer operates
under a modified Mixmaster. The code has been modified so that
outgoing messages are passed to premail to allow padding of extra
remailer chains. Each outgoing message will have two type-I remailers
randomly padded to the end of the chain based on the current status od
Raph Levien's remailer reliability list.
