Dale,
  Thanks, I love the quote but can't find it or it's source.  Perhaps I can put it
all together in bits and pieces.

   I don't thinkI'm very naieve about cryptography.  I fully realize that the same
goons that will crack you over the head for what you've written, will also be
prone to cracking you over the head for 'not' being able to read what you
have written.

   Thanks for the advice.  PGP serves me very well for most of my correspondences,
but I add a little 'je ne sais quoi' to it for things I consider to be of more
personal import.  It's probably something that experienced crytptographers would
laugh at, but just because I'm not a professional security-alarm designer doesn't
mean I'm going to leave my housekey under the front door mat.
