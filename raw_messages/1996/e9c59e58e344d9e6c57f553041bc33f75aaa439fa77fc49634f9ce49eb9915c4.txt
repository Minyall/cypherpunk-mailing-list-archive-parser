This information has been available in Oregon for at least a couple of
years on CD.  I've always been concerned about the privacy implications of
that service -- perhaps that's the upside of this story?  That people do
give a rat's ass about their privacy?

I do think that the information should be able to be disseminated on the
Net as long as it's legal.
