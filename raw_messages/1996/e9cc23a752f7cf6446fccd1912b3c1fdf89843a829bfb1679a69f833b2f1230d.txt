Hi...

I've built a random number generator based on the noise of a Zener
diode. Now I'd like to verify it's correct operation. I'd be very
grateful if someone could point me to existing software for randomness
tests or additional tests not mentioned in Knuth.

I'll make the design of the generator available as soon as I've
verified it's operation.

Andreas
