How about this regexp in some perl code that checks for 
subscribe/unsubscribe requests [mis]posted to the list:

if( (some other conditions such as message size necessitate the check) 
    && $line =~ /(subs?ri?e|su?s?ri?e|unsu????be)/ ) {
  ... message goes to moderator ...
}

The trouble is that the word "unsubscribe" is really hard to spell
correctly. Even if you know how to spell it, it is too easy to 
mistype.
