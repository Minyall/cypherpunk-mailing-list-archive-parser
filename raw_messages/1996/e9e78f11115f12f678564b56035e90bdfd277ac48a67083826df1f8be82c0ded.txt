I find it in a way amusing that a country which
have very weird attitude towards use of crypto
(it is not allowed to be used) tries to set 
standards and provide new technology. If they
are that opposing to use of strong encryption
how on earth they can be providing it to others
and get those others to believe there is no
catch in it?

Maybe it is the difference in internal and
foreign policies but still I suppose a country is 
supposed to be spying or sorry gather information
on other countries not on their own people and
companies.

Just wondering...
