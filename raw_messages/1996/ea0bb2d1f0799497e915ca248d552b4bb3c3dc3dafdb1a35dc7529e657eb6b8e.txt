Unicorn, please try to take a minute to think before hitting that send 
key.

You infer that a product is critically flawed without even trying it ?
There are quite a few members of this list who are using Pronto Secure 
and will testify to the contrary. 
See http://www.commtouch.com/testers.htm for a list of people who take 
the trouble to try out a product before venturing an opinion.

Agreed that feedback from external testers is a good deal for 
developers. It is also not a bad deal for evaluators, they get a free 
copy of a product which in the case of Pronto Secure many find useful 
(as witnessed by x-mailer headers on c'punk traffic). Testers also get 
an opportunity to contribute neat feature ideas which helps propagate 
secure messaging to the masses. 

Unicorn, you are invited to whitewash my fence :)
