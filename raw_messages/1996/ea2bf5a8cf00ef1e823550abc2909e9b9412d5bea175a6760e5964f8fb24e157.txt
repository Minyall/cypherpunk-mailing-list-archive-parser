It's five in the morning, I'm almost out of Scotch, but I finally
 figured out what to do with the 58 million Xmas Greetings I got from
 various conferences.
   I'm going to save them, and send them, each and every one, to the
 conferences they came from---in July.
   If they are spam 'then', they are spam 'now'.
   Spam-be-spam. (Bop-shoo-bop)
