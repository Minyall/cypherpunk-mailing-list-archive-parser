There is a new web site for people going to college and needing
financial aid. The site has downloadable software for electronic
filing of the FAFSA for free. There is even software for increasing
your financial aid eligibility. Check it out and pass this message on
if you or someone you know is going to apply for financial aid and
attend college in the United States.
