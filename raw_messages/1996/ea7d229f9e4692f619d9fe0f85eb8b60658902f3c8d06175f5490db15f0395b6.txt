Church of Scientology. Someone posted too many Secret Scriptures, it
seems. The details, nobody has shared. Conspiracy theories, galore, but I
have faith in their judgement and commitment to free speech and anonymity.
I'm sure it was a tough decision.

Btw, I don't believe it has shut down yet. Rather, the operators announced
that due to "recent events," there would be a planned shutdown on May
20th. 

I *would* like to know if the mail2news gateway is going down in addition
to the remailer. I'm assuming that it is.
