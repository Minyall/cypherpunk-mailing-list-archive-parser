      Sure it is. Earlier this year I threw a party for my wifes birthday.
A suprise party. I had to deceive her to keep her out of the house I needed
privacy to do this.

     It is still a valid example. Someone made the claim that people do not
need privacy, this is an example of someone who needs it.

     I am sure that there are other victims in the PO's history, but 
not with as big of numbers. 

     1 is a crime, 100,000 is a crying shame.

prostate.
