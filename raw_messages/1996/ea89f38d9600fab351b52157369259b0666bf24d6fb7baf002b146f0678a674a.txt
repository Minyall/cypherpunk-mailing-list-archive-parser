Whoops. Sorry. Wrong context. What I should have said was "the 9th Circuit
upheld a CA statute forbidding sales of *printed* material considered
'harmful to minors' from unsupervised vending machines". The publication(s)
at issue are those newsprint swingers' magazines (e.g., "me and my friend
want to screw you and your friend. here is a picture of us naked."). 

(doh!)
