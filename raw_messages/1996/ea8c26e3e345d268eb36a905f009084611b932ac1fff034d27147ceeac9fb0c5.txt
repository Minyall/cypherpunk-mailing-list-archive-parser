While I haven't looked at the more recent ones closely, most hard drives have an ultra-fine (<0.1 um particles?) filter element separating "inside" from "outside."  It allows air to pass to equalize pressure and humidity, while keeping out the dust.  (it is probably made of the same kind of material that is used, internally, as a filter for the airflow within the drive.)

Even if they didn't, there is a big difference between an enclosure that's good enough to hold a hard disk on earth, and one which can spend N-years in a high vacuum yet maintain enough air to run a hard drive.

That's not a problem at all.  Most modern drives are rated for 10's of G's, non-operating.  Satellite launches are probably a breeze compared to this.
