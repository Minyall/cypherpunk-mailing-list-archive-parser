No, I refused to reply to your obvious troll the first time, or to the
various Nazi tracts that have been posted anonymously recently. You had to
repeat the off-topic smears twice before I decided to humor you.

All presenting one point of view, stated less strongly than your link

As I told you on February 9th, I am win-announce@metrics.com.
