Check out http://www.finjan.com and the stuff about "SurfinGate".  The
software supposedly can perform an on-the-fly inspection of a Java 
applet or ActiveX control, and then apply a signature to it along with
a "safety" level qualifier to feed into a configurable policy mechanism.

Any ideas as to how you can look at an ActiveX control and determine
whether it's safe or not?
