Yours seems to be about the most aggressive policy a ISP provider can 
take and expect to remain in business.

That is, resist by what legal means are available, but ultimately depend 
on the user to secure his or her own data.

Where I differ with Mr. Bell is that he seems to think the ISPs of the 
world are going to rise and unite to quash the oppressive hand of big 
government at their own expense in order to satisify some sense of 
personal ethics or customer goodwill.
