This software already exists.  Take a look at Disperse/Collect at
http://www.eskimo.com/~weidai.  Disperse splits a file into n base64
encoded pieces where any k of them can be used to reconstruct the
original.  Collect will search through arbitrary collection of files (for
example the entire news spool) for these pieces and automatically
reconstruct everything that it finds.
