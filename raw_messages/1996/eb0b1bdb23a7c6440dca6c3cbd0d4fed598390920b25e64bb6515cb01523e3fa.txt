If you are the worring sort (or are looking for a ripe target)
point your browser at:
    https://www.diginsite.com/clients.html

There is a list of 23 Credit Unions - some (or all) of which
allow transactions to be done over the net.

A brief once over shows that it requires Netscape 2.0 or 
better so you will have encryption, but it does not warn you 
when you are using only a 40-bit session key vs. a 128-bit key.
(Netscape wizards - is there a way that the server can detect
 this so that a warning message could be put up?)

They also have some other information about their security at:
   http://www.diginsite.com/security/security.html

I think it is GREAT that this kind of functionality is coming.
I also think that the pioneers like this had better be prepared
to be targets as I am sure they will be.
