Never mind the details. What's important is that this is yet another example
of net censorship, like the Berkeley administration's reading student email
and the FBI's monitoring and disrupting patriot email. 

It's really sad, the difference between HRW/AI and Wired. You know, Amnesty
has some outstanding policies regarding accuracy, objectivity, and
universality. That's why they're accorded such respect. Human Rights Watch,
which has only been around since the late 70's and committed a few major
faux pas in Central America, is still learning. Wired decided that it had
all the answers years ago.
