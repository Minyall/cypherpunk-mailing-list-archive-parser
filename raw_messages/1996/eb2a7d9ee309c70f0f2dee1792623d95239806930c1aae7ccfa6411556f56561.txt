I just thought about this: obviously (witness the CDA which is much less
notorious than this proposition)  none of what she suggests would ever
work technically and pass the courts legally.

She may be dumb enough not to realize that BUT I think that she realizes
that too.

Therefore we can logically conclude that she does it just to score
some immediate points with angry electorate.
