I believe the OECD meetings are closed to the public and journalists. I
was thinking of going to one, but was told that I couldn't. (Even though
I'm fully accredited with U.S. Congress-issued press identification.)

Isn't there an OECD meeting soon in Paris? Marc Rotenberg from EPIC has
been following this closely and would be a good person to ask.
