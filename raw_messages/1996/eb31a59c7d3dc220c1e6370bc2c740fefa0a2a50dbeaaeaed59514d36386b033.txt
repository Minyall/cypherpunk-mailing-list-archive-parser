Suggestions, based on the successful ratings concept I've seen in 
Virginia elections, and a mainstay of groups like the Borg, excuse me, 
the Christian Coalition <g>

Pick 10-20 issues/votes.  Rate each congresscritter AND THEIR OPPONENTS 
based on "our" stand on the issues. Give a numerical score, based on 
percentage of "correct" positions.

Obvious issues are:

digital telephony   the CDA  Encryption/PRO-CODE  copyright, etc. . .

*   Keith A. Glass, Annandale, Virginia, USA, Filker/punster at large   *
*           "Specialization is for insects"   -  Lazarus Long           *
* Worlds saved, virgins converted, bongos taught - special group rates  *
