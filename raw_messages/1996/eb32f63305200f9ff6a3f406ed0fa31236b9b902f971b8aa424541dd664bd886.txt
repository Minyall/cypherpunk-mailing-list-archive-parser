And as we all know, having discussed this many times, even if one buys
these arguments for the advantages of key escrow, THEY DO NOT APPLY TO
COMMUNICATIONS!

That is, imagine Alice and Bob communicating over some channel. Alice has
files on her computer. Putatively, if she dies, leave her company,
whatever, it is desired to reconstruct these files. Fine. A potential use
for key escrow. (If voluntary, of course.)

But what does this have to do with a channel between Alice and Bob? Why
should the keys for this channel ever need to be escrowed for the reasons
Gorelick cites? After all, Alice has the files she sent stored locally, and
Bob presumably has the same files he received.

There is essentially no rationale for escrowing the keys of a transient
communication.

The Administration and even cryptologists apologizing for GAK (who ought to
know better) are curiously silent on this rebuttal to their claims.
