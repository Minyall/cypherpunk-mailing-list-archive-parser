	Howzabout this: Figure out about how many coins of each denom. the
shop should have on hand, and every so often the shop goes online to even
out it's til. That way the shop maintains the capability to make change
for anything. 
	Alternative: Instead of the shop going online every <x> minutes,
set it up so that everytime the shop goes online it evens out the til so
that it really isn't know whether the shop went online to make change for
a specific customer, or just to even out the til.
