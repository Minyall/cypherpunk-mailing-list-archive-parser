Hi,

I have a thought for addressing the anon. problem.

We could create a network of anonymous remailers with mailboxes. All messages in the mailboxes are stored encrypted. No information about the users are keep. Users would be be given x K of mailbox space.

We could use PGP keys for encrypting the messages. Each user would have his own key pair for his anonymous mailbox. Any plain text messages received to the server would be encrypted on recept.

Let the government's subpoena away. :)

"Sorry we don't have user addresses, no I can't decrypt those messages Senator." <BEG>

What do you think?
