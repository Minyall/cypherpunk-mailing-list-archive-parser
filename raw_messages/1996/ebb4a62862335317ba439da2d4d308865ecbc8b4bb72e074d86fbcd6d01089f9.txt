as usual, you skip the most interesting part. please elaborate on
why you are interested in "deconstructing and demolishing democratic
institutions". are you opposed ot democracy? do you support the 
constitution? it would be strange for you to say you agree with
the constitution but are opposed to democracy. apparently you
agree with anything that limits a government but nothing that
creates one? 

ok, so you've argued against police as a legitimate part of government
before as I recall (advocating, as other here, things like "private"
security forces etc.), so I won't get into that.

well, then, do you think there is a legitimate role for a legal system?

if not, how do you propose settling disputes in a civilized manner
other than "he with the biggest bazooka wins"?
