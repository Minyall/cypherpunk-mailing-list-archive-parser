        et tu, Brute?  I thought I was the only one who deliberately 
    stiffed the United Way, 

        The recent jailing of the national chairman of the United Way
    for pilfering multiple millions from the coffers, and squandering
    even more on lavish expense account jet-setting...  is more than 
    adequate justification to stiff the United Way.

        no, cypherpunks is not about redistributing the wealth; at
    least, certainly not the vocal, active active members, and probably
    most of the rest as organized politics turns the stomach of anyone
    of knowledge, even skewed as it may be.

        redistributing the wealth is over in *.politics.*, &c.

        Tim redistributing the wealth?!?  I'll be ROTFL for days over 
    the "insult."  

        Come on, James, get with the program.  Arguing that the elite
    rich are narrowing our margins as they steal from 99% of the
    population, and *maybe* they need to be curtailed, in not
    redistribution of wealth --in Canada, you call the real thing the
    National Health Services which supposedly provides cradle to the
    grave social services (which is bankrupting Canada).

-.There is naivete and then there is complicity.

        I dunno, James... 

        so where do you draw the line?  Isn't most anyone who accepts
    money for employment these days guilty of complicity?  If not, why
    not? --they are, after all, selling their principles for the
    proverbial loaf of bread.

        I agree there can be stupidity --Americans, in particular, with
    30% functionally illiterate are more often stupid and uninformed
    than most members of the industrial world, However, even these
    "mentally challenged" (note the politically correct terminology)
    sloths (not very PC) have the one eyed monster telling them all the
    truth their masters wish them to hear.  we do not have political
    consultants and advertising agencies --we have PR teams.

        since the usurpers of the public trust don't allow me to enter: 
    "none of the above" I have never voted --I'm just waiting for the 
    time the politicals stage an election and noboy votes  --that is one
    of the few means of telling them we dont like what any of the 
    stooges will actually do when elected.
