I applaud this clear, sensible, and correct statement.  Nicely put, Jeff.

I don't think it's fair for Greg to characterize our approach as
"security is a product".  Quite the contrary, we keep talking about
security as a *process*.  It's made up of multiple layers, which may
include digital signatures, encryption, hard-to-sniff identifiers,
out-of-band mechanisms, confirmation loops, vigorous investigation of
attempted fraud, and probably many other things, not to mention more
"traditional" aspects of server-level security.  -- Nathaniel
