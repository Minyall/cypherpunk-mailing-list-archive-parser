Only outlaws will have books...

Just watching the news here in Fl. and they are trying to hold a publisher
responsible for a murder because they published a fictional account of a
hitman and a guy says he used the book to kill some people.

Would you give your 6 year old a book ?

This is really getting out of hand.. Anyone have any property for sale in
Idaho ?
