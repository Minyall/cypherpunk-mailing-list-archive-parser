This is not universally true. Everyone doesn't have access to
a functional News server or even to the Web, and some interesting
stuff could come from closed commercial sites etc.

But even if everyone had global access, I think there is a place for
forwarded articles on the CP list. It's a convenient way to keep
up with the happenings to passively watch on-topic items drop into
one's mailbox or to be able to request longer pieces with very few
keystrokes, jya-style. The most lazy of us will hardly even light
up our browsers for a maybe-interesting URL.

The problem is off-topic or quasi-on-topic forwards, including EPIC/EFF
kind of announcements. And all forwards would benefit from a personal
comment by the forwarder (at the beginning of the mail, NOT after the
10 screens document) where he explains what is interesting cp-wise.
