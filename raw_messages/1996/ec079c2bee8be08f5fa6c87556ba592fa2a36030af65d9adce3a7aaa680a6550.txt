Okay this is on-list because I have propagated disinformation
and I'm trying to propagate the correction:  for some reason
I, and apparently E. ALLEN SMITH, got a copy of Black Uni's
key which was devoid of signatures of any kind.  My
complaint was that this made it utterly open to MITM
attacks.  I was mistaken about Uni's key's lack of
signatures though, and I apologized for saying the above.


Actually, Black Uni's key via finger has two signatures (not
counting his own): Sandy Sandfort (whose key has no 
signatures, as far as my copy of it goes), and 
loki@obscura.com (whose key has 22 signatures, only 3 of 
which are from keys that I can find copies of not counting
loki's own).


more later,

Bryce
