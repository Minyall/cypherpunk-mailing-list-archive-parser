The thing is that at "best" the Iphone people (et al), are sell
Equipment!. NO ONE is SELLING phone service.. I mean Selling phone
service means some guy in NYC putting a sign on a store front offering
10 cents a minute calls "anyway where in the world."

When you or I use Iphone (etc), we are not selling anything.. Tarrifs
are for Selling.. Not "personal use." The only one selling anything is
IDT with there plans to have Iphone like calls start in the US go to
europe via the Internet and then switch them to regular POTS lines for
the call completion..

Any Legal options here?

Btw. the worst thing is all the phone companies are very very good
a lobbying... congress, the FCC, etc.

ALso once FCC regulations something commmerical speach becomes "restricted."
Eg., tobbaco ads..
