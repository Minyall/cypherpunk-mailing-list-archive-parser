No, you misunderstood.  The RF wouldn't be transmitted on the inside of the 
pipes (how could it get inside, anyway?) but on the outside.  Since most 
information-containing appliances are well-grounded, there is at least a 
strong possibility that a ground connection would carry enough interesting 
RF to be useful to tap.
