I also got one of these right after I posted to cypherpunks.  I
normally just lurk, and the address that was used is the machine I
read and post news on(we have a gateway to the mailing list).  So I am
pretty sure it is related to my posting to cypherpunks.  

I have written to the administrators at anon.penet.fi asking about this
and informing them.  I'll pass on any relevant info they send me.
