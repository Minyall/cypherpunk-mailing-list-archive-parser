I would suggest a much simpler technique.

Explain to them the next time you point out a flaw, that you will be
explaining these flaws by publishing exploits in the local newspaper,
and that all future flaws will be explained in the newspapers until
such time as they begin to take you seriously.

Don't bother. Just describe the flaws in public enough, and then you
have no risk because you are not committing a crime, and you have a
gain because you get an increase in your reputation for supplying
accurate information.
