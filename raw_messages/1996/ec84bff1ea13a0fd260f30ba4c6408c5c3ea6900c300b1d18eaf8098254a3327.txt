Ah yes, but software without hardware doesn't do much.  Wires are
expensive, and in many places you can't string them across public
right-of-ways.  The distance from my house to my neighbor across the street
is less than 200 feet.  I suspect some form of optical link would work
fairly well.  I also think it would be hard to tap.

I think my point is, don't throw something out of your tool bag just
because you can't use it everywhere.
