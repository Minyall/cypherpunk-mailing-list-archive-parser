It seems a bit strange that PGP Inc. is so fastidious about enforcing
intellectual property claims, given the treatment of RSA Data Security
Inc.'s similar property claims a few years ago.

In other words, I don't worry for one nanosecond about "infringing" on PGP
Inc.'s claimed property rights.

Nothing personal.
