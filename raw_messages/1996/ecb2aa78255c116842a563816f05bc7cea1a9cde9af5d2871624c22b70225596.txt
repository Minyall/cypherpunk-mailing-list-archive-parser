The 90-bit key length is for secret key ciphers, not public key
ciphers.  There is a conversion metric for public key ciphers based
upon the difficulty of breaking the cipher.

For example, a 1024 bit RSA key is about 85 bits of security, which is
below the 90-bit limit they are proposing.  The 90-bits of security
does not mean you are limited to a 90-bit RSA key.
