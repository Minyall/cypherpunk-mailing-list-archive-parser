	If non-subscribers, aka remailers are banned from cypherpunks,
I'll personally subscribe every remailer to the list.  Be a good
exercise in writing filters for the remailers.

	Saying that you can't deal with immature people using
remailers, and thus they should be banned from cypherpunks is ammo to
our opponents, who will sieze the opportunity to say, 'See, even
cypherpunks can't deal with anonymity.'

	The list has gone way downhill, but offers a forum unavailable
elsewhere online.  As Tim points out, you can contribute or leave.
I'm trying to contribute.

	As a basic rule of thumb, if your posts are generating lots of
flames, you're not contributing, you're arguing.  (He says to generate
flames.)
