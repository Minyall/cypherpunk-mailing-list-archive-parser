In my dealings with Platt's office, I discovered an interesting thing.
His staffers are retired people, who have no mailboxes at HP, and who
you reach only through a single individual, kinda like the concept of
compartmentalization used in military operations.

And believe me, that isn't the only peculiar thing going on there.

Let's just say that HP is a shrewd survivor in a sea of nasty predators.
