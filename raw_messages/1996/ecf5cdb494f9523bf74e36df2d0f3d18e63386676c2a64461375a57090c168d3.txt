Its not an admin's point of view thats worrisome.  Whats worrisome is
that the routers at the core of the net only have so much memory, and
if the routing tables grow beyond that, we're all hosed, becuase the
core of the internet will start thrashing.  So, in essense, you taking
your network address with you when you switch providers ('address
portability' causes costs that must be borne by the entire global
internet.

	Good question.  I think the address allocation just went to
last call, which means that we should have a policy for getting IPv6
addresses pretty soon.  After that, you need to wait for your router
vendor to announce an IPv6 capable version.  I'd guess it will be six
to eighteen months before you can call Netcom and ask for an IPv6 PPP
connection.
