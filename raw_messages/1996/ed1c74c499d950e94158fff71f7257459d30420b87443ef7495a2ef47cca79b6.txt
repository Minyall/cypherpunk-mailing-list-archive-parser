This is particularly problematic... if the mainland Chinese gov't 
requested a key from a N.Amercian or European (or even UN controlled) 
escrow agency, who is to say it isn't really for political reasons 
(even though they may claim the persons are drug smugglers)?

Or what if the 'crime' was, say, discussing Mormon beliefs, which is 
illegal in Singapore (and I think Russia as well)?

Or what if some terrorist was using keys escrowed in a country that 
sponsered terrorist acts?
