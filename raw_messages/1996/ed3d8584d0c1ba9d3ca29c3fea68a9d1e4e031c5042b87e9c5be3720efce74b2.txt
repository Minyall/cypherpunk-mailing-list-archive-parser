I agree.  Having a return address outside the signature allows for denial-of-
service attacks and it would be trivial to intercept the output of the script.
Definitely not a Good Thing.

There are a couple of problems with this idea:

	- The security of this scheme depends on trusting the user to sign her
	key.  If the user doesn't, than an attacker can intercept the user's
	key and alter the key ID.

	- Even if the user does sign her key, there is still the problem of
	an attacker being able to generate a key with an identical key ID and
	and a different user ID.  If the attacker has the ability to intercept
	and modify messages, a MITM attack would be very effective.  If the
	key's fingerprint was included in the signed message, an MITM attack
	would be necessary to subvert the system.

If the key's fingerprint is included in the message, then it certainly wouldn't
take much more effort to put a return address in the signed body of the
message.
