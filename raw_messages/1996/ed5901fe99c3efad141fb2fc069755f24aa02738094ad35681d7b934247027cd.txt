I agree that Dr.Dobb's ain't what it used to was (they mention that Bruce
Scheneier is a contributing editor - a bad sign), but this issue was
worth getting.

1. A very interesting interview with Eva Bozoki, chief scientist as
Digital Secure Networks Technology. Among other fascinating stuff
she complains about export controls.

2. "The RIPEMD-160 Cryptographic Hash Function" (with C source code).

3. A nice article explaining Reed-Solomon error correction, with
nice-looking C source code.

4. An announcement of a free compression library (the article only discusses
the APIs, not the internals).

5.  A discussion on hooking system calls in WinNT, allowing a program to
monitor system activity.

6. "Steganography for DOS programmers." Yes, it suggests putting data to
be hidden after a ctrl-Z, which hardly qualifies as stego, IMO. Not a
good article.

7. An article on extended MAPI 1.0 (I was looking for a place for crypto
hooks), announcing some inetersting code.

8. A discussing of publishing databases on the internet, including payment
systems.

9. A discussion if fractal-based compression (again, API's, not the guts).

Other interesting stuff with no crypto-relevance.

Byte magazine used to be very useful from the beginning to about '86,
when it turned into another Ziff-Davis clone. I have most of the issues
from that time filed somewhere. It's still relevant.

I guess good publications don't survive in the free market environment.
