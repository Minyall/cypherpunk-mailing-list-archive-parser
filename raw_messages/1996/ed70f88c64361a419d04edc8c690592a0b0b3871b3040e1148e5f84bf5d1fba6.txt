I have PGP, mixmaster, and several other crypto programs as well as X,
Netscape, the entire Linux kernel, and several other huge programs and files
that I never even use on my Linux system, and all of that takes up ~137 Mb.
A base Linux system takes up between 10 and 80 Mb, so Linux would fit quite
nicely on one of these disks.
