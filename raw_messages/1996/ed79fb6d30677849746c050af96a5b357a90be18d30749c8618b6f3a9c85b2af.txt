They are mutually recursive but the types of the relations are 
different.

Laws create rights	- argument in "is"
=> Should create good laws to protect valid rights.
			- argument in "ought"

Of course the two sentences don't say exactly the same thing, 
otherwise I would have written one.

If law did not have the potential to create rights there  would
not be the same duty of care for law creators.

I'll tell you what, ill admit that my original statement was
not of the clarity that I would ideally wish to achieve. But
I don't think that we need apply the criteria of a journal article
here. :-)

I don't think we have a problem with the statements conflicting,
there is an interaction. What a Hegelian would call dilectic. 
I prefer to use a different term for much the same reasons as
Sorros, the misuse of the term has created garbage that one
does not want to associate with (eg Historical materialism).
