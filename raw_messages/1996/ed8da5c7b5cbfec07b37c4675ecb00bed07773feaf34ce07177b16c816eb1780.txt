No he didn't.  It was CyberAngler (motto: "Trolling For 
Libertarian Cypherpunks Since Mid-April") that wrote that.
Attributions are important-- try not to mess them up again.

We aren't convincing him to shut up just by telling him that
we've heard his statist spiel before, are we?  His point
exactly!  He is trying to tell us that peer pressure isn't 
working to shut obnoxious people like him up, so stronger 
measures are needed.

It's a service industry.  An information service industry.  
Journalists, phone-sex whores, business consultants, 
bankers, brokers and barkers are moving into town, setting 
up their virtual shops, and catering to the hordes of 
readers, sightseers, sex-seekers, game-players, businessmen,
professionals and amateurs of all stripes that are pouring 
into town in wave after wave.


Granted most of these virtual shops consist of a single
ticket-taker's booth and a 10-meter tall neon facade.  
Granted that the shops occasionally collapse on visitors,
that there are no streets, that you can't tell the sellers
from the buyers and that few people are able to accept 
cash.


Still, it's a service industry.




more later,

Bryce
