I don't KNOW, but a reasonable speculation is because Netscape is a
complete operating package and RSAREF is a set of subroutines or (in the
case of MIT PGP, a pre/post processor). If, as I have often speculated, the
objective is to keep mass market software with strong crypto out of foreign
hands (and Netscape certainly qualifies given the number of copies out
there), then one would expect more stringent rules for it, the Microsoft
browser (when IT gets strong crypto), Lotus Notes, etc.
