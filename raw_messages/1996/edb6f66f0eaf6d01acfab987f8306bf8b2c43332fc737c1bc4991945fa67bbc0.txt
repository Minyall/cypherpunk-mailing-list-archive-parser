In case Aaron isn't the only one who was confused, the above is called 
sarcasm. No pun unintended. But for what it's worth, I've been told that 
the fun runs from 4:30 to 6 PM. The address is 870 Market St., near 
Powell, in S.F. Unfortunately, I'll probably be headed out of town by 
then, but say hello for me.

If you thought Dale was wacky, wait til you get a load of the 
senderistas.
