So would I.

I posted a message to alt.security.pgp and sci.crypt stating that "I had
found the release schedule for PGP 3.0 on page 16 of Applied Cryptography
(1st edition) and was wondering if had been updated for the second."  I got
lots of answers, but no one seemed to look at what was on page 16.  (It
happens to be the examples of incredibly huge numbers.)  No wonder I have so
little faith in that newsgroup...
