I wrote a perl script for such encrypted list.

It works the following way: suppose the list address is
somelist@someplace.com. The list owner generates a pgp key
with user name equal to "somelist@someplace.com". The public key gets
sent to all list participants.

The members, in turn, submit their public keys to the maintainer.
He lists their email addresses in the "subscribers" file. 

The perl script gets invoked from procmail. It decodes the incoming
message.  If an incoming message is not encrypted or cannot be decrypted,
the list processor returns it to the sender (this quickly teaches people 
to do encrypt their messages).

The script then encodes the message for each participant and sends it to
the recipients. 

What you need to run it: 

	- Perl 5
	- Perl 5 PGP module (it is quite crappy because it does not
          allow passphrases containing several words)
	- PGP
	- premail

have fun
