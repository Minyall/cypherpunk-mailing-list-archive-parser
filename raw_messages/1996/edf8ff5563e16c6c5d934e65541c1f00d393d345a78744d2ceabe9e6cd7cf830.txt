Anon.lcs.mit.edu does not perform ident lookups, does not add
Received: headers, and runs at log level 1 (only "Serious system
failures and potential security problems" logged, according to the
sendmail manual).

This is useful for testing things out anonymously, but I don't
understand why you would want to use it an a regular basis.  Why don't
you send your mail directly from your home machine to the first
remailer hop?  Nothing is forcing you to send outgoing mail through
your ISP's mail server or any other one particular mail server.  Why
would you want to do that in the first place?
