They're really looking desperate, aren't they? They try to limit the export
of crypto software, they try to limit the export of anything with "hooks"
for adding crypto outside the U.S., they try to limit export of crypto
knowledge, and here they're even trying to limit _signing_ software?

What's next? Maybe they'll try to limit the dispensing of _legal advice_ by
U.S. attorneys to foreign clients.

(I keep using the phrase "they try to" becuase obviously few of these
schemes to keep the horses in the barn will work.)

It's looking more and more obvious that crypto development belongs outside
the U.S. (is this observation a controlled item?).
