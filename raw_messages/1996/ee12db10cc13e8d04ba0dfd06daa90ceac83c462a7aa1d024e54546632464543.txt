Ah. So, why settle the transactions for digital cash and skip all that
overhead? Yet another application for micromoney.

It seems to me that I've been arguing -- for two years now -- that digital
bearer certificate settlement will prove to be *much* cheaper than
book-entry settlement, and here the answer's been looking at us, straight
in the face, all this time.

Anybody have any ideas how to go about measuring the savings between
accumulating, storing, and processing call-billing data and simply paying
for them  before/during/after the call with digital cash?

I hear this strange rumbling underground. Hey, isn't that "Dad" Joiner?

Cheers,
