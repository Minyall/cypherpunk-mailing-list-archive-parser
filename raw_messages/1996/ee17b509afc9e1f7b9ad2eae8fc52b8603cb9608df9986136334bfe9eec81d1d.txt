OK, let's try this again:  Is it your position that the hardest part of
the attack we've outlined is the large-scale infection of consumer's
machines with untrusted code, using a virus, Trojan Horse, or some other
method?  And that this attack is not serious because doing that is
prohibitively difficult?  If so, I agree with the first claim but not
the second.  But I'm really trying to get clear about your position
here.  -- Nathaniel
