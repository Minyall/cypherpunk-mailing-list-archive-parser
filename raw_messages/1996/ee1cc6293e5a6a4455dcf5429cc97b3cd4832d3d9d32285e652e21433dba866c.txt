That is only true if they find a way to crack Netscape's software
distribution security from overseas, or somehow found a user machine with
the software on it and cracked IT. IF the thing leaks it is much more
likely because someone on our side of the border was complicit.

Do I _think_ it will stay on this side of the border? Of course not. But
any leaked copies will be illicit and won't be in the "mass" market of
non-US Netscape versions. I think the government realizes this and the
safeguards are designed to deal with the mass of overseas users, not the
odd clever hacker and his friends.
