You hadn't heard?

Sadly, John Gage was run over in the Sun Microsystems parking lot two weeks
ago.
The driver was not apprehended, but an APB for hit-and-run is out on black
Ford  Contintental with the license plate "WeBeSpooks."

Jim Bidzos was narrowly missed by the same car, and now supports GAK.

that the National Security Agency would try to twist their technology."
