Why bother with theory?  By January sometime, I ought to have my own
personal set of numbers finalized. My mate and I are caring for three
orphaned children, we both work (good paying corporate jobs), yet it
appears we'll be collecting at least $1400 per month tax-free for the
kiddies, from various agencies, not including medical/dental benefits.

I'd guess the medical/dental will be worth $300, so $1700 divided by
172.5 (or 173.33) work hours is $9.80 to $9.85 per hour after taxes.
Imagine what it would be if we were also collecting for the grownups.

This is in the greater L.A. area.  It looks like the bigger the family,
i.e., the more dependents, the bigger the income.  Does this hold true
elsewhere?
