Subject: EzStego in Java!: Now Disappearing At A Site Near You

EzStego, my tool for "steganography made easy", now has its own web site at
http://www.fqa.com/ezstego/

EzStego is currently alpha software. Use it at your own risk. It is a
reimplementation in Java, with much improvement, of my notorious shareware
product, Stego. EzStego is also shareware. I have made the source code
available for peer review and verification.
