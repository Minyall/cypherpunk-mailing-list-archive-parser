Thats why people are supposed to use the web of trust to check the
keys. You claim to make your key available by finger. How do you know
that Mallet isn't switching the bits as they go down the wire to your
correspondants? The only way to verify a key is to check known good
signatures on it. Because of this, no security is needed on key
storage facilities per se -- you aren't supposed to trust keys without
signatures.

Geesh. I thought this was obvious. I guess not.
