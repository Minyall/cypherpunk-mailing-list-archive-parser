We require people who have syphilis to divulge who their sex partners
were. I don't know if it's a good idea or not, but I haven't heard of any
activist movement against it in the past 80-odd years it's been in effect. 

We require property owners who don't have city-sewage hookups, to install 
their septic tanks and maintain them in certain defined configurations 
which estop them from contaminating the neighbor's well. I don't know if 
that's a good idea or not - but I haven't seen sentiment against sewage 
regulation of property owners.


So why should we be terribly upset about an ordinance which makes it 
illegal to operate a residential kitchen and a residential sewge-disposal 
operation in a city park or a city sidewalk?
