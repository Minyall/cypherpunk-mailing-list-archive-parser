To follow up the GNN report on Net espionage and NSA 
sniffing:


For a quick overview of the prime sites for sniffing, see
the informative map of the major US NAP's, routers and
interconnections at:

   http://www.cerf.net/cerfnet/about/interconnects.html


MAE-East, MAE-West, MAE-Chicago and others are detailed
at:

AltaVista offers more about the Routing Arbiter project -
- for examples, www.ra.net; rrdb.ra.net; rrdb.merit.edu;
isi.com -- as well as about FIX-East and FIX-West, 
various NAP's and the international exchanges and 
routers.


Is there technology for eluding these espionage-enabled
chokepoints -- tunneling, satellite-richochet or 
otherwise?


The newly announced Planet 1 personal satellite phone
system, $2,500 a unit, could it provide secure privacy 
off the heirarchical telecomm throttle? Or, are all
options slowly being shutdown by regulated greed?
