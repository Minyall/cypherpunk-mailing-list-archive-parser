So much the worse.

I don't think its a good idea to download random programs and run them
without even realizing it, especially when they run in an execution
environment which is not particularly emasculated. I don't think this
can be made particularly secure in the general case. It is a bad
paradigm. I've said it before, and everything we've seen thus far
about Java supports my contention.
