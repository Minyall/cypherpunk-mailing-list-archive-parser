Assasination politics is  impossible to defend from a classical 
Liberal/Libertarian position. Bell advocates arbitrary applications of 
violence and coercion without restriction. There is no way to justify the 
initiation of force without abandoning any pretence of being a 
Libertarian (which, to be fair, Bell doesn't claim to be).
