Welcome to the list.

Yes my high school Civics class was good.  So were my law school Con Law
courses.

Yes, David I would say you practice "contumely" -- Rudeness or contempt
arising from arrogance; insolence.  But then so do I.

I'll say again, the Preamble speaks of the reasons the drafters of the
Constitution had for writing the thing, it does not set forth any powers of
the federal government.  Goals not means.  GAK is a means not a goal.
