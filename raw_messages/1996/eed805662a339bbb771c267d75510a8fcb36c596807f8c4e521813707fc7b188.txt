	Mea culpa.  Morton Grove is right.

	In the case of Kennesaw, if you had a personal objection 
	to having a handgun -- or any other weapon --- in your home,
	you were automatically exempt.  If federal, or state law 
	prohibited you from owning a weapon, you were also exempt.  

	Also note that the official city policy was to not enforce
	that specific law.  It was a purely symbolic thing, which
	did have some interesting side-effects.

VapourWare is like the Tao,
Looked for it cannot be found,
Reached for it cannot be touched,
Waited for not even FedX can deliver;
