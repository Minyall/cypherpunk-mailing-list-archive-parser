   "Error-Correcting Codes Keeps Quantum Computers on Track"

   Commentary by Barry Cipra on Peter Shor's error-correction
   scheme for quantum systems (published last year in Phys Rev
   A) and his subsequent work with Rob Calderbank at AT&T
   Research on "quantum analogs of other more powerful codes
   that can correct multiple errors in long strings of bits."

   And cites work of others who are following Shor's lead --
   Seth Lloyd at MIT, IBM, LANL, Oxford: "Quantum computers 
   may be getting closer to reality."
