Sorry, not a chance. The symmetric cipher used in Ecash is 3DES. Since 
DigiCash has the good fortune to be located in The Netherlands, full 
strength crypto can be (and is) used in all their products.

I would advise any company suffering from a loss of competitiveness due to 
US export regulations to do the logical thing and move their operation 
to a more suitable location.
