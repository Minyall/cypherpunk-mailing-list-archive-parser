Hi Dale.  I believe I've seen you around.  Thanks for replying
to my article.

Can you "to wit" one or two more times, here?  I'm not sure
what idea is being twisted into what other idea and which
philosophical purpose this twisting serves.  But I'm curious.

Hm.  So if you send an email into the ether with 
"Cc: cypherpunks@toad.com" and "Subject: MAKE MONEY REALLY
TRULY FAST!", then you share no responsibility for the fact
that a copy of that email is going to arrive in the inboxes of
thousands of subscribers?


Okay, it could be an interesting discussion, but what's your
point?  


My point was (and is) that neither you nor I have any kind of
_right_ to access the services of toad.com against John's
will.  Seems like a very simple point (deceptively simple, one
might say...), but I recall several people, including Dale
Thorn, opining that Dmitri Vulis _did_ have the right to access
those services with or without John's consent.


What gives?


Regards,

Bryce
