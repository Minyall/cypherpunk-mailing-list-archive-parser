regarding remailer spams:

one way to prevent this sort of spamming is to put a cap on the number
of messages that can be delivered to a given address.  of course, an
exception will have to be made for instances of chaining so that the
number of messages allowed to be forwarded to another remailer is not
limited.  

i'm trying to think of a scenario where this would not be a good
thing.  i suppose if somone was conducting an anonymous poll their
address should not have a limit.

i'm sure there are problems with a mesg quota system, but it does seem
like an easy solution.
