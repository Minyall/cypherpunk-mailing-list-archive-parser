"Me too," though I recently created a 512-bit key just for the purpose of
such insecure signing. As long as people understand that that key simply
means "this is either me, or someone who has gone to the trouble of cracking
root here, or someone who spent a couple weeks brute-forcing this key," it's
useful to prevent casual attacks.

Several others are doing the same thing... I know all the NoCeM posters and
most of the newsgroup moderators using PGPMoose have created suuch secondary
keys.
