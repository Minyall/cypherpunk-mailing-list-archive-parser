The insurance companies have every reason to perform "Utilization Reviews",
since only they have incentive to contain costs.  Our medical plans tend to
insure for routine medical care and as a result, give the insurance
companies the data about our routine care.  If they only paid for
catastrophic illness and accident care, they would only have reason to have
data on that care.

Do you want to share the risk of routine medical care?  Or do you just want
to share the risk of catastrophic illnesses and accidents?  Or do you want
to keep it all private.  What you pay for, you can keep private.  What they
pay for, they can review.  Your choice.
