You are right. Wages are determined by the productivity of labor. But the productivity of labor in its turn is for a large part determined by the amount of capital invested. So, there is no contradiction here.

I think you're probably right again, but I never said that the average American is poorer now than in 1970. Again, no contradiction here.
