If you can hack your TCP implementation, you should be able (with a high
probability) stego information in a few bits of the TCP checksum by
adjusting the packet boundries of the TCP stream.  An error correcting code
protocol would cover the cases where you couldn't get that *%$# bit set
correctly.  Please note that this technique would not result in TCP
checksum errors.
