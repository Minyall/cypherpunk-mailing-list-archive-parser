   3-29-96 NYT reports on the Montana Freemen's competition
   with the USG: printing money and fostering free market
   brigandry; building arsenals for terrorizing the weak and
   suppressing dissent; amassing national security treasure
   for the protection of the people; and PC education to boot.

   The USG, looking in the mirror, says such actions are a
   criminal conspiracy, a "school for crime."
