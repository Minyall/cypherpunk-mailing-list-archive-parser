	I'd say Oyvind is right. 

	If you can't speak Spanish the only jobs available in
	Southern Florida are with the federal government.

	If you can't speak French, you can't get a job in 
	northern New Hampshire, or northern Vermont. 

	One other advantage to knowing a language other than
	English.  Legal encryption.  << Unless a federal law
	bans the
	use of any language other than English for any purpose,
	which would be a violation of NAFTA, not that the US hasn't 
	allready violated NAFTA. >> 
 
	So if the use of encryption is banned, just switch to writing
	everything in something like Xhosa, or Chinese, using the
	Wade Giles transliteration, or Dervish.  << Heck, do all
	your important stuff in languages like that, and then 
	encrypt it with PGP.  Would the cryptanalysts recognise
	the plain text, even if they had it?  >>
