I downloaded this, and I notice you don't have a "makefile.linux".  Is that
just because no one's bothered to make one, or does Linux Atlas actually
not support plugins at all?  (Quickly checking the binary...)  I see that
Linux Atlas is still a.out.  Ick.  That would make supporting plugins
pretty tough.  If it were in ELF, things would be _way_ easier; in fact,
I'd probably say trivial (but that's just me).

I'd venture a guess that most people who have a Linux box sufficiently cool
to run netscape at all, have the ability to run ELF.  In fact, there are
probably a lot of people (like everyone who bought Slackware 3.0 or a recent
RedHat) for which netscape is the _only_ a.out binary on their system.

The reason I'm pointing this out is (obviously) because Linux is my main
development platform, and I'd like to be able to try writing plugins
for things like crypto and ecash.
