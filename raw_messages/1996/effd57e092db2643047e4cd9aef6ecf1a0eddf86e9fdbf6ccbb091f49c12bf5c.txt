How many people trust clients?  If we wanted clients, we would use WebStor
from Mcaffee.  I don't trust any clients specific to one task, and would

In some countries, when the government jails someone, it doesn't matter
what evidence they have.  Not everyone has a justice system that at least
makes an attempt to give a fair trial.
