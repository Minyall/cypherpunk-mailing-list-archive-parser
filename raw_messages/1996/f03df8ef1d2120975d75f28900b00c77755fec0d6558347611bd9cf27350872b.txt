Sure.  Here is the beginning of the press release:

   to Enable Wide Scale Software Electronic Commerce

   Westwood, MA - May 7, 1996 - Supported by AT&T,IBM , First Data,
   Microsoft Stream International Inc. and LitleNet in association

   various industry approaches, to be operational in test mode by late
   1996...
