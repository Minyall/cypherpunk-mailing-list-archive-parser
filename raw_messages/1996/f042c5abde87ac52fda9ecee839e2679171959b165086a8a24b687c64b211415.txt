While I might put it in a somewhat less insulting manner, the central
thesis here is correct.  Society consists basically of a few percent 
of the people who see things one way because of strong ideological 
reasons.  This is balanced by another few percent who see things
the exact opposite because of strong ideological reasons.  

The remainder of the population generally follows whomever is perceived
to be running things.

Such people may safely be ignored during any revolution, although it 
is probably not a bright idea to use terms like "working class trash"
when describing them.
