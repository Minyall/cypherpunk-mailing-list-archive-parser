        well, if we can get Dimitri to be the victim, I would enjoy 
    nothing more than exercising some well honed skills of cynicism,

        of course, that assumes you will tolerate a roast where the
    stated goal is his resignation from the list; maybe we can send him
    off to Perry who apparently has become too personally disgruntled to

        several literate assaults managed to clear Dr. Fred from the 
    list.  Dimitri just does not know when to quit.
