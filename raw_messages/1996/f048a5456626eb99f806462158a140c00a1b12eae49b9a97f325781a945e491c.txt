And I recall from my history classes that the _official_ name of that war
was "The War of the Rebellion," which of course comes closer to Dale's
point about the war being about an attempted secession, which no serious
scholar doubts it was about. (Another common name: The War Between the
States. The "Civil War" is far and away the most common name, but is, as
Dale notes, highly misleading. The winner gets to write the history books,
though.)

(Oh, it was "about" lots of things, things we all studied in high school.
Cotten, tariffs, and the right not to have to teach children in Ebonics.)

By the way, I'll be off the list for a while, for the usual seasonal
reasaons. Ignore the usual Vulis remarks about how my silence means he has
succeeded in driving me off the list, or that I'm in a tryst with Gilmore
and Hughes.

As to subjects discussed on the list, it's interesting that my very much
"on-topic" post on extortion and untraceable payments, a very long post,
has generated not a single response, while the "Ebonics" thread be cookin
and jivin. I be dissed by dis shit.

(Anyone who claims only crypto- or digicash-related sorts of posts are what
the list should talk about should note the dynamics of these threads.)

By the way, both Jesse Jackson and famed poetess Maya Angelou have
denounced the Oakland School Board's adoption of "Ebonics" as shameful and
a travesty. Jackson said black children should not be encouraged to speak
"garbage."
