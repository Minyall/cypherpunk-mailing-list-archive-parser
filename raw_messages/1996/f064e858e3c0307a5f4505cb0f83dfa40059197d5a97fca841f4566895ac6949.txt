Neat trick, unless they're using biometrics, which doesn't appear to be the
case :}

I think they just said it best themselves, but I'll comment a bit more....

All under NDA, I suppose. Note that they don't even name an "informed expert of
the technology"; at least the POTP people gave some names.

Clearly they (claim to) offer some sort of system using One Time Pads.
Notice the price quote of "$15.00 per user, per network, per month" including
"unlimited Nvelopes and Nvelopeners". I suspect this means that they're
basically selling chunks of (pseudo- ?)random data for as much as $15/person 
each month !  I guess it's nice work if you can get it. At that price, one
would hope that they're at least generating truly random bits from a hardware
source. But their skimpy details on their proprietary processes don't
inspire confidence....

In case you didn't get enough hyperbole from the press release, they have
extra helpings on the Web. This site has numerous pages containing precious
little real information. I found a few tidbits in unlikely places, though:

In http://www.netprivacy.com/ipg/mlmplan.html, which incidentally promises
that they "can help you to make some big bucks through the PCX Nvelopes
Multi - Level - Marketing Plan", it says:

This is actually a little scary. According to one of their other web pages, 
the DIR.LST file is a numbered list of user names and email addresses. So it
appears that a customer hands over a list of names and addresses, and IPG
assigns a set of one-time pads (or something) to each pair of users on the 
list. (Holy combinatorial explosion.) And now IPG knows the one-time pads that
will be used between any pair of email addresses on the list it has !  
The EES is starting to look attractive by comparison.

Gee, why are we all so worried about key management ?  It's just a load and
go installation at each of the user sites !  ;)

"not easily transportable, to say the least" ???  
Any ideas to what this might refer ?

OK, I saved (IMHO) the best for last. I suppose this could be taken as a claim
about their proprietary, immobile RNG methods:
