How about the sender provides a Digicash e-cash payment for the
appropriate amount with each message, kind of like a electronic postage
stamp?  A script on the receiving side could automatically check the
payment amount, bouncing the message back to sender with an
"insufficient payment" message if necessary.  Or you could use a web
page to submit messages and payments.  Either way no one needs to worry
about billing, account tracking, etc.  Payment/billing is taken care of
immediately.  Of course, there is some overhead with the fees on e-cash,
but it probably would be more cost effective than other methods.


P.S. I have an alpha version of a program which may be of interest to
technomads: it automatically executes scripts received by email from a
remote machine and then mails back the results.  The scripts (shell
scripts, perl scripts, or whatever) are encrypted and signed with PGP
before being sent to provide security and prevent unauthorized users
from executing scripts on your machine.  The program runs on unix
systems, and submissions can be from anything that runs PGP and is able
to send email.  See:

for more info.
