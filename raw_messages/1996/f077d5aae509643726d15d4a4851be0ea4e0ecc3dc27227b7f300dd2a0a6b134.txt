Fred Cohen did not coin the term. "The Shockwave Rider" explicitly
refers to viruses in addition to worms -- indeed, the main character
at several points uses a "phage" (i.e. a virus) to eliminate
information about himself from the global communications
network. Other people used the term "virus" in a number of similar
contexts long before Fred Cohen.
