Oh, sure. How, exactly, could you do that? I can't think of a way to
build a CPU to do such a thing. What would it do? I mean, if it
checked a signature before booting, you could just halt the clock,
reach in to RAM, and alter the contents of the OS after boot. Its
both meaningless and impossible for it to check signatures on
individual instructions.
