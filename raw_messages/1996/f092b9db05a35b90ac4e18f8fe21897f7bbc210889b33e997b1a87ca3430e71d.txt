A Microsoft person just responded via direct e-mail that they'll do
CAPI signing in the United States (the word "only" wasn't in there,
but that certainly was the implication).  This means, to me, that
there won't be much CAPI-compliant software produced outside the US,
or at least that people who do it will have to bear that insult.  It's
reminiscent of the Lotus thing.

I see no reason for Microsoft to be reluctant to have non-USA
signings other than fear of USGov reprisals.
