This should be my last comment to the list in this thread...

Even if 99% of Germans don't wish to be on the net, and 1% do, it would be
an honorable thing to help that 1%; e.g. by providing the tools to
circumvent their laws that we consider to be unjust. IMO, It's not fair to
blame each and every inhabitant of a country for the actions of their
government, even if it's democratically elected.

So, develop the tools to make the (illegal) flow of information easier and
the prosecution more difficult. E.g., the former Soviet Union couldn't stop
its people from listening to Western propaganda on short-wave radio,
although it was illegal, and more repressive governments did confiscate all
short-wave radios in the past.
