>WHO IS AFFECTED BY THIS ALERT?
>------------------------------
>
>Users of Netscape Navigator 2.0 or 2.01.  To determine what version of
>Netscape you are running, do the following:
>
>     1.  Open Netscape Navigator.
>     2.  Pull down the Help menu.
>     3.  Click on About Netscape.

>
>WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?
>--------------------
>
>There have been reports lately of a hostile Java applet (a Black Widow
>Java applet called JAVA) that is downloaded and executed automatically
>when certain sites are visited with Netscape versions 2.0 or 2.01.  Java
>applets are small applications that are automatically started when you
>access certain web pages.  This particular Java applet is a malicious
>program that can destroy data, interfere with your network, and possibly
>even upload sensitive material to a third party.
>
>WHAT SHOULD YOU DO?
>-------------------
>
>Upgrade to Netscape Navigator 2.02.
>
>
>WHAT SHOULD YOU DO IF YOU CAN'T DOWNLOAD VERSION 2.02 RIGHT NOW?
>----------------------------------------------------------------
>
>You can temporarily protect your PC or Macintosh by disabling the Java
>functionality.  However, this should only be a short-term fix as many
>legitimate web sites make use of Java applets.  To disable the use of
>Java applets, do the following:
>
>     1.  Open Netscape Navigator.
>     2.  Pull down the Options menu.
>     3.  Click on Security Preferences.
>     4.  Under General, place a "X" in the Disable Java and the
>         Disable Java Script boxes in the Java window.  Click on OK.
>
>After upgrading to the latest version of Netscape Navigator (version
>2.02), re-enable the Java applets by doing the following:
>
>     1.  Open Netscape Navigator.
>     2.  Pull down the Options menu.
>     3.  Click on Security Preferences.
>     4.  Under General, remove the "X" in the Disable Java and the
>         Disable Java Script boxes in the Java window.  Click on OK.
