This is something that seems to be a little problematic to me. Considering
the 3-minute time slot, it seems fairly easy to somehow block the SecurID
server at the time a user is sending his username/passcode, steal that
information and allow a malicious user to enter that information into the
server. Or have I misunderstood some security aspects?
