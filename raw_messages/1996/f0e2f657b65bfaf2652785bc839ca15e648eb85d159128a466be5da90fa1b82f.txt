        and where does the average hacker find a reliable attorney in 
    these matters?  more likely you will find the usual charlatan 
    mouthpiece who will give it a whirl, be body-traded out, and still 
    take your money.
    
        and that is just what is so special about pro bono attorneys: 
    they have their soul on the line; and, even better, when the 
    horsepower has the folks at Baker & Hostetler behind them (even if 
    their head office is in Cleveland --my mother remembered Hostetler 
    when he helped his father deliver milk door to door in East 
    Cleveland (in the 1910s!))

        Absolutely! 

        Given the concept I propounded a few days ago that each Federal 
    District Judge is his own 'Judge Roy Bean, Law West of the Pecos," 
    he still has reference to the decision; he can either use it as the
    basis of the decision in his court, or he can ignore. If the case has        
    been to appeal and affirmed; and, Judge Roy is in the same appeals 
    circuit, an adverse decision is not likely to stand.

        What's the point?  PRECEDENCE!

        Bernstein (who hung on despite dealing with a mute point in his
    own case), the EFF, and all the <i> pro bono </i> attorneys who made
    the case successful are to be congratulated.  

        We, if we love our freedom, owe all of the players a rather large 
    debt of gratitude for blowing a hole in Fort Clinton.

        and, I will stand up and say "thank you!" any place I can.
