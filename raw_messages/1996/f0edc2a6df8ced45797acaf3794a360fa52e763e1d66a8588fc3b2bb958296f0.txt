Citing sources from 1978 in the computing field is a little like using
dictionaries from the 1800's to dictate modern English usage.  My desktop
machine has as much computing power as some colleges had during that era.
 We've come a long way, baby!  Yes, in the past, the term "byte" applied to
entities other than 8 bits, but "8 bits" IS the commonly accepted, standard
meaning of "byte" now, in the present.  The fact that the meaning and usage
of words can change over time is not relevant to current meaning and usage.
 Anyone who wishes to dispute this should study the etymology of the word
"gay."
