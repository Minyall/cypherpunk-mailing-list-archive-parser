Pretty much you are SOL.  To re-create the secring from the pubring
you need to find the secret components of your secret key.  The only
known way of doing that is factoring you key.  How big is it?  If it
is in the range of 384-512 bits, then we can probably reproduce your
secring in about a year.  If its any bigger than that, all you can
really do is generate a new key.

You don't want to generate a key that has the same keyID, since it
wont be able to decrypt any messages that the old one could anyways.

Enjoy!
