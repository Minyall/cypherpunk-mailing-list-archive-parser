Except that it goes against our normal definitions of random in a
crypto context. A string that is compressable might still be
random. There is no reason you can't have a string of 20 1 bits in
a row in a perfectly random sequence, for example. Usually, random
sequences are non-compressable, but it is possible (though very
improbable) for Hamlet to appear out of a random number generator,
and it is of course quite compressable...
