One method of protest against License Plate invasion of privacy is to 
simply not use license plates.  When I bought my car six years ago the 
front license plate was never drilled for license plate holes, so I 
simply took off the rear plate too, and in six months I only got two 
tickets for it, one for twenty dollars in Walnut Creek which I only had 
to pay, not needing to "fix the defect," and another on the Richmond 
Bridge, costing seventy six dollars because it was a fix it ticket which 
I didn't want to fix, and pulled over another time with only a warning.  
Not bad at all for California, has any one else practised this form of 
protest?  I had to put the rear plate back on though, because I acquired 
a drinking problem and I didn't want to get busted for drunk driving.
Now that I'm sober, and with worse threats concerning license plates, 
it's time to pull off that rear plate again!  Doing it tonight, join me!
