I didn't notice any specific reference to the difference between materials 
encrypted for long-term storage or transmission (data, email) and on the 
other hand audio telephone communications, the original stated application for the 
Clipper chip.  I can't see any reason that an individual would want the key 
to his own crypto telephone keys escrowed; unlike the key for data on a computer, 
which at least theoretically might be lost, the cryptophone data is by 
definition lost as soon as it is used.  Therefore, I can see no argument 
which would make a person support this key escrow for that purpose.  Since 
the whole system is supposed to be "voluntary", who is going to accept this?
