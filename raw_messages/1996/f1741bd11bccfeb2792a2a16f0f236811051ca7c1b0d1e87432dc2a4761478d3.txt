By popular request, I am following up on the three year old idea of the 
Cypherpunks Shooting Club. All Cypherpunks in the San Francisco Bay Area 
interested in participating are welcome to contact my by email. If enough 
individuals wish to participate, the first practice session 
will be held at the United Sportsmen Rifle Range in Concord this Sunday.

Bring your own firearm or use one of the ones provided.
