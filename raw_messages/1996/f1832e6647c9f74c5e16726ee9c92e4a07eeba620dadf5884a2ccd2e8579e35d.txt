Who says that such a proxy needs to be run on a different machine?  For UNIX
users with a SLIP/PPP connection, it is trivial to run a web proxy that could
be pointed to by web browser.  I believe that this is also possible for Mac
and Windoze users.  The point of the proxy is not to keep the user's username
or hostname anonymous, so it does not necessarily need to run on a seperate
host.
