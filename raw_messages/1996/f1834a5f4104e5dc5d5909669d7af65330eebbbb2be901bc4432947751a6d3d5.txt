When Microsoft announced their crypto API, they also announced that their 
signatures on crypto modules would be export-restricted.  According to 
e-mail I received from a Microsoft employee on the project, the act of 
signing was considered a "defense service" under ITAR, so exporting the 
signature would somehow be performing defense services for foreign 
persons.  It makes slightly less sense to me than the rest of the crypto 
export restrictions do, but I guess that's the deal that Microsoft worked 
out with the Feds in order to be allowed to do a crypto API at all.
