Ya gotta get yourself connected, as the Stereo MC's said.


Unfortunately I can't see anyway to gain trust in this
pseudonym since I don't believe that the ostensible owner,
name of "Black Unicorn", understands about how to establish
a strong pseudonym in the Web O Trust.


I mean, I could explain it to him, but not even counting the
difficulties of communicating such complex concepts among
humans, there is the fact that if Mitch is here, he can
prevent the real Uni from seeing the explanation, and he can
act in Black Uni's place as if he understands.  Then he can
go through the necessary steps to increase our trust in his
pubkey, as if Uni were going through them.


There would be only one problem for Mitch:  there would be
some knowledge shared by the facade Uni and the rest of us
that was not shared by the real Uni and the rest of us.
Forever into the future whenever this knowledge came up in
conversation Mitch would have to break automated-active-attack
mode and go into acting mode to prevent us from realizing
that we remembered history differently.


Wouldn't be cool if we could somehow make much of our
conversation depend on that shared memory in some
non-automatible way?  Then we could just recurse, making
more and more of the conversation depend on previous
conversation in a non-automatible way.  Eventually all of
our conversation would have to be acted by a human MITM
instead of just falsely digitally authenticated by an
automated MITM...


more later,

Bryce

P.S.
