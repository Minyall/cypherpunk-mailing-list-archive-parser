Wall Street Journal, 5/3/94:

"Our sources agree ... on a number of things:  
There was most likely a CIA-sponsored Contra operation run out of Mena, 
as well as a huge parallel cocaine-smuggling operation, money laundering 
and a Justice Department coverup.  Much of this happened on Mr. Clinton's 
watch as governor."

[...]

"Mr. Clinton was asked by a state prosecutor for help to pursue the case ...
Help was promised but never arrived."

[...]

"Mena is a perplexing and difficult story.  There is a trail - tens of 
millions of dollars in cocaine profits, and we don't know where it 
leads.  It is a trail that has been blocked by the National Security 
Council."
