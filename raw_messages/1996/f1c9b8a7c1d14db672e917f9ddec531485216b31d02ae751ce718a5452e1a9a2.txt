  One of the goals of a "Snake-Oil FAQ" as proposed is to gain as wide a
distribution as possible.  If a "blacklist" of products is put into the FAQ,
or if actual existing products are referred to a negative light, the
distribution of this FAQ will be severely limited.

  I also think that as a whole, this project is a good idea and a good
mini-project.  As crypto continues to spread, it is inevitable that "bad"
crypto will spread as well.  While these products will surely come and go
with the phases of the moon, some people will be undoubtedly be suckered and
soured towards crypto-technology in general. 

(sarcasm) "If it saves just one...." (\sarcasm) 

  It has been said before that the best way to counter noise is with signal.

  If one of the primary goals of cypherpunks is to encourage the widespread
use of strong crypto, then, by extension, it is important to discourage the
spread of "crappy crypto."
