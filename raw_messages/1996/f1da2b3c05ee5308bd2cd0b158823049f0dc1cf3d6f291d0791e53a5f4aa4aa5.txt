DCE is exported today, although without the ability to encrypt application
traffic.  Authentication and message integrity are in the export version.

    They are attacks against Diffie-Hellman. I don't know if DCE uses D-H
    in a similar manner. The main problem was too small a (fixed) modulus.
    
DCE RPC uses Kerberos V5 to establish DES session keys.
