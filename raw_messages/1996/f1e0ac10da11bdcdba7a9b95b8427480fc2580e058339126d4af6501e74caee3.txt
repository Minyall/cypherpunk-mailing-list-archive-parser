	But is "entitled to the number legally" meaning anyone who _must_
have the number legally (IRS & other government agencies, those dealing with
the IRS, etcetera), or anyone who can require it as a condition of doing
business? There is a difference between the two, at least according to the
Social Security Number FAQ that I last read.
