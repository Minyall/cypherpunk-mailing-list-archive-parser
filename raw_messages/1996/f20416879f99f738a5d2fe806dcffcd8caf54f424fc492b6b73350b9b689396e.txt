Short of 1) moderating the list or 2) restricting new subscriptions to the
list, it's almost impossible to prevent someone from posting to a
mailing list.  As soon as you "block" posts from one address, the
determined poster can sign up from another address.  All it takes
is paying money to a few ISPs, or changing his AOL userid.

The determined poster could even grab a subscriber list from the lists's
mailserver, and send his message to each member individually.
