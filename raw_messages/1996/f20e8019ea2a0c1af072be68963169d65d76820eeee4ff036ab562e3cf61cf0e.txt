   4-16-96. Jour:

   "Bidzos Holds Key to Guarding Internet Secrets."

      Mr. Bidzos has made shrewd deals to build a powerful
      franchise, but he has also angered the government's
      security apparatus and some of his own customers and
      partners. Mr. Bidzos has fended off the government with
      a mix of stratagems and chutzpah. Lynn McNulty, an ex-
      Commerce official, said Mr. Bidzos always found "the
      open door that we hadn't thought about locking." Adds
      NSAper Stew Baker, "Jim has made a career out of bashing
      the NSA."

   4-16-96. Fint:

   "A hacker's paradise. One computer on the Internet is
   broken into every 20 seconds."

      Despite a proliferation of computer security products
      ranging from "secure" server and browser software to
      firewalls, encryption and authentication schemes,
      computer break-ins are on the rise. Security experts say
      US Internet sites are under frequent attack by hackers
      from eastern Europe. But there are also now more than
      20,000 aggressive, deliberately destructive hackers in
      the US and the number is said to be growing at a minimum
      of 5 per cent per month. Ironically, as the number of
      sophisticated hackers rises, there is a dire shortage of
      computer security professionals.
