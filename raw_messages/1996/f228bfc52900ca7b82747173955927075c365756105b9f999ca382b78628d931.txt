An ISP that I have ties with  is looking to set up a secure server.  
Currently, they are running Apache.  I told them that for ~$500 they 
can put on Apache SSL and be all ready.  However, they want to buy 
Netscape (for the name, I've already given them the 40bit gospel), 
put it on a separate, firewalled machine, allow no access to it, etc, 
etc.  Is all this paranoia necessary?
