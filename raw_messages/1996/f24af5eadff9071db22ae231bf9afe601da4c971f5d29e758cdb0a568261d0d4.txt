I am not so much worried about the bank stealing money out of my account as I 
am worried about them loaning to deadbeat countries to support some 
governmental idea of foreign policy.  Then, of course, there is always the 
possibility that they will loan it to some deadbeat country, not because of the 
government, but because of just outright stupidity.
