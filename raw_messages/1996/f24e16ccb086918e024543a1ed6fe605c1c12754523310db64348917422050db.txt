There is division in the IETF community on this point.

Phil Karn (who I have the greatest respect for) thinks IPSEC means we
can get rid of the firewalls. I, for one, don't -- they are there
largely because people don't trust that their networking software is
free of security holes, and cryptography doesn't fix security holes
for the most part.
