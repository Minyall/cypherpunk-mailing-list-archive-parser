Yup. I agree with you here - every year Forbes puts out its list of the 
richest people in America. I'm too lazy to go digging under the coffee 
table to find the issue, but as I recall, a good number of the people on 
the list made their money the old-fasioned way - they inherited it.

Also - most people inthis country do not have true "wealth" - most are
fairly leveraged with mortgages and other loans, so their true net worth
is not all that high.

The "coupon-clipping" class is mostly "old money."
