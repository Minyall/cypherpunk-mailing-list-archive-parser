No David, there isn't.  That's because ITAR represents neither an
enumerated nor unenumerated right of the people.  The application
of ITAR to speech, however, is a violation of the 1st Amendment
which is enumerated.

You "accidentally" misquoted the 10th.  It actually says:

	The powers not delegated to the United States by the 
	Constitution nor prohibited by it to the States, are 
	reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.

See my explanation of the 9th Amendment, supra.

Wrong.  Everything quoted above was adopted prior to the adoption
of the Bill of Rights.  In other words, the 1st, 2nd,...9th and
10th AMENDMENTS came after and modify (or amend, get it?) the 
clauses you rely so much on.

Now I see you have "accidentally" forgotten to address my response
to your blatently unconstitutional assertion that I don't have
the right to say that the system is being abused.  Please defend
that assertion, or at least tell us how you think the 1st Amendment
is a nit.

Believe me, David, I don't think I could teach you anything.
