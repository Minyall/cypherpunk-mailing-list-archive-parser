Mitsubishi publicizes MISTY encryption algorithm 


Mitsubishi Electric Corp. said it has released the design 
principles for its data encryption algorithm MISTY. In 
doing so, the company can enlist third-party users to 
evaluate the integrity and power of its encryption 
algorithm and gain wider name recognition for MISTY.


To make evaluations easier, the company is also providing 
a sample program.


The existing de-facto world standard encryption algorithms 
DES and RSA were both developed in the U.S. But MISTY has advantages of its
own and Mitsubishi would like 
encryption experts around the world evaluate the program.

No information given on the source for the algorithm
or sample program. Anyone with the info care to share?
