A legal concern about GAK ...

What would be the basis for each and every request for GAK keys from
other nations?  What sort of process would decide which purposes are
okay for which to grant access to GAK keys?

What if it is to enforce this new Malaysian law against Karaoke (say,
because someone was importing karaoke equipment to Malaysia)?  It
seems like we should not be supporting other nations' repressive laws.
Is each and every GAK key to be granted to be carefully reviewed for
concerns on national security/foreign policy/repressive law/stupid
law?  If so, then it seems like a huge government beaurocracy will
have to be created just to handle proper review of GAK requests.

 KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 28, 1996 10:35 a.m. EDT) - Citing concerns about
 moral decay, the central Malaysian state of Selangor will close all
 illegal video games outlets and karaoke lounges from September 1, the
 national Bernama news agency reported on Wednesday.
 
 Licensed video games arcades will also be closed on expiry of their
 licences while the licensing conditions for karaoke lounges have been
 tightened, Bernama quoted Selangor's Chief Minister Muhammad Muhamad
 Taib as saying.
 
 As in many Asian countries, karaoke has become a popular recreation,
 resulting the mushrooming of lounges in many of Malaysia's
 cities. Officially Moslem Malaysia is vigilant for any erosion of
 moral standards among its youth.
