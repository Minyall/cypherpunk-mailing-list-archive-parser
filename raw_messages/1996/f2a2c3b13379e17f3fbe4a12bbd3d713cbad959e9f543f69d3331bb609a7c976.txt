I have it on quite good authority that I am an undercover plant for
Gharlane and all that I see and hear is being relayed to Higher Powers.
Unfortunately, my cover is so deep that I can have no conscious knowledge
of this, so I can neither confirm or deny the theory.

I do, however, have a very impressive black suit in my closet that I have
no memory of buying....

As for the VTW, I'm afraid you'll have to ask someone else.  I have a
strict rule against interfering with Illuminati operations.
