simple, not real secure solutions:

find a unix host, run the cern httpd server, turn on proxying, turn 
off logs. (about 10-15 minute setup) if this is not run often, it 
works well.

use netcom (or something similiar) that gives you dynamic ip 
addresses. as a bonus, netcom doesn't require an actual name or 
address. (yes, they require a CC#). this allows fairly anonymous 
access. (prehaps one reason the neeed for web proxies isn't that high)
