It is to be expected that among the citizens of this world, there would be 
those who have so much moral or economic stock in the current order that 
they would strongly resist any serious change. (maybe they're already on 
top, or they hope to be in a few years, etc.)   Until a few years ago, 
almost everybody probably figured that the main effect of computer 
networking (and the Internet) on politics would be to allow people to send 
letters to their Congressmen faster while destroying fewer trees, or letting people 
send in their votes by email rather than travelling to a voting booth.

Simple changes.  Non-threatening.  Don't rock the boat.  Don't upset the 
apple cart.  Don't make a wave.

It will be a great shock to most of you to hear that the real changes will 
not only be figuratively "revolutionary" but also LITERALLY revolutionary.

I guess this guy never heard about the 1st Amendment.  Or maybe he did, but 
he concluded that it must have been a mistake, because it's not the kind of 
thing that the people in charge today would vote for if they had a choice in 
the matter..
