1.  If "cooking" a byte sequence in a manner that reduces its maximum entropy
by less than 1% allows an attacker to break your cryptosystem, then it is
crap to begin with.  With only a little more effort, he could break it
anyway.

2.  All I was trying to say was that applying cooking technique X to a byte
sequence will reduce the maximum entropy of the sequence by a factor of Y;
adjust entropy expectations accordingly.  I said nothing about the origin of
the byte sequence, the techniques used to generate it, or the exact method
for "cooking" it.  I did not recommend against using hash distillation,
hardware RNG's, or any other commonly accepted method of generating
cryptographically useful random or pseudo-random numbers.
