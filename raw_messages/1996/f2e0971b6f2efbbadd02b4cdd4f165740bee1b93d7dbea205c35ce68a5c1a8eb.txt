                   By the rude bridge that arched the flood,
                        Their flag to April's breeze unfurled,
                   Here once the embattled farmer's stood,
                        And fired the shot heard round the world.

Relevant to cypherpunks because to steal from Nelson Thall of some Marshall
McLuhan Institute in the latest Wired:  "Ultimately, the power of the
Internet is that it makes you think like a North American.  It allows the
entire world to think and write like North Americans.  This is the agenda of
the Internet.  It goes along with NAFTA."

An *why* is it vital that the world become like 'North Americans' (or, as we
non-Canadians would say 'Americans')?  See my follow-up message.
