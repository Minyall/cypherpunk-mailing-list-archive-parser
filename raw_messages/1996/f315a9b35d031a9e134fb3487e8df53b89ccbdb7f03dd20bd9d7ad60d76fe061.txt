One of the most important parts of any security analysis is the
threat models.  In this case, we're talking about sending email
_to_the_government_.

There may be something you want to tell the Senator or his staff that 
you want kept private from the public or from rest of the government,
and Tim's phrase "Unless the information is 'secret'" seems to cover that.
Maybe you want to say "My company lost $X to competitor Y"; that's private.
Maybe you want to say "The FBI is reading your email, y'know..."
Maybe you want to attach a $20 MarkTwain DigiCash campaign contribution.

But usually, telling the government something is fairly similar to
publishing it, in terms of expectation of privacy, even in a republic.
The tradeoff is between using PGP to make a point, and getting the staff
to read it.  Typically, Congressional Staffs are Your Friends, at least
more directly than the Congresscritters themselves.  Lobby _them_;
making their job easier is a good start.

Maybe the right thing to do is include the digicash, encrypt the message, 
and attach a note indicating that the enclosed digicash is for the staff
member who decrypts the note and gives it to the Senator :-)
