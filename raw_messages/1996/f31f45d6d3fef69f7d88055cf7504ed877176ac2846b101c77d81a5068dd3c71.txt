! 
! The right to discuss revolt or secession or the overthrow of the federal
! government, it seems to me, is given below:
! 
! "We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created
! equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
! Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of 
! Happiness - That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted
! among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the
! Governed, that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of
! these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it,
! and to institute new Government, laying its Foundation on such
! Principles, and organizing its Powers in such Form, as to them shall
! seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.  ... "
! 
! Now this is the Declaration of Independence, and not the Constitution, but
! it seems to me that the right to discuss "agitating for secession or the
! overthrow of the federal government" is protected.

Correct, if government is not protecting our rights as a people, we are 
responsible for forcing the government to do so, even if that means 
changing of the guard, ie, successful radicalism.
