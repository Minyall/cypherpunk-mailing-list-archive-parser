Well, who is a non-native?   If it walked across the Bering Sea land 
bridge a few thousand years ago, does it have a higher moral value than 
if it hopped a ride on the bilges of a cargo ship in 1957?

If you want to isolate the rainforest until mankind has had time to 
completely inventory all the species and test them to see if they are the 
next cure for malaria or an exploitable raw material, well, now you have 
my sympathy.
