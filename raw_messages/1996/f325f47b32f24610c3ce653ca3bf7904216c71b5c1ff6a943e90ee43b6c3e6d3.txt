I haven't done any sort of survey lately, but I think the 
following jurisdictions are all good bets:

BANKING		Cayman Islands, Liechtenstein, Isle of Man,
		Canada(!) for some purposes, United States
		for non-US people and or nominee offshore
		corporations owned by anyone.

CORPS./TRUSTS	English speaking Caribbean countries, Hongkong
		in certain circumstances, Liechtenstein for
		its trust-like entities.

LIVING		Most anywhere that you like and that isn't your
		country of citizenship.  If I had the bucks, I
		would seriously look at Campione d'Italia.

I'd be curious to hear what Duncan Frissell and Black Unicorn
had to say on this question.
