	You have one chance in three, of showing a profit, in 
	one trade.  For 25 consecutive trades to show a profit
	it is 1 chance in 3^25.  <<  Slightly lower than my original

	Or in Hillary's case, no strategy at all, just
	pure, dumb luck that she caught all those
	successfull trades, and then quit.  

	Can anybody replicate her trades, on any futures market,
	and gain anything close to the success she had?
