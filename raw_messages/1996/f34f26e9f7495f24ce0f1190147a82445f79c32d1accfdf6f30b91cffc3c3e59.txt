Allow me to play the fool here for a minute.  If I really wanted to put up
a site which held copyrighted material available for download on the web
or via FTP, I could do it using two semi-anonymous accounts, a crontab 
entry, and the anonymous remailer network.


Since finding me, personally in the first place would be difficult at
best, and three doors down from impossible if I really tried...  Wouldn't
it make sense to go after whoever my enemies could get to?

Watch the movie "The Usual Suspects".  When Kaiser Solce wanted to get at
his enemies, he killed their friends, business associates, anyone who owed
them money, their families, etc...  A site to which no one makes any links
soon becomes an abandoned site.

Perhaps this is the "Deep Pockets Rule" at it's finest.  If you can't get
action from your enemy directly, attack his allies.  Whether they knew
they were allied against you or not is irrelevant.

Or maybe I've had too many beers.
