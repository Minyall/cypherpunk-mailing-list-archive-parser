The above text does not feel like Zu"ndel to me.  I think
that this ErnstZundel@aol.com might very well be an imposter.
The above is not the real Zu"ndel's speaking or writing
style.  Zu"ndel does not want books burned and people persecuted
nor does he want certain races and ethnic groups declared
inferior.

Zu"ndel more likely to complain about hypocricy and lack of tolerance
than lack of capitalized Free Speech. (At least according to
what I have been exposed to of him.)

Mossad?  Come on, get real.  The real Mossad would have an address
that ends in .il.   The ending .gov is for US government agencies.

"Do not write to these people", huh.  Well, I wonder if this is
because some of these addresses might all be fake?  I'll try sending to
them to see what happens.
Lemineberg!   That's a spoof on "Mark Lemire" a guy who really
works with the real Zu"ndel.

Sorry, but the guy with the Charlie Chaplain mustache spelled his
first name "Adolf", not "Adolph."  The real Zu"ndel would not
make this misspellilng.
