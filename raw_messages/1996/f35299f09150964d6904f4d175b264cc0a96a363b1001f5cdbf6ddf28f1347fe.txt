This is the way I did something similar:

		puts("Enter your company name:");
		fgets(company, 80, stdin);
		puts("Please call 1-800-555-1212 for your encryption key:");
		puts("Enter it now:");
		fgets(supplied_key, 80, stdin);
		/* Compute a key based on what the user typed in */
		/* This is using md5 as an example */
		computed_key = md5(company);
		/* Now, compare it with what they typed in */
		if(strcmp(supplied_key, computed_key) != 0)
		{
			puts("Incorrect key!");
			exit(1);
		}
		...

As long as you keep the way you compute the key a secret, there's little 
chance that someone else could rip you off, since the key is 
implementation-dependent.
