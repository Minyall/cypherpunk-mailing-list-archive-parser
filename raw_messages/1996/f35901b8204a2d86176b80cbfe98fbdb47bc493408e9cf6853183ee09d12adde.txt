This is the clueless kind of crap I expect pitched to AOL users and upper
level management.

GIF and JPEGs contain *NO* executable code.  You cannot get viruses from
them.  You obviously have no clue as to what the hell you are talking about.

The only way that you could obtain the effects described above is with Black
Magic and/or Voodoo.  (And not even then.)

I remember a similar hoax going around about 3-4 years ago about viruses in
image files.  I guess nothing on the net is ever forgotten entirely.
Especially the urban legends and bullshit.
