Of course, that would be for THEM to decide what they find interesting or
not. Every response to this thread always seems to impart some speculation
as to what other people might or might not find interesting. What one finds
of interest another may not so why don't we leave it up to the recipients
themselves instead of some self appointed censors. I'll decide whats
interesting to me, you decide what is interesting to you, and the senators
can decide whats interesting to them.

I'm sure that some senators/reps on the various endowment for the arts
committees, and or the technology oversight committees would have found
HipCrime's sight to be of some interest. Of course if it was a blurb of some
new mixmaster/remailer development, you would have found it of interest, so
lets stop trying to guess what other people want and speak for ourselves.

To you it may not seem appropriate, as its a subjective judgement, I'm sure
that some brown-shirted jack-booted gov't officials beleive that using a
remailer for any reason is inappropriate....thats what's great about this
world, we all have our own subjective beliefs.
