When you do the checking, make sure it is from an IPN that does not point
back at you (or at least only points to a Server Supplied not a Dedicated
IPN). You might also want to watch out for "Canary Trap" Decoys (where each
list has an unique set of Decoys [or at least one unique Decoy] so they can
tell which copy was compromised). I'm assuming that the Decoy is a "valid"
[possibly virtual] domain address which is being logged.
