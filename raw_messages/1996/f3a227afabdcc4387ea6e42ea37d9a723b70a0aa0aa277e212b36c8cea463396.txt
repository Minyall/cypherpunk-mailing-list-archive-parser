   "ADL Special Report: The Militia Movement in America."

      A 1995 national survey by the ADL offers disturbing
      evidence that the militia movement has continued to
      grow. The ADL survey also found that many hard-core
      militiamen believe that the United States Government
      itself conducted the Oklahoma City bombing to create an
      excuse for further depriving citizens of their
      constitutional rights. A continuing flow of information
      from ADL Regional offices around the country indicates
      militias are operating in at least 40 states, with
      membership reaching some 15,000, and that these numbers
      could rise still higher. The following is a 40-state
      summary of known militia activity.
