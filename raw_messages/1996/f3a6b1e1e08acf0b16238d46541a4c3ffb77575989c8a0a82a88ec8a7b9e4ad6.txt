"In July, Mr Lee [Kuan Yew, senior minister of Singapore] described an
insight that came to him watching a sheepdog show in Australia. You start
off with a group of young puppies, and 'weed out those who are not going to
be successful . . . You either have those qualities or you don't.' It was,
said Mr Lee, 'the simplest of all the lessons in life.'
        From _The Economist_, September 14th 1996.
