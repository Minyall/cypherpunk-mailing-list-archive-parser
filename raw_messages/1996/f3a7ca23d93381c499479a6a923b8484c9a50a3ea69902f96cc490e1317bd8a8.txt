	Umm... only one other list I'm on does reply-to to something other than
the list, and some of those lists are running majordomo. Reply-to to the list
doesn't have to cause problems; only a few domains (compuserve.com, wow.com,
and one other that I can't remember offhand) cause error problems to reply-to
addresses. The point about low volume mailing lists vs high volume ones is,
however, a good point; the other list with reply-to to other than the list
that I'm on is one designed for low traffic.
