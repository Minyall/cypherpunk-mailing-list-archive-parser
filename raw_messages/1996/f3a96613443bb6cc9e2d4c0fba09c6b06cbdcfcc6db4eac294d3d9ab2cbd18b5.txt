This is a contradiction.  Unless you were defining "subset" using a 
specific weakness in a specific RNG, in which case your argument would 
have been a tautology, saying nothing.

RNG's are written to maximize randomness of of the numerical _value_ of 
the integer, independent of any arbitrary radix, including 
binary.

The "property" you describe is imaginary.  Like the Gambler's Fallacy, 
it's an artifact of our own cognitive functioning, and does not exist in 
the real world.

The radix is 13.
The answer is 42.
The question is "What do you get when you multiply 6 by 9?"
