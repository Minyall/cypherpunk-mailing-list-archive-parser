No, I was merely pointing out that if the review revealed that it had
problems (one assumed that the intent of peer review is to reveal such
problems in the first place, but perhaps you just like giving software
away?) then the offered reward was valueless.

A lot of people use DES on this list too I'll wager.

I "tried out" your promotional scheme when I read your message, and it was
that scheme which my opinion targeted.

This is a subjective question.

Cypherpunks is always getting the cash poor developer who thinks he very
clever because he has to pay testers no money if he offers his new product
free to the person who discovers a flaw, or writes a review.

you to make their comments public.  That's called an endorsement, and, by
the way, people are usually paid for them.  Sometimes in the millions.

Think Michael Jordan is getting a deal when you use his name to promote
your product and then give him a $99.00 piece of software (which is
effectively worth the amount of time it takes to write a few kiss ass
paragraphs on the software, not $99.00)?

Alturisim is a pipe dream.

Do I have to review pronto secure first?
