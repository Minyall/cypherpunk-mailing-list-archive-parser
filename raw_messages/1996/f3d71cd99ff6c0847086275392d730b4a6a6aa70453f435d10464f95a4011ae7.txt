Websters defines fake with "to treat so as to falsify", "pretend",
"simulate", "imitation", "impostor", "sham", "faud", and "counterfeit". 
The passports fit most of these definitions.  A word applies if any of the
definitions work. 

If the passports had been marked "US of A" they would have been
"counterfeit". I did not say they were counterfeit (he clearly would not
be permitted to sell counterfeit passports).  

So his passports are not "counterfeit", but they are "fake".
