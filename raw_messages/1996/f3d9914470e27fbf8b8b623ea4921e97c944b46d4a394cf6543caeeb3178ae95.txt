If anyone is interested in helping out the gentleman quoted below by
ruthlessly savaging :-) his algorithm and assumptions, would you please
e-mail me so I can hook you up with him? (He decided not to post to the list
directly to avoid the usual signal-to-noise problems. Can't blame him. But I
offered to forward along relevant info and queries.)
