Anyone read this book?  Available on line:

	http://www.truthmachine.com/

The book is a possible future world scenario exploring the social
implications of another new potential technology, a 100% reliable
truth test.  What would society do with such a device?

The book explores the direction in which it is no longer possible to
speak untruthfully without detection.  A different approach to AP to
ensuring honesty in politicians.

The political climate has moved to a situation were the population
accepts a world government and loss of privacy for the payback of near
zero crime rate.

Is this utopia or has free will been removed?

Certainly many of the premises in the book are contrary to cypherpunk
goals in that privacy is erroded (you can not lie, and truth tests
with the question as to wether you have committed a crime at routine
points, for example when you need to renew a driving license, etc).
Government regulation of many aspects of life have been increased.

Position escrow or some near-relative is in there too, for the purpose
of allowing one to prove what was said, the video stream is sent and
encrypted in real time.  Also cryogenics, and nano-tech.

Interesting technology for cypherpunks to think about the
implications, likelihood, desirability etc.
