You are in the Village.  A low crawl leads off to the north....

I was #21 and #22, though the first one didn't actually export crypto,
and the second one exported code for rot13 instead of perl.
So there's now some rot13 hanging out in the Caribbean,
waiting for Hostile Foreigners and NarcoTerrorist Tax Evaders
to protect their privacy with it.  (This is _illegal_??)
