Congratulations!

You must be very relieved, as are the rest of us in the cryptographic
community in the US.

One question, though.  In your comments, you write
      I'd also like to thank Joe Burton, counsel for the co-defendant.
This raises the obvious question - do you know if the entire case has
been dropped, or have you just been eliminated as a target with the
possibility still open that others may yet be indicted?

Again, my congratulations.
