a hackers of america list? 

that would be really stupid and give the wrong impression. while i am a
'hacker', i would rather not be associated with the media definion of a
hacker, and i am sure that this is what your list will be associated
with. either that, or be given to the wrong people..

is there any point to all this?

i apologize for responding to this thread, but it just seems like a
really stupid idea.
