C'punks,

I just totaled up the "Bring Dimitri to San Francisco" pledges.
The pledges add up to an amazing US$681 and some guava pastries.
Airfair should be around US$300.  That, plus hotel should come
in under the amount pledged so far.  I'd still like additional
pledges, however,  I want to be certain we're covered and as an 
expression of the mood of the list. 

I intend to front the entire amount myself and then ask the
"pledge partners" for a pro rated payment based on the actual
cost and their proportionate pledge amount.  

It's interesting to me that several pledges have come from list
members who are far removed from San Francisco.  One or two of
them plan to attend Dimitri's meeting, but most just want to
have it happen.  I've only had one request for anonymity, but I
have kept names confidential without a clear go-ahead from them.
(If you have already pledged or pledge in the future, please let
me know if you mind if I post your name/nym.)

Now there's only one thing missing--Dimitri's response.  My open
letter to him contained an explicit and unambiguous invitation
to address a Cypherpunk meeting on any topic he wanted.  I asked
him for a clear yes or no, but have received nothing.  Perhaps
Dimitri prefers shooting from ambush.
