What's up with some of these press releases?

Can anyone clear up the confusion with RSA/Bidzos/Key recovery?

Here are some quotes:

=================

>From NYT:CyberTimes (2 Oct)
"Clinton Encryption Plan Is Generating Resistance"

Executives of the International Business Machines Corp. said
late Tuesday that they were still lining up the final list of
companies in the alliance. Those involved will include Digital
Equipment and smaller data-security companies including RSA
Data, Cylink and Trusted Information Systems. 

=================

>From NYT:CyberTimes (2 Oct)
"Clinton Encryption Plan Is Generating Resistance"

"The government announcement is disastrous," said Jim Bidzos,
chief executive of RSA Data Security, one of the country's
leading developers of data-scrambling software. "We warned IBM
that the National Security Agency would try to twist their
technology." 

=================

>From BusinessWire (2 Oct)
"JOINT PRESS ANNOUNCEMENT/ HIGH-TECH LEADERS JOIN FORCES TO
ENABLE INTERNATIONAL STRONG ENCRYPTION"

"Export controls are a fact of life," said Jim Bidzos, president
of RSA Data Security. "The key recovery alliance's approach will
allow companies to use cryptography with differing levels of
security in an interoperable way. When the alliance implements
this technology it will give the user a new level of flexibility
that did not exist before. In an imperfect world this technique
will at least allow you to take advantage of what governments
around the world will allow."

=================

So is RSA part of this or not? 
Is the middle quote above mis-attributed?
