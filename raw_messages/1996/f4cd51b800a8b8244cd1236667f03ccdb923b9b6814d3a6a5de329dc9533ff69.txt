Here's what I use, a simple sh script with pine for signing/encrypting.

#!/bin/sh

# Simple as hell sh script for automating PGP. I use pine, and have not
# tried this with any other mailer, but it should work. The version of this I
# use asks all kinds of questions about using remailers and nym servers
# before editing the mail, so it can toss in templates and such. Anyway,
# hack this at will.
#

# Pine configgy stuff I use with this:
# 
#	A)	enable-alternate-editor-cmd
#	B)	enable-alternate-editor-implicitly
#	C) 	signature-at-bottom
#	D)	editor=<full path to this script>

# I would use emacs cept that firing it up for every mail I send would suck
PGPEDITOR='pico -z -t'

# Some echos don't like -n, modify if necessary
ECHOTYPE='echo -n'

# Edit the mail... the mailer shold give us the tmp file as $1
$PGPEDITOR $1

clear

# Annoy with questions
$ECHOTYPE "PGP sign this message? [n] "
read PGP

if [ "$PGP" = "y" -o "$PGP" = "Y" ]
then 

  $ECHOTYPE "PGP encrypt this message? [n] "
  read PGPE

  if [ "$PGPE" = "y" -o "$PGPE" = "Y" ] 
  then
    pgp -east +clearsig=ON $1
    mv $1.asc $1
  else
    pgp -sat +clearsig=ON $1
    mv $1.asc $1
  fi

else

$ECHOTYPE "PGP encrypt this message? [n] "
read PGPE

if [ "$PGPE" = "y" -o "$PGPE" = "Y" ] 
then
  pgp -eat $1
  mv $1.asc $1
fi
