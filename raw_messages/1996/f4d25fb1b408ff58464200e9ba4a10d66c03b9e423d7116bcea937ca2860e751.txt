Some tribal societies are individualist, some are not:  Most of the
myths and legends of the Australian Aboriginals have a lone ranger
character as the hero or villain, or at least most of the ones
that I have read feature a person whose life is dramatic or heroic in part
because he is tribeless, perhaps for the same reason as most heroes
in Disney cartoons are orphans.


 Individualism is not about the
