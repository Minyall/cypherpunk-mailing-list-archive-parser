You fail to mention that Jefferson tried to pass a law through Congress that
would make slavery illegal by 1800.  The bill failed to pass by one vote.
Also, he deplored slavery and considered it evil.

This is an entirely subjective and philosophical argument about whether the
means justify the ends.  I won't debate any of the issues here.  However,
consider the fact that if Jefferson didn't have as much money as he had, he
might have not had as much policial impact.

Also think about the fact that all libertarians who drive cars, are by your
definition, hypocrites because they drive on tax-funded roads.

Sometimes it is necessary to violate one's principles in order to help the
greater good.
