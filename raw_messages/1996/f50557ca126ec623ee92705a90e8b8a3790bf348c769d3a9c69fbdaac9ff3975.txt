-.Somebody must have said, once, that the winner in an argument is the one who 
-.gets to define the terms.  Notice how the term "protect" and "protection" 
-.are misused above. (not by Attila, of course; but by whomever he's quoting.)  

-.However, the term "protect" has long been misused by lawyers in just such a 
-.way.  "Monopolize" would be a more appropriate word under the circumstances.

        monopolized is actually too 'weak' a final description of the 
    results --how about 'absolute denial of information?'

        what itrigues me the most is the bill originated at the White 
    House!   I won't waste time preaching to the choir, but the
    original intent was to protect West Publishing's "keyed" and
    proofed legal reference material (in return for a a hefty campaign
    contribution, and who nows what else under the table...).  just
    because it is legal, does not make it moral.

        some lame-brain (probably DOJ and whitehouse political hacks)
    expressed the terms in the treaty bill so broadly that it is all inclusive --everything.

        this is a case of no speech at all....     goodbye information 
    age, hello darkness.

        of course, there is always the possibility that Bubba _desires_
    to crash the economy so he can declare martial law for his NWO
    mentor, George Bush.
