Karl Hess Jr (PhD). wasn't Barry Goldwater's speechwriter. His father
was. His father didn't have a PhD -- indeed, he never attended a state
run school past his early teenage years. Karl Hess senior also was
never a Cato instutute staffer -- to my knowledge, his son is not on
the staff of the Cato institute either. Its astounding how many
inaccurate comments you can pack into a brief space.

Dr. Phill Hallam-Baker, D.Phil (one wonders how a doctor of philosophy
differs from a PhD since that is also a doctor of philosophy) seems to
spew random inaccuracies left and right.
