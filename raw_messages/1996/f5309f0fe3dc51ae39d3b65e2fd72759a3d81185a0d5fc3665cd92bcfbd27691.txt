Also--and I mean this point completely seriously!--many parents are not
altogether convinced that the "public school socialization" is all that
beneficial. Do kids really _need_ to learn to wear gang colors, smoke to be
cool, get pregnant at age 14, and so on?

An awful lot of accomplished persons grew up in isolated areas, on small
farms, and were educated in very small classrooms (or at home).

I think the "social skills" Snow talks about above are actually the _worst_
part of public schools in fin-de-Siecle America. If I had a kid, I wouldn't
want him or her in the local public schools.

(And my area is more remote than over in San Jose--San Francisco, which is
even worse. And LA is even worse.)
