But the latest developments, like the December meeting in Paris
and another international meeting advertized for March -96, seem
to take place on a Worl Government basis (OECD). Obviously various
national governments understand that they can't really act on their
own. I don't think the EC will propose any actual laws on their
own but together with the US, Canada, Australia and possibly Japan.
