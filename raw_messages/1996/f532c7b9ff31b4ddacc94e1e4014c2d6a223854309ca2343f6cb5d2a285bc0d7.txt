I happen to have a Sparc 20 box and a Linux box and a SCO box, and ActiveX
won't work on any of those. I also work with a bunch of other equipment
that's much faster than a PC, but doesn't run browsers. (Most of it is not
connected to the 'net for security reasons, but that's besides the point.)

If Bill's client is sure to run the platforms that MS IE runs on, then this is
not a consideration.

Interpreted FORTH bytestream (which is what Java is) may be "doing quite well"
when drawing GUI gizmos and widgets, but it can't get anywhere near the
performance of hand-optimizer assembler that you can stick into ActiveX.
