I think you chose your starting place in the key space and then proceed
sequentially from there.  However, if it turns our that gray code
increments of the key can reduce the key setup time, then you would want to
use that ordering of the key space for the "next" key to try.

Another possibility is to work in randomly chosen blocks of 1000 to
1,000,000 or so keys.  This approach would reduce the cost of getting good
random numbers to manageable levels.
