Does the English Only bill conflict with the UN Declaration of
Human Rights (Article 2):

Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this
Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex,
language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin,
property, birth or other status.

Note: "freedom of language"

For that matter, does the escrowed crypto legislation conflict with
Article 12:

No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy,
family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and
reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against
such interference or attacks.

My understanding is that the United States is (finally) a signatory
to the Declaration.
