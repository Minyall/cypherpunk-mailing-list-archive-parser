How about a combination of the two?  Suppose Alice wants to anonymously
post a message and get replies.  She generates a new RSA key, signs her
post with it, and asks readers to send encrypted replies to a server. 
Then periodicly she sends a one-time reply block to the server to retrieve
the accumulated replies. 

This would let Alice receive an unbounded number of replies and also give
some protection against the denial-of-service and rubber-hose attacks
Lance described.
