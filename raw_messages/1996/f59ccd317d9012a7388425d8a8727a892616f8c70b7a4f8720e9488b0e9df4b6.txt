The generalized halting problem comes to mind...

Since it can be proved that there's no complete set of heuristics
to tell if a given program has a characteristic (such as "secureness")
then sooner or later someone will discover another security flaw.

A question is whether a simple patch is made or if the set of heuristics
is widened (ie, learn from mistakes) so that similar flaws can be found
based on knowledge of that one flaw.
