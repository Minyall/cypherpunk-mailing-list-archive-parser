People would do well to remember this.  In the future software
released by PGP Inc. will not come with source code.  I don't believe
source to PGPfone will ever be released, for instance.  Beware of this
software.  Despite Zimmerman's strong privacy record, you should
never, ever, use crypto software that doesn't come with source.
Period.
