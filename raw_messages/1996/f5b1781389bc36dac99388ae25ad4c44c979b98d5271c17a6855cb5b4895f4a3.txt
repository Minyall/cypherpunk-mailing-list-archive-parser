Now I understand it.

That thing on the cover of Applied Crypto is really
one of the Gray's space ships that they use to abduct
aspiring cryptographers and implant microchips in them,
controlling their minds and making them obey RSA's
license agreement.

Very interesting indeed.

On a lighter note, a local NBC station advertised a
special they will have this monday, about the 1-800-INFO-PET
chips... only that parents are opting to have them implanted
in their newborn children.
