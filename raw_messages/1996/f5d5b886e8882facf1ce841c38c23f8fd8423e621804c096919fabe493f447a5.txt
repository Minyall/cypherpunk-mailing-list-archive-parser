It was you who insited on calling me "Mr Baker" despite the fact that we have 
been introduced. If you insist on being formal you can get it right. Its a 
D.Phil by the way, not a PhD.

Good.

PS, I don't recommend that people read the works of the late Cato Institute 
staffer mentioned. There are better authorities than the speechwriter of Barry 
Goldwater.

If people are interested in Philosophy then I suggest they read "A History of 
Western Philosophy" by Bertrand Russel.
