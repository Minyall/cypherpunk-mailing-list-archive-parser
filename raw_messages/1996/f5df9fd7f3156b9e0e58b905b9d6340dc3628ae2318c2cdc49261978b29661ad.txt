From: 	Hal [on the idea of companies operating fully anonymously]

It might be interesting to make a list of all the problems people can
think of why this idea won't work, paired with proposed solutions and
workarounds - sort of a mini FAQ for this important (some might say
ultimate) cypherpunk model.
.....................................................................

I think this is a much needed discussion  - in particular as it comes at a time when Uni is is "somewhat disconcerted" at the defeatist attitude of some cypherpunks and since TCMay is getting ready to read us the Cypherpunks Bill of Rights regarding the subsidizatoin of other's people's cyber existence (heh). 

3 problems which immediately come to mind:

.  What if someone, hired on one occasion but fired at another, decides in anger to "turn coat" and report everyone to the IRS (or other fine government agency)?

.  What if a company does not pay as expected - other than adopting Assassination Politics, what method could an employee use towards getting their expected remuneration for work done?

.  Wouldn't everyone need to have two jobs (or source of regularly accepted cash), in order to be able to pay for services where suppliers do not accept virtual cash transactions? (TCM has mentioned before about the need to pay for some things in tiny quantities - like quarters for a phone call, etc.)
