Sure thing. Most people on this planet do not read their email through a
TCP/IP stack. They either log onto another program or they use a
proprietary front-end. There are actually many, many different ways that
people send email. That's one of the reasons that FV has been successful
--- you don't need a live TCP/IP connection to the internet to use it.
