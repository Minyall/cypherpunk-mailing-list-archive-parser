It seems to me that phone line costs are turning into a floor price for
Internet access, when they shouldn't really be.  The main asset telephone
companies have, right now, is in RIGHTS OF WAY.  Put an ISP in a business
park that allows you to run  your own dedicated copper pairs, and you've
bypassed $25/month/line business phone line charges. 

At some point, individual urban and suburban blocks could easily be
"guerilla re-wired" for ISP access without serious trenching, etc.  The
phoneco would still be involved, but in a far lower-profit mode, as the
supplier of a single T1 to a multi-block area.
