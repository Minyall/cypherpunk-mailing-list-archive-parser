   Shimomura and Markoff give an illuminating account of
   tracking system break-ins; it is in those that Tsutomu and
   his road crew really dazzle. Skip the filmic crud and enjoy
   the gritty details of hackers hacking, stretching legality
   and propriety, emulating their mocking nemeses.

   Glimpse the far-side hackers, say, jsz and jft and xxx,
   still taunting, eluding, taking down, making pay for job-
   security cybersloths.
