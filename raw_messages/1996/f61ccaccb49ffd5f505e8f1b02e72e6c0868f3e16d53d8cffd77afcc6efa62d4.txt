   The Wash Post today has front page "Specialists Say Message
   Spotlights Issues of Power, Responsibility" on an alleged
   abuse of the Internet by a UMD student (and member of the
   Utopian Anarchist Party) who posted a message accusing a
   mother of mistreating a daughter, and asking readers to
   telephone the mother to protest -- which many did, causing
   mayhem in the harem.

   Stiff-necks say that the incident demonstrates the
   uncontrolled nature of the Net. "Computer experts said lack
   of accountability in Internet communication could expand
   with the use of anonymous remailers." Easy e-mail forgery
   is noted.
