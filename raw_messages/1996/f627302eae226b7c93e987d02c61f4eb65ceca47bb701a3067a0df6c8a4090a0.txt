ANNOUNCEMENT: PGPfone Beta 7 Now Available for Download
_______________________________________________________

MIT has released Philip Zimmermann's PGPfone 1.0b7 for Macintosh and
1.0b2 for Windows95 or NT.  This new secure telephone product is now
available for download at the MIT PGP distribution web site:

     http://web.mit.edu/pgp
or:  http://web.mit.edu/network/pgpfone

Using PGPfone is like using a telephone, except no one else can
eavesdrop on your conversation.  PGPfone lets you whisper in someone's
ear, even if their ear is a thousand miles away.  Secure voice calls
are supported over the Internet, or through a direct modem-to-modem
connection, or even over AppleTalk networks.

PGPfone uses Diffie-Hellman public-key technology to provide encryption
keys for the user's selection of CAST, TripleDES, or Blowfish
encryption algorithms.  A unique biometric authentication feature uses
spoken words to authenticate the Diffie-Hellman key exchange allowing
easy authentication of secure calls.  This new version introduces CAST,
a fast and well-designed new encryption algorithm from Northern
Telecom.  The use of Diffie-Hellman in PGPfone allows secure calls to
parties that are not previously known to the caller -- no prior key
exchange over other channels is necessary.

PGPfone 1.0b2 for Windows is an improved version which is now on par
with the Macintosh version.  It now supports silence detection, much
improved sound quality, significantly reduced latency, completely new
interface, faster call negotiation, and some important bug fixes.

A commercial version of PGPfone will be available in the fall from
Phil's new company, Pretty Good Privacy, Inc.  The company may be
contacted at 415 631-1747, or at http://www.pgp.com.
