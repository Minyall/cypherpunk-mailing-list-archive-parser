Actually, that doesn't work either -- if I wanted to forward the
message you sent me to someone else to make them think that you sent
it to them, I could just take the nonce and put that in the header of
my forwarded message and it would match...

No, you need to include the "to" and "cc" fields as well inside the
signed message.  But again, the MUA should do this, not PGP.
