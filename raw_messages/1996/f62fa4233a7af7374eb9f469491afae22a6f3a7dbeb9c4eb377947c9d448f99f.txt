 drivers are (can be) shipped as totally separate pieces of code.

You missed my point.  The crypto-service program they sign might be a 
DES library.  One implementation would be entirely in software; 
another would be a front-end interface with hardware (essentially a 
driver), perhaps as part of the kernel [Admittedly I'll have to 
re-read MS's specs].

So say you're a manufactuer or DES hardware... you sure would like to 
get that covetted 'Win95' logo on your package if you want to go 
mainstream.
