I like anonymity as much as the next guy, but if you're asking for help 
it's not really appropriate -- lots of disinterested people are going to 
read this, when they really shouldn't have to.

The place to ask about pgp is alt.security.pgp.  If you post there, try 
to say what happened when you attempted to compile the program.

Before you post anywhere, try grabbing the .tar.gz version instead of the 
.zip version -- there are some case sensitive file names that munge on 
linux in the .zip version.  The other ought to compile out of the box.
