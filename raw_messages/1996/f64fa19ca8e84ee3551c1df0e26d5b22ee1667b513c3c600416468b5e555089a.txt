Indeed, I support the elimination of concepts such as "slander" and "libel" 
precisely because they cause more harm than good.  Currently, there is an 
illusion among ordinary citizens that "if that was untrue, you could sue him 
for libel!" despite the fact that this is rarely practical.  In that way, 
the law actually adds credibility to what should be an incredible claim.  
Eliminate libel suits, and you've eliminated any presumption that because 
it's been spoken or is in print, it's likely to be correct.
