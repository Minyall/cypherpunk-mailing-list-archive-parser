Banner Front page headline in the British Observer, Sunday 25th

"The Peddlers of child abuse"
see http://scallywag.com/

The internet is presented as a conspiracy by child molesters.

There is a picture of Johan Helsingius, the man who free of charge
provides an anonymous remailer service:  The picture is captioned "The
internet middle man who handles 90% of all child pornography"  He is
represented as personally profiting from the distribution of child
pornography, though in fact no posts to binary newsgroups can go
through his system, and no large binaries can go through his system,
and he provides the anonymising service free of charge.

There is a picture of Clive Feather, the man who runs the largest
internet service provider in Britain, captioned "The school governor
who sells access to photos of child rape"]]

The observer article savagely demonizes all who use the internet,
presenting it as primarily existing for the purpose of distributing
child pornography, and demonizes and libels by name those who have
sought to defend the liberty of netizens.

I urge you all to check out this article, and send snail mail letters
to the observer condemning (since they are obviously too low tech to
read email) and email letters of support to those netizens who have
been savagely libeled for their defence of liberty.
