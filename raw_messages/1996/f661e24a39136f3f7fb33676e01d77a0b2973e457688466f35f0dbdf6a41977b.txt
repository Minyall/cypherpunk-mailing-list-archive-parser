   Well, I'm sure you're correct on most of those,
but the post on Microsoft using ENCRYPTED databases
of competitor programs as part of its plan to surreptitiously
collect information from unsuspecting users when they allow
their "wizard" to violate their PRIVACY seems to be 
quite germane to this lists's topics (which include
encryption and privacy, as I recall).   I found the
reference it pointed to very interesting reading indeed.
