	Does anyone have some code that will search a dictionary, and
tell me *quickly* if an arbitrary chunk of text is in the dictionary?
Pre-indexing steps are fine, as is using big chunks of disk for hash
tables.  The point of course, is to check arbitrary possible plaintext
that a test decryption produces.
