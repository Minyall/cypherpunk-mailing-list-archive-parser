It's that wonderful season again, when all the assholes are out in
force, and people feel obligated to purchase merchandise to give to
each other.  For various reasons, I don't believe in credit cards, and
yet, trying to pay for something by personal check at the local
Hecht's, they either *require* a credit card, or go through the Nazi
check-warranty company Equifax.  However, it doesn't stop there...only
SOME departments seem to have this requirement (Electronics/Luggage
not requiring).  Is it legal to require credit cards?
