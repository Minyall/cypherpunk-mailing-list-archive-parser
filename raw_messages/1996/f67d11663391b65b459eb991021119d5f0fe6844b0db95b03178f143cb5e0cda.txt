I personally know Winn and several of the folks from NCSA.  You're stuff 
would be a FANTASTIC contribution, and I'm certain that it would be a 
popular session.  Yes, some of these folks are a bit "establishment," but 
they go to these things looking for new ideas, new perspectives, etc.

You sound like a guy who can hold his own in a debate, so I imagine 
you'll have no problems dealing with this crowd.  They may "challenge" 
your views, but you're not going to get attacked or anything.

BTW, I'm not one of the reviewers or organizers....

Don't read too much into this.  Last year, we had Eric Bloodaxe (Chris G) 
there, a host of, uh, shall we say "fringe" elements, and I think Eric 
Hughes was there (?Eric?  Sarah and I *think* we saw you there?), as well.
As far as an "agenda" other than the published one, I think you're probably 
being overly concerned.  It's actually a fun con and you'd be surprised 
the number of people willing to actively listen to anyone they even think 
might remotely be a "hacker."

If you show up trying to "one up" folks, however, you may not get what you 
want.  It's more of a cooperative, interactive forum;  Not a competition.
