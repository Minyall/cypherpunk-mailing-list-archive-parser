What a week!  What is this?  "Net Loon pig-pile on Cypherpunks day?"

So far i have killfiled three people in the past two days.  (That is the
total number I filtered to trash before that date.)

For those of you who are sick of wading through this mess, I am willing to
show you what it will take to filter those of your choice to /dev/null or
its local equivelent. (procmail can be your friend!)

Maybe after some creative filtering, the list will settle back to the usual
noise, instead of the net-loon noise.
