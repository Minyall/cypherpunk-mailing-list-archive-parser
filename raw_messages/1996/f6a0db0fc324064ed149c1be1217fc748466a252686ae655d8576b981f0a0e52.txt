I meant to quote this part in the previous post:

taxbomber:
>Needless to say, we have NEVER EVER dealt in one single fake
>passport, nor have we ever offered, sold or brokered any forged,
>stolen or "lost" documents. Nor is there any need to do so, if you can
>get the real thing absolutely legally.

He was definately selling fake passports.   He thinks of them as
camouflage.  If I look up fake in websters, they fit the definition.

Turns out this is not legal in Anguilla.

If it is no longer in his web page, you can see quotes from his web
page in the David Evans article.

The Internet spans many counties and if something is not legal in one
country but legal in another, someone can move.   He has moved.
One of the exciting things about the Internet.  

If there are taxes in your country and banks cooperate with the
government, you can incorporate in Anguilla, put your web site here, and
run your business from here (coming in over the Internet) tax free. 

But fraud is illegal in Anguilla, and fake passports are concidered
fraud.
