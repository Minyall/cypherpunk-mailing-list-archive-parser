I have some direct insight as to how airlines interpret the new travel
provisions and what they are reasonably able to accomplish in improving
safety via identity and luggage checks.

I was wondering if with gov't trying to compile dossiers on travellers it
might be possible for a large enough percentage of frequent air travellers
to assume the same identity (e.g., John or Jane Doe).  If so, a service
could be established to book airline reservations under a single credit
card for Does so as to confound automated tracking systems.

Eventually, Does could arrange to exchange IDs (if their ages and
descriptions matched) and even credit cards (again assuming equivalence) to
really monkey wrench things.
