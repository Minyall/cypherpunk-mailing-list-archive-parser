Search Campus Where Jewell Worked;
 Check Internet Link

By Associated Press, 08/02/96

ATLANTA (AP) - Widening their investigation of Richard Jewell,
federal and state agents descended on a small Georgia college campus
Friday to hunt for evidence linking him to the Olympic park bombing.

Among other things, investigators were trying to determine whether the
former campus guard had tapped into the Internet via Piedmont College
computers, a campus source reported. Bomb-making instructions
available through the global computer network have contributed to an
increase in bombings in the United States, authorities say.
