Do not disagree, just is not regulated by the FCC the same way radio 
stations are.

Today we think (if you do) of Zenith as manufacturer of computers (owned by
Thompson), cable TV decoders, and televisions (Samsung ?). However seventy
years ago, Commander MacDonald "willfully" (having notified Herbert Hoover)
started broadcasting station WJAZ in Chicago on a frequency reserved for
Canadian stations (have a copy of a photograph *somewhere* showing the
1925 station crew in Pirate costumes) in direct violation of a Department
of Commerce order.

Shortly thereafter Congress passed a law creating the FCC.

History tends to repeat itself.
