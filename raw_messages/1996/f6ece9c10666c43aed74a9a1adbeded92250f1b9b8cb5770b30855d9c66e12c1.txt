I found a couple of papers on anonymous protocols that I haven't seen
mentioned here before.  I'll list them for people who might be interested:

   Cryptographic Defense Against Traffic Analysis by Rackoff and Simon.
   http://pct.microsoft.com/papers/ta.ps

gives a proof of security for a mix-net like protocol.

   A. Pfitzmann, B. Pfitzmann, M. Waidner: ISDN-MIXes - Untraceable
   Communication with Very Small Bandwidth Overhead; Proc. Kommunikation
   in verteilten Systemen, Feb. 1991, Mannheim, Informatik-Fachberichte
   267, Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg 1991, 451-463.

describes a protocol for anonymous telephone calls.
