I again encourage Perry to consider learning how to use filters.

While I happen to be uninterested in many of the topics being discussed, I
realize that one man's noise is another man's signal.

Besides, the C coders and crypto mavens created their own protected list,
the Coderpunks list, and this is where Perry and others can presumably find
the high S/N discussion of Java, Diffie-Hellman, applets, DES, and memory
leaks that he so craves.
