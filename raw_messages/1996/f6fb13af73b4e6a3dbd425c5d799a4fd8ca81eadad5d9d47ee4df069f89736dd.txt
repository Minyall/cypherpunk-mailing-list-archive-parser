I think the really interesting question underlying this whole discussion is
how a minor child makes the legal transition to a competent adult.  This
issue comes up again and again.  We see it in "parental consent" laws
requiring parental consent for a minor girl to get an abortion.  We also
see it in issues like when a minor child may throw off the "protection" of
products like SurfWatch.

ObCrypto: When may a minor child say no to PAK (Parental Access to Keys)?
