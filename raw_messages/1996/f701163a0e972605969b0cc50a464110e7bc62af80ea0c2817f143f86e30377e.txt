Supposedly I won by a 30-vote margin over David C Lawrence (the moderator
of news.announce.newgroups), which I'm very proud of. Do take a look at
this site and at Misha Verbitsky's archives (taking everything with a
grain of salt). It makes good reading.

BTW, are _you related to http://206.250.116.19/~netscum/conwayc0.html?
