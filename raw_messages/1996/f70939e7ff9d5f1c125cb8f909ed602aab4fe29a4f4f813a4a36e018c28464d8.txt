Why would anyone set up a remailer at Lance's (or Sameer's) machine?
They have remailers running already. If the thugs break root and obtain
one remailer key from a machine, they probably get all the keys on that
machine, compromising all the remailers in one single attack. Or am I
missing something? Is there any benefit of multiple remailers on a machine
where root is running his own remailer?
