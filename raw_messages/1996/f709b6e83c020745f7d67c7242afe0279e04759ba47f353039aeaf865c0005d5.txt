I would like to be able to enforce a policy for Java applet CPU time which
says, the applet can have as much time as it wants/needs constrained by:

(1) I can always determine how much it is using.
(2) I can kill it without killing other processes/threads including the browser.
(3) Without interfering with 1 or 2, I can set its priority in relation to
other programs running on my machine.

In the long term, I would like the ability to sell CPU cycles to Java
applets.  (Or donate cycles to projects I support.)
