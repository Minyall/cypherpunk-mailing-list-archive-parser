I have a growing feeling that PGP 3 is never going to happen. Or that if it
does, it will happen only after the passage of more draconian anti-privacy
laws, and the guys working on it will be forced to include sundry backdoor
stuff or drop it altogether.

I suspect someone could do quite nicely by going ahead and developing a
2.6.2 or 2.6.3 DLL.
