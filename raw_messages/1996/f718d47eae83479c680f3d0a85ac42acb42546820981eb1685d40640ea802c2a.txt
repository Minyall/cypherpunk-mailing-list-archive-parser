It's not new.  I wrote a similar thing for executing shell scripts for EDS
in 1986, except that I didn't have the means to digitally sign the email,
so I put a header "X-Password:" with a password in it.  Since the email
was only going over a UUCP link, I felt pretty safe about it.  Since the
EDS machine (a Sun 2!) was calling me, that was the only way I had to
execute commands and get results back.  It was written in C, by the way,
for a variety of reasons, even though perl was available (I am not a perl
fan).
