Gosh, I'm not a German citizen, and don't even have a nickel's worth of 
german blood in my body, but who will be the first to add some real 
pretty pixtures and some snazzy ol' text adages to THEIR governments' web

Life needs more risk.  If we ever EVER hope to establish any sort of 
DISestablishment, it only starts with us.  Well, you.  As I said, I'm not 
German (and quid pro quo, and stuff like that).
