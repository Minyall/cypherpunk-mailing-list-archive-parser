Changing the subject doesn't change the point.  Your announcement implies   
that users are liable, and that is incorrect.  This is misleading, and in   
my view, reprehensible.  This was the point of my post.  The fact that   
the fraud is traceable when detected should have been self evident.

If your post has said "Financial Industry Should Watch out for Keyboard   
Sniffers" as a *potential* threat for which the risks should be weighed,   
that would have been different.  Arguably farfetched, but different.   
 Your post relies on people's ignorance of their rights with respect to   
credit card liability, and therefore is shameful.
