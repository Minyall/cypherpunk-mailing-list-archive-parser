  No, no, no.  Netscape navigator does not reveal your name or
put it into cookies.  The only way to get your name or other
personal information about you into a cookie is for you to type
it into a web site, and have that site send you back a cookie.

  The only time we reveal your name is in e-mail headers, and
when doing anonymous FTP when you have manually disabled the default
of sending 'mozilla@' as the anon ftp password.
