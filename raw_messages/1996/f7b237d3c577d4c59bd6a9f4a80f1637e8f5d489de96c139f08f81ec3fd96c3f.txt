The text of Judge Richey's decision to grant the government's motion
to dismiss my case is now up on my web page as

http://www.qualcomm.com/people/pkarn/export/decision.html

My attorneys scanned it into HTML format, but neither they nor I have
had a chance to thoroughly proofread it yet.

An appeal is extremely likely.
