Hello Everyone,

	I'm proud to announce the new nym server at nym.alias.net. The
address for the nymserver is:

nymrod@nym.alias.net (Catchy name huh?)

	Anyway nymrod is running Matt Ghio's latest nymserver
code. It's been tested and I think (cross your fingers) all the bugs
have been worked out. It works the same at the nym server at c2.org
and gondonym. If you need a quick tutorial, send email to:

help@nym.alias.net

Enjoy!!
