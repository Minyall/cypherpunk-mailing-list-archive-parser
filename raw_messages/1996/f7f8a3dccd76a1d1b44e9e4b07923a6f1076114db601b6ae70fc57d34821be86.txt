	By mistake, I sent a message in reply to a list member and
forgot to include the list.

	I also misremembered *Austria* as Australia when I sent my
original question to the list.

	The item I read was a news item on the bottom of p.16, July 6
Issue of _New Scientist_, enititled "It's good to talk in quantum
trits". The researchers are Klaus Mattle, Harald Weinfurter and Anton
Zeilinger of the University of Innsbruck and Paul Quiat of Los Alamos
National Laboratory in New Mexico. Weinfurter said "It's the first
experiment which demonstrates a communications system using pure
quantum states".

	I don't know enough QM to tell if it has the same immunity to
eavesdropping as the scheme studied by British Telecom.

	I'll send more details tomorrow, as I have to leave now.

	Derek
