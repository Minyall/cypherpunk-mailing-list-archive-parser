I think the original point was that they MIGHT storm into your house by
mistake (say, because they incorrectly accepted a informant's story).
Therefore, it is truly a mistake.

That said, it is still not justifiable for a SWAT team to FORCE a situation
where they may necessarily be in physical danger, and therefore, are forced
to respond with overwhelming force when the target may reasonably be
innocent.

Worse yet, the bureaucrats, whose asses are on the line when a tragic mistake
occurs, will rarely, if ever, admit to any wrongdoing.  They may be forced
out, at worse; there may be a symbolic verbal lynching in front of the
Congress, but that would be about it.

If such a tragedy were to occur to me, and I were to survive, I would want
the responsible PERSONS fully acknowledge their mistakes (and be properly
punished).  It is a travesty of justice to blame a no-name, faceless
"system" as was done in the well-known recent cases (whether or not the
target was ultimately found guilty of any misdeeds).
