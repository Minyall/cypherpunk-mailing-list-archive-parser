I'm a little confused by this phrase from the bill. It seems to be
saying just that export needs to be authorized if the software is 
already exportable from the U.S. and if to a financial institution.
 I know that can't be right, but what is the translation of this 
legalese?


> "Requires that export be authorized for non-military encryption
>  software to any country where similar software is exportable from
>  the U.S. to foreign financial institutions."
