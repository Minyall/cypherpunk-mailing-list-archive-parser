This is far over-simplified.  Most BSD derived Unices provide the _option_
for single-user mode not to be password protected (depending on whether the
console is marked secure in /etc/ttys).  A few default to this behavior,
but on all it is either a configuration choice or a password is always
required (as it is in USG'ish unices).
