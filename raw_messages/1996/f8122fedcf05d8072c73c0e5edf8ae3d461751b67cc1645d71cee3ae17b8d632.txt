Its been used in an SF Story/Series <g>. It is the Venus Equilateral Series
by George O. Smith. Midway into the Series, they invent a method of doing
Teleportation via destruction of the original item, sending the info to the
receiver, and recreating the object. In the process of a Court Case
involving if the transmission of the signal between the two Teleportation
Devices was a transmission of Energy (which was the province of the other
party in the case) or a transmission of Data (which was VE's job), they had
to invent a Duplicator (in the process allowing the non-destructive readout
of the transmission signal). It gets vary hairy for a story or two until
Civilization gets adjusted to the Duplicator (they have to invent something
that can not be scanned and thus duplicated to act as "Paper" for Money and
Contracts/etc since the bottom fell out of the Economy due to no need for
most Factories and the lack of uncounterfeitible currency).
