The not allowing unsubscribed individuals to post is logical, for a time.  But
that basically outlaws anon remailers that don't allow you to send to an 
account, and a lot of them don't, from my limited understanding.  Besides, if
we set up the list to ban people who are 'undesirable', instead of just using
our own killfiles to do the dirty work for the list, then what is to stop 
someone from banning you?  Sure, you move on to another list, but, personally,
I wouldn't want it done to me, and so I would not do it to someone else.  But,
like I said, personal killfiles are more than encouraged.  It resolves these
kinds of conflicts a lot faster and cleaner than debating who and who should
not be banned.

Daniel.
