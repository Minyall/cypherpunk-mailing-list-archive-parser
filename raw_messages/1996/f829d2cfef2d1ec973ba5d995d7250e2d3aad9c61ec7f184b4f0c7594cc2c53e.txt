I've taken a personal look at this,  and it's awful.  I'd like to make a
formal submission from Thawte to the EC committee in charge.  Even better,
I'd like to muster industry support against escrow schemes in general in
the EC. If any organisations following this thread would like to join us
in that submission,  please contact me directly.

Thanks,
Mark
