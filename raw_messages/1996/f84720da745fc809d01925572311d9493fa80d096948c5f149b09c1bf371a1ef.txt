It sounds like most of their "counter-arguments" are just stalling tactics.

If you are a lawyer for someone you know is guilty, you still would choose
to find every reason in the book to attack the prosecution's case.  Here we
have precisely the same effect with the NSA.  Any tactical manuveur to keep
stalling the impending collapse of ITAR.

(It is human .. er .. rather .. bureaucrat-esque to claim innocence in the
face of overwhelming evidence of guilt.)

Perhaps, in their fit of downsizing, Congress should privatize the NSA?
