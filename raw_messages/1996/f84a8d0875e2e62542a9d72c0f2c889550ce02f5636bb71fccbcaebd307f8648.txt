That's only a problem if physical security doesn't exist at the
console.  No operating system (or monitor) can overcome the lack of
that.

In which case it's in memory and can be paged or swapped.

Depending on how the kernel is written, bringing down the machine
could result in a dump of kernel memory being written to the swap
device anyway.
