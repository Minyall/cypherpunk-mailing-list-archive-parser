"Other than Canadians"? Exactly what is the legal status of RSA and 
other crypto algorithms in Canada?

My understanding of ITAR is, crypto software can be exported from the USA
into Canada, but even in Canada, it remains under US ITAR laws. But what
about the patent laws? Do RSA and/or IDEA have patent strings attached up
here? 

Bottom line: Are there any potential problems with me using the 
international version of PGP (2.6.3i) up here in Canada? What about 
distributing it?

Most of the legal info I see on the net about crypto in Canada only
mentions Canada in the context of "US/Canada". :-/
