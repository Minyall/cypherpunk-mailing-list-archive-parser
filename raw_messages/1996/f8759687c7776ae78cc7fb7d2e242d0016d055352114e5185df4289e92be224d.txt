Sorry. It seems that you need to go through IBM's home page at: 
www.ibm.com, then follow the links to the full press release where the URL
above comes up. This is the release that most of the media parroted. It
does include hand-rubbing quotes by industry rats, er, finks. 
 
 
Anybody who can't get through and wants the PR-dirty, send me a blank
message with the subject:  RAT_ibm
