Many states have open records laws, and Oregon seems like the type
that would.  You might try asking your Legislator's (or their staff) first 
before going to the DMV, since Legislators are more likely to say
"Yes, we're helpful and friendly and like interacting with the public",
while DMV bureaucrats say things like "No" and "Go stand in line, peon".
