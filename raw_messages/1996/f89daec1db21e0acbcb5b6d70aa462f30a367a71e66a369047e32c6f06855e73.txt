Yes, and they are sad that ebonics IS NOT going to be a course taught 
in school.  I spoke with a source at the Oakland School District who 
said they would not allow papers to be turned in written in ebonics.  
It is just an effort for educators to better understand how their 
students may communicate.  So everyone who liked Tim May's
fake sarcasm are now sad that they made fools of themselves.
