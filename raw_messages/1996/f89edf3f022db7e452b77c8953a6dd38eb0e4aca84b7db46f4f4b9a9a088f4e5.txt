there's a new cracker under dos called John the Cracker, and coded by
UCF96. It's optimized for Pentiumsand is better than cracker jack on a
lot of points : can work with or without wordlists, and u can modify all
what u want....approx 30% faster than cracker jack on a pentium (i run
it at usually 4000 cps on a P90/32Mb ram and a 25Mb wordlist (yeah it's
big))
