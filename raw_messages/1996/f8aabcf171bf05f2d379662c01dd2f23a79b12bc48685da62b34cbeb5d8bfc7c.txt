Not necessarily.

The Supreme Court has upheld Title VII's ban on workplace "harassment." 
The Court said it occured when "discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and
insult" in a workplace create an uncomfortable "working environment." 

Then there's public accomodation law, under which the (I recall) Greek
owner of a privately-operated diner was held liable for using the word
"nigger" where a black woman could overhear. 

Clearly, speech that makes someone uncomfortable must be banned by the 
government.
