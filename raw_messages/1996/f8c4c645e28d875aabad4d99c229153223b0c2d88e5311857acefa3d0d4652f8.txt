Please get a clue before designing crypto or allowing your marketing
people loose on the net.

This smells of snake-oil and your pages are full of inacuracies:

1) What is Internet-compatable (PGP works fine over the net, but it is
not).  If you mean RFC or other standard compatable (i.e. MOSS,
S/MIME, PEM), you aren't conformant to any standards.

2) 22 character Public keys are a joke

3) No crypto system is unbreakable unless you are doing some
permutation of OTP.  Public key systems are definately compromisable
with the appropriate application of compute power.

If you do not have a clue, don't play with those that do.
