My God! Could Chomsky be right after all?

James

A favorite story on Bosnia was an interview I saw with Noam Chomsky and Canadian
Major General Lewis Mackenzie who had led the Canadian forces in Bosnia. The
interviewer asked Chomsky some question about the real goals of the West in this
crisis and he gave some biting response about them having no motivation to
resolve the conflict but simply appear to be acting while continuing to follow
various policies that were cynical, amoral and contradictory to their stated
public goals. Lewis Mackenzie is then asked to rebut this view but instead he
agrees with Chomsky's analysis and goes on to give specific examples that he
faced first hand.

More Canadiana: The man who recently snuck into the Canadian Prime Minister's
residence and tried to assassinate him was released from jail last week after
serving three months. Fortunately, he did not call him names.
