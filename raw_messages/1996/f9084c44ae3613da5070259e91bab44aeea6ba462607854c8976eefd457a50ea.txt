Now that's a good point. The First Amendment says "The Congress shall pass
no law..." Doesn't that restrict the Congress's rights as a whole, and each
member's right to vote for bills that violate the Amendment? In GB, they
_generally frown on any restrictions on what laws the Parliament can pass -
the adage is "the Parliament's hands shall not be tied".

Does saying "The list owner should not kick people off the list for speech"
violate the list owner's right to free speech? That depends on whether plug-
pulling (and mailbombing and ping-storming and other obnoxious behavior)
is speech.
