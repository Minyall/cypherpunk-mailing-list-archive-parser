	Yes, as you have probably already read, my postmaster received such 
a message from you about my supposed lack of knowledge when it comes to 
unsubscribing.  He had quite a good laugh before asking me whether I had 
removed my brain while reading mail..

	BTW, I returned the favor with the above mentioned response to your 
initial letter.  Please be more careful in the future.
