As I remember the quote, it ended something like "and they came for me,
but there was nobody left to speak up".

We're all thinking about it.  We just don't believe (naively) that just
because someone issues code that was designed 20 years ago, and which
the NSA can undoubtedly crack in a heartbeat, that that code can
necessarily protect us against all comers.

There is a difference between principle and fact.  You have the
principles exactly correct, but as to facts, you have to be eternally
vigilant, i.e., don't get too comfortable with PGP et al.
