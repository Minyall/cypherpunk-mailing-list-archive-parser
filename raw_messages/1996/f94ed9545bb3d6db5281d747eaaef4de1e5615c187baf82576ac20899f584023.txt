Tim May's early support of the cypherpunk concept has helped
advance the culture of humanity! A true scholar, Tim analyzes
the various ideas presented to the cypherpunks list, and gives
his honest opinion, even when that opinion is not popular. In
doing so, Tim displays truly noble courage.

Unlike some others on this list, Tim has not sought to make purely
personal attacks of the other inhabitants of the list and has shown
impeccable restraint in doing so.
