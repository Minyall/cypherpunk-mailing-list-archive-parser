Quite true.  These estimates were made in 1995 so they are probably still
pretty accurate.  The rate at which factoring time decreases is greater than
the rate at which brute-force time decreases.  As to your claim that factoring
a 512 bit number is easier than bruting a 64-bit key space, it is not feasible
for anyone except maybe the NSA to do either of these.  I have heard that an
effort similar to that of factoring RSA 127 will be launched against a 512-
bit modulus.  I think that the difficulty is about equal to that of brute-
forcing a 64-bit key.
