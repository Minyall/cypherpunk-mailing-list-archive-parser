Anonymous questioned the meaning of the FBI-DECA 
national security threat:

>Perception management and active measures activities.

----------


Updated "The Puzzle Palace" will have more on this.

"Perception management" means any method used to conceal
intelligence or counterintelligence -- HUMINT, ELINT,
SIGINT, etc. -- including encryption or other operations
or communication technologies not accessible to, or
comprehensible by, the USG.

"Active measures activities" means any operations, human,
technological or administrative, that threaten the US.

The threat is a catch-all for interference with, or 
operation against intelligence and counterintelligence, 
surveillance and counter-surveillance or any other means 
used by the USG to protect against threats.

Its obscurity is used to cover in general what is not
covered explicitly by the other six well-known threats 
-- and to avoid revealing details of what is known or 
may yet be discovered.

It points to USG, and likely international, operations 
more blackly cloaked than those garishly paraded.
