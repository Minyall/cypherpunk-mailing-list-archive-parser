Greetings All,

Question for the group:  I have encountered a situation that causes me
to believe an ISP is snoopingthrough encrytped mail.  It seems that
PGP'd mail has aroused the curiosity of an ISP (not hooked.net).. I have
encountered "POP3 account in use by another user" several times in the
past few days and I am the only user... wondering if that "in use"
messsage is the result of a clumsy sysadmin being caught with his hand
in the cookie jar.  Any thoughts from the group???  If those more
knowledgeable than I deem these NOISE... my sincere apologies.

regards,
Michael E. Carboy
