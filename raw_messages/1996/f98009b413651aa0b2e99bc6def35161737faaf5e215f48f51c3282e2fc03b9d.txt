  Hi guys,
    Long time no post. Credit card numbers are determined by 
algorithmns.If s credit card number is no fitting to that algorithmn it 
is phoney. The only way that I know of to determine the validity of the 
card if a person has a copy of underground algorithmn generating software 
is to use the voice number and a store acct # for a purchase of say 
$50.00 or to go through the credit bureau.What I have wondered is if 
there is a way to determine a experation date from the credit card number.
                          Bye
                               moroni
