False.

You must present a SSN card or a "suitable substitute."

A w2 form with a (not necessarily YOUR) SSN is sufficent.  Note that not
all w2's actually HAVE your SSN because in some cases the Taxpayer
Identification number is distinct from the SSN.

I might add that standard w2 forms are available about anywhere.
They are also generally filled out by typewriter.
