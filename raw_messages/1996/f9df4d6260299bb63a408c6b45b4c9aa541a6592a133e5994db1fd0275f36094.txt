I've had a request from someone for a copy of Stealth that can run on a
Mac (I have the README for the DOS/Unix version on my Web site). Has
anyone ported it? Or if not, would anyone be able to? You should be able
to just hack up a simple GUI around the main filter code to select input 
and output files.
