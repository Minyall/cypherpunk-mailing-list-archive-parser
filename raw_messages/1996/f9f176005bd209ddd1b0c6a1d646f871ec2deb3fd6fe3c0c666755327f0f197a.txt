For how long is this really going to be the case?  As the whole world
of HTTP and related things (like Java & VRML) advances in capability
and sophistication, how long will the Compuserve/AOL/Genie "Big Online
Service" model continue to make sense?

Seems to me at as soon as things like a general-purpose browser (and
associated TCP/IP stack & PPP or SLIP) becomes as easy to load up as
an AOL demo disk, and local ISP's are listed in the yellow pages, the
advantage of being able to pay a provider for nothing more than the
routing of IP packets so that the net as a whole can be explored (and,
perhaps, more services purchased) will FAR outweigh any of the goodies
the current big providers offer.

The flip side of that, of course, is that big service providers can
offer access to their goodies to anybody with net access.

That sort of setup would make the whole concept of Internet regulation
even more bizarre; we'd really have something more directly parallel
to the phone system.
