Please see http://www.cdt.org/policy/freespeech/cc_ltr.html for a letter 
from Ed Meese, Ralph Reed, Donald E. Wildmon, and others which actually 
suggests language in the CDA.

"Attached is the specific language we support which includes the House
passed language on obscenity and includes revisions on both the House
passed language on indecency, which would amend Title 18 and the
Senate-passed language on indecency, which would amend Title 47. The
combination of these provisions, we believe, would provide effective laws
to curb obscenity and indecency on the Internet by establishing that all
who knowingly participate in the distribution or facilitation of obscenity
to anyone or indecency to children would be subject to the law."
