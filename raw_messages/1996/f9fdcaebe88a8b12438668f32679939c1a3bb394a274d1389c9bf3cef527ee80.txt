Not. It wasn't a classified project. It was upstairs from Woolworth's
in Central Square, ferheavens sake. SCIFs would have annoyed the
landlord, and presented interesting "challenges" given the pasteboard
construction. We didn't even have any of those clunky file cabinets
for Keeping Secrets Safe.  We just amused ourselves with such
speculation, since this was clearly a technology that excited interest
in certain quarters.
