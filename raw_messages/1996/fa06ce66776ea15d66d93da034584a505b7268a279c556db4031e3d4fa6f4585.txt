Forth!=Java.  Test it before you speak.

Sure it can, you just have to let your server act as a proxy and do a bit 
of work.  An applet snarfed over the net can only talk to the server.  
But the server can talk to other servers.

Not as an applet, but as an application, sure.  Also why would you want a 
DES breaker to put stuff on the client's hard drive?  It's far better in 
terms of security - both for the client and for the server to store'em on 
the server.
 
In other words, you can't be lazy.  You have to write a good server that 
will handle some of the legwork, but leave the DES to the client.

Or maybe Ray knows what he's talking about BECAUSE of that same 
implication. :)  As for inappropriate, ActiveX is inappropriate for most 
uses - any web page attachable code that when downloaded and executed can 
format your hard drive is inappropriate.  Regardless of performance.

Until Microsoft secures ActiveX in it's own sandbox and doesn't allow it 
to access things it shouldn't, it's not cool.

Anyhow, I will drop this topic here since it's becoming an ActiveX vs 
Java religious crusade and is inappropriate.
