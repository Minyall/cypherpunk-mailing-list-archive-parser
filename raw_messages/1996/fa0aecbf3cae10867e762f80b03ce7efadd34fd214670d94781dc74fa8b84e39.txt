 Perry, if someone is so clueless as to post a general programming
 question to cypherpunks, do you think they're going to "get it"?  You
 need to explain it in very   small   words.
 
 This mailing list, cypherpunks, is about encryption.  It's not about
 reminiscing about old personal computers (however much fun it is to
 do) and showing off our respective ages.  Yes, you may consider this a
 Russ-o-gram.

Yes you are right. BUT its funny. I only asked something about another
mailing that was done yesterday about real-protected mode and the chip
desing. So while its there.. why not take a question outta it!! hehe
