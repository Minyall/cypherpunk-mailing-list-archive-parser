The Codebreakers by Kahn is available at some stores.  (Powell's Technical
books in Portland, OR has copies.  It is right next to Applied
Cryptography.)  It has not filtered down to some ordering systems, so some
bookstores claim it is out of print.

Warning:  The book is $65.00 hardbound!  (It is also *NOT* a small book.
It is large.  About 2000 pages by my guess.  (Maybe more.  I was being
pulled out of the bookstore at the time.  My wife was trying to save me
from the evil mind control rays of Powell's Tech books.)

I know what is on my shopping list for Christmas.
