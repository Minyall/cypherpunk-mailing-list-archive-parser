IANAL, but I have one, and he said (a couple of years ago) that these  
shrinkwrap contracts are practically worthless without a signature.  At least  
this was how things were being handled in some districts.  Anyone care to  
comment?

crypto relevance:  Can RSADSI __really__ enforce the silly "thou shalt not  
call certain functions" restrictions in their 'license'?  I doubt it, but I  
would love for someone to prove me wrong.
