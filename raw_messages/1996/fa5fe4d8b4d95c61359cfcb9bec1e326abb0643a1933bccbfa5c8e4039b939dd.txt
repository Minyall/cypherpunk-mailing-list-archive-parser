-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

I've finally gotten around to adding secret key cracking support to pgpcrack.
There also have been a few minor code changes to speed things up a bit.  The
source and cooresponding signature are located at
http://www.voicenet.com/~markm/pgpcrack.html.  Bug reports and suggestions are,
as always, welcome.
