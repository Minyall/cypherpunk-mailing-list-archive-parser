  There is no trouble brewing.  The final release of 3.0 will be
happening shortly.  The final US version without expiration will
be made available from our US download site.  Our process for
updating the US download site has not been passed over to our
release group, so it still has to be done by engineering.  We
have been concentrating on getting the release out, and didn't
think that it was crucial to get the last few betas out for US
download.  In the future this will be handled by our release
group as part of their automated process, and so you won't see
this lag in the future.
