There is 'Punk irony in spades in today's list:

	On Jan. 10, 1776, Thomas Paine published his influential 
pamphlet, ``Common Sense.'' In his call for American independence 
from England, Paine wrote, ``Everything that is right or reasonable 
pleads for separation.''  

>From personol independence to personel monopoly control:
	In 1870, John D. Rockefeller incorporated Standard Oil.  

Promises made, promises broken:
	In 1920, the League of Nations was established as the Treaty of 
	Versailles went into effect.  
and
	In 1928, the Soviet Union ordered the exile of Leon Trotsky.  

If at first you don't succeed...
	In 1946, 50 years ago, the first General Assembly of the United 
	Nations convened in London.  

Can the telescreen be far behind?:
	In 1946, the first man-made contact with the moon was made as 
	radar signals were bounced off the lunar surface.  

Gee, will ITAR be next to go?:
	In 1990, Chinese Premier Li Peng lifted Beijing's
	seven-month-old martial law, and said that by crushing
	pro-democracy protests, the army had saved China from ``the
	abyss of misery.''
