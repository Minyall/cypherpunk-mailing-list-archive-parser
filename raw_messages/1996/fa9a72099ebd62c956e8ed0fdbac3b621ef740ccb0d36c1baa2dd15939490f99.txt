I recently took a tour of Park Scientific, the scanning-probe
microscopy people, in Sunnyvale.  One of their demo-stations
showed a small portion of a hard disk (taken with an AFM
tip fitted with a small magnet to generate the force).  Most
impressive.  (I did look closely at the edges of the track,
but saw no sign of previous writes.)
