This thread is becoming isomorphic to one that took place on the
Coderpunks list.  Jonathan Wienke was promoting an idea to make the
output of a PRNG "more" random by throwing away output whose statistics
didn't match the ideal statistics of an ideal RNG.  Critics of this
scheme (including Perry) argued along these lines:

Suppose you think that quotes from Hamlet don't belong in your OTP
keystream, and so you filter them out.  In doing so, you are making your
keystream *less* random, not more, because you are making some bit
sequences more likely than others.

Given that Hamlet quotes aren't very likely, you aren't making your
keystream very much weaker, but you *are* weakening it.  

See the Coderpunks archives for more details on this argument.
