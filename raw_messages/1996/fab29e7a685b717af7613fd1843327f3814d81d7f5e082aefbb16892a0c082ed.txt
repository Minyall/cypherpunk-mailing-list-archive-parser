Polite?  You show more restraint than most of us would 
I suspect.  Actually it is probably a good tactic for the
first encounter.

It is possible to PGP-clearsign web pages using comments.
PGP's insertion of "- " before any line beginning with "-"
might cause a problem, but you'll just have to be a little
more careful.  I'm considering hacking up a "PGP verification
service" web page which will accept a PGP-signed URL, 
retrieve it, verify it, and report the results.  Of course
I'll make it clear that this service is very susceptible to
active attacks.


On a related topic it would probably be wise for you to
clear-sign your mail, Declan.  Establish a public key with me,
and next time I see mail from you saying "I've been reading
about this 'the Holocaust was a hoax' stuff and it's actually
kind of convincing." I'll know where to lay the authorship of
the words...  :-)
