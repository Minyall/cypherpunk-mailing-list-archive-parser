I spent a few years living in Columbia housing on 111th St and there are
plenty of good, cheap groceries around. If you choose to save on the rent
and to live, e.g., up by City College, then indeed there are fewer groceries
and they cost more. The clerks who work there also get paid much more than
the clerks midtown because they risk their lives.
And you spend more time commuting to Columbia.
