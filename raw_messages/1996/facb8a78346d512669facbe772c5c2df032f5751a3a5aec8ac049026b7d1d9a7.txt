Sure, what did you expect? A program that obtains your pass phrase without a
user interface?!? That would be a neat hack if you could pull it off. Should
it do mind reading, or just crack the pass phrase by brute force?

Seriously, the idea here is that the pgp front end shouldn't deal with the
user interface in your present mail program. Nobody (before you) have
considered doing it completely without a user interface.
