Unfortunately, both sentences, as originally written, DO NOT
say the same thing.  They are recursive in the extreme.  

"Society enacts laws which provide protections to the individual"
is not the logical equivalent of "Society finds it necessary to 
enact laws to protect rights" unless rights exist prior to the
enactment of laws.  

Maybe Phill should just say he misspoke himself rather then go
through his elaborate back-and-fill charade.
