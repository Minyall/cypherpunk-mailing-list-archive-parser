As I said dude; I no longer respond to any como with the cypherpunks
address in the header.  If you want an answer to your comments,
address your reply to the Freedom-knights list or to me, without
any *punks address in the header.

Any list run by an admitted Faggot is no place where I
will allow an audience.  This is not a reply to your comments.
