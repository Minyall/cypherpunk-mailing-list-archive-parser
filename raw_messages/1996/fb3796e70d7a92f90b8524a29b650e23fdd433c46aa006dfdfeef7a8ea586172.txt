Is crypt(1) a prohibited export from the US? I thought it was. The
reason I ask is that it has come to my attention that HP ships that
overseas too, with HP-UX versions 9 and 10...

The man page is a bit dated:
	crypt implements a one-rotor machine designed along the lines of the
	German Enigma, but with a 256-element rotor.  Methods of attack on
	such machines are known, but not widely; moreover the amount of work
	required is likely to be large.

Clearly written before CBW became popular.
