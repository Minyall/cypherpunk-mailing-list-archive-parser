C2 (http://www.c2.org) and I think Cyberpass (http://www.cyberpass.net) both
allow anonymous accounts.  There was also a list of offshore ISP's posted a
while ago.  I am looking into getting an account on one of these myself.

P.S. For you non-UNIX types, I am currently in the process of writing a program
that will automatically install an anonymous remailer on a UNIX account.  It
should be ready for release in the next couple of days.
