Child pornography is illegal, however I don't believe that pictures of
nekkid children are always considered to be child pornography (however much
small-minded twirps want you to believe that they are).  I know several
"fundamentalists" who decry what our society has sunk to with images such
as David's posted on the net for all to see.  I take the opposing view,
decrying the idiocy of declaring parts of our own bodies to be obscene. 
Unfortunately I don't see victory any time soon.
