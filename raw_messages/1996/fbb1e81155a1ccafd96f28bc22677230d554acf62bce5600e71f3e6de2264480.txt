Hey guys,

Take a look at:

http://www.mailmasher.com/

It's a way to get your mail through a web page. Pretty useful when you're
at a braindead "cyber-cafe" machine and want to read your mail.  The
problem is, mailmasher knows you POP password.

Anyway to do this more securely?

Cheers,
Bob
