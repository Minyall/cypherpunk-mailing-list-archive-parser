There's also an article in today's San Jose Mercury News.

I'm just wondering how the hell they would enforce regulations on carrying
voice over the Internet. Are they going to analyze every packet? What
happens when someone makes a trivial modification to the code, or adds a
gateway, so that the voice call uses a different UDP (or more likely RTP)
port and header format? 

They could try to make a frontal assault by regulating the Internet 
itself, but they should know better.
