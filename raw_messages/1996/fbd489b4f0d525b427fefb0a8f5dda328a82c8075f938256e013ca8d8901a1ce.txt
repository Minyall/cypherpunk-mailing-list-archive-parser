Myself also, I suppose.  That's why I'm so concerned that it not contain any 
component that could be easily be re-written more to our liking.  The big 
attraction of the Burns bill, from a strategic standpoint, is that (by the 
elimination of export controls, assuming it does it) it removes the one 
major "must do" task onto which could be loaded other "features" that we 
can't stand, as the Leahy bill tried to do.  Once export controls are 
eliminated on crypto, it should become impossible to get enough support to 
pass a bill even mentioning key escrow, let alone mandating it.
