I'm not quite in Flushing, but: it's possible to keep one at home, but
a carry licence is impossible.

Russians in Russia are very polite to boys wearing leather and riding BMW's.
New Yorkers are sometimes polite to black men wearing lots of gold jewelry.
Maybe they suspect something.

I think it would take very few 'depopulation' incidents to improve manners.
Humans, like rats, are very good at learning from others' mistakes.

There are some very interesting discussions in Bruno Solnik's book I
mentioned about the worth of anonymity v. reputation in financial markets.
I wonder if it would be possible for government officials to hide behind
anonymity. Everyone will hate a certain gov't official, but no one will
know who s/he is?

That's an interesting question - want to think about a protocol?
