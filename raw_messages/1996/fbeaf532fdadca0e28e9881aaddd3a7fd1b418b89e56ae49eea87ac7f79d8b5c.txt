It is very similar, both in tests and in basic principle, to Satan.

The differences between the two are hype and Satan is free to anyone who can
figure how to make it work.  (Not always an easy task...  Especially on Linux.)

Such tools are very useful for system admin types to fix holes and for
hackers to find them. It is not the "all powerful hacker tool" the media
makes it out to be.

What this has to do with crypto, I have no idea...
