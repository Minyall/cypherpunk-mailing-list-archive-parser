Spy Agency Said to Have Spare Billions


     The National Reconnaissance Office, the secret agency
     that builds spy satellites, lost track of more than $2 
billion in
     classified money last year, largely because of its own 
internal
     secrecy, intelligence officials say.

     
     In the past, congressional oversight of the reconnaissance 
office
     has been sketchy, because few members of Congress
     understood the highly technical language of spy satellites 
and some
     did not know what they were approving when they authorized 
billions
     of dollars a year in secret spending.
