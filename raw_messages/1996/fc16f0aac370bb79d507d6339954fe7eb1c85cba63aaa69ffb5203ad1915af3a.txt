I will be spending a fair part of my time over the next few months
investigating java security, especially from the point of view of trying to
break it.

I'd like to hear from coderpunks/cypherpunks having ideas about how to
break it, especially if you don't have the time/energy to pursue the idea
to fruition yourself.
