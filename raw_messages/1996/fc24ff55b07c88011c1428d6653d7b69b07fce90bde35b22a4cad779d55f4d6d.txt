Did you ever see one of those mattress tags which reads something like 
"removal of this tag is a violation of ..... and is punishable by ..."?
They could tag the stuff, then make it a violation of law to cut the

and besides, how are you gonna go half way on legislating against 
untraceable barter (other than to prohibit dividing the beef)?
