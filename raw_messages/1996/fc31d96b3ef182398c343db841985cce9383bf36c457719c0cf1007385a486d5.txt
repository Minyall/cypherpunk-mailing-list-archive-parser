I just switched ISP's to Netcom, and I HATE their web browser and 
REALLY hate their mail program.  Can anyone direct me to a good mail 
program that will allow me to download my mail and read/reply to it 
offline, as well as the NETCOM compatibility settings necessary to make 
it work?  Even Netscape would be preferable to the status quo, if I had 
the proper settings (DNS IP address, mail server address, etc).  Please 
respond by email to avoid further list noise.
