	All valid points, but when the likes of Nathaniel Borenstein &
his cohorts use the failures of snake oil to discredit all
cryptography, then we have a problem. (Not to say that Netscape is
selling snake oil... but I figure that FV would capitalize on a snake
oil failure to further their anti-cryptography agenda just as they
have used the Netscape RNG bug)
