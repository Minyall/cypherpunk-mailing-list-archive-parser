Picric acid is easier for amateurs to make than TNT.

It has the same energy per unit mass as TNT, but it's destructive
power is greater because of the substantially higher velocity of
detonation.

It is far less predictable and far easier to detonate than TNT.  Also
TNT has the advantage that it can be melted and poured into molds,
and it is cheaper to manufacture in large quantities.
