He's listed in the staff section, but he's clearly labeled as a
fellow. P.J. O'Rourke is also listed in the same column as a fellow. I
suppose he's working at Cato full time and only moonlights at Rolling
Stone. The fact that neither of them lives within striking distance of
Cato headquarters (O'Rourke lives in New Hampshire) makes your claim
ever more interesting.
