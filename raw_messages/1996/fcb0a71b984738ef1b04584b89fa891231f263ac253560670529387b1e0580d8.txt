<< Anyone have the current black-letter regulations? I'll have some time
 to kill over the holidays that might as well be used for civil

 Provide invalid ID, don't get caught, then publicize the fact? Provide 
 invalid ID and get caught? Or, better:
 
 "My wallet was stolen. The only ID I have on me is my ACLU membership 
 card and my PGP key. Can I still get on the plane?" >>

Well, something of the sort happened to me...
I didn't have my ID on me. (Delta airlines..) and they _WOULD_NOT_ let me on
the plane without the proper ID. I actually had lost my ID shortly before...
Then... A different time at the airport.. American airlines told me that If I
didn't have ID.. Id still be let on... just that the way they process my
baggage would be different ( I imagine they would physically look through
it...
