Yes, this was I (or "me").

I first read of Chaum's work in late '85, in his CACM article, and then
"rediscovered" it when I was doing some review work for Phil Salin's AMIX
information market startup in 1987.

Certainly the text of Chaum's articles implied both payer and payee
anonymity, though certain details may've been unclear to some of us.

When Chaum unveiled his "payer is anonymous, but payee is traceable," some
of us were surprised.

(On the other hand, I have had a longstanding faith that the system can be
made to be both payer- and payee-anonymous. Moneychangers, for example.)

I agree with Jim Bell on this completely. I don't know if Chaum has been
seduced by the Dark Side, or is looking to get digicash widely deployed by
"respectable" institutions, or is telling the truth (that his system
_never_ provided for real untraceability), but I know that Cypherpunks
should always strive for full untraceability.

One-sided traceability is not enough.
