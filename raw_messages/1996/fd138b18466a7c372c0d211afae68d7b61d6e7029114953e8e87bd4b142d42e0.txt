Sorry, but no.

If you know that your posting is off topic, you shouldn't be posting
it, period. Reply in private or some such. The S to N ratio in these
parts is dropping rapidly, and its largely the fault of people who
think "just one more off topic post can't hurt". One person doing it
causes little damage, but unfortunately dozens upon dozens feel the
urge every day.

I usually just reply to such posts in private and note that they are
off topic, but since you insisted on bringing it up in public...
