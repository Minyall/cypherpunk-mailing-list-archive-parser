  This is typical "the reporter doesn't understand the difference
between RSA and symetric cipher key sizes" reporting.  What it
really boils down to is that export software can use larger key
sizes for certain application specific encryption.  For example
if you limit what is being encrypted to fixed length financial
information such as credit card numbers and ammounts you can
use keys larger than 40 bits.

Reported in today's Wall Street Journal

Basically Verifone's credit card processing technology
(credit card verification) will be bundled with Netscape's
Commerce server.

Netscape also announced that the software will use new
encryption technology being developed by MasterCard and
Visa.  I don't know what this quote means:

  That technology would break sensitive information like
  credit-card data into 1,024 bits of information, instead
  of the 128 bits used currently, theoretically making it
  much more difficult to steal.
