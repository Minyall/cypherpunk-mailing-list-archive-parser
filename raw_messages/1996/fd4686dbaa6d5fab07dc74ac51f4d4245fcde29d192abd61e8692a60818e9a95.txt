I know that there were already several replies so I'll just add a little more

If you are in DOS, you can prevent the cookies file from being written to by
making it read-only (attrib +r cookies.txt).  Ditto for UNIX.  Also, if you
have Netscape 3.04b, you can enable a security option that notifies you
whenever a server attempts to send you a cookie.
