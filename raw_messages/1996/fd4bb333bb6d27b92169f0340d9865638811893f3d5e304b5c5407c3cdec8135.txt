No, the market for the more mainstream MFM's is small (a few K devices), for 
MFSTM's it's even smaller (a few dozen?).  MFSTM's are usually built by 
universities for research purposes, which means the patent won't affect them.  
As I said before, it's purely a "we paid for the research, we want some paper 
to wave around to justify the cost" thing.

You can see the results, just read the Journal of Applied Physics or IEEE 
Transactions on Magnetics.
 
I know people like to come up with conspiracy theories about the NSA, but this 
patent won't work as the basis for one.
