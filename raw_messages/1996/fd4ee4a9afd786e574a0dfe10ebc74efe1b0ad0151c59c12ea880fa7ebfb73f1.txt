Drawing an analogy with encryption and US ITAR, a poster reported that
A piper is being taken to court for practicing on Hampstead Heath,
which has a by-law forbidding music. Mr Brooks, the piper, has denied
the charge. He claims he wasn't playing a musical instrument, but
practicing with a weapon. In 1746 in England, bagpipes were declared to
be instruments of war, not musical weapons, and a subsequent Act of
Parliament specifically stated that they were weapons.
