Yep, matter of fact that's what the light versions of cpunx are for.  's 
matter of fact I happen to run one of them and my subscribers are happier 
without all the noise and flames here.  :)  as for me, I don't mind the 
noise or the flames, I tend to hit the "D" key quite often. :)

Especially since Cypherpunks isn't the only list I subscribe to.  I go 
through about 200-300 messages a day, and 80% of them get delted without 
a single look.  I tend to read the 1st few messages of a topic, and if 
it's noise, it gets axed. :)
