In the early feudal period, ordinary knights did not live well.  
They were only moderately better off than peasants, and yet to support one 
knight, you needed a startlingly large number of peasants, a fact
that kings were continually unhappy about and continually trying
to fix.

While it is difficult to assess the tax rate, because taxes were
in kind, it was clearly very low by modern standards.
