	I see nothing cowardly about opposing a bad law from where the
Feds can't harrass you.  If the Feds were 'moral and upright' about
enforcing the ITARs, instead of keeping Phil under indictment until
the last minute, harrassing MIT via Sandia National Labs, and refusing
to make clear the laws under which we live, then you might call it
cowardly to oppose the law from behind a shield of anonymity.
However, the Feds don't play by any set of rules known to the public.
