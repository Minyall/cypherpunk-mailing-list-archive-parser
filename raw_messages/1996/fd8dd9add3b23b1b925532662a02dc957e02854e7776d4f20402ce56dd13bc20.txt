  With all the recent talk about converted oil-rig DataHavens floating
around the oceans, fending off pirates, and Low-Orbit satellite
communications, I had a thought.

  How about an orbiting DataHaven. No jurisdiction to bother with,
extremely difficult to get to (except by large governments...). You could
put together a couple of Linux boxes with a RAID system, some backups and a
large solar panel and have a very nice, secure DataHaven.

  Granted, you wouldn't have all the fun of floating around the south
pacific fending off pirates and navies who are after your data, but it
would work. Might even be cheaper than outfitting the oil-ring with the
rate that they are tossing satellites into space.

  If the HAM radio community can get a satellite into space, why not the
Cypherpunks/Linux communities?
