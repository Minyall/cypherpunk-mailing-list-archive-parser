I have personally attended a cypherpunks meeting.  Seems that's not one 
of the required ommissions.

Cute.

Perhaps, if these identity issues tire you so, you should stop fostering 
them?

This, of course, ignores all issues of reputation capital.  The message 
is still only as good as the messenger, which is why I have maintained 
this nym for so long.  Or more accurately, the message is only as good as 
it is heard.  The message is heard in proportion to the reputation 
capital the messenger holds.

I believe this in error.  This is why I work to debunk Mr. Bell, and why 
I don't post with complete anonyminity.  Of course, as you have no 
reputation capital of note, you would be of the view that posting without 
any name at all would be of no worth.  You, like Mr. Bell, have little to 
lose.
