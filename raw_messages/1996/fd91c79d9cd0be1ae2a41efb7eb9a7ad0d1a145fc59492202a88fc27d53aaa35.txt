Do spaces (ASCII 20) in passwords make them less secure?

I was speaking with a security admin who feels that spaces decrease the effectiveness of 
passwords.

I thought that they would actually do the opposite & increase password efficacy, as most 
password dictionary attacks do not attempt to attack embedded spaces. An attack trying to 
penetrate embedded spaces would seem to make the dictionary orders or magnitude larger.

Any comments?
