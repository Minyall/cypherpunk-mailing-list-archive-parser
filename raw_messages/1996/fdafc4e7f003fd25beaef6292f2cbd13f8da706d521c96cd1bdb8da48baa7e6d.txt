"Verifying them in person" would, in fact, be essentially impossible. Few
sources of documentation mean much, in fact. Consider that I joined Intel
in 1974 and was never once asked for any form of identification...I just
showed up for work under my assumed name, Tim May, and no one was the
wiser.

Ask yourself this: Have you _ever_ really "verified" the identity of your
girlfriend, your friends, your co-workers? (I mean this not to pose an
existential riddle of no real significance, but to remind people how seldom
we ever actually try to verify that people are "really" who they say they
are.)

Representatives from my ISP, got.net, have attended some of my
parties...and they _still_ don't know that I am _actually_ Irving J.

For which purposes? DLs are notoriously easy to forge. I think $25 is the
going price. (And DLs which would fool people like us are probably doable
on any H-P color inkjet printer.)

My point in all this being that "proofs of identity" aren't all they're
cracked up to be.
