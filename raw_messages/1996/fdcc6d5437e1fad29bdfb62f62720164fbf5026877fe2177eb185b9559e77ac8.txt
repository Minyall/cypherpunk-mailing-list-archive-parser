It is an inversion of that quotation and it does indeed sum up our focus.
It has no name on it because I switched it around to make a motto for our
work.  Not that I disagree with Franklin though.  The comment is true both
ways around.

:)  As a former teacher at the University of London department of adult
studies, teaching history, politics and International Relations I can
assure you I am very familiar with the history and belief of
totalitarianism - and have opposed them all my life.

That's not how I have it but hey! Obviously we are dealing here with a man
who knows his quotes.
