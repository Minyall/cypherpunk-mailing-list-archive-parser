Well I have been given my notice to terminate the remailers running at
this account. Make a note to remove ncognito from your type2.list, and
those running pingers, please remove nCognito as soon as its convenient.

Below i've quoted verbatim the request to shutdown that I received. PLEASE
note that there is no mention of FBI, NSA, or Co$. :)  The request is the
result of some errors that mix generated while I was makeing changes, that
resulted in the administration at gate.net noticing the remailer. Frankly,
I cant blame them given the current legal climate.

Although I would have liked to continute operating the remailers, I must
admit that I'll sleep better at night now that its gone. 

BTW: Does anyone know of a few ISP's that accept cash and dont require
verification of your identity? :)

Please note that CyberGate does not support remailer program so please stop
running it on gate.net immediately. Repeated violation will cause your login
privilege compromised. Your cooperation will be appreciated.
