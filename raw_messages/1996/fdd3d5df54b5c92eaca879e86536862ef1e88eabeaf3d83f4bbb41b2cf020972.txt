As you say, fetching keys for all keys you ever receive will cause your
keyring to become excessive ...

I prefer to be able to fetch a key in real time when I want to send to it.
As such, I wrote a reasonably defined command such that "if the exit code is
0, then stdout is the armoured key for the KeyID or UserID specified on the
command line".  In future, it'll use the new Distributed Key Server, but until
then, it uses a "fast" server (a perl daemon which loads the whole keyring into
a DBM backed ASSOC array) or WWW servers.

  making one attempt per week to get the greatly overdue Fat Pipe upgrade going
  it'll be somewhat more for anyone outside the UK :-((
