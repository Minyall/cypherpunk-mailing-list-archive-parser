But they succeeded in blocking Webcom. Until the block is removed, we
haven't won. Do 'we' agree that the block should be removed?

Amen. I just wished that the people who's names mark some of the milestones
in the fights for our rights (i.e, Miranda, as in Miranda Rights) were
people whose causes I can support. Having seen concentration camps, I can
not possibly sympathize with Mr. ZÃ¼ndel's views. But he still has a right
to free speech. If he loses it, we lose it. It all comes down to this:


                First they came for the Communists,
                  and I didn't speak up,
                    because I wasn't a Communist.
                Then they came for the Jews,
                  and I didn't speak up,
                    because I wasn't a Jew.
                Then they came for the Catholics,
                  and I didn't speak up,
                    because I was a Protestant.
                Then they came for me,
                  and by that time there was no one
                    left to speak up for me.

I can imagine what they wrote. "The world is supporting our cause...." No,
I do not support their cause. I despise their cause. And I still support
their rights.
