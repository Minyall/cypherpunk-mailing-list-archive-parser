I hope Dimitri will stop hidding behind his computer and "honor" 
us with his presence at an SF Bay area Cypherpunks meeting.  I've 
got pledges for nearly $1200 to bring him out here to speak.  All
we need now is a serious response from Dimitri.  I guess when the
going gets tough, the "net legends" get yellow.  What are you 
afraid of Dimitri?
