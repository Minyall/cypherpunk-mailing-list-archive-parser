You should expect software companies to make more money and for prices to
come down.  Remember, there's not just one software company.  This scheme
would force some of the people who would copy software to buy it,
increasing the profits to the software companies.  So, why would the price
come down?  Well, because of the increased profit margin, there is now
room for the price to come down, and since there is competition among
software companies, at least one of them will lower prices for the
advantage it will give them.  The others will have to follow.
