Close, but the cigar doesn't burn long enough.  Capitalism, as said by
one who knows, is as much an enemy (well, almost) of Free Enterprise as
is Socialism, due to Capitalism rewarding monopolies as they do, with
their Golden Parachutes et al discouraging real investment on the part
of most corporate "leaders".

Just don't confuse "Free Trade" with "Free Enterprise".
