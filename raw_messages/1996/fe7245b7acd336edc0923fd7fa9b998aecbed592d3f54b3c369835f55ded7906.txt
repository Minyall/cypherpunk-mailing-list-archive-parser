The government has, for quite some time, attempted to control most things 
in our lives (and quite successfully) by evoking the "interstate commerce 
clause" incantation.  Only recently has the Supreme Court put its 
collective foot down (in the recently-decided "no guns within 1000 feet 
of a school" law, which the government LOST).  Let's hope it does it more 
often :)
