I had absolutely no problem with Sternlight subscribing to cpunks.  In fact,
I would be opposed to any action that attempted to remove him from the list.
I also have the right to killfile whomever I want to, and I will defend that
right, also.  However, if cpunks was a "closed" list with a definitive charter,
I would not be displeased with any of the list owners who would prevent David
Sternlight from subscribing or posting to the list.
