It seems to me that the best argument AGAINST supporting (and using) keys
greater than 2048 bits is the false sense of security created.  Even
1024-bit keys will probably be safe for decades if just the algorithm is
concerned.  Far more threatening are various other attacks, including RF
snooping in combination with specialized viruses, as well as black-bag jobs
on hardware.

5-foot chain-link fence?!?
