Not so. There are unfortunate tricks that can be played here because
some encryptions preserve properties of the underlying text (like
parity) and some checksums can be manipulated because of the same.

I've asked the crypto types for information on simplified faster MACs
for use in authentication protocols for IPSEC and I have yet to get a
straight answer, so for the moment I'm erring on the side of caution, too.
