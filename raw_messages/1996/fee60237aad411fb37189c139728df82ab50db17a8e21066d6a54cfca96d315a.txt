I am looking to hire someone part-time (with potential to upgrade to
full-time) to work for Counterpane Systems, doing cryptography consulting
for a variety of clients.

The work is in analysis and design, mostly of cryptographic and security
systems.  Think of SSL, SPKI, PGP... that sort of thing.  There isn't a
whole lot of math, just critical thinking, complete analysis, and good
writing.

If anyone is interested, please send me mail.  (Depending on the number of
responses received, I may have some kind of application test.)

Bruce
