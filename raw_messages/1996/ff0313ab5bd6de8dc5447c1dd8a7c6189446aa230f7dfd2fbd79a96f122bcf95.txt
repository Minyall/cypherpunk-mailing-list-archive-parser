A little simplistic, perhaps, but nevertheless accurate.  800 and 900
numbers do not receive CNID (Calling Number ID).  They receive ANI
(Automatic Number Identification).  In the case of 800 (or 888) numbers,
they're paying for the call.  For 900's, you're paying a premium charge.
In both cases, the calling number is delivered for billing purposes.
This isn't new... ANI has been around for years.

Speak for yourself.  I have CNID, and I find it to be damn useful in
deciding which calls go to voicemail.
