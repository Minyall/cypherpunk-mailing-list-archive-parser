Not really, it's a tool used in Data Warehousing/Decission Support 
Systems.

Here is what it is in a nut shell.

A company creates a Data Warehouse, defining it's data universe in 
terms of business rules and practices.

Data Mining is the process by which users try to make sence of all 
the data.

They call it "intelligent" because it supports natural language 
queries, ie the end user does not need to know SQL or the table 
layouts to retrieve the information they want.

Very sketchy explination, but there are entire volumes written on the 
subject, and it's new technology so the exact definition varies 
depending on who you ask.

I have been developing systems like this for the past year, and I 
still can't give people a cut and dry answer as to what the hell it 
is.
