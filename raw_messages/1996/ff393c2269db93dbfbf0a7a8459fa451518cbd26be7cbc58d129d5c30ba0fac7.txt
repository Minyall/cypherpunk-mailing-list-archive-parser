Welcome to 1984+  what else with useless and illegally constituted
bureaucrats add to their total infringement of every facet of our life. 

-.NEW SYSTEM LINKS LENDERS, IRS

-.The Internal Revenue Service is developing an electronic program to link
-.mortgage lenders with the IRS, allowing them to exchange e-mail comparing
-.stated earnings on the mortgage application with actual tax return
-.information for the previous couple of years.  If the cross-check turns up a
-.more than $10,000 discrepancy between the earnings claimed on the application
-.and those declared for tax purposes, the IRS has the option of pursuing the
-.loan applicant via an audit.  IRS has targeted the system at self-employed
-.borrowers, who often declare high earnings in order to qualify for a larger
-.loan, but lower earnings when it comes to paying taxes.  "Who knows what
-.their real incomes are?" asks one mortgage broker.

one of the few things we all share: 
  the utter, corrosive contempt for our elected officials.

  Politicians are like diapers.
    They both need changing regularly, and for the same reason.
