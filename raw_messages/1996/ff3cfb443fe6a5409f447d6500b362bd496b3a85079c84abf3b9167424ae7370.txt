But, as in the case of any PHYSICAL (ie: security box at the bank, blah 
blah blah) items, at least in escrow, if you DON'T have the key, then you 
don't get the loot.

If we fight for the same rights, at a minimum, in both the physical AND 
the electronic forums (and we should have more of both! :)), then this 
case should be no different than any other case.
