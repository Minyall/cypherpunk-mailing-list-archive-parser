It sounds to me like your argument abstracts thusly:

"Personally, I fail to see the point to the development of more powerful
computers, since I can always steal time from other people's current
technology computers."

One could make this statement about _all_ advances in processor
technology. And it boils down to this: you're not paying for it, so you
don't see the point in getting more bang for the buck. People who are
paying for it, and have neither the inclination nor the ability to steal,  
do see the point of getting more bang for the buck. And eventually even
you'll benefit, when you find yourself writing a java applet to freeload
processor time on someone else's DNA computer. Meanwhile, processor
technology will have advanced because many people went out and paid for
faster (Intel/PowerPC/PowerDNA/Whatever) CPU's. Not because you freeloaded
off of someone else.
