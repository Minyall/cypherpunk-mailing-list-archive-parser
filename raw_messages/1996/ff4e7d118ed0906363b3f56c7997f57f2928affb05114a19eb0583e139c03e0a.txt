A scenario:

1) The spooks put a bug (named Eve) on the link between
kiwi.cs.berkeley.edu and the Internet.

   Whenever kiwi.cs.berkeley.edu sents out the pubring.pgp Eve intercepts
it and replaces it with a file of the spooks' choosing. This file will
selectively replace the public pgp keys of some of the remailers (say exon)
in pubring.pgp with keys to which the spooks know the private key.

2) A similar bug is put on the link between the exon remailer and the
internet. All email to exon is intercepted, and if found to be encrypted
with the spooks' PGP key, it is decrypted, saved, re-encrypted with exon's
real PGP key and sent on.

It is only a scenario. I am still using premail to send this.
