A little greedy.

Other people have set up a multitude of remailers for substantially less.

We now need remailers, preferably many, many small remailers rather than
one big remailer, that is as easy to reply to as alt.penet.fi, but which
gives substantially better security, that is to say the reply address can 
map to a remailer chain, instead of being constrained to map to a regular
address as the penet.fi remailer did.
