So, the "expanded version" of the story says that it was a nazi-mirror, and
FUDless verbage why Futplex did it, and that UMASS Amherst said they didn't
want "Political messages" on their web-server, so they booted Futplex.

LOL! The most Politically Correct university in the universe doesn't want
"Political messages" on their web server!

The ganglia twitch...
