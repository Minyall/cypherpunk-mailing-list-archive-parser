Not exactly currency exchange.  More like simple exchange.  Don't confuse
"issuing ecash" with "exchanging ecash for cash".  Issuing implies that
you have assets to back up the ecash.  Exchange only means that your
giving up your ecash for an equivalent amount of cash. 

Anybody could conceivably "exchange ecash".  Only "banks", who back up 
your money by law and researves can "issue ecash".
