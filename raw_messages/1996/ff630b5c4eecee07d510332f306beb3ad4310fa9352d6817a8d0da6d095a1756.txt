        you know, the last time one of them fuzzy weird colored things, 
    you know, the kind which is always crawling around the edge of any 
    gathering with stick signs and chanting, ...well, the other day one 
    them things accidently crossed my sights, and my whole trigger hand 
    went into an involuntary spasm.  

        ...well, the judge he told me to take my medication and 
    dismissed the charges.  As I thanked the judge and reminded him of 
    the meeting tonight, I remembered the fuzzy little thing's last 
    words: "...Tax the Rich." 

        ...you know, that fuzzy little thing really looked like that 
    city slicker flatlander what up here last month --Dale or somethin' 
    like it! 

        I did not quite understand the significance of that, but I 
    thought to myself: 

            "oh, yeah, that's right: 'Nuke the Whales'."
