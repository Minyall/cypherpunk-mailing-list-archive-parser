I complied pgpcrack (which was on the list a few days ago) on a 
SPARCstation-10 running SunOS 4.1.4.

Running pgpcrack on a -c encrypted file (duress.pgp) encrypted with the 
passphrase "lover" (which is in my dictionary file) results in the 
following output after under 1 second.  (The dictionary file I was using 
is about 250k):

PGPCrack passphrase: cruddy

Using the same plaintext encrypted with "pain" the following output after 
3 seconds or so:

PGPCrack passphrase: promulgate

A third time, same plaintest -c'd with "avoid" results in:

PGPCrack passphrase: cerebral

Seems to work just fine on linux.
