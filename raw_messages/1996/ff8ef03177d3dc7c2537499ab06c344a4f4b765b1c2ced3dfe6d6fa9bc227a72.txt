Mike Godwin can speak to this a lot better than I can, but I believe that 
by abandoning their case against PRZ, they have seriously weakened their 
case against anyone else that they feel has violated the ITAR in a 
similar manner - it's called "selective enforcement" and courts have been 
taking a dim view of that sort of thing.

I predict that you will start seeing a *lot* of crypto software showing up
on FTP sites within the next 24-48 hours, as news of this spreads.
