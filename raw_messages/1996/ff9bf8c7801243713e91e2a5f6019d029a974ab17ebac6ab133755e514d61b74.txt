Don't forget: There are lots of colleges and universities on the net,
and most of these universities have undergraduates, and a significant
fraction of these undergraduates are minors.  The potential user base is
going to be mixed and must be presumed to be so.  (That, I'm told, is
the chief justification of the Carnegie-Mellon ban on the alt.sex.*
Usenet newsgroups.) *Lots* of systems are affected by this problem.

(Remember, as far as the CDA is concerned, a seventeen-year-and-eleven-
month-old downloading nekkid pictures is every bit as bad as a
six-year-old doing so.)
