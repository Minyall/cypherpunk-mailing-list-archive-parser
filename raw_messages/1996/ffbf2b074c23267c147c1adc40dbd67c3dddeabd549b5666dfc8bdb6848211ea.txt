I am NOT relieved at hearing this.  If one must have a "judge's waiver," 
then that means he probably can "request" whatever other conditions he 
chooses to put on his waiver.  The government still has a motivation to make 
every crime a felony, down to and including jaywalking and speeding tickets. 
 (Don't try to tell me "they can't turn speeding tickets into a felony."  
The term "felony" is defined, and can be RE-defined, to whatever the 
legislature wants at any time.  Naturally, this won't occur all at once; 
it'll happen in "reasonable" stages.)

All the more reason to adopt a system that will rid us of these parasites 
forever.
