You lose!

Typical Microsoft arrogance:
                                                               Welcome to MSNBC


                              Welcome to MSNBC

                                   [LINK]

















http://www.msnbc.com/default.asp?

Since Lynx is the only browser blind^H^H^H^H^Hvisually challenged

case of discrimination.
