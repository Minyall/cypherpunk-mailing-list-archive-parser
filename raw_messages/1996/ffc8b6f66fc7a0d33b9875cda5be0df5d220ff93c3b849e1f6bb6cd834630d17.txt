While I have never come even close to needing to attempt this kind of thing, 
long ago it occurred to me that if the "no read" bit was stored in a 
programmable bit, and if the location of that bit was known or could be 
identified, you could expose that particular bit through a tiny mask hole 
and cause the part to be readable again.  Locating that bit (assuming 
there's just one) would be relatively simple:  Take a test part, program it, 
read-lock it, and then expose it to a VERY slowly sliding mask with UV 
behind.  Do this for both axes, to find the bit's location on the chip.
