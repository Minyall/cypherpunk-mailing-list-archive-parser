You don't think the rest of the press is truly any better, do you?
At least on the net, you get to see the horse's mouth on a bad day,
and sometimes you can even meet the people and track down the rumors 
hat eventually become headlines, and pull the wool over your own eyes.

Dorothy Denning may know a lot of mathematics about cryptography, 
but that doesn't make her any more fit to decide what policies the 
government ought to enforce than I am.  She'll get the 
technical details correct far more often than Senator Burns,
as would most people here, but being a trained ethicist would perhaps
be more relevant than being a trained mathematician - it doesn't take
that much technical explanation to know that crypto lets you have
private conversations.
