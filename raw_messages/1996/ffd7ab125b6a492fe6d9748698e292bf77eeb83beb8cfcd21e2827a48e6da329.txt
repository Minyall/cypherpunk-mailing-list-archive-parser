IMHO, it will end up similar to the late night infomerical spots on TV.
Not puch of value there, but bored people will still look.

Any effort to regulate it will come from a tangent; IDs of some sort
to post in public, or have access to the net, or screening it out of
the hypothetical InfoBahn II networks,  or similar.

Would the concept of moderated forum have to go away, too? People could
look for messages signed by the moderator, but the overhead inherent in
validating keys could make that unusable.

The transition would be messy, once (if) two parallel systems were in
place. Many people using the new system would start tagging messages
with newsgroup names, of course, but the breakdown effect of lots of
people posting messages that seem to go straight to the void would have
a negative impact on the whole thing.

Something similar to the namespace pollution problem large companies
see with resumes would also start to happen, only in a much more
shameless form (Spam, the Next Generation).

Once enough specific search terms emerged as coherent analogues to
groups, this might be functional, though.

I'm interested. I see a lot of problems, though, with implementation
details, especially while both the old and the new exsist side by side.

Something more akin to _Islands In The Net_ style data havens seems more
workable, but with obvious disadvantages...
