I wouldn't give Netcom my CC# if my life depended on it.  They have a 
really lousy record of people breaking in, stealing their lists of CC 
numbers, then Netcom trying to sweep it under the rug and not telling 
their users that their CC# was compromised.

Besides, their service really sucks, and their technical "support" 
doesn't exist.
