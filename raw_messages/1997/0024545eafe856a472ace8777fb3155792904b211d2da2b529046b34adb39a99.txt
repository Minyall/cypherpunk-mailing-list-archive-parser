It makes sense that the Net.Scum pages would be hosted by Cyperpromotions
since every other ISP that hosted the web pages were threatened with
libel suits.  As I understand it, Cyberpromo's web hosting services
are separate from their junk email services.  Cyberpromotions gets so
many legal threats that a few more don't make a large difference.  This
was also the reason why an anonymous poster suggested Cyberpromo as a
possible remailer-friendly ISP.
