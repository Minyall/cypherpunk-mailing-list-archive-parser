  And then the rest of the children were made to stand at attention
while
the Jews, the Buddhists, the Muslims, et al, performed their own
religious
rituals, right?

  Big news, Tim...non-violent discrimination against a particular 
religious faction is not quite the same as freedom from religious 
persecution.
  i.e. - Not kicking Seth's Christkilling little butt is not the 
equivalent of letting him engage in his religious activities in 
school just as the Christian kids do.
