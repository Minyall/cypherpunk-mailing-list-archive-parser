I'm looking forward to this demo! Hell, maybe I'll volunteer to actually
commit whatever crime is being furthered!

The language of SAFE would directly impinge on use of anonymous, chained
remailers for many uses. Some use remailers to harass others, a crime in
many jurisdictions. Some use it to post or transfer so-called "child porn,"
a crime in some jurisdictions.

(But, I assure you, our local community--implicated in the Salinas
so-called "porn ring," use PGP to protect themselves from finks. Under
SAFE, these neighbors of mine could be hit with heavier penalties for using
crypto in furtherance of their crimes than the supposed crimes involve!)

Let's call a spade a spade...cryptography, anonymity, and untraceable
digital cash will be used often for criminal purposes. So what else is knew?

By the way, speaking of digital cash, think about the obvious implications
of the SAFE provisions for untraceable digital cash. Talk about a chilling
effect.
