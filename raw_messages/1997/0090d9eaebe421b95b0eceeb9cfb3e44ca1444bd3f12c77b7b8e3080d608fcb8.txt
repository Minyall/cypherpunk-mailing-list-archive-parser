This is probably more serious than the year 2000 problem.  Unix/posix has
become the de facto standard operating system.  Apple has already migrated
to a unix/mach kernel.  Even Microsoft's NT has substantial amounts of
unix-derived code.  You're kidding yourself if you think this software
won't be around in some form fourty years from now.

The fix is (seemingly) simple:
  typedef unsigned long int time_t;

Which will give you a year 2106 problem instead. :)

That'll at least fix most email systems.  InterNetNews will need a bit
more work to prevent it from trashing its history file come 3:14am
on January 19, 2038.
