Unfortunately neither does the 14th respect any right, only immunities
and privileges (which clearly are not rights since they can both be
revoked by the granting agency) but it doesn't work because it allows
the feds to intrude in areas they were not meant to be involved in.

The original Constitution already had a clause applying the Constitution
and all laws derived from it to the states and preventing judges or other
agencies from bypassing them. So, given that such extensions were already
in place just what does the 14th do?
