BXA has published its semiannual regulatory agenda
scheduling the issuance of export rules for encryption,
dual use technology, Wassenaar implementation, 
communications intercept devices, and, a new one (to me), 
controlling access to source code by foreign nationals, 
among other banes.

Here's the abstract for GAK:

-----

   604. LICENSING OF, AND EXPANSION OF NATIONAL SECURITY 
   AND FOREIGN POLICY CONTROLS ON, RECOVERABLE 
   ENCRYPTION SOFTWARE

   Abstract: This rule will amend the Export Administration Regulations by 
   imposing enhanced national security and foreign policy controls on 
   certain recoverable encryption to supplement the national security 
   controls on those items. This rule will also amend the EAR to exclude 
   recoverable encryption software from the de minimis provisions for 
   exports from abroad of foreign-origin software incorporating U.S.-
   origin software. In addition, this rule amends the Commerce Control 
   List by adding ECCNs to control recoverable encryption software 
   transferred from the U.S. Munitions List.
