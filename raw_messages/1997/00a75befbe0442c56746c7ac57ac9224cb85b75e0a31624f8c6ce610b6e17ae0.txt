Oh, this is just charming.  People are still dying, and now you're
going to sit on the sidelines making tally marks for your pissing
contest.

You can't count up human lives and say ``this entity is more evil than
this entity.''  It doesn't work that way.  People are people,
regardless, and usually don't deserve that kind of premature
termination.

As for the running dictionary flame, by all means, piss on.  Perhaps
later, when you mature a little, discussion can get back to more
meaningful topics.
