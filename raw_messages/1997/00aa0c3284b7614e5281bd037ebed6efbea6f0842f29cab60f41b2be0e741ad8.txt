Sprint's network was somewhat overloaded due to the bogus routes
redirecting traffic onto their network. I doubt the problem spread as far
as Europe, at least on a widespread basis. We have about 200 sites
worldwide, only a few actually connected to Sprint. We only saw
intermittent failures reaching some sites for about an hour. 

The problem occured at about 11:30 a.m. EDT, when the routers in question 
began sending invalid paths. The routers were shutdown at 12:15. 
Re-convergence might have taken another 20 mins. or so.

FLX. ASN 7007.

The Sprint router took in 72,000 bogus routes from the downstream 
source before it crapped out. A lot of traffic ended up being re-directed 
to Sprint as a result of the route problem, causing them to haul higher 
than normal levels of traffic.

Sprint probably should have been filtering routes / AS_PATH (insert debate
here) from its downstreams. This is a management challenge, but Bad
Things(tm) can happen if you don't.

Why are you picking on Cisco? The equipment in question was a pair of Bay
Networks BLN routers. The jury is still out as to whether this was a Bay
bug or a config screw-up.
