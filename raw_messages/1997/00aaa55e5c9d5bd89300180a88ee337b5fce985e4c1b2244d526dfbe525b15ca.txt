So, write a new browser (Theres a linux project staring to do 
this for linux soon/now (i think anyway)) and then port to a bunch of 
systems and base it outside the US. There aren't any import restriction 
on strong crypto yet are there ?? Besides you could then set up a home 
page ala. netscape.com and rake in the advertising dollars, if you can 
get teh browser to take off. A lot of if's and work but in theory it 
works.
