HotWired's "Hot Seat" interviewed two private investigators who consult
doing hostile data recovery. Their comments are interesting, both in terms
of illustrating what can (and can't) be recovered, and in terms of the
scope of civil discovery which has become standard in civil disputes. A
transcript is at
