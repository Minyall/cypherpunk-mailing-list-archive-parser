The traditional solution, which happened to a number of early
photo-radar cameras, involves a ski-mask and a baseball bat;
more subtle approaches rely on spray-paint, which does less
damage to the expensive equipment, but spray paint is a Controlled Substance
in many cities....

Other approaches, for the video-surveillance types of cameras,
are to always use appropriate gestures when you're near the things.
