The 1938 Nazi law barred Jews from businesses involving firearms. 
On November 10, 1938 -- one day after the Nazi party terror squads 
(the SS) savaged thousands of Jews, synagogues, and Jewish 
businesses throughout Germany -- new regulations under the 
Weapons Law specifically barred Jews from owning any weapons, 
even clubs or knives.
