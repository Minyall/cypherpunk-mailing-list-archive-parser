VERDICTS IN CASES OF DEFAMATORY LIBEL.

   317. Where, on the trial of an indictment for publishing a defamatory
   libel, a plea of not guilty is pleaded, the jury that is sworn to try
   the issue may give a general verdict of guilty or not guilty on the
   whole matter put in issue on the indictment, and shall not be required
   or directed by the judge to find the defendant guilty merely on proof
   of publication by the defendant of the alleged defamatory libel, and
   of the sense ascribed thereto in the indictment, but the judge may, in
   his discretion, give a direction or opinion to the jury on the matter
   in issue as in other criminal proceedings, and the jury may, on the
   issue, find a special verdict. [R.S., c.C-34, s.281.]
