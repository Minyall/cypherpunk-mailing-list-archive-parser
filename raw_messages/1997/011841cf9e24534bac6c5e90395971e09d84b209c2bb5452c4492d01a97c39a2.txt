Someone is vastly over-reacting.  I read this letter as a polite request
to do what they think is the "right thing" along with some reasons
intended to gently persuade you that this is a morally correct choice. 

There is no threat.  No hint of compulsion.  It is IMHO utterly legal and
appropriate.

Just as it would be utterly legal to comply with or ignore this
letter. (Appropriateness we could debate...)

No foul.
