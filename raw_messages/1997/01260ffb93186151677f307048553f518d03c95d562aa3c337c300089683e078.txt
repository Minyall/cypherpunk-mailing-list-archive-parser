Well, now that wouldn't be very smart of me, would it, to tell the world
where my defensive measures are? (I'm willing to let would-be ninjas know
that I won't take a no-knock raid without fighting back, as this may deter
them, in classic game-theoretic terms, but not to tell them precise details
of my defenses.)

Check the ads in the gun and survival mags for ideas. Seismic (footfall,
vehicle) detectors are affordable, but hard to monitor on a 24/7 basis.
Simple photolectric vehicle detectors are useful. In my case, I have a
private driveway about 100 meters long as the only access to my house. Not
to hard to rig up methods to warn of vehicles approaching...harder to warn
of men approaching on foot. And even harder if they come up through the
brush and chapparal on the other 3 sides.

The main thing is to provide a minute or so of warning of vehicles
approaching in the middle of the night.

The usual advice is to secure one's bedroom for immediate invasion. (My
bedroom is on the second floor, too.) This helps with burglars as well as
with ninjas. For example, lock the bedroom door. This will slow down
attackers, who first have to gain access to the main house, then have to
get in the bedroom. The noise from the first step should provide valuable
seconds of awakening, grabbing a gun, etc. I don't think a locked bedroom
door will stop an entry team from getting inside in a matter of seconds,
but every second helps.

(Experts also advise that homeowners facing such assaults "stay put,"
unless, of course, they have to defend other family members in other rooms.)

And ignore the advice from the Consumer Protection Safety Commission, etc.,
to lock all guns up in safes or vaults or closets. A gun locked up in a gun
safe can't be gotten to when it's really needed, can it?

Oh, and loading a gun takes far too long, especially in the dark and in a
crisis situation. (And keeping ammo out of the gun is only a minor speed
bump to inquistive children, so it's not even much protection there.)

"What about the children?" For children too young to understand orders,
come up with an access solution that gives you fast access but keeps little
Suzie from finding the gun. For children old enough to understand orders,
and what guns are, tell them exactly what a gun does, show them, educate
them, and warn them to NEVER touch the gun or show it to their friends
(this is exactly where many accidental shootings happening, with Johnny
showing his friends Dad's gun).
