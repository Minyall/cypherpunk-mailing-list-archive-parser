     "VeriSign on Monday said it received permission from 
       the U.S. Department of Commerce to export 128-bit 
       strong encryption software and issue digital 
       identifications to approved organizations based on 
       that software. "

     "Under the 128-bit scheme approved by the U.S. 
      government Monday, companies will not need to 
      place their encryption keys in escrow, or submit 
      to U.S. government key-recovery requirements in 
     order to use VeriSign's software, company officials said."
