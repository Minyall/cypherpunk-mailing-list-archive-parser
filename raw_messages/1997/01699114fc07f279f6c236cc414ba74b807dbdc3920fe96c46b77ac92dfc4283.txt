Thanks, John. This does indeed confirm what I was talking about. I hadn't
realized they had gotten bans on microphones that are politically
incorrect, except, of course, for themselves.

Why not just go all the way and ban typewriters and photocopiers,  except
for themselves, as other repressive regimes have done?

And who can say with a straight face they haven't earned sanctioning?
