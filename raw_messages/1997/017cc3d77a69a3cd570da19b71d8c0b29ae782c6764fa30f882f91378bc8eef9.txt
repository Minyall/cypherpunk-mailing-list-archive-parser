Agreed.  But PGP Inc may be able to deploy their system better than
some lone hacker is able to deploy a perl hack.  And deployment of
pgp5.5 / 5.0 is required to provide automatic interoperability for
this.

(Yes I know you could bounce the mail, and demand a Cc: snoop@acme.com
to go with all mails to fred@acme.com, and use a lot of pgp2.x setups
to auto-encrypt to those recipients with pgp2.x crypto recipients, but
this is not as convenient).

Fine, a good, entirely separable functionality.

You are right, it's not.

Just because things are possible, doesn't mean you should _do_ them,
nor attempt to massively deploy them.

If the pgp5.5 functionality is designed to provide companies with a
disaster recovery procedure (forgotten passphrase, or dead employee),
there are much better ways to do it.  We're not arguing against the
user requirement, just against the methodology.

Sure, that works.  For now.
