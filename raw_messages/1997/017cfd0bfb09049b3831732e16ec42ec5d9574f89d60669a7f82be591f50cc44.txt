What Congress can grant, they can take away. I'm not sure if I like the
SAFE language that "grants" me the right to use whatever encryption device
I like at whatever strength I like. 

You see... I thought that was an inalienable right that Congress can't
grant, let alone take back.

No pro-crypto legislation will survive a Clinton veto. I challenge those
who disagree to post a contrary scenario.
