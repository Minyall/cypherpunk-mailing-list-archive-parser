    tim:  

    two points you make: 

    1.  the propogation is slow...

    2.  some sites do not carry alt. groups

    are enough to kill an active discussion list. of course, it does
    slow down excessive volume.

    I vote we just set up a new majordomo with some additional antispam 
    filters including knocking out exploding mail headers, etc. I would 
    accept excluding non-members as long as we take the remailers which 
    are listed with either JP or RL.

    Therefore, I am willing to host it on our majordomo which I have 
    pretty well shaken down for other lists.  other than spam and 
    potentially non-members, I refuse to even consider censorship or 
    moderation in any form.  

    Likewise, Jim Choate and Sten Drescher apparently are trying to 
    establish a multi-site majordomo.  the extra work of maintaining 
    non-duplicates and sychronization makes the task non-trivial and 
    questionable...

    as for failure mode recovery, I can always run a backup from 
    primenet; I dont really see the need for it; we have had less than 
    4 hours downtime in the last year, and that for a regional power 
    failure which will be a mute point sometime this spring when the 
    diesal generators arrive.  knock on wood, but the T1 has been up 
    straight through.
