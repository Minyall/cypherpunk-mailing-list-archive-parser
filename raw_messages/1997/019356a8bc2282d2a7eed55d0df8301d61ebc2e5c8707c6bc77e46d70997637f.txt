>www.myemail.net is a commercial remailer service;

BTW, it only seems to know how to send mail to one recipient;
I tried sending mail to 
	cypherpunks@toad.com, administrator@myemail.net
and it only acknowledged the former.
I then tried sending mail to administrator@myemail.net
and found that address was blocked :-)
