Though I hate the conmcept of key escrow, it actually makes sense for 
corporations to be able to have access to internal documents. Why they 
think having key escrow in place will stop people from being able to use 
other encryption as well is beyond me. I guess it's the same (stupid) 
mentality of the feds. They don't think anyone would be smart enough to use 
the escrowed encryption a a wrapper for the non-escrowed encryption.

include the corporate public key (or conform to other corporate policies):
