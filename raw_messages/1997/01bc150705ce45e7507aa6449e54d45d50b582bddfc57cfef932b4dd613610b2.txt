I have just updated my survey of existing and envisaged cryptography
laws and regulations. 
See the Crypto Law Survey at
http://cwis.kub.nl/~frw/people/koops/lawsurvy.htm

This update includes:
-    update on Australia (Walsh report), Germany (Interior Ministry
     opinion), Sweden (IT commission report), US (government bill
     amended, Kerrey-McCain bill, SAFE act amended and passed House
     committees, czar travel FOIA request) 
-    clarification on Singapore (import, domestic), Japan (government cannot choose) 
-    URLs added to Belgium (law proposals), Canada (export), UK (cyber-rights report) 

Comments are as always welcomed.

Kind regards,
Bert-Jaap
