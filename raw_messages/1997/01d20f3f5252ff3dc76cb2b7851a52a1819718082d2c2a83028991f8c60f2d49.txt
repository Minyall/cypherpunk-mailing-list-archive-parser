How would you know, old fart?  You've announced that you killfile me and
a dozen other people who know C2Net for what they are.  Therefore you
can't "see" anything coming from me, unless you're lying again.

Yeah, right.  That's coming from the same individual who didn't object
to C2Net's "moderation" of this mailing list when Cocksucker John Gilmore
announced it, and who also supported Cocksucker John Gilmore's forcibly
unsubscribing me from the mailing list by repeating his lies about
the "volume", not the "contents" of my writings that got my plug pulled,
alluding to the bogus numbers like "50 articles / day" and "megabytes
of Serdar Argic reposts [about the genocide of 2 million Moslems and
Sephardic Jews by the Armenians]".

Timmy, you're a liar.

If the Arab terrorist Sameer "Gas All Kikes" Parekh and his obsequitous
lackeys Greg Broils and Sandy Sandfart and their NSA bosses had it their
way, you'd have to show your Federal ID card every time you pay cash and
also record the serial numbers on the notes. (I understand that recording
the serial numbers is the standard practice in some countries.)
