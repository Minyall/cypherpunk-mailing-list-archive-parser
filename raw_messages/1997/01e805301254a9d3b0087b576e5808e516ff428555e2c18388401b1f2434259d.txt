Lutz,

I am not quite sure what your point is here. A company has every right to
listen in on any phone conversation you make on their phones. There is no
"expectation of privacy". Many companies have strict guidlines on how you
can use their phones, just try spending alot of time on a 900 number. As
far as emergancy calls, I know of no company that disalows them but don't
expect them to be private as they are not.

This is not and issue of storage & communication this is an issue of
property rights. The owner of the property is the one with the rights. :)
