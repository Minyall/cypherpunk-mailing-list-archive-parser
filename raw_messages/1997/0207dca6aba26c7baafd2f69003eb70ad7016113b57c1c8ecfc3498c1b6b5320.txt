I worked for a gay man in Beverly Hills and Encino for 3 years.  I
learned a lot about "signals" during that time.  Bigot?  I don't

(and who grew up where I did) told me she could spot 'em every time.

I'll bet you do!  Er, I wouldn't bend over in front of you, that is.
No offense, ya' know.

BTW, my browser has a problem with your lines that have no c/r after
