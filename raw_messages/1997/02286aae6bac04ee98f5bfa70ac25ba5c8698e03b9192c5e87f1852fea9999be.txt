	The way I remember it, it was only defeated after <oh shit, I'm
drawing a blank here what was his name...> at Bell Labs/Lucent Technologies 
proved that the clipper chip could be counterfeitted and interoperate with 
"legitimate" clippered devices.

	Most people didn't even know about the fight, much less take a side. 

	The Code was written by Mr. Blaze, and the law fell apart.
