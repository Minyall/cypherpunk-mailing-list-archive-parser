I refer, inter alia, to the smelly Arab pulling the plug on netscum@c2.net back
when c2 peddling "privacy". The following is from Parekh's own net.scum page:

]Sameer Parekh, sameer@c2.net, pulled the plug on the Net.Scum pages because

]that he exercises no control over his users' contents. He clearly lied:

Note that Parekh pulled netscum's plug in October, 1996, because he didn't
like the contents of a web page critical of Timmy C. May,

If you review the Cyperpunks archives from that time, you will see that
Parekh was being sued by the Software Publishers Association, was whining all
over the mailing list and asking for "petitions" in his defense, and was
claiming that he exercises no control over the content on C2net.

Is that proof enough for you that the smelly Arab is a pathological liar?
