Bryan,

What you did may be the ideal way to go actually. It would be
great to have several NNTP servers with these (or similarly named)
groups open to the world. I believe that it is possible to set 
them up such that they feed each other.

say, the following groups may be good:

cypherpunks.crypto
cypherpunks.politics
cypherpunks.flames
cypherpunks.products
cypherpunks.pgp (sort of redundant with the pgp newsgroups)
cypherpunks.groups
cypherpunks.admin
cypherpunks.kooks
cypherpunks.remailers
cypherpunks.paranoia (or cypherpunks.tla)
cypherpunks.politics.assassination
cypherpunks.censorship

(the following part is more questionable as some people would argue in
favor of nocems)

cypherpunks.moderated.sandy-sandfort
cypherpunks.moderated.ray-arachelian
cypherpunks.moderated.tim-may
cypherpunks.moderated.... whoever else wants ...
