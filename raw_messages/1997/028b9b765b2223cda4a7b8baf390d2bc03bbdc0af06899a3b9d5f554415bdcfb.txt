Thanks, I shall look up Feistel-type networks. Nope, I don't 
understand the mathematics very very well, and that's why I 
asked. While I haven't seen the official GOST specs but all 
the reference I could find indicates that GOST specs don't 
discuss the process of generating SBOX permutations and GOST 
sboxes are not mathematically understood. 

Regarding the developer's ethical responsibilities with experimental 
technology I rather have the consumer decide (and of course 
document the limitations).

Thanks, 
Vipul
