One of my projects involves tracking language drift; i.e the relative
change in word frequency on the internet as time goes by.  This is
useful for predicting concept movement, and the anglisization
rates of non-English language countries.

Now, one day while browsing the frequencies from the 10 billion
word corpus, what do I see?

God     	2,177,242
America 	2,178,046
designed        2,181,106
five    	2,189,194
December        2,190,028
