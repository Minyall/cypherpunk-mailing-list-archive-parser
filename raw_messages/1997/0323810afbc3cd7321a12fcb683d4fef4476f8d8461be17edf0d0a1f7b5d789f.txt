So can you use pgp5.0 to construct a CMR key which would
interoperate with pgp5.5 for business?

Clearly pgp5.0 does nothing with these flags on reciept, but does it
understand them when sending?

Scenario: I work for Mega Corp, and it is using pgp5.5, and is using
CMR with companies key.

Does pgp5.0 reply encrypting to just me as individual, or two crypto
recipients me, and Mega Corp recovery key?

I would be interested on clarification of this point.

Yes, I'm not so much arguing about the flexibility or the mechanism,
as what it is being used for.  I consider there are more secure and
more GAK resistant ways to acheive same functionality.

It is evil.  But it is not _as_ evil.

The reason for this is that government access to storage keys is not
as evil as government access to communications keys, because the
government has to come and capture the ciphertext (take your disk),
whereas with communications they can grab them via an arrangement with
your ISP.

Indeed.  It is of only marginal use.

See point above.

This is not avoidable for storage ... if you are encrypting data on
disk, and if you want recovery information, you have no choice but to
allow company access.

The recovery information should be as decentralised as much as
possible.  (Perhaps this should be the Stewart corollary).

The point though is that storage recovery is a completely separable
issue from communications "recovery" which is a euphamism for allowing
companies to read, or snoop, employees email, unless it is being used
soley for data recovery of mail stored in mail folders (which seems to
be what PGP Inc means by CMR term), in which case it is not necessary
functionality, and can be better acheived by encrypting the mail
archive with a user symmetric key with company storage recovery on
that key.

I would be interested to hear novel ways to minimise the likelihood
that the government could walk into your offices, grab the CD duke
box, grab the single corporate recovery key and walk off.

Decentralisation is one good way -- recovery keys are in hands of
department and group heads -- secret splitting is another good way --
and (your suggestion) omitting some of recovery bits is a small
addtional hinderance to intruders after plaintext.
