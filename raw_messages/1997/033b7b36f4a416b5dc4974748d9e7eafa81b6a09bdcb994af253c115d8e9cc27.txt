Hoo, boy...

Make sure you get (buy?) citizenship somewhere else first, okay, Sameer? :-).

Seriously, it would be indeed a drag to have a whole bunch of
cypherpunks-without-a-country out there, no matter what we all say about
the evils of nation-states...

Anyone out there have suggestions about a domicile of choice? Vince's old
"perputual tourist" thing comes to mind, but I'm not conviced that's really
practical.

I heard someone talking about Belize at FC97. The Seychelles have come up
around here, more than once, for those with $10million to throw around...

However, I tend to agree with Tim about this whole regulatory arbitrage
stuff. Nothing keeps the law honest like good software. :-).

Cheers,
