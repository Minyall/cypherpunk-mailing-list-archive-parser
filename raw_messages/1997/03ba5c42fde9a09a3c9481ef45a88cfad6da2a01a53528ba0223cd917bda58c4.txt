While a keyserver with no authentication has a very low barrier to entry
for false authentication, the barrier is not that much higher for even a
Verisign class three verification.  I've continually said that the biggest
problem with secure authentication is that secure authentication is not
possible.

I hate to see people doing such things with keyservers and keys, but we all
knew the problem existed.  I wonder where the solution is.
