I'm not sure sending him money for lawyers would be most helpful.

I was thinking another type of profession entirely.


Until Jim actually gets charged for something I don't see that
freedom of speech is the issue. Jim appears to be in trouble
for reasons not associated with his AP rants. The AP manifesto
has made it worse and attracted the opinion of the press but it
does not appear to have caused his trouble, merely affected the 
way he was dealt with.

AP probably caused there to be 20 heavilly armed cops rather than
two unarmed ones. It probably meant that casual comments were
taken rather more seriously than otherwise. Bell was always much
more wacko off list than on.
