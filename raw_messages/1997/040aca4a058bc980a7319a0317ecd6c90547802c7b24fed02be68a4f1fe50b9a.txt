You can write a program to read both the censored and uncensored
email, and do a diff. You wouldn't have to see it, and it could be
done so that a "fake" address subscribes to the censored list.

Maybe I should offer this as a service to the uncensored list? ;-)

None should say "I can trust" or "I cannot trust" until they are the master
of the option of trusting or not trusting.
