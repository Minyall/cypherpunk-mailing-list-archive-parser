The elected scum are far from being human.  Apparently you haven't been
paying attention to lovely incidents involving plungers.  Is that
demonizing them?  Yes?  Good!

What compassion did they show?  Toilet plungers?  Bullets in the head,
flame throwers and tanks?

Unquestionable?  The very fact that I'm replying to you rather than
sending out the toilet plunger brigade should give you a hint.  What would
the LEA's do were you to present the same arguement to them and cause
enough noise that others took notice?

Right.  Same thing they must have been feeding the FBI the morning of the
Waco incident.  I believe the key phrases were "gun toting child
molesters."  Nevermind that they fried to a crisp those same kids they
supposedly were going to free from the clutches of the evil gun toting
child molesters, and the supposed molesters.

Incorrect: this process is objectively identical to the process
experienced by all HUMANS when faced with a horrid freedom destroying
government.  That it coincidentally is the same for the jackbooted thugs
before they are told to attack.

The difference is that no one is telling me to hate or feel rage.  The
actions of those who abuse freedom are my only inspiration.

Better that than standing in the auditorium and having Philip Zimmerman's
face displayed on the screen, interposed with a film of keys and cyphers
encrypting data and screaming wordlessly durring the Two Minutes of
Hate.  At least the former is based in honesty, not governmental orderes
under the threat of thoughtcrime.  It's not enough to fear Big Brother,
you must love him.

Still doesn't lessen the enemy's action, nor will it help the wrongs they
commited any.

Who said I'd be in the trenches or murder the enemy?  Who said I would
pick up a weapon and use it?  Hating them is not the same as taking
actions to quench that hate.  That should give your panic pause for
thought.

Do what you think is necessary within your ideals.

Erm?  What Jihad?  Since where are we so organized and sacred?  Hell, I
don't even own a gun, I don't know where you get your knee jerk reaction
from.  You certainly don't see me renting a Rider Truck and buying
fertilizer.  So where do you get "sacred" and "jihad" from?

Am I supposed to silence my hatred for the crimes against humanity that
the scum in power have commited, or for their incessant attempts at
destroying our freedoms because you can't deal with another's hatred?
Because you imagine and fear that hatred will lead to action?  Isn't that
what CENSORSHIP is about after all?

I wouldn't think, nor hate, this way if it weren't for thinking about my
family and loved ones and their freedom.
