Another example of the violent rhetoric which goes without comment on
this list.

The death penalty is completely inappropriate for this kind of crime.
It should be reserved for the most serious of criminal actions, the most
egregious murders, terrorism, genocide.

An appropriate punishment for a judge who violates his oath of office
and sentences someone wrongly to prison would be a prison sentence for
the judge himself, some multiple of the unjust sentence.

Calling for the death penalty for crimes which do not themselves involve
killing only cheapens life.  Before long you too will support shooting
graffiti vandals and nuking London.
