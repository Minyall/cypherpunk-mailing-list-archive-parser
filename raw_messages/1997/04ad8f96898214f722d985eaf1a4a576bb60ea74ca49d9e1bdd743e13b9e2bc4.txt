December 11, 1997, NYTimes: Reno Says Plan Will "Match Wits"
With Technological Criminals By JERI CLAUSING

>>> A new first for Reno/Justice! Encryption not even
    on the agenda! absolutely unreal --of course, being
    cynical at heart (and having watched the snakes and
    other assorted vermin inside the Beltway, encryption
    control will be back...

WASHINGTON Justice officials from the world's largest
industrial countries met here on Wednesday to draft an
international plan that Attorney General Janet Reno said was
designed to catch cybercriminals and ensure no safe haven
exists for them.

... "Today is an important day in fighting computer crime,
and in laying the groundwork for the next century of crime
fighting,"  ... cover the following principles:

1.  Ensuring that a sufficient number of trained and 
    equipped law enforcement personnel are enlisted to fight
    high-tech crime.

2.  Creating contacts available on a 24-hour basis to allow
    countries to move quickly in tracking down computer
    criminals.

3.  Developing faster ways to trace attacks on computer
    networks and identify hackers.

4.  Carrying out a criminal prosecution in the country a
    suspect flees to, if extradition is impossible.

5.  Taking steps to preserve important information on 
    computer networks to help prevent tampering.

6.  Reviewing the respective legal systems in each nation to
    make sure there are appropriate crimes for computer
    wrongdoing and to make it easier to investigate the 
    crimes.

7.  Working with the industry to come up with new ways to
    detect and prevent computer crimes.

8.  Stepping up efforts to use new technologies, such as
    so-called video links, which would allow obtaining 
    testimony from witnesses in other countries.

...  Reno said the contentious topic of encryption
regulation was not a focus of the meeting.  ..."We were here
to discuss a framework," she said.  "Encryption was not a
topic.  Although it was alluded to, it generally was not a
topic."

...
Asked what the biggest dangers are from technological
criminals, Reno gave the example of a hacker who can "sit in
his room in Washington, D.C., and steal from a bank in
another country," or sabotage the computer networks of
companies or governments anywhere in the world.
