Ironically, safety instructions for making bombs would almost certainly be
lumped in with the actual formulas for explosives. (Actually, as the safe
and proper handling is more critical to successful bomb-making than the
mere mixture of chemicals, this is a certainty.)

And, as usual, the law will probably end up being applied to people
innocent of criminal intent.

And the _real_ bombers will continue to learn their trade at training camps
in the deserts of Sudan and Iraq, and, of course, in the various militaries.
