Too complex for what you're really doing.  Give your lawyer a floppy
with the key revocation certificate and a yellow sticky about how
to call Alice or Bob for help if your lawyer's not computer-literate
enough to follow the README file.  If you're paranoid about the cops
getting your unindicted co-conspirators' names, use PGP Inc.
or some computer consultant instead of Alice and Bob and have your
lawyer pay their per-hour rate.  On your One Phone Call,
tell him to get the floppy out of the sealed envelope in his safe
and use it.

Key revocation certificates don't leak your private keys,
so the only risk if the Bad Guys get a copy is denial of service,
including the pain of rebuilding all your connections, etc.;
it doesn't leak your communications or allow them to forge mail.
