* In June, a Scripps Howard News Service reporter examined
Consumer Product Safety Commission records recently made
public and found that 1,823 serious injuries caused by "electronic
air-fresheners" had been reported to the agency.  Though the
records were short on details, they included 50 cases of amputation,
46 burns, 48 scaldings, 68 poisonings, 56 "foreign-body"
penetrations, and 69 "drownings."
