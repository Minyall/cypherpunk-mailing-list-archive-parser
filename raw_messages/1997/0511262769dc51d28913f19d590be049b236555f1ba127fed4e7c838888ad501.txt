Woodwose (who appears to have borrowed my last name for his "True Name")
appears to have done a variation of this--except that if there are
complaints about messages being sent from woodwose@mailexcite.com, I doubt
anything will happen other than the woodwose account at mailexcite.com
being closed.  Hence, his "disposable remailer" claim.  Any shmuck can log
on and input a fake name, address, and demographic data to create a new
account at hotmail, mailexcite, or juno.  In this way, as existing
remailers are harassed out of existence, new ones can be created on a daily
or hourly basis.  It would probably be interesting to find out how much
info these outfits collect (cookies, etc.) that could be definitively
linked to a True Name.
