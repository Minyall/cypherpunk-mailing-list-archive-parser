I just got off a phone with an industry lobbyist. The conversation went
something like this.

"Can there be a compromise?" I asked. "I don't think there can be one that
will satisfy all three or four parties involved." (I was thinking: law
enforcement, national security, business, and privacy interests.)

The answer: "I don't think compromise is the right word. But we need to
give something to law enforcement."
