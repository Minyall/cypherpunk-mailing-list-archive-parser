Not a _sub_sect, or subset, but a _super_set.

Unless JC had a time machine, Judaism predates Xtianity.

In any case, the convention is that "Judeo-Christianity" is the general
tradition connected with the Old Testament, the Ten Commandments, the
pre-Xtian prophets, and so on.

If your parents really drilled this "sub-sect" business into your head,
maybe you ought to ask them to lighten up on the drill, or use a different
bit, or something.
