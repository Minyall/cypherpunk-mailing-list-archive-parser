I call bullshit on this whole line of reasoning!

All prohibition of speech should be based on the judgement of whether or
not specific individiuals (not general groups or socienty at large) can be
reasonably be deduced to be at immediate risk or be harmed from that speech.

I find lust to be a noble urge.

What happens when you sell high-power autos to immature consumers which can
only be used as promoted by traveling at speeds well in excess of safe?

Following this line of reasoning, isn't it appropriate that any
attractive/exciting experience which gets the adreneline pumping (with the
possibility for abuse and injury to third-parties) be regulated?

I think some families in Oklahoma City may disagree.

Now you've transgressed from speech to possession.

Regulated or banned?  I find war to be the best such example, but we still
have massive armies and a military-industrial complex don't we?

Can you back up this assertion with clinical data?

I believe it means you are a wanna-be Libertarian.
