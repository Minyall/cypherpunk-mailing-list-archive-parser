By a reasonable definition whoever has a monopoly on force *is* the
government.  A rather significant body of history indicates that 
force monopolies arise spontaneously in any society.

It's actually closer to a cult -- a small group with it's own shared
reality -- a reality quite at variance with societal norms.  The cult
has its own terminology, and an underlying dogma to which these code
words refer.  The cult has "special knowledge" that has been revealed
to them concerning massive changes that will happen to society --
changes that will usher in a new world order.  These changes may 
involve the world going through a cleansing fire of war of war and 
destruction. 

The members constantly reinforce each other's beliefs with stroking
messages -- eg:

Certain of the members sport a messiah or a martyr complex.  It is 
also quite common for cults to call for arming the brethren against 
the coming struggle -- even the Heaven's Gate group apparently had 
stashes of weapons.

It's all so predictable.
