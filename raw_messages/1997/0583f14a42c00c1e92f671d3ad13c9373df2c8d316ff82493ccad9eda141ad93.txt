Well, for a start, you can save evidence of the steps you took in making
the images.  If you are combining images (adult actors for the X stuff, and
children for the faces etc.) then save the original images and some of the
rejected intermediate images.  If you are drawing from scratch (e.g. using
paint and brush), save the sketches, and perhaps also photos of the
intermediate stages of the final image.

Given a rational legal system (Yea, I know), these steps should give a
complete defense against the charge that you abused children in making the
images.
