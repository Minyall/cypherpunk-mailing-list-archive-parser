Hi, 

Here is A Better Way to Wash Your Pet

Think of it as a shower massage for pets. SHAMPETTE easily snaps on to any garden or shower hose. With an integrated shampoo reservoir for instant lather, and flow through massaging fingers that get deep down to the pet's skin. Fleas, ticks & loose hair will have nowhere to hide. 

Special promotional gift with each purchase, go to link below.
