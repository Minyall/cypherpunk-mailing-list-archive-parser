> QUANTUM TELEPORTATION has been experimentally
> demonstrated by physicists at the University of Innsbruck (Anton
> Zeilinger, 011-43-676-305-8608, anton.zeilinger@ uibk.ac.at; Dik
> Bouwmeester, Dik.Bouwmeester@uibk.ac.at).  First proposed in
> 1993 by Charles Bennett of IBM (914-945-3118), quantum
> teleportation allow physicists to take a photon (or any other
> quantum-scale particle, such as an atom), and transfer its properties
> (such as its polarization) to another photon--even if the two photons
> are on opposite sides of the galaxy.  Note that this scheme
> transports the particle's properties to the remote location and not the
> particle itself. And as with Star Trek's Captain Kirk, whose body
> is destroyed at the teleporter and reconstructed at his destination,
> the state of the original photon must be destroyed to create an exact
> reconstruction at the other end.  In the Innsbruck experiment, the
> researchers create a pair of photons A and B that are quantum
> mechanically "entangled": the polarization of each photon is in a
> fuzzy, undetermined state, yet the two photons have a precisely
> defined interrelationship.  If one photon is later measured to have,
> say, a horizontal polarization, then the other photon must "collapse"
> into the complementary state of vertical polarization.  In the
> experiment, one of the entangled photons A arrives at an optical
> device at the exact time as a "message" photon M whose
> polarization state is to be teleported.  These two photons enter a
> device where they become indistinguishable, thus effacing our
> knowledge of M's polarization (the equivalent of destroying
> Kirk).What the researchers have verified is that by ensuring that
> M's polarization is complementary to A's, then B's polarization
> would now have to assume the same value as M's. In other words,
> although M and B have never been in contact, B has been imprinted
> with M's polarization value, across the whole galaxy,
> instantaneously. This does not mean that faster-than-light
> information transfer has occurred. The people at the sending station
> must still convey the fact that teleportation had been successful by
> making a phone call or using some other light-speed or
> sub-light-speed means of communication. While physicists don't
> foresee the possibility of teleporting large-scale objects like humans,
> this scheme will have uses in quantum computing and cryptography.
