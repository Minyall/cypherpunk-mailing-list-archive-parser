Hello. I just posted an encryption program on the web. It uses a key-
generated pseudorandom stream of characters that get XORed with the 
plaintext to produce the cyphertext. For decryption, the same stream 
is run against the cyphertext. (Such is the nature of the XOR 
operation.) You can download the program at:

I am interested in other people's views, comments, questions, etc. on 
this program. Any questions, comments, etc. can be sent to me at 
"semprini@theschool.com".

Thanks,

Dylan
