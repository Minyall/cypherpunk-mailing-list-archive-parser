This problably wouldn't be to cool a thing to do.  A fella named Douglas
Hopstader(?) wrote a book called Meta-Mathematics (same guy who wrote The
Golden Knot).  In this book he developed (or showed, forget who should get
credit) an algorithm to solve Rubiks cube from any beginning state.

It makes for interesting reading, but kills any attempt to use the cube as a
cipher machine.
