The New York Times has a long report today on the
massive data banks about US citizens operated by
commercial services for sale to marketers (and used
by databankers for special ops against those who sue 
them).

Emphasis is given to the number of states that sell
low-cost inmate services for data entry and preparation
of hot-selling Geographical Information Surveys which
map and stat in minute detail the life-style preferences
of purchasers. And how sharp and horny inmates snatch 
select data for criminal attacks on unwary citizens (and their
children) who cooperatively provided personal information 
to government agencies and market researchers.

Texas is featured as a leader in the privatization of
government data and using inmate labor to underbid
offshore sweatshop competitors -- all engendered
by citizen demands to reduce tax burdens.

Another report covers the Microsoft/Netscape effort
to ward off government regulation by agreeing on a
privacy protection program.

It's not clear how government and inmates will join the two
public-spirited corps in peddling the illusion of privacy.
