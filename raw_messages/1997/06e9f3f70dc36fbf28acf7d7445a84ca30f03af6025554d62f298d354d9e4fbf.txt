"Kingdom .... free enterprise" -- hmmm  :-)
With an automated system, you can probably _register_ any name,
but you might have trouble keeping it registered.
Don't know how they'd feel about obscene names, or
"The-King-Is-A-Fink.to" or "Return-Minerva-Now.to"....

(The Republic of Minerva was a libertarianish new country
started in the 70s on the previously unclaimed Minerva Shoals,
about 200 miles from Fiji and 450 miles from Tonga.
The founders built up the reef to above the 1 foot above high tide
level that the UN counts as "land", and were building a harbor.
After they'd been open about six months, Tonga invaded
and stole the place.)
