Recently The Jewish Defense League succeded in shutting the domain ABBC.COM
hosting a database of publicly available information of Jews who endorse 
censorship.
The ISP CLEVER.NET forced Ahmed Ramito take off the list without any 
justifiable reason such as invasion of privacy.
Under U. S. law public figures must demonstrate actual malice to recover 
damages
for invasion of privacy and for defamation.
But the information is publicly available and not covered by privacy laws 
in the United States.
