Greets, everyone!  To keep this message short, I'm just going to
beg and plead you all to go surf my page.  More specifically, I'm
begging you to surf the alert section of my page, I just put it
up today, and I think that it's something everyone needs to see.
My page is at:

http://www.geocities.com/Paris/LeftBank/4795

Wether or not you like me, or even know me, I think you ALL should
read this, and pass it on to your friends.

Daniel.
