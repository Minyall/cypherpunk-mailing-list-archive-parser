Minimalism is merely a by-product of orthogonality.  A language is considered
orthogonal if builtin functions do not provide overlapping functionality.
So the term orthogonal probably refers to the fact that there is no
point of intersection in the functionality of the language (or system, as
the thread started out).

And I will not argue about vector spaces until I get bookshelves and actually
dig my Linear Algebra texts out of the boxes around my apartment.
