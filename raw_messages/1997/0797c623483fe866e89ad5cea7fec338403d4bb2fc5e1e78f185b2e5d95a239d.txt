About The Patent
	Novadigm's Patent (Number 5,581,764) "Distributed Computer Network
	Including Hierarchical Resource Information Structure and Related
	Method of Distributing Resources" describes the processes needed
	to generate from a common reference model a unique content
	configuration for each target end user, and to "difference" the
	"desired state" configuration with the actual-state of the target,
	yielding highly granular and very specific updates to distributed
	content automatically. The patent covers two central areas:

	Desired state configuration-processes which incorporate essential
	elements of both "push" and "pull" distribution models. By
	generating from common reference model a unique user configuration
	which describes the specific software or content a target user
	should have, producers can automatically 'push' content to
	specific servers, desktops, or users; or groups of users. In
	addition, the 'pull' process provides a means for users to control
	when the flow of information takes place, what information is
	delivered, and where it is stored.  Fractional
	Differencing-processes for comparing and contrasting the desired
	state configuration identifying what components a target should
	have with the resources it actually has, resulting in a concise
	and highly detailed difference configuration describing what
	components are needed-or should by removed-to ensure the targeted
	user is properly configured with a minimum of network traffic.
