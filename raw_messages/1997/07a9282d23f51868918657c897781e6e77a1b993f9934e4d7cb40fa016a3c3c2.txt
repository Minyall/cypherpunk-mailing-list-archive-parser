There are some cops who I have known or had dealings with (even ones
who have given me a citation) who I consider very principled and generally
good people ... they actually "serve and protect".  However, from my
experience with cops in general, even the sight of a cruiser knocks
the adrenalin into gear.  I have seen friends harrassed and even beaten
by cops.  I don't trust a cop to protect my well being any more than I
trust my mechanic to protect my well being.  Big difference is, I can
choose my mechanic.
