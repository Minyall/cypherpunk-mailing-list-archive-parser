This slur is unwarranted.  The ACLU has a long tradition of defending
religious rights, even those of Christians.

My personal favorite is the case of the Jehovah's Witnesses in the
1950s.  The Witnesses believe that they cannot honestly pledge
allegiance to the flag.  They believe that they owe allegiance to God.
Were the government to act in a way that was other than God's
intention, they would be unable to cooperate.

This had to go all the way to the Supreme Court and it was the ACLU
that did it when nobody else would.

Be my guest to criticize the ACLU, but you'd do better to pick one of
their weak points.
