Major Organizations Are Experimenting With Computer Chip Implants in
Humans, According to EE Times Special Report

Manhasset, N.Y., Feb. 4 -- The implantation of computer chips into 
humans and animals is now actively being funded, researched and 
experimented by major institutions such as Stanford University, 
British Telecom, the National Institute of Health (NIH) and major 
corporations, according to the first of a two-part special report 
published by EE Times (http://www.eet.com). Although the work is 
drawing fire from civil libertarians and conspiracy theorists, among 
others, many scientists and physicians defend the work for its 
potential to ease suffering.

"It's 'Total Recall' come true! Our in-depth look into this state-of-
the- art research reveals that the mix of electrical engineering and 
medical technologies to surgically implant computer chip-driven devices 
is here today -- a micro chip implant is simply one step beyond a 
pacemaker," said EE Times Internet Editor Larry Lange.

According to the EE Times report, Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (Tokyo) 
recently developed a low-cost input device that can recognize human 
movement and convert it to commands for use in software applications. 
This device is expected to find its way into tools used by people with 
disabilities. On other fronts, the semiconductor research lab at 
Motorola Inc. is working on body-embedded electronic blood-sensors that 
may one day allow diabetics to measure their blood sugar levels without 
ever drawing a drop of blood.

The special report, appearing in next week issue in print and online, 
looks at additional areas of research and the differing reactions to it.
