An entity claiming to be Mix wrote:

: be soon."
: 
: This is depressing. Something has to be done about
: "free"-market capitalism. It is as destructive as
: government, and built on the same lies.

And what, exactly, would these lies be?  Other than any claims that
one of these "Mothership" chains will be healthy for the local economy.

I used to live in Indiana, PA, where the unemployment rate was about 12%.
A big ol' WalMart plopped down just outside of town in my last year there.
Via the power of sheer bulk-buying, they undercut EVERY local business they
competed with.  Despite the overwhelming roar of money being sucked out of 
the region, I fail to see any underhandedness.  They were honest androids.
