    Zooko Journeyman <zooko@xs4all.nl> purported to expostulate:

+So maybe _that's_ why I've found it rewarding to select _for_ 
+anonymous posts instead of against in recent times.  

+And why I toy with the notion of fomenting the kind of infowar "war
+games" that Phill Hallam-Baker hates.

    yes, Zooko, go for it; Phill needs all the help he can get to
    shake out his obviously poorly maintained and porous node which
    he has claimed to be secure.

    if Phill is secure, what difference does it make if you assault
    him?  my guess is he is not secure, and probably has no clue how
    to get from there to secure.
