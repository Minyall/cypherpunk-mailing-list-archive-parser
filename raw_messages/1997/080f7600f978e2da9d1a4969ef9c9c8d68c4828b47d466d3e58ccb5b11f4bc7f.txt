Adam,
I believe that Declan may be trying to keep things in perspective,
by reminding us who the actual users of "widespread crypto" will
be, GAK or no GAK.
As a matter of fact, Declan and I are counting on you to explain
the issues involved to our good friend and neighbor, Debbie (details
below), and get back to us with her thoughts on the crypto issues
which are relevant, from her perspective.

* At a celebrity auction in May, Debbie Dacoba of Paw Paw,
Mich., bid $8,625 for a pair of Mr. Ed's horseshoes and was so
overcome with joy when she won that she had to retreat to the
ladies' room for 20 minutes until she stopped crying.  Later she told
a reporter that she would keep the horseshoes in plastic because
specks of brown residue in the nail holes "could be manure, which I
hope it is because then I have a piece of him."
