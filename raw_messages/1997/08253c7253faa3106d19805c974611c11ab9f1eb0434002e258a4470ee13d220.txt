Unfortunately, the messages that make it through to the cypherpunks
list have their MessageID changed when they get approved.  So,
checking for duplicates by MessageID fails, given the current approval
mechanism. :(

I've informed Sandy of the problem, but he doesn't know how to
preserve the original MessageIDs.
