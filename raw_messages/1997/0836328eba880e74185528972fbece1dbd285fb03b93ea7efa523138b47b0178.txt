Summarizing an article on the Svenska Dagbladed web page:

Swiss bank accounts are no longer good for hiding illegal money.
The Swiss government has, for the first time, paid money smuggled
out by a former dictator to the country's current government.
The Swiss government returned about $2 million that was hidden
in a Swiss bank account by Moussa Traore, former dictator of Mali.

Processes are currently underway regarding Zaire's former dicator
Sese Seko Mobuto and Phillipine dictator Ferdinand Marcos, and
several others.
