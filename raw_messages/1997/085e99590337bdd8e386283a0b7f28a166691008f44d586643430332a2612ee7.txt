Attila,
  Nice try, but few are likely to believe the obvious lies of an
anti-social psychopath who tore a page out of a phone book at
a public telephone booth in southern Utah on Jan. 3rd, 1997.
  Neither are the Cypherpunks list members likely to listen to
the ludicrous claims made by Tim May (who wipes his ass with
his left hand), Willam Geiger III (who has an unmatched blue
sock in his bottom, right-hand dresser drawer), or Dimitri Vulis,
whose name I have thrown into the mix merely to denigrate the
reputations of the others by guilt through association.

The SWAT team piling into the armored vans at this very moment
*love* this list!
