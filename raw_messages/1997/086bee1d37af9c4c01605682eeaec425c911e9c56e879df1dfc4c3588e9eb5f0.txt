State is lagging in issuing the terrorist organization list required by this 
law.  It is believed that they are chicken because most of the groups would 
be Moslem groups and this would be considered a politically incorrect 
denigration of a "protected group."  Then they'd have to put the IRA on the 
list as well and that would cause controversy.  If they never issue the 
list...

In any case, I don't think that we have to worry because we don't fund 
anyone.  We just send non-cash bits.  The law requires that a foreign 
terrorist group on the "Attorney General's List" (actually State Department) 
receive money or physical support.  I suppose remailers could be targetted 
but that would make for an interesting case since anonymnity remains 
protected.
