This is an ideal value-added extension to all those surveillence TV cameras
springing up, especially on private property. With a bit of technology the
cameras and guns could automatically identify graffiti activity and alert a
security person or the resident. Tranc-type guns would be mounted on the
camera platforms.  The artists would often be found facedown on the
pavement when the police arrive.
