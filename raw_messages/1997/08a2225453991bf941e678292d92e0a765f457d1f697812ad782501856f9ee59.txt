Presumably by "this list" you are referring to the fight-censorship list,
and not the cypherpunks list (your message was distributed to both).
The cypherpunks list has been well established as an outpost of hate
and bigotry for some time.

About a year ago, influential cypherpunk Tim May turned away from the
previous emphasis on cryptography and privacy, towards a new approach
emphasizing guns, violence, killing, exclusionary rhetoric, and crude
racist humor.  New members have become active who apparently find these
topics more accessible than the arcane cryptographic technicalities
discussed in the past.  You no longer need a good mind to read the
cypherpunks list; today, a strong stomach is more important.
