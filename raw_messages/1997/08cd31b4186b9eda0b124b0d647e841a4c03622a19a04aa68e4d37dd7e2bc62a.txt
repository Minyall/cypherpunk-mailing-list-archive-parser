There is no crime called "advocating revolution" or even 
"revolution."  The crime that is being discussed in such cases is 
"sedition."

Any US Attorney will tell you that sedition convictions are hard to 
win because of the difficulty proving that the defendant actually 
tried to do so in a realistic way.  Tough.

The trial of a group of isolationists during WWII and some white 
supremacists a few years ago resulted in acquittals.
