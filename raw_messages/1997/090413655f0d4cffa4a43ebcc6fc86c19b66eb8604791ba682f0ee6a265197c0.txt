* The Times of London reported in August that the California firm
Interval Research has developed a prototype for a new wristwatch
that would be worn not on the wrist but in the wrist.  A liquid
crystal display, microchip, and battery would be implanted under
the skin, close enough to the surface so that the time would be
readable.  Battery-recharging and time-zone changes would be done
by remote control.
