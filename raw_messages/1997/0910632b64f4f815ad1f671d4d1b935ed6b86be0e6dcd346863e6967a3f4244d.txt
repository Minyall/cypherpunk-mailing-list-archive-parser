CONGRESSMAN CALLS FOR REVIEW OF ONLINE BANKING

House Banking Committee Chairman James Leach (R-Iowa) has
asked the General Accounting Office to review whether the
Federal Reserve has sufficiently protected its Fedwire
funds transfer and security transfer system from electronic
trespassing.

Fedwire processes around 380,000 securities and funds
transfers totaling $1.6 trillion each day.
