This relates to the proposed "Feinstein Amendment" of the 
AEPDA. It covers in detail what kind of speech is permissable 
now and what language for the amendment should be to 
close gaps. A fine distinction is traced between "teaching"
the use of terrorist and mass destruction weapons and 
"advocating" them. Or something like that -- I am a jailhouse
laugher.
