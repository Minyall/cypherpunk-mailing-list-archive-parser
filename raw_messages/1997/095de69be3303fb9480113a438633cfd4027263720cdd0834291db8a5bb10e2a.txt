Somehow, I don't think that's the place to mount an attempt to take it
over.  The prohibitive cost of getting an antenna into space where you can
counter some of the effects of Earth's spin and keep the damn rover in
contact all the time would be the biggest problem.  The trick would be to
get into NASA's flight control computers.  They're almost definitely as
top-secret military systems in terms of access.  (i.e, no outside
connections to unsecure nets, controls almost certainly limited to certain
stations...)

Besides, how much encryption is needed between two points if intercepting
the traffic is expensive, the communications protocol is undocumented (as
far as anyone outside NASA is concerned), and the actual frequency is also
hard to find?
