I believe I read that in Infoworld or ComputerWorld (within the last month,
maybe 2)

The rules that the SEC had for snail mail (for brokers/traders I believe),
in that all mail had to be approved by someone in the company now apply to
e-mail.

I don't save my copies of Infoworld or Computeworld anymore (too much
paper) so I can't look it up easily for you.

Oh, I see where I was a bit unclear in my original statement.  This rule
only applies to the brokerage firms (I think I've got the right terms
there, if not, the general idea should be clear)

What, you don't encrypt your lab book to yourself (and sign it) with your
public key?  Easier than remembering another symmetric key, and allows you
to keep a the recovery key in use.
