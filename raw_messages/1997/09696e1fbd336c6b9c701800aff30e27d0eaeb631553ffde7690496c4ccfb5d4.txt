Along with a far larger number of well-adjusted innocents.  And the 
maladjusted who aren't dead will be in power.

No question about it, the only hope for the human race is wide
dispersal.  Everybody should join the L5 society, if it still exists,
or become a terrorist Luddite, and bomb us back to the stone age.

either the grand crunch or the heat death of the universe to contend
with after that.  Hopeless.
