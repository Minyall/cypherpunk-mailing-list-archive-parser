Yes, Dimitri.  Freedom is also the freedom to act "stupid".  Since
"acting stupid" is a subjective evaluation it implies that one is
allowed to make subjective, individual decisions.   This is as
opposed to having a central authority decide what is and isn't 
stupid -- telling us how to lead more efficient, carefully planned
lives.

Freedom is not necessarily efficient, but it beats the hell out of
whatever comes next.
