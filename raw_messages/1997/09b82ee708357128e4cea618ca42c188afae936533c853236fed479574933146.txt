So if I wanted to do this and use RSA, how could it be shielded from
attack?  I take it switching to DH or MH won't help.   Would Eliptic
Curves have different properties against this attack?

Maybe a random session key in the middle would help?

i.e.:	File[N]=RSA(PublicKey[n],RandomSessionKey[N]+IDEA(SessionKey[N],Data))
