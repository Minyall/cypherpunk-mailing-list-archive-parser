Perhaps in addition to the X-foo structures we have discussed already we
might consider adding,

X-distrib-policy: foo

Where foo might be,

         Public Domain
         All rights reserved, contact author for redistribution
         Distribution for non-commercial uses permitted
         Refer to authors header
         Copyleft
         etc.

or whatever the policy might be for a given remailer. This would
significantly aid folks in their shopping around.
