That's a great response, but I still see little chance that this 
argument will go away on constitutional grounds. Until then, I'm 
reporting on what happens. It's shocking and intellectually 
indefensible, I know, but hey, my money's on reality.;-).

Actually, I'd be more than happy to "draw the line" if I did such 
things for a living - but I don't. In any case, I'd address the topic 
of privacy on its own without referring to hot button issues like 
obscenity. I invite everyone else to decide if the two issues are a 
fair parallel or not.

I now invite Solveig, Julie and everyone else to comment. Me, I'm 
just betting on the horses....
