An associate is trying to find an American who left the country to operate
a high-tech business, possibly illegal, outside the U.S. to evade American
laws. Think hacking/cracking, money laundering, child porn, black market.
This is for a profile in _Details_ magazine.  Any tips? My friend is
discreet and trustworthy and lives in New York City.
