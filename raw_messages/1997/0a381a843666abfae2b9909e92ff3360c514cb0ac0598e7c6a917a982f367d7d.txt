What is it with the "LEFTovers"?  Do they have problems grasping reality?  
Getting work is easier these days than it's ever been in the history of 
mankind.  I've worked steadily for 20 years and in all that time never dealt 
with a personnel department or a job application (the joys of contingent 
employment).  No firing or blackballing could possibly keep me from getting 
well-paid work somewhere.  The only way I could be kept out of work is 
murder.  Not even imprisonment could stop me from writing that privacy book 
I'm always meaning to do.
