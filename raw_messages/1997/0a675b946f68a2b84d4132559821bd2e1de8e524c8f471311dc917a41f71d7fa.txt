Why not establish an offshore insurance company (e.g., in the Caribbean so
the area code doesn't make it appear outside our boarders) which knows you
true ID, but let's you use a pre-agreed upon pseudo-ID.  They could even
have URLs on their pages to services which could help you out obtaining
realistic hardcopy.

Doctors don't much care as long as they are getting paid and all will
accept out-of-state, many even knowingly out-of-the-country, insurers.
They really don't care about the IDs as long as they match something
insurance company says they'll pay.
