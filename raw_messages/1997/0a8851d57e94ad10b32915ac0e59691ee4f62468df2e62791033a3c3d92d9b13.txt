I wish.  It drops the P120 I tested it on like a rock, when executed
from a normal user account in Linux.  This does not crash the PPro or PII
-- my PII just dumps core.

There's been an article on this at CNet, for one, and a lot of discussion
on Bugtraq and comp.sys.intel.  If this is a hoax, a lot of pretty smart
people have been fished in.
