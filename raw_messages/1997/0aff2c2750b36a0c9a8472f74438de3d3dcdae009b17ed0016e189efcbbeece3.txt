Chewing gum per se is not illegal.  I just cannot buy them from any store
in Singapore.  I can chew to my heart's content.  I can go up north to 
Malaysia, buy a whole month's supply of gum (name your flavour) and bring
it back into Singapore.  

So, what is moronically illegal is that I cannot sell that pack of gum.

Regards.
