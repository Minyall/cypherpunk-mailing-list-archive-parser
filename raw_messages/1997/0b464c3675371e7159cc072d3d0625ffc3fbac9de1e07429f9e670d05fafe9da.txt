The German Academic Internet Provider, DFN, decided to block access 
to xs4all because it hosts a radical left-wing ezine called -Radikal 
magazine http://www.xs4all.nl/~radikal/index.html 
which is said to contain content in violation of german law.

They are blocking the whole site though the ezine is only a minor 
portion of the content on their site they are being penalized

The folks at the mag and xs4all are looking for people willing to put 
up mirror sites to thwart the DFN's efforts.

Dr Klaus-Eckart Maass is apparently running point for the 
DFN-fielding calls and dealing with the press- here are a few 
mail to:links and URLs to add to the phone number already provided.

The DFN - science network in Germany has blocked access to the
dutch xs4all.nl server after an order of the Bundeskriminalamt
(BKA), the german FBI.

Users of DFN have confirmed that today. If somebody wants to follow
up on it, the public relation office of DFN can be reached at (49)
030 - 884-29942 (Miss Quandel).
