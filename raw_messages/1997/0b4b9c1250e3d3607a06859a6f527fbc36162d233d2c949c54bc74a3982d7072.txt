After much playing with majordomo I have decided to create a UK 
cryptography list, I intend the list to focus on UK cryptography
research, law, activism, announcements of conferences/meetings etc...

The list is being hosted on fatmans.demon.co.uk, which is served by a 
dial up connection, so message latency will be around 12 hours on 
average, but I do not see this as a problem as I imagine list traffic
will not be very high.

Of course, the list will be open for anyone to subscribe whether in the 
UK or not, and it will be totally unmoderated (with the exception of 
majordomos command filter which sends posts containing the string 
"subscribe" to the list owner instead of the list).

To subscribe to the list send email to majordomo@fatmans.demon.co.uk with 
the string "subscribe crypto" in the message body.
