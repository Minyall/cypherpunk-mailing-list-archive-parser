Re...

In the coming weekend, I'll be updating the newuser FAQ
(for things like PPP and 2.2). I'm sure a post-install checklist would be
a welcome addition.

B U T . . . .

Not everyone runs things like Kerberos or DNS. Keep in mind that many
people use OpenBSD for many things and in many environs. The OpenBSD setup
on my firewall at the office is much different than the Sparc, Alpha, and
P5/133 I run it on at home. The setup on my router machine at home is also
much different than the other machines in my house. There are ways people
have setup OpenBSD on embeded systems to do things like manage the
fuel/air mix ratio on their Corvettes (OK, one person I know of planned
that, but couldn't get the financing for the car...) I hope that draws the
picture.

As for the verification after install, that is sort of "auto-manditory"--
if a filesystem isn't mounted right, /etc/fstab has to be checked out. If
the network doesn't work, the network files must be examined to "make it
go." As oopposed to attacking this as a checklist, how about it is
attacked as "If networking doesn't work, check hostname.(interface)"-- but
there is more to that then just files in /etc (boot -c in order to
reconfigure hardware addresses)
