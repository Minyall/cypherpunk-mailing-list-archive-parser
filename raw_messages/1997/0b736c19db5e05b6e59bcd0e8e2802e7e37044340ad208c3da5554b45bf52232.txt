We offer Peter Junger pleadings against the Secretary of State
and the government's responses:

   "This action is brought by a law professor under the First 
   Amendment challenging United States export laws that he claims 
   infringe upon his rights to speak and publish encryption software 
   and other encryption information."

Several prominent cryptographers and NSA officials have provided 
declarations in connection with the suit.
