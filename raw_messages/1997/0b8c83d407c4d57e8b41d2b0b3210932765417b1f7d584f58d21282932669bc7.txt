** INNOVATIONS: SPYING SAUCER **

Sikorsky Aircraft in Stratford, Conn., has designed and built a small,
round rotary-wing pilotless aircraft that can locate and follow objects,
flying down urban streets or peeping into windows.  The Cypher is
propelled by two rigid motors, one above the other, that revolve in
opposite directions.  The outside shell of the aircraft is rounded, like
a donut, giving the machine some protection when it bumps into tree
branches, or the sides of buildings. It can stay aloft for about two and
a half hours, using advanced software made by Lockheed Martin and
Northrup Grumman to find and trail enemy soldiers, or scout out an urban
setting for potential sharpshooters.  A video camera mounted on the
aircraft can peer through windows when engineers on the ground signal the
Cypher to land on a nearby rooftop.  "The beauty of Cypher," says the
aircraft's project leader, "is that it can fly low and slow."
