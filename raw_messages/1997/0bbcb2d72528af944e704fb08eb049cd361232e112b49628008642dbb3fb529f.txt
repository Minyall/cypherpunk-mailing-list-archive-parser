*** N.Y. judge rules for Planned Parenthood in web site case

A federal judge has temporarily stopped an abortion foe from
identifying his web site as belonging to Planned Parenthood and
selling an anti-abortion book from that home page. The temporary
restraining order, issued Wednesday, stops Richard Bucci from
identifying his home page as "Planned Parenthood's Home Page" and
using "plannedparenthood.com" as a domain name. Planned Parenthood,
which has its own web site, sued Bucci for trademark infringement. The
next hearing is slated for Feb. 20. For the full text story, see
