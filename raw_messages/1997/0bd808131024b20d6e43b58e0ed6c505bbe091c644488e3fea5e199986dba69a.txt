I think you're overreacting here (or I am misreading the above '>>').
If the sentence is life, with a chance for parole after 15 years, or if
the sentence is death, that is what all those who practice civil
disobedience should face -- what the actual sentence is.  Applying
pepper spray directly to eyes of _non-violent_ demonstrators is "cruel
and unusual punishment", not just normal arrest procedures.  (Violent
demonstrators must deal with the consequences of their actions,
including death.)
