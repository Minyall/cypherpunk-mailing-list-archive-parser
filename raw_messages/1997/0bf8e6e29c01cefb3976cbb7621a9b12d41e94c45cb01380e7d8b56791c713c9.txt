Show me the money! A DES break that resulted in a loss of several tens of
millions of dollars, suitably publicized, would be both educational and
rewarding.

We often talk about the "threat model." But what's the _profit model_ for
breaking DES?

Can money be made by breaking a SWIFT transfer in approx. 35 hours?

(Personally, I doubt it. Between increasing use of 3DES and "time windows"
which are probably much shorter than tens of hours, I doubt a Wiener
machine would be of much use to a hacker.)

Of course, the payoffs could be huge. If the banking system is really
vulnerable to this sort of attack, then why has some private group not
financed the building of a Wiener machine? (I know many people who could
pay for such a machine out of "spare cash," if the profits/risks were
there; I'm not saying *I* would, of course, only that the amounts are not
so high. The cheapest of the listed machines above is comparable in price
to a Jaguar XK8.)

Is anyone publishing on this? Are the details of the SWIFT and similar
interbank transfer systems available anywhere?

(What kind of out-of-band checksums may exist? What kind of callback
systems? What window of opportunity exists if a single DES key is found? Is
it useful?)

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
