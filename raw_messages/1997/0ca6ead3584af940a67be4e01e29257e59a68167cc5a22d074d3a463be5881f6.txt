Several months back there were discussions on the list regarding renaming
the government's key escrow/recovery proposals (KRAP comes to mind).  I
think we need something that's catchy and simple (perhaps already familiar)
to understand for the semi-litterate citizen units.  I propose we encourage
use of the terms "crippleware" or "crypto crippleware" when refering to the
products limited to their weak crypto and/or key escrow/recovery.
