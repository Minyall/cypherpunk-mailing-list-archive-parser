Catching counterfeit credit cards

Researchers find way to check magnetic 'fingerprints'

ST. LOUIS, Missouri (CNN) -- Researchers at Washington University here have 
come up with a way to spot counterfeit credit cards by detecting the unique 
"fingerprint" on the back of each card. 

<snip>

Their solution, called the Magneprint system, reads the millions of tiny 
magnetic particles, which are unique on each card, says Professor Ronald 
Indeck. 
Each magnetic stripe on the card has two important areas. The first looks 
like a bar code, which contains the account number. The rest is a random 
pattern of magnetic information -- a signature that is different on every 
card and impossible to duplicate, Indeck says.

The inventors say the Magneprint system can be used to stop other kinds of 
fraud, involving airline tickets, currency, and checks.
It's expected to be made available to card companies later this year.
