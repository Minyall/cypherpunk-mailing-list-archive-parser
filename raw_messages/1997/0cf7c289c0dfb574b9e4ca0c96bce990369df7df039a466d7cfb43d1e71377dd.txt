Congratulations on your decision to moderate this list.

My bottom line feeling with respect to this is that we cannot
expect freedom unless we are willing to exercise responsibility.
It is apparent that the people who are noisiest about freedom of
speech and content censoring are working tirelessly to abuse
the list and provoke the very opposite of their stated ideals.

As for the spammers who have run riot in recent months,
moderation will remove the burden of re-transmitting this unwanted
garbage from the list server and save us all the time and effort
currently wasted dealing with it.
