You are not thinking this through. Under this scheme, every welfare mother 
would march her girls down to the clinic and get them Norplanted as soon as 
she could. Those girls would not be able to further add to the welfare rolls
until they reach legal age, and could have the contraceptive removed 
without their mother's permission.

By then they'd have developed a habit of contraception, which would 
likely continue.
