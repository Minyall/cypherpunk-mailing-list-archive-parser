It would be neat if you could quote people and prove that they signed
the particular paragraph quoted without supplying the entire text.  Is
there a way to do this?  (It seems impossible, but so does mental
poker.)

A crude approach would be to sign every paragraph or line separately,
but that's obviously inelegant.
