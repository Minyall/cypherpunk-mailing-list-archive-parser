"The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) is reviewing the 
foreign policy-based export controls in the Export Administration 
Regulations to determine whether they should be modified, 
rescinded or extended. To help make these determinations, 
BXA is seeking comments on how existing foreign policy-based 
export controls have affected exporters and the general public."
