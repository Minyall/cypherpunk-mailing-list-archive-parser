They did what all huns do - they ruthlessly eradicated those who were
dissidents, and now they're gonna bring their collective boots down
on the necks of whoever is left.

Does this mean the little moustache is coming back into fashion?
I hope not.  It's bad enough having Reno, Gore, and the rest of

Go search out a list called net.scum (or something similar) and see
who's there, and why.
