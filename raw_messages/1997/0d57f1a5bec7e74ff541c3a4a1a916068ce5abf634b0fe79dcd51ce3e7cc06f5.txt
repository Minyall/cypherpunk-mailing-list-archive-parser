How is the buyer responsible even indirectly?

Someone puts an add in the paper NEC Laptop $1,500. I go and check it out
and buy it. Should it be my respocibility to call NEC over in Japan and
find out if it was reported stolen (if they even keep such records).
Should I have to call the manufacture every time I buy a some used
equipment? Perhaps I should have a background check done before I buy
anything.

If anyone is responcible for the theft other than the theif is the person
who was so carless with their equipment.
