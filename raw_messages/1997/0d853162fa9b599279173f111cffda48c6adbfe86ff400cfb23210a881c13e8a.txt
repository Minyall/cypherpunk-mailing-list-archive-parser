-------

Cypherpunks reject politics.  They know that it is unnecessary,
counter-productive, and wrong.

Terrorism and violent confrontation are the ultimate form of
politics.

-------

Cypherpunks don't fixate on their enemies, real or imagined.
Reactionary Christians do.  Reactionary Muslims do.  Wacko
leftists do.  Wacko rightists do.  In fact, probably every
penny-ante cult and fringe political movement does.  Perhaps
it makes it easier to avoid doubt by thinking and feeling
about your enemies (real or imagined) in order to keep from
thinking about your self.

But cypherpunks don't fixate on their enemies.  They have more
important things to worry about.

-------

Cypherpunks think strategically.  Cypherpunks act strategically.
