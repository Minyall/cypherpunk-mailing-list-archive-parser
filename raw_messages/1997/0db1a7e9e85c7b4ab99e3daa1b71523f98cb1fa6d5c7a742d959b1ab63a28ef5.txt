With November drawing to a close, WE will be winding down OUR use of
the phrase, "ad hominem."
The Official CypherPunk Phrase of the Month, for December, will be:
  "Ad gaolas deliberandas"

Any disputes over the proper meaning and use of this phrase will be
settled by Jim Bell's judge (once he comes out of hiding).
