Never mind. Sorry.

It looks like http://www.pgpi.com/ is still open for business, so paranoia
is unwarranted.

Though I wonder for how long Network Associates will continue to publish
source code books and encourage their wide distribution around the world?

Or how long source code will be available at all.

Or how long the freeware version will be available.
