I had an interesting conversation a few weeks ago with a friend who has
a closed-form solution to a well-known problem that's been unsolved for
about that long.  He has no intention of publishing it, but he has already
made quite a bit of $$$ on it. :-)

I've known the guy for a number of years and it's not the first time he gets
a good result and makes money on it instead of yet another paper in a 
refereed journal.  In general, lots more is known to some people than is
published. E.g. it's possible that some of stuff I did for my Ph.D. thesis
was done by the British crypto people but never made it to the open literatre.

Let me get this straight - Schneier claims that factoring is secure now and
will remain secure in the future?
