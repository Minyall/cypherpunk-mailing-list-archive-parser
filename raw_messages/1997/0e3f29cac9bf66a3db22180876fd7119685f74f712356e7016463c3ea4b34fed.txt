Hi,

The ISDN just came back online...now if only the POTS will return...

Anyway, SWBT Level 2 and their protocol analysis seems to have done the
trick this time. As soon as I get my POTS back I'll lack the ISDN folks and
find out what the problem was.

Be advised that SWBT may still have their analyzer online which means they
are doing a full capture of all the Internet related traffic.
