  Maybe it's time to set up an "InterNet Free Europe" type of program.
Crypto and remailers seem to be well-suited to the task of implementing
the dissemination of information and protecting identities of the many
individuals who would be involved.
  CyberHackers could compromise a few systems, to turn them into 
innocent remailers, and this would open the door for the administrators
of other systems to 'fake' system attacks, and do some remailing 
themselves.
  CryptoRebels could disseminate encryption programs containing the
public keys that would be used for the InterNet broadcasts in certain
cases.

  One of the keys to "InterNet Free World" (a better name?) would be
to make a habit of disseminating a plethora of 'false' encrypted 
messages with little or no meaning, and no available key, as a cover 
for the messages that are actually targeted for certain users or
systems.
