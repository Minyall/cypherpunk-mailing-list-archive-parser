This is the first I've heard of a Blowfish based produce being approved for
export.  Since Blowfish has about 9 bits worth of protection against brute
force searches in its key schedule, this is about a 41 bit approval.  Does
anyone know of an export permit for a version of Blowfish with a key longer
than 32 bits?
