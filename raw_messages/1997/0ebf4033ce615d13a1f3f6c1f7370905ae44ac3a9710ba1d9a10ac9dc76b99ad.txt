 Loose-cannon Diana became dead Saint Diana ala J.F.K.
 "What a wonderful person she is, now that she's gone."

 Why do the nefarious, omniprescent 'they' (TM) always announce the
death by heart attack so many hours after rushing the target to the
hospital? Does it have to do with airline schedules?

 Any reports of a second driver on the grassy knoll?
 Any guesses as to when the crash surviver bites it?
