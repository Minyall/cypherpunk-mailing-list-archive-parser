Sigh.  Terror isn't our business, and any handbook that
can't tell ammonium tri-iodide from nitrogen tri-iodide
is more dangerous to its readers than anyone else.

If you _really_ wanted to scare governments,
you'd start publishing papers saying things like

	AMENDMENT 1 - Congress shall make no law ......

or
	n = p*q , p and q prime.
	c = m ** e mod n
