 Q. How did Sir Alexander Fleming change Spain's
bullfighting?
 A. Before he invented penicillin, countless toreros died
of infected wounds. After, even the smallest arenas were
equipped with penicillin syringes. And the performances
became much more exhilarating. Said one cape artist: "Now
I can stand closer to the bull."
