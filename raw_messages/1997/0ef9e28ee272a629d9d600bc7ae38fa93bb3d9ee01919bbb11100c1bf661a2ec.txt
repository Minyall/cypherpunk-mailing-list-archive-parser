* An ad, from an Atlanta Journal story in May on the increasing
number of Internet Web pages devoted to classified ads from
prison inmates seeking romantic relationships:  "Aren't you fed
up with meeting all the wrong men?" [asked California inmate
Ronald E. Mays, who also asked] "[Are you] In search of a truly
honest and good man . . . ?"  (Mays is serving life without parole
for first-degree murder, second-degree murder, sodomy with
force, and kidnapping.)
