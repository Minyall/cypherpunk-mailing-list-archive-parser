Are you looking for access to the MISTY source code? It's still illegal to
export it pending an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Even if that appeal
fails, Congress will likely pass amended laws and/or the NSA/Commerce Dept
will issue revised regulations on the same day that an unfavourable decision
is announced.

Those guys just never learn that not only is the barn door open, but that
contents were never theirs to begin with.
