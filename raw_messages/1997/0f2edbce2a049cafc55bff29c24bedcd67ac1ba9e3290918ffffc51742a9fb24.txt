Which list would that be?

There is the list I run dealing with Perl. (Incredibly technical and high
volume.)

There is the local Portland version of the Cypherpunks list.  (mostly dead.)

There is the list for disgruntled ex-employees of a company I used top work
for.  (Completely dead.)

There is the list for the board of directors and co-conspiritors of a not
for profit corporation.  (Maybe should be dead.)

Or maybe you meant THIS list...

Find a book on mailing lists and look up information of "subscribing".  (It
is next to the information on "circumcision".)

Oh... So you are on a short fuse...
