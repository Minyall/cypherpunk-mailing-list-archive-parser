I've recently had a surge of remailing attempts made through the remailer
which I used to have running. It is no longer running. If I do reset it,
I'll notify the cypherpunk list.. the address(es) were:

rperkins@nyx.cs.du.edu
rperkins@nyx10.cs.du.edu
or:
rperkins@nox.cs.du.edu
rperkins@nyx.net .. whatever, they all went to the same place..

These accounts are all _forwarded_ to my account: rperkins@uvic.ca, and are
not forwarded.. 

Please remove my the addresses from any list of remailers you may mantain. I
will alert you if the remailer goes back up.

For those of you who don't maintain remailer listings, please make note of
these addresses: they are _not_ remailers.

Thank you.
