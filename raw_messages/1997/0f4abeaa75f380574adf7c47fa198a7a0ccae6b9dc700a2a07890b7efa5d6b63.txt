The latter.  The originator provides all postage for one way
remailers.

Nym reply block postage needs other mechanisms as described in a
previous post.

Making the hashcash message dependent is interesting in that it
removes the need for a double spending database, because apart from a
DoS attack it is not interesting to the spammer to send you multiple
copies of the same mail, and in previous discussions someone suggested
it for this reason.

However, generally I have been assuming that it's easier to have a
double spend database, and to make the hashcash depend only on the
resource name for the kinds of problems you raise, and because it is
cheaper to verify hashcash on shorter strings.  By resource name I
mean whatever it is that is being used.  For an email address it is
the email address, for a remailer it is the remailers address.  Could
be generalised for other purposes, for example free use of web based
resources or even telnet based TCP/IP protocols in general.
