Indeed, and in a wonderful case of schadenfreude, when the
Dworkin-MacKinnon anti-porn law was enacted in Canada, "Lesbitan Erotica"
bookstores and publishers were shut down. (I believe this was in Toronto,
and it may have only been in that city or region that the law was enacted,
not in all of Canada. Toto can clarify.)

Predictably, the feministas squealed like stuck pigs (or is it pigesses?).
They claimed that the law was intended to block "male uses" of certain
images, not uses by womyn and other exploited peoples.

Be careful what you wish for, double-edged swords, and all that.

When will they learn that the simple cure to such double-edge swords is not
passing  authoritarian laws in the first place?
