I have to say I agree, I believe that violence is probably the only way 
to proceed in order to defend ourselves against the criminals within 
modern societies, however, I seperate this entirely from the action of 
killing indiscriminately.

I have to say also that I believe that if one were to drop a fairly large 
bomb on a major US city, say LA or NYC, the probable outcome would be 
that 99% of the people killed would be corrupt scum anyway, in DC I would 
imagine the figure would be approching 100%, however, this does not 
absolve one from blame if, through some freak outcome, a small bomb of, 
say, the Timothy McVeigh style happens to kill an innocent person, one is 
still guilty of murder. Part of the reason I despise government so 
greatly is because the poloticians justify their actions by reference to 
"the greater good", ie. "If a few thousand innocent conscripted members of 
the army get killed defending our society so be it."

In the end, it also comes down to what action you believe is justifiable 
in the name of freedom, ie. When I say I believe 99% of people in sat NYC 
are corrupt scum this is true, but to varying degrees, I would personally 
say, as an estimate, only 3 to 5% of these people should be executed 
for their crimes, the others are either corrupt morally on a small level, 
or are just naive, eg. I believe people who vote in democratic elections 
commit a crime against me by being part of the process which brings about 
authoritarian government, even if they vote for a party that proposed to 
rule according to libertarian values they still perpetuate a system where 
the majority control the actions of the minority, however, I would not kill 
these people, I believe they are simply ill educated and unable to comprehend 
the wrong they do me.

The bottom line is, I disagree with what Tim said but I do sympathise 
with the reasons why he said it.
