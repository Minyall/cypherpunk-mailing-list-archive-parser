I hope you really don't think that any call made to an LEA is "anonymous".
If in doubt try calling one of these "anonymous" lines and make several
crank calls and see how long before they are kicking in your door.

The LEA's do not beleive in anonymity only in having the sheeple beleive
in the false apperance of anonymity. Very simmilar how Clipper, GAK, and
weak crypto give the sheeple a false sence of security.
