Not true - you can't implement CMR without a mail enforcer unless
you can stop your employees from using non-CMR versions of PGP,
which is nearly impossible.  Even with an enforcer, of course,
you can't stop the determined employee from double-encrypting and
steganizing and otherwise getting their outbound bits past your enforcer
looking like the baseball game narrative from Wayner's Mimic Functions
or Pointy-Haired-Boss randomness, but they could also carry a floppy disk 
out the door or beam infrared out the window from their Newton.

Similarly, on incoming mail, you can't stop people from sending your
employees non-CMRed mail without an inbound-mail enforcer and
can't stop your employees from reading it with their own warez.

More importantly, though, PGP isn't a mail program, it's an encryptor,
and if you're trying to stop people from sending encrypted mail
back and forth, you've got to control the mail system as well as the
encryptors, and you probably already _do_ control the mail system.

				Thanks!
