Week:

> Novell Inc. 
> RSA Data Security Inc. 
> SafeNet Trusted Services Corp. 
> Silicon Graphics Inc. 
> Sun Microsystems Inc. 
> Trusted Information Systems Inc. 

Some of these players I would expect to sit at the key recovery table,
but why SUN?  Any of you California dudes know what's up with that?

Am I right in assuming that the International Elvis marketing deal will
