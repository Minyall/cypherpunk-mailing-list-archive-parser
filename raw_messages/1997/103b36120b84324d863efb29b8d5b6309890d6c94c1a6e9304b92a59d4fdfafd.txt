CMU does lots of real world crypto stuff, mostly centering around
Kerberos. There's some good theory here, too. In addition, NetBill
(book-entry bastards) does some crypto. If you were interested in
working one of those projects, you could easily do so as an undergrad.
There's also one "number theory" class which is basically crypto 101.
As for grad work, if you're interested in number theory and such, you
could do well here. Otherwise, you might consider somewhere else.

Allumnusly yours,
Jer

BTW, the administration here is a bunch of bloody facists.
