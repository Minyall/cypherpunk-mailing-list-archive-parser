Has anybody got anything good against this ?  I can get about
1/32 of the state with a simple form of differential cryptanalysis,
but can't see how to progress it beyond that.

My attack takes a long chunk of known text and looks for repetition.

ppppppppppppppp.11.pppppppppppppppppppppp
ccccccccccccccc.22.cccccccccccccccccccccc

When a two neighbouring p-c pairs are the same you can test
whether they have the same value of a and b.
(That is a_n == a_n+1 and b_n == b+n+1,   a != b usually.)

This involves 16 inputs to each byte - very cheap.
What I really want next is to know "a".

Because c is always known (it's only a counter) if you always knew
"a" you'd have a handle on "b" because only 2 (predictable) elements of
the state array change with each byte encrypted.
