Check out the latest (June 9th, 1997) Wall Street Journal.  On page B1
there is an article on the wave of money laundering convictions for
non-drug related crimes.  In fact, the article points out that just about
any monetary transaction can be declared money laundering.  (And get
upheld in court!)

And the reasons behind this?  Long terms and lots of ready cash for the
feds.
