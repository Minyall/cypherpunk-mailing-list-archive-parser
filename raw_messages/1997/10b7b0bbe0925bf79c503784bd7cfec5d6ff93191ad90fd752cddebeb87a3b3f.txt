Don't feel bad about not hearing about it....I only heard about it from
some friends this past summer. My first reaction was "say what?"

After looking at a summary of news reports, I was less than
enthusiastically interested any more.

(My hunch: eddy current effects)

An effect this important, requiring so little equipment, is confirmable in
a matter of days or weeks. That this report has been floating around--pun
intended--for more than several years, tells us somthing important.

Wake me up if it's actually confirmed. But don't wake me up just to tell me
the claims have been withdrawn.
