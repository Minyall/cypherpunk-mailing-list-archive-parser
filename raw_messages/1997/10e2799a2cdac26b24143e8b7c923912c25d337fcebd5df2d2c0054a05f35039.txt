While I suspect that new key recovery or CMR products may create some new
traction for supporters of mandatory GAK, PGP 5.5 is not the first example
of such a product (TIS has been marketing key recovery products for a
while).

More importantly though, the Blaze et al study
(http://www.crypto.com/key_study) did not say that key recovery/key escrow
systems can't be built.  It said that such systems designed to meet law
enforcement specifications (24/7 real time access, the infrastructure for
key exchanges, and security considerations necessary for such a system to
function) are beyond the scope of the field and would create significant
vulnerabilities in the network.

This is an important distinction.

So far, Soloman, the FBI, nor other mandatory GAK supporters have said that
PGP 5.5 or other key recovery products on the market today solve their
so-called 'problems'.  I don't really expect them to. They seem to want
much much more.
