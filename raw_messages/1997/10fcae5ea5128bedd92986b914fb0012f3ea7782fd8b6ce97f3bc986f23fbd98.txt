I've mostly just used postgres, a db, for doing database stuff, and kludged
together a disgusting collection of kernel patches and usermode processes to
make data appear as a directory structure in a modified version of the
ext2fs (actually, most if it is in the VFS level as it should be, but I didn't
know enough about it when I started to cleanly separate the two.  Oh well).

It's not distributed, it's not reliable, it's not secure.  It's just me 
learning
how to play with virtual file systems.  And unfortunately most of the code 
is stolen from commercial/proprietary software, so I can't really release it.

My current Eternity DDS plan is to have a linux file system and an http
interface to the data store up in the first incarnation.  I'm at the stage
of playing with technology for the interface layer, and having a vaguely
workable plan for inter-server communication.  Once I have something which
can be demonstrated, I'll post an announcement to the technical people who
would be interested.

I've entered the Eternity DDS idea into a MIT-sponsored new business
competition, etc.

My current Eternity homepage is at http://sof.mit.edu/eternity/, although
it's rather sparse.
