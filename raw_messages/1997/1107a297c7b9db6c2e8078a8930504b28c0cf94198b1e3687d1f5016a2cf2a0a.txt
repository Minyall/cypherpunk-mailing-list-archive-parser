Be afraid, be very afraid.

I didn't think one could debit a bank account without signed documentation
by the holder of the account giving permision to do so. Personaly I would
never give somone such authorization to do so.

If they are capable of getting access to funds in an account just by a phone
conversation this is truly a sad state of affairs for the banking community.

Could somone here with more banking background clarify this?

Thanks,
