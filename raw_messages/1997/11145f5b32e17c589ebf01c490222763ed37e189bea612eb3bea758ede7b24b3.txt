Thanks for the reference.

Actualy it was used for telegraphy and flags. You see Mahan, the inventor of
the disk had also just invented the first ever alphabetic flag system.
Because of this system, instead of the wig-wag system others used, McClellan
was the first general in history to change his orders of attack 3 times in 3
days *and* win the battle. The problem on the Peninsula was the land was too
flat and the woods too thick to use it (see my original references around the
same few pages).

Friedman? Who the hell is Friedman? None of my references has anyone by that
named listed, let alone involved.

McClellan was the general in charge of the Army of the Potomac. Meyer was in
charge of the Signal Corp, which at the time was responsible for tactical
communications for McClellan. Originaly Meyer intended to use his new flag
system but because the terrain, flat and wooded, on the Peninsula they found
they weren't reliable. They were also using the balloons from the Union
Aeronautic Department under Lowe. They were quite effective, haven't found
out if they used Meyer's signal system. The flip side was the fully civilian
Military Telegraph under Stager which handled strategic telegraphy was
fighting Meyer for control of the various communications along technological
boundaries. At this time, while they were fighting the South and each other,
they brought in some Beardslee equipment (a rail-based portable telegraph
system) which apparently didn't work well at all. The Beardslee system was
the first use by an American army of portable telegraph equipment, it ran
between McClellan's headquarters to Stoneman's at Mechanicsville. Apparently
one of the chief problems was that wagons and people kept cutting the lines. 

Merry Christmas!
