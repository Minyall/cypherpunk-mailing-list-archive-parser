Hello,

Greetings! DataET Research, Data Engineering Technologies, has recently
initiated the distribution of VSACM, VSA2048 Cryptography Module. VSACM
implements a relatively new, but extensively advanced and sophisticated,
encryption algorithm named VSA2048. If you are not interested in
incorporating the power of advanced encryption into the software that you
develop, you may want to visit http://members.aol.com/dataetrsch/ if you are
searching for a help file / system development, installation program
development, or shareware distribution and marketing service. Otherwise,
please continue on.

VSACM (the VSA2048 algorithm)...

o Is a royalty-free Windows DLL module featuring advanced cryptography.
o Is a cost-effective size of only 50 kilobytes.
o Contains more than 120 procedures and functions.
o Implements the VSA2048 encryption algorithm.
o Allows encryption keys as large as 2048 bits.
o Is extensively key and data dependent.
o Includes 18 algorithm extensions.
o Processes all forms of binary and ASCII files.
o Allows multiple encryption layer levels.
o Has absolutely no back-doors or magical keys.
o Includes time and date locking features. 
o Includes file specific unique encryption features.
o Includes data importance and sensitivity stamping features.

VSACM, being a Windows DLL module, can be accessed through programs developed
with popular application and database programming languages and environments
such as: C, C++, Visual Basic, Delphi, Turbo Pascal, PowerBuilder, Smalltalk,
dBase, Paradox, Access, FoxPro, Oracle, Sybase, SQL, and numerous others.

DataET Research has released a shareware trial edition version of VSACM named
VSACM V2.0.

To download VSACM V2.0 for free, please go to:

I hope you will consider applying VSACM in the software you develop.
Thank-you very much for your time.

Sincerely,

Jeremy K. Yu-Ramos
