I'd appreciate some EMAIL comments on what anonymous remailers are used for, 
in particular the remailer at anon.efga.org.

The "Georgia Cracker" remailer, like any remailer, has had several people 
complain about it's existence.  While I've received various emails telling me 
the remailer is a bad thing, including veiled legal threats, I've yet to see 
even one note that tells why it is a good thing.  I'd appreciate some 
comments on why the system should be maintained.

There are two main reasons for this.  First, I need to explain to others at 
EFGA why this remailer is being maintained.  Secondly, I need to write an 
affidavit explaining why the remailer should not be shut down.  I'd really 
appreciate anyone who has used anon.efga.org EMAILing me with what purpose it 
serves.  Anonymous comments are of course very welcome.

Thanks,
