When I was in high school, about 30 years ago, much was made of a alleged
public opinion survey in which Americans on the street were asked what they
thought of a document they were shown.

According to the story, a majority thought the document was some kind of
leftist, communist, illegal propaganda.

Obviously you all know what document they were shown.
