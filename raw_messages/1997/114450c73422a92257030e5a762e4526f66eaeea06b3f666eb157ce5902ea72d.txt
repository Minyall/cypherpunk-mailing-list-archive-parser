Ok, I believe that falls under the 'bitching' category.

And your point is? My personal opinions have nothing to do with my
professional career and yours shouldn't either. I would love to have a
company bring up my past posts, makes it easy to decide if I want to work
there or not.

If you want to work for such a company and you know their views and your
views are in conflict then I would say you need a shrink not an anon.
remailer.
