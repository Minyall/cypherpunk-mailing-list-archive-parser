Alan Olsen forwarded an article from USA Toady (sorry, Freudian
spelling slip) on airline bag matching, including this interesting
statement:

>Airlines are expected to match bags with about 5% of fliers. A
>computerized profiling system will identify those who might pose a
>security risk. Example: passengers
>who buy tickets with cash.

>If someone matches the profile, their bags would not be stowed until
>they actually board the plane.

Hmm, since the last bag on the plane is usually the first one
off the baggage carousel, there is an opportunity for better
service that ought to be exploited. Now, all I need is the cash.
