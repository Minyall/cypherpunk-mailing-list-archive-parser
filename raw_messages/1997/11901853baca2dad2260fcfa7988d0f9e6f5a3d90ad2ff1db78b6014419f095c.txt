Summit leaders to combat cyber-terrorism

World leaders will agree to take measures against a 
new high-tech element of terrorism--attacks on host 
computers--at the June 20-22 Denver summit, officials 
involved in the preparations said Friday. 

As part of countermeasures against cyber-terrorism, 
further joint efforts to control the spread of computer 
encryption technologies will be reaffirmed, they said. 

Concerns over terrorist attacks on computers and the 
need for heightened international efforts will be added 
to the 25 specific counterterrorism recommendations that 
Japan, the United States, Britain, Germany, Canada, 
Italy, France and Russia adopted at a ministerial meeting 
in Paris last July.
