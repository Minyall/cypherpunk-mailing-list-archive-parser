I came up with yet another brilliant idea.

Stanford Wallace's Cyberpromo site has been hacked by some criminals, but
it's coming back.  In particular, he's giving away free autoresponders again.

(An autoresponder is an address@cyberpromo.com to which you can send an
e-mail and get back a pre-recorded response, if your site accepts e-mail
from cyberpromo.  Supposedly anyone can set one of them up for free
and provide their own automatic response. Stanford is running a promotion.)

Now, suppose some non-US person sets up an auto-responder that sends out
strong crypto software, and another non-US person requests it and gets it.

Is anyone going to be guilty of ITAR violations?
