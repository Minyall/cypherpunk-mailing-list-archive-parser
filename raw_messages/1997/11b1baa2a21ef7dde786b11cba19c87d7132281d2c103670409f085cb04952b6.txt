WASHINGTON -- For decades the FBI's reputation as a crime-fighting
agency has rested heavily on its high-tech forensic laboratory, which
could solve baffling crimes from a speck of blood, a sliver of paint
or the thinnest filament of human hair.

            But an investigation by the Justice Department's inspector
general has put the FBI laboratory, and the way the agency has
used it, under the glare of public scrutiny. The findings, which were
turned over to FBI officials last week, are threatening to shatter the
image of an agency on the cutting edge of scientific sleuthing.
