But it's ok for Barnes&Noble and Borders to decide what the categories
are?  And the Motion Picture Association of America? I'd suggest you 
must accept that parents will use whatever tools are available to
help them exercise their "moral duty", and if that means they choose
to let Bill Gates decide what the categories are, so what?

Whose values, the churchmembers' or the bookstores'?  Either way, 
"don't mind" is different from "want to".

There has never been a voluntary tax, that worked. "Tax" and "volunteer"
are mutually exclusive terms.

Now you're on to something. What better way to check your church's
values.

They have, with regard to books, a long time ago. Admittedly, that
list didn't have anything to do with money, however.
