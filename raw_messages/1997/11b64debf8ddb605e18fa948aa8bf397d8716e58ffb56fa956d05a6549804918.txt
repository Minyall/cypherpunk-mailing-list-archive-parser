         FAMILY VALUES ISP ANNOUNCES CHANGE OF REMAILERS!
         ------------------------------------------------

We at Family Values ISP would like to apologize for the activities of
the 'Bad Remailer' operators, who have allowed their system, and ours,
to be abused by foul-mouthed swine and minors seeking information on
venereal diseases.
We initially had our doubts about the operators of the 'Bad Remailer',
based on their name alone, but we gave them the benefit of the doubt,
as good Christians are wont to do. (Have you seen the word 'wont' in
any other posts today?)

Although we are sad that our confidence was betrayed by the operators
of the 'Bad Remailer', we are pleased to announce that we have replaced
their services with those of the 'TruthMailer'.
We are confident that this change will be a positive one which will
result in better service to our customers, with less potential of
abuse by the remailer users.
