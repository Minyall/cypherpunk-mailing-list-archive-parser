======  100% of WHAT?  Systems with it installed which are stolen?   How
would you know what systems do NOT call in?  
It's like the question the clerk asks at the airport: "Did anyone put
anything in your luggage you don't know anything about?"

Now that the word is out, of course, the wily thief will eschew pluggin in
until the hard drive is reformatted and installed
with a clean OS.  As usual: the stupid will be caught.
