It occurs to me that this entire question is really of much larger social
import:

 -  do babysitters in your home have an inherent right to not be monitored
    in case they harm the child?

 -  do operators of vehicles on public roads have an inherent right to
    privacy about the vehicle?

 -  do businesses have the right to monitor the uses that their systems
    are put to?

 -  do public officials have an inherent right to privacy about their
    actions related to their office?

etc. ad nausium...

These various issues can be broken down into two simple questions that
once answered genericaly can be applied to the specific cases.

The bottem line is:

Does the owner of a resource have an inherent right to control that
resource and if so what are the boundaries?

Does the user of a resource have rights outside the purvue of the owner
of that resource and if so what are the boundaries?
