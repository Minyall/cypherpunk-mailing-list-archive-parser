I do not keep up with the various DES challenge efforts: Did DESChall 
ever give a reason for not releasing source code?
Has anyone tried reverse engineering the executable? 

Does anyone have statistics on how quick deschall is as opposed to, for 
example, Bryddes? If they haven`t released source code and it is 
significantly faster it may be they have further key schedule 
optimisations they do not wish to share.
