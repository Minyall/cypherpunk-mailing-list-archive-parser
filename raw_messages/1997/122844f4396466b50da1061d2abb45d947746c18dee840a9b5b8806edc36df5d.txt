Wrong, the LOC is for the people. It is there (originaly) to provide a
reference listing of all documents published and therefore claiming copyright.
Currently it is open to any legitimate research project. I have used it on a
couple of projects in the past to research writings no longer in print.

New York does not equate to 'all the states'. A more than trivial point in
your position. Bottem line, both Texas and Louisiana have public libraries
that predate eithers entry into the Union.

Go piss in that pot you lying commie sack of shit.
