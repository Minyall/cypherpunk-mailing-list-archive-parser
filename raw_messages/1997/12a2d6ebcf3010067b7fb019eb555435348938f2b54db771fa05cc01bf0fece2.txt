Practically speaking, using the cable TV infrastructure looks much more
promising than the power grid.  Pros: 

- already available in many major urban centres = less retrofit
- theoretical 30Mbps transmission rate (not fibre, but still pretty good)

Cons:

- lack of standardisation / compatibility for the modems themselves 
(bleeding edge technology, surprise surprise)
- little choice for your ISP
- you may have to buy cable service along with the Internet connectivity
