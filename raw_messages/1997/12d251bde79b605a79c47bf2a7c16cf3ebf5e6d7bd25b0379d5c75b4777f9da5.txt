* A Washington Post report in March on prison corruption in
Mexico revealed that drug traffickers supposedly under maximum
security actually have "spacious rooms, cooks and maids, cellular
phones, a gymnasium, a sauna, and manicured gardens where they
host barbecues," among other things.  And in May, the New York
Times revealed that a federal jail in Brooklyn has been run as a
"Mafia social club," where family business "sit-downs" featured
smuggled-in meatballs, manicotti, vodka, and wine.  And in May,
imprisoned Gangster Disciple leader Larry Hoover was convicted in
Chicago of running a vast prison drug operation in which he
typically issued memos and gave orders by cellular phone while
wearing $400 alligator boots and eating specially prepared food in
his cell.
