I've already made a similar message to the ports list.  It was shot down.
But maybe now that we see the "trouble" with the current setup, we can
re-evaluate that.  Personally, I think we could share 95% of the ports
stuff between open/freebsd, but it would be nice to have the ability to
fix things in a local cvs tree, without having to wait for the fix to go
through channels.
