Hi Guys (F/M),

Just a quick question.

Are the current (mostly PGP 2.6.x based) keyservers able to incorporate,
store and provide the new PGP  5.0 based DSS/Diffie-Hellman keys? And if
not how can  one publish (the public  part of) such a  key using nothing
more than email or a web-browser behind a firewall that does not allow a
direct connection to a keyserver on port 11371?

Ciao,
Unicorn.
