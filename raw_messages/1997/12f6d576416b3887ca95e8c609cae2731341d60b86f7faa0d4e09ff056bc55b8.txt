*** Pentagon computers broken into over 250 times

More than 250 U.S. Defense Department computer systems were broken
into last year and the number of attempted break-ins was projected to
double this year, a U.S. intelligence official said. The comments
that Air Force Lt. Gen. Kenneth Minihan, director of the National
Security Agency (NSA), made Saturday at an intelligence convention
were released Thursday. Urging stepped-up awareness of cyber security
issues, Minihan said the United States built its information
infrastructure on a "poor foundation -- and we will eventually pay
for it." See http://www.infobeat.com/stories/cgi/story.cgi?id=5585016-7b1

Powell lingered. "How's Earth?" 
It was a conventional enough question and Muller gave the 
conventional answer, "Still spinning."
