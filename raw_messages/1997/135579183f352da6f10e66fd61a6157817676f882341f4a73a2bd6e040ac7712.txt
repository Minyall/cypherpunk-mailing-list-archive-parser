  Given Adam's many accomplishments in the arena of CypherPunks issues,
I find it hard to make a case for his discussion in this area to be
mere mental masturbation.
  'Democracy in America' is also vaporware--always has been, always 
will be--but I see no reason we should not go on discussing it and 
hoping that we will not having to keep pushing the release date of the
finished product back, time and time again.

  I agree. I think that we should just wait until someone comes out
with an actual product, and then castigate them for their ideas being
"ill-thought out."

  In return for your positive suggestions, the CDR Board of Dirctors
has voted to allow you two posts containg cheap shots at the list
member of your choice, without including any points of redeeming,
on-topic, list value.
