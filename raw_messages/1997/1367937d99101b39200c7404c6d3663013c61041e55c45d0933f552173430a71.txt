This is one thing I have never understood about the greate concern users
have over their CC #'s. If ,as Eric points out , the upstream provider
goes Cristmas shopping on your Mastercard it is not the user who is out
the money! The person who gets stuck with the bill is the Vendors who sell
products to someone who is not authorized to use your card.

Of course the hype from the CC card company and those selling services
like CyberCash go a long way to explaining this.
