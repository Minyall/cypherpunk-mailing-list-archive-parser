I would have to dissagry with you.  If the state has any business, it is
to provide services that the comminaty as a whole needs or services where
the market will not provide.  While churches (and other voluntary
organizations) have there place I do not beleave that it is a universal

Indeed I have worries about contribution money to an orginisation that I
have little ablity to control via my influence as a voter.
