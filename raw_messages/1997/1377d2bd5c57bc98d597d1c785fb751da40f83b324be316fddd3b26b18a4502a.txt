The San Jose Mercury News reports that Judge Patel has been promoted to
Chief Judge of the Northern District of California.  It lists some of her
decisions as:

* The first judge to declare illegal the WW2 internment of Japanese-Americans

* The gas chamber is a cruel and unusual punishment.

Given the way these high profile decisions have been upheld on appeal, we
can hope for the Burnstein case to be upheld as well.
