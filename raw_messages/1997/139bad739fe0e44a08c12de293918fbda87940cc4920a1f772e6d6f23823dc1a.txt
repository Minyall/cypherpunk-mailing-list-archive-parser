  You hit the nail on the head.
  The Bummerment always gains their ground by taking away 'other' 
people's rights, one by one, until they've taken them all away.
  As long as people only complain when their own rights are being
taken away, then the Bummerment will rule by a 'divide and conquer'
approach.
