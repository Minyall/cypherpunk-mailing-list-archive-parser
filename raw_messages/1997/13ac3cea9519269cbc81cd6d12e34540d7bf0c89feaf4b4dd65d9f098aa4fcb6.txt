Gosh, I feel bad whipping on one of the old/reliable/reputable
posters here, but, this seems to perfectly describe one T.C. May
and how he just couldn't believe what Sandy was doing, or that
Sandy would consider the c-punks' reputation to be expendable.

I think someone else has a gun on both of them.  The "partner" is
wearing a badly-composed grin, but then he may have been pulled out
of the closet at the last moment for the photo, and the light could
be bothering him.

Not only the software, but folks get lulled into complacency with
the "new, distributed" lists, thinking that since Gilmore/Sandfort
are "gone", everything is going to be OK from now on.

I have a Sid Vicious t-shirt that says "never let them take you
alive".  I really enjoyed the story of the Warsaw ghetto uprising
when I first heard it, and whereas Sid and the Warsaw dwellers are
from a different time and mindset, I think us modern folks can draw
the appropriate analogies.

A gun in one hand and a babe in the other - what a privelege to be
an American!!  BTW, I saw an all-stainless Colt King Cobra .357
in a pawn shop the other day for $475.  Clean as a whistle.  I
snatched that puppy up real quick.  It would be my dying wish
to have some otherwise faceless bureaucrat be the recipient of
its intended use, should it come to that.

Exactly.  Now who would be taking an option on throwaways like that?
