Is it possible the unreasonable crypto export restrictions are simply being
imposed at this time for the purpose of making Al Gore look good when he
runs for President in 2000?

In other words, his campaign could include promises to retract existing
crypto export restrictions established by his predecessor. The campaign
would be accompanied by slogans and rhetoric such as "export crypto, not
jobs" and the crypto/high-tech community would support Gore and the
Democratic party in droves.
