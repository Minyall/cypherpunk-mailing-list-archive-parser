This is an important point.  When you kill people, you make implacable
enemies.  Consider the SF Bay area rescue team that is still trying to
learn how to live with the memory of the mangled bodies they found Oklahoma
City.  They hate the person(s) responsible for the bombing and they did not
even have relatives killed there.

If you at least avoid killing people, then you have fewer bitter enemies
and a better chance of holding on to your winnings.  The examples of
Gandhi, King, and Mandala come to mind.  Contrast their success with the
results of the violence approach as exemplified by the generations old wars
in Ireland and Israel.

For cypherpunks this comes down to: Make code, not bombs.
