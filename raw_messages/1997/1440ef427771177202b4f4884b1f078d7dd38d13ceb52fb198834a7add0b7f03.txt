Because that's what all the cops on TV do.  Most people see non-lethal
leg shots on TV all the time, so they assume that it's probable.  Even
worse was "The A-Team" where hundreds of rounds were fired, but no one
ever got hurt.  It was intended to reduce the amount of violence on TV,
but (in my opinion) only made gunplay seem like a safe recreational
activity.

Most of the people who talk about non-lethal wounding have very little
experience with firearms.  A few years ago, I was in school in a small
PA town.  The local cops shot and killed a kid who rushed at them with a
knife.  Most of the people I knew couldn't understand why the cop (who
was in no way a gung-ho type, but competent and stable) didn't "just shoot
him in the leg".  I would ask them if they knew what shooting a moving
target, in an uncertain situation, in the middle of the night was like.
Most of them had never even held a gun, but they had seen the cop show
last night and KNEW it was possible.
