I didn't exactly say that. Hate is merely an absence of harmony,
and destruction is sometimes appropriate. What I did say was that
the best way to strengthen an enemy is to hate them.

The King decided to force his subjects to tell the truth. Nasrudin was 
first in line.  They asked him, "Where are you going?  Tell the truth
or be hanged"  "I am going," said Nasrudin, "to be hanged on that gallows."  
"I don't believe you."  "Very well, if I have told a lie, then hang me!" 
"But that would make it the truth!" "Exactly," said Nasrudin, "your truth."
