One of the articles was on the increase in government SWAT teams
	More shoe leather
	Among the biggest beneficiaries is the FBI, which has seen its 
	counterterrorism budget nearly triple to $243 million since 1994. 
	Bureau officials vow to "double the shoe leather" of agents working 
	on chemical and biological terrorism and are outfitting their elite 
	Hostage Rescue Team with $3.3 million worth of gas masks and protection suits. 

Doubling the shoe leather is easy - they're replacing gumshoes with jackboots.....
				Thanks!
