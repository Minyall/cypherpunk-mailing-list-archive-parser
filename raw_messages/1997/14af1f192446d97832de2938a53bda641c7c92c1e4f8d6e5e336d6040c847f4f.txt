Congress has traditionally accorded states wide latitude in regulating 
gambling, nor is gambling yet recognized by Congress as legitimate
commerce, generally speaking.  It's still regarded as criminal
behavior.  State murder laws are not unconstitutional on the ground
that contracts for killing are made ikn interstate commerce.:)
