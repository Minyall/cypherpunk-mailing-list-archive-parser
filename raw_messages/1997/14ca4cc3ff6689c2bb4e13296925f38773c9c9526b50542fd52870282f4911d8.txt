A group from IBM who had developed a telephone based audio messaging system
many years ago described it at Share (the IBM large systems users' group)
many years ago.  They described their system as being used by the top level
IBM executives.  They also described the aggressive "no backups" policy and
mentioned the discovery process in the Justice Department vs. IBM suit.
Tim's point is very real.
