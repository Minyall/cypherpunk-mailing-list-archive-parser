	And if Tim May does kill me, I hope someone has his key, or better
yet, can go make a showing to a judge and get it from him.  Then he won't
kill again.  I think this is the whole point of key escrow -- to make sure
people like the one Tim represents himself to be are people you can find
in the maze of the Internet.  Unfortunately -- well, not really -- I don't
think Tim is a trained killer who's going to search me out.  There are
plenty of them, though, and they are moving vast sums of stolen money and
nuclear weapon parts and stolen information all over the globe.  I see no
reason why we should be defenseless against them. At the same time, I 
don't think the keys should be in the hands of federal law enforcement 
agencies who have demonstrably screwed up big-time on an anwful lot of 
occasions.  Judges -- people like the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals -- 
would look rather askance at requests for someone's key when it was no
more aggravating an issue than a piece of flame mail.  On the other hand, 
if someone's going to blow up San Francisco this week, it sure would help
to have a key to any encrypted communications he was generating.  Of course,
a lot of people would like to see it blow up, and maybe Tim is one of 
those, too.

Best,
