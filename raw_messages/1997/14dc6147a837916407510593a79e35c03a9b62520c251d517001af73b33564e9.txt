Actually, Larry is right. At least in my case, and that of many I know, I
send _them_ the money, it is not withheld in any way. I have to consciously
write them out a check (or several) for their blood money.

As for my being hypocritical, Detweiler is free to think whatever he
thinks. If and when I go down in a shootout with the fascists, I expect
it'll be over something more dramatic than not paying my taxes.

(And not paying taxes merely starts a long, multi-year process. If they
even figure out I haven't been filing and paying, a long period of letters,
warnings, and seizure proceedings starts. Although I gather it was a tax
dispute that got the IRS interested in Jim Bell and, thus, the eventual
raid on his house. I'll take this into consideration.)
