So I'm putting together a special report featuring examples of illegal
wiretapping by governments -- to show why we shouldn't trust them with
mandatory domestic key escrow. Also illegal electronic surveillance,
generally speaking. Especially more recent ones. Maybe non-U.S. examples
too.

Any suggestions? I'm thinking things like: MLKjr, Mrs. Roosevelt, _Irvine_,
_Socialist Workers Party_, Dewey-FBI alliance, mail opening, Emma Goldman,
Brownell's blanket microphone surveillance, _Katz_, _Alderman_, CISPES.
