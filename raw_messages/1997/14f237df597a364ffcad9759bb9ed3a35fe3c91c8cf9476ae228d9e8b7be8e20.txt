This is simply a reflection of reality.  The sender has little real control
over what the recipient actually does with any message.  If the recipient
shares the information content, the sender is basically limited to civil or
criminal sanctions after that sharing becomes evident.

Designing a standard for encrypted communications that attempts to fight
that fact will likely be wasted effort.
