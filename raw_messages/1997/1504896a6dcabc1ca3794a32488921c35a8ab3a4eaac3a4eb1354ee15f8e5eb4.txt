I've noted a couple of others which are very similar to Hotmail:

www.rocketmail.com
www.netaddress.com
www.mailcity.com

There are probably more. I've sorta hinted this to Ian... I was thinking
the user login file could be modified so that it also used the e-mail
system type, such as:

hotmail user1 pass1
rocketmail user2 pass2
netaddress user3 pass 3
