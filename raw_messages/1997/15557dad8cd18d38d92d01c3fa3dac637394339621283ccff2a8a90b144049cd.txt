I wish you could be a little more specific.
Harrashing email and excessive cross-posting in violation of each UseNet

If someone sends a gay an email saying "I will kill you. Look out for the 
next gay pride parade" that's is legitimate ground for action.

Do you have any prof that Lance Cottrell would "bending over" his

What court document are you referring as evidence that Sameer Parekh is a 
pathological liar?
