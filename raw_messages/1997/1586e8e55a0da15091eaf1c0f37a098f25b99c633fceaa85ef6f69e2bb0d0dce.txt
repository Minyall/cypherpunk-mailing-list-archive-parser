  Having had electro-shock therapy, I consider myself 
somewhat of an expert in this area.
  I have an outdated computer which I set next to my new
computer, and I have self-running programs running on it
all the time. I also add a keyboard input device when I
want a little extra *noise* in the air. (It uses those 
*ducks* that swing up and down, dipping their beaks in
a glass of water.)

Not that I think that Martians from the flying saucers are already
listening, but it is interesting to find out how to do this stuff.

  For Martians, use an aluminum-foil hat. (That's common
knowlege).
