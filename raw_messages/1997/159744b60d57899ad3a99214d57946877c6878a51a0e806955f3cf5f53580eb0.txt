And, though most of you already surely know this, the phrase "Disneyland
with the death penalty" is not Declan's. Not that Declan is claiming
authorship, but the record still ought to be clarified. This nice turn of
phrase appeared several years ago in an article of William Gibson's (or
maybe Bruce Sterling's, but I 97% certain it was Gibson's) in "Wired."

However, our own(Cypherpunk list) Sandy Sandfort coined it, when he was
working with Gibson on the article, from all that I have heard.
