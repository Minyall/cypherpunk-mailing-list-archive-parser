  It's not an 'attempt', its a 'done deal'.
  The new 'laws' have pretty much already been written to control 
cryptography world-wide. The only thing left is for the Big Boys
to fight over control (and the spoils).
  I have a relative involved in this farce.  For as long as I have
known him, he has always tended to get a 'pained' expression on his
face every time words like 'freedom' or 'rights' get slipped into
a conversation.

  When you use the word 'censorship', does he counter-attack with the
word 'moderation'?
