I forget where I saw the below message announcing stext for Linux,
but there is a nice collection of crypto packages at
http://www.replay.com/redhat .
Unfortunately, they're in RedHat Package Manager format,
so they may be a shade difficult to use for non-Redhat users,
but Redhat does seem to be a fairly popular Linux flavor.
