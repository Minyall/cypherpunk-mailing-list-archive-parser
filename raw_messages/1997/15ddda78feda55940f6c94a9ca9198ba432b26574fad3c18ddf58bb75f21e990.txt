How do you do that?  Arrange the XORs to do x0^x1, x2^x3....,
then (x0^x1)^(x2^x3)... etc., ending up with user 0 doing the last XOR,
and broadcasting or tree-casting the results?  It cuts down on bandwidth
for the average user, but does end up with a few users doing most of the work,
and perhaps there's some security risk in the unbalanced workload.
It's an interesting approach, and I suppose you could do a bit more work
(logn instead of 2) to spread the partial results around so more people
can calculate them directly (e.g. user 0 sends user 2 x0^x1, and sends 
user 1 x2^x3, and if you're still paranoid you can have user 0 also send
user 3 x0^x1, which user 2 and user 3 can compare....)

You've probably got to put more thought into getting the details right,
like collision detection and backoff, but it's still doable.
