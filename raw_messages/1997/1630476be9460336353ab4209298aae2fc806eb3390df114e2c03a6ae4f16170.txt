Could you please (!) state for the record:

1. Why you can't use filters?

2. Why you want your news censored?  Do you think when (if) you pick
   up your favourite big-city newspaper, that having a "Times Staff
   Writer" edit (rewrite) all the stories is better than getting them
   straight off the wire, i.e., AP, UPI, etc.?  I'll bet you do, you
   budding little fascist.
