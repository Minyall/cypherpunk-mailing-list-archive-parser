You typically only need to tune into either the forward or reverse
channel.  You can usually hear both sides (one may be down a few dB).
This is probably a result of acoustic coupling from the speaker into
the microphone on one or both ends (could also be near-end hybrid
echo).  You see the same situation on both cellular and the 49 MHz
cordless phones.
