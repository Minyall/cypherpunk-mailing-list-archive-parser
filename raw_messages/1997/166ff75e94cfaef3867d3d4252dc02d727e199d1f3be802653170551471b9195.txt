OK. I give up. I think DreamMonger's last comment about at least sort of
believing in my intentions is about the best it will get for me here.
Tim, you're in my killfile now too so I'm not going to respond directly to
your
comments.

Now at least when I am going through the meatgrinder, I won't know if it is
a cypherpunk or a Japanese fascist who's sending me through.

Some Japanese conservatives probably think *I* am the cancerous tissue that
their people shouldn't hang out with...
