General Sherman's march through the Confederacy wasn't first either.
Depending on when you count "America" starting, it was probably
some attack on some Indian group.  If you count internal attacks as well,
maybe the crushing of the Whiskey Rebellion or Shay's Rebellion?

Casualties from Bush's invasion of Panama were about 6000, mostly military.
All sorts of people were murdering civilians in VietNam and Korea - 
governments, wannabe governments, other civilians...
US figures for deaths in VietNam are typically given as 50,000,
though sometimes you can remind them of the 2-3 million VietNamese killed
(in contrast to during the war itself, when there were exaggerated
body counts to make it sound like the draftees were doing a great
job of killing Commies.)
