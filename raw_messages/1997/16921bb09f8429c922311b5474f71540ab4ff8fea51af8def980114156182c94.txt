Of course the CDA was not necessary for national security. It would not
prevent the U.S. Capitol building from being blown up.

The main thing is preserving freedoms, both to use and export crypto.
Restrictions on use are not reasonable tradeoffs for relaxation of export
ctrls.

Also the coalition that came together can be fragmented if the domestic

Your blind faith in the U.S. Congress is touching, but hardly realistic.
