Ok so if a mailing list gateway @bwalk.dm.com pumps thousands of broken
posts into usenet you don't wish them to be removed from usenet?

Nor if I post a message with your name and email, saying "Chris Lewis the
best thing that happened to usenet and I wish to have his baby."

If this is so sould I change the RB to reflect this.
