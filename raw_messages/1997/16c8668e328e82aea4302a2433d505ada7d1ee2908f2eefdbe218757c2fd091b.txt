William Burroughs warned of "the policeman inside."

(A variation of my "Big Brother Inside" logo might be "Policeman Inside."
Perhaps as many as one in ten thousand might catch the Burroughs reference.)

As Bob Hettinga, Kent Crispin, and other policemen inside are warning, if
we don't censor ourselves, if we don't narc out others, the real police
will have to do it for us. Welcome to the New World Order.

Of course, an alternative is to say "Fuck you" to those who want us to shut
up, to deploy more unbreakable crypto, to encourage more armed militias to
spring up, to destabilize the regimes in Hong Kong, Japan, and India, and
to "Just Say No" to backdoors in PGP and other crypto products. Bring on
crypto anarchy.
