By the way, which list address are you now subscribed to...I switched from
algebra. com to cyberpass.net, but now expect to see 2-3 hours delay before
posts appear.

(This applies to others, too. I'm getting replies to my posts, when sent
directly to me, literally hours before seeing it on the list. Someone
mentioned subscribing to toad.com, which, to tell the truth, I thought had
vanished as a list origination site months ago.)
