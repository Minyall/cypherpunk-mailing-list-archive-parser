That's a bold assertion, but not one that squares easily with the 
half-dozen or so privacy laws already on the books at the federal 
level.

I would like to go to those small-town folk of whom urban 
intellectuals write so eloquently and ask them what they would think 
of their neighbors posting all their gossip to a place where millions 
can read it. Something tells me they wouldn't see those two actions 
as one in the same. There is a qualitiative difference between the 
two.

That's about as far as I'm going on that one.

I'm sure Bernstein, DeFalco et al. will have clear reasons for why 
none of us should care less.
