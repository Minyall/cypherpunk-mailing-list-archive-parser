  When you two 'wise' men are done playing kissy-face, why don't
you get together and build some bombs?
  Debating class is over, it's time to move into the Lab.

  If you guys are serious about what you are discussing, just wait
a couple of years and ask your jailer's opinion.
  In the end, he will have the last say, anyway.

Fuck You
