Dyslexia's harder to help, but in an online environment you _can_
help agraphia (or bad typing) by using spell checkers.  Sure, the
spell checker may occasionally miss misspelled words, and may "fix"
words that were correctly spelled, but you're still probably ahead of the 
game.  And they may not recognize "genetically" either, but it's a start.
