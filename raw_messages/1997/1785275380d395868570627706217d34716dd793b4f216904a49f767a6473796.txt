Heh.  Sending illegal or unexpected commands to a program is _the_
standard way to break security; if they can't defend against that, they're
hosed.
I'd reserve the phrase "utter absence of security" for systems that
let you ignore the permissions by just asking nicely :-)

Interesting paper.  I was surprised it didn't explicitly mention Plan 9
when it was discussing other operating systems, though mentioning Inferno 
does include that indirectly.  It also didn't mention security -
it talked about the kind of world where you can just buy a computer,
turn it on, plug it in, and it'll find whatever resources it wants
in the One Big Operating System.
