Note, too, how well the Senator firmly straddles the fence all
through the letter, agreeing somewhat with one position but
remaining concerned about the flip side.  It's a complete CYA job,
part of a library of boilerplate updated as the issues come and go,
and designed to make every correspondent feel like the Senator
understands the constituent's position regardless of what it may
really be. It's the ultimate in "reasonable," "responsible"
Newspeak and scarcely touched by human hands, much less Senatorial 
ones.
