Despite the sometimes controversial contents of Usenet feeds it is unlikely
that the Feds will move to put the kabosh on Usenet.  Services, like
Etermity, which merely act as reference engines to simplify Usenet access
are also unlikely to be targeted.  Even services which refresh existing
Usenet feeds to provide persistence may be off-limits, especially if the
articles are encrypted, the service does not possess the key and it is the
client browsers which decrypt and handle the cleartext.

The Feds are undoubtedly honing their skills at traffic analysis for
locating posters and email correspondants of interest.  It is the
cypherpunk role to provide the means to keep the Fed nose from coming under
the privacy tent.
