  Since the U.S. legislature is so concerned about child pornography
and the government is interested in promoting world-wide enforcement
of laws meant to fight evil, I was wondering about the following
scenario:
  Manuel Noriega sends pictures on the internet to Iraq of women with
their ankles showing and their heads uncovered. Iraq sends an armed
force to the U.S. to capture Noriega and take him to Iraq for trial.
  Sure, a few thousand U.S. troops and citizens might die, but it is
for the greater good, right?

Scenario Two:
  Bill Clinton sends a picture on the internet to Iraq of Hillary, with
her ankles showing and her head uncovered...
