Rich, you have to have a mind to comment on my posts.  To call my
posts disgusting, when I as a person am  1) Vastly more concerned
about justice, truth, and openness than you, and  2) Vastly more
intelligent than you, is pure ignorance and hypocrisy.

When you have nothing to say, you do the "attack against the man",
which is a logical fallacy.  You and Sandfort can lie in bed together
on that one.  Punk.
