I'm not going to defend Japan on this one. Japan is a rascist society.
Does that make it OK for you to be one too?

I'm sorry, but a racial remark is a racial remark. I never said it wasn't
funny and I never said this guy didn't deserve it. But what you said
was racist, no doubt about it, and even if they are funny, I personally
think that racial jokes are stupid and cheap.

On and by the way, I actually didn't think your message was very funny,
and I don't see how you can argue that I shouldn't brand you a rascist
just because you thought you were funny and the guy deserved it.
