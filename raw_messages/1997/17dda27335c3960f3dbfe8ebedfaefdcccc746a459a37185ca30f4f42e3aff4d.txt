DEFCON IV was well before FC97.  This was an issue I was chasing Eric
Hughes on.  As far as I understand it, this was unpublished in any form,
just presented, but many people have saw it (must have been a big
conference :-).  If anyone knows any different, please let me know
(except, "get in touch with Eric" because that was not resultful).
