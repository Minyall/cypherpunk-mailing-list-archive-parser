This is a question which I am unclear on about PGP Inc's design goals
in using the CMR method.

  Is the CMR field to allow the company to recover from the user
  forgetting his password?  (recover his mail folder full of encrypted
  email).

or

  Is the CMR field to allow the company to read the email in transit

This seems like a fairly important distinction.
