Here's recent Jim Bell material:

   http://jya.com/jimbell6.htm (news stories on Bell's sentencing)

   http://jya.com/next-wave.htm  (US News on CB terrorism, stars JB)

   http://jya.com/jibell-dock4.htm  (latest court dockets for USA v. Bell)

For earlier info access backwards in each series: 

   ../jimbell5, etc.; 

   ../jimbell-dock3.htm, etc.

Not aware of a source for the classified version but the public 
version of "Assassination Politics" is at: 

   http://jya.com/ap.htm
