Comrade Declan:

Thank you for labeling se7en's thoughtcrime as such and blocking his
subversive and enturbulating assertions from the fight-censorship mailing
list. The counterrevolutionary sedition that there is such a thing as
kiddie porn on the Holy Internet shall be suppressed forthwith. Verily,
traitor to the Holy Cause se7en is naught but an NSA Shill, who belongs
in the Pit of Despair with the other thought criminals.

Operation Free Speech II is proceeding according to the Five-Year Plan.
