  An interesting observation.
  The original Gold Rush involved the thronging masses stepping on each
other's toes, shooting each other in the back, etc., and the end result
was that a few 'lucky' ones got filthy rich, while the people behind
the scenes, encouraging this activity, 'all' got filthy rich.
  If I had a mansion on the hill, with a high wall surrounding it and
a guard on the gate, I would be much more inclined to encourage the
masses to seek their fortune at my doorstep, and shop at my general
store across the street.
