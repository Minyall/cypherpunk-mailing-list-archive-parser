Hello,^Morons,

         WELCOME TO THE 30 SECOND COMMUTE...45, IF YOU GRAB SOME COFFEE!
        
 Let's take a trip back to 1950 and imagine that my name is Ray Crock and I want to tell 
 you about a little restaurant named McDonald's.  If you had bought the stock that I was 
 selling then, you'd certainly be doing the 30 second commute now!! 
 Seriously, had you bought that stock then, it would've been the right decision.


 Fact is, it's 1997, I don't own McDonald's corporation and I'm not selling anything. 
 
 What I want to know is:

 1.  Would you spend 3 or 4 minutes a day to make $300 or $400 a week to spend on yourself 
     and family?
 2.  Would you trade $100 for $600 ?
 3.  If you got promoted to president of the company, would you accept?
 4.  Would you make the right decision now, if you had to?
 5.  Would you e-mail me to see how you can do the 30 second commute?
