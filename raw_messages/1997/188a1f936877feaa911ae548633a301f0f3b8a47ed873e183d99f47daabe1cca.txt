According to the Associated Press, the first Black student at the
University of Mississippi, James Meredith, has just opened an
institute which teaches Black men and boys to be successful by
avoiding the use of Black English, or Ebonics.
 
Speaking at a news conference today, Meredith told reporters that
Black males could never be intellectual giants unless they learned
proper English.
 
Meredith promised that after attending his new Mississippi Meredith
Institute's weekend classes, the Black male would be "as comfortable
in the library as he is on the basketball court."
 
The Meredith Institute would not be open to girls or women, Meredith
explained, although they may sit in on classes if they pay a $50 fee.
He explained that Black women would still prevail in the Black family,
because, "She's not going to let the boy get ahead of her."
 
Meredith's first school, the Library Scool for Black Boys and Men in
Jackson, Mississippi, is scheduled to open in January.  A second
school will open in February in San Diego.
 
No Ho's or Bitches need apply.
