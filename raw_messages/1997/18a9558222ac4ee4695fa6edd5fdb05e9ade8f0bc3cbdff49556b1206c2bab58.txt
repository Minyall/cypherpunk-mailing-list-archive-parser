Very succintly put, and straight to the point. Even minarchism could not 
be achieved by compromising or negotiating with the current system.

This is not so certain, crypto-anarchy would of course be achieved if 
anarchy in general were achieved, this could occur if strong action were 
taken such as nuking DC. I believe more selective systems such as AP will 
eventually cause the downfall of government, and will do so in a much 
more ethical and discrimatory manner.

I don`t believe they are at all comparable statements, the first is a cop 
out, the second simply carries the discussion to its logical conclusion, 
that agressors must be punished and agressive acts must be prevented.
