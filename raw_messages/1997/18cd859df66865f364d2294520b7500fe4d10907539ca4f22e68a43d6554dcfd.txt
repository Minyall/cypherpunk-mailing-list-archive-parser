Adam,
  Here is your official PGP Signature. Cut and paste it to all of
your correspondence to the CypherPunks mailing list, so we will know
it is really you in the future.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
Version: PGP for Personal Privacy 5.0
MessageID: HyRMcbGm8DN7BxUVL/6EunpyDLmTX8Wj

-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----

  Everything you want to know about encryption is on the Clue Server,
which you should be able to find with a quick Yahoo search. If you 
can't find it, just post a message to the list asking where it is,
and I am certain that there are a variety of list members who would
be more than willing to take time out of their busy schedules to
tell you where to go.

Sincerely,
PGP Signature Key Intelligent AutoResponder
