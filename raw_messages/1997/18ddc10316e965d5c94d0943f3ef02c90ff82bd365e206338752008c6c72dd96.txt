Having worked for DigiCash for more than one year before giving up on them
due to persistent billing problems, I can assure you that the privacy
features of Ecash have *nothing* to do with the failure of Ecash in the
marketplace. 

The blame for the failure of Ecash rests squarely and exclusively with 
DigiCash's management.
