There is a short piece by "Wired News" on the Eternity servers. 

   http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/5778.html

I should add that all Eternity servers...

         http://www.zipcon.com/~enoch/eternity
         http://www.replay.com/~aba/eternity

now have pretty icons and a more attractive format.
