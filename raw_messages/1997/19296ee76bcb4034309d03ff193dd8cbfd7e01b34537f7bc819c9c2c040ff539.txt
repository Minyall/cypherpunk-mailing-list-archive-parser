according to http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,10604,00.html

                Kerrey's effort has one thing in common with the
                SAFE Act: It calls for the creation of an Information
                Security Board. The board proposal caused some
                privacy watchdogs to pull their endorsements of
                SAFE because it wouldn't have to comply with
                federal open-meeting act. 


Since a common hand has presumably been at work in both bills,
this looks like good cop / bad cop to me.

The good cop says, "I am your friend"

He is not your friend.

Create a federal board, and it will exercise power.
