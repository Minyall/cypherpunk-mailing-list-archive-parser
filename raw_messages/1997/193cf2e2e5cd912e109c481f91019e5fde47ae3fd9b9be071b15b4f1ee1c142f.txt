I know some of you are into goth and stuff, and since this list almost never
talks about things related to cypherpunkery I thought I'd pop in something
vaguely relevant.

31 Oct in OKC there's a masquerade ball/costume contest/art show/etc for
those interested in the RPG "Kindred".  Email if interested, otherwise ignore.

anyone know of a good goth site to link a web page to?  (It's not up yet.)


Thx,
