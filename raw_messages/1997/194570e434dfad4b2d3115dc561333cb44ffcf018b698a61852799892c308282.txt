Kent, 
  You should try to refrain from embarassing yourself by referring
to the above as "reasoning".
  I'm of a like mind with Bill Stewart and Dr. Robert's, or whoever, 
who appear to think that compromises on privacy and freedom lead to 
yellow stars and barbed-wire fences.
  
 
  Now, if you could just give us similar examples to illustrate 
how the burdgeoning market for Zyklon-B showed that corporations
*really wanted* the Holocaust...
  Or how the Allied POW's in the Battan Death March *really wanted* 
to go for a walk in the country...
