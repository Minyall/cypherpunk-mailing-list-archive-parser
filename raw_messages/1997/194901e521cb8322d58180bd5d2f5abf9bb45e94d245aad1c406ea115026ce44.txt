Got two FOIA things in the mail today:

1.	~ 200 pp of "LIST OF DUAL USE GOODS AND TECHNOLOGIES AND MUNITIONS LIST"
re my Wassenaar FOIA. It's much too long to type or scan. Am planning to
type the crypto and software relevant parts when I get some free time. This
looks like the document I was expecting.

2.	A letter from the NSA in response to my FOIA request re cypherpunks -
they want a check for close to $2400 before they'll do a search of their
records. I'm not sending them $2400. Am considering appealing their denial
of my fee waiver, and/or making a more carefully tailored request. I'll
probably scan this within the next few days.
