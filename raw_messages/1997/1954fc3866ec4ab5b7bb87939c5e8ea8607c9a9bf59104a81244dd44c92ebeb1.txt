Well, for starters, what are the laws about crypto use in India?

(I'm serious. None of our Indian list subscribers, that I can recall, has
carefully stated what the Indian laws are.)

If it isn't illegal in India, what do you care what some laws in the U.S.A.
say?

I certainly don't let whatever the laws are in India, or Botswana, or
Germany, or Latvia dictate my actions in the U.S.

So, when you say "I donot want to break any law," how do you think you
could be breaking any laws that bind you?

(If you are concerned that using DES could cause you to be subject to
kidnapping and wrapping in a Persian carpet by one of the NSA's snatch
teams, I expect you have little to worry about. Noriega was kidnapped and
spirited out of Panama because he knew the details of Bush's CIA dealings
in Panama. I expect you have nothing that scares them.)

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
