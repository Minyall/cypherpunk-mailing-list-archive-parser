At the risk of responding to a post which has a good probability of being 
a troll I will at least say that the above opinion may be that of several 
members, but the fact is the list has evolved, it never had an original 
defined purpose, at least not one easily put into words, and applauding 
murder of government agents is a part of the whole strong crypto privacy 
and liberty ethic. As for white supremacy, look elsewhere, I think you`ll 
find Tim`s post an example of what the developed world knows as humour, 
not a serious attack on any ethnic group.
