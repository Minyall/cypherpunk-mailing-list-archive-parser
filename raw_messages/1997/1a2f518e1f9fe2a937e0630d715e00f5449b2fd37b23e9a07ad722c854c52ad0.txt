I can't see that export controls are much of a big deal for freeware
cypherpunk software ... just publish it on a US site with whatever
access controls you fancy.  It'll make it's way out of the country in
a few minutes and end up on replay.com, or one of the automated
mirrors of export control sites at ftp://idea.sec.dsi.unimi.it/pub/ or
where ever.

It's not as if you're trying to sell it, or are a corporation worrying
about stepping on toes at NSA Inc.
