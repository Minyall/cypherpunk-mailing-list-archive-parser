Not obvious at all - spammers have harvester programs that
hunt down new web pages to find spammer targets,
and since three of the different spammer groups are hitting you,
that's probably what happened.

Perl is a nice language to write such things in, but you won't
get huge quantities of people implementing it, except perhaps Linux users.
You need an executable that'll run on Win3.1 or Win95 (sigh);
a user interface letting you input different targets is also good.
However, that doesn't really block the spammers who buy a list of
N million targets and send spam out from their own machines,
though shutting down Spamford and Harris Marketing would help,
and would cut down the sales of the lists.
