"On the Internet no one knows you're a nigger."



(Lest anyone be offended, I'm using the vernacular used by colored people.
And I'm paraphrasing the famous cartoon. And I'm using strong language to
make the point as some might themselves make it.)

And this point isn't even strictly true, even for dogs. No doubt dogs on
the Internet would advertise their pedigrees, as people do. And even race
can and is advertised. Also, it is quite possible to imagine the form
"racial credentialling" by private entities could take: visual inspections,
with digital signatures given. DNA tests, etc. Those who want to hang out
with other brothers, or other Aryans, or other Jews, could do so by asking
for such credentials, which of course could be formally isolated from one's
True Name.
