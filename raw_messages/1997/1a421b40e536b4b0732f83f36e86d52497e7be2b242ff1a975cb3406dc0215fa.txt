The ACLU does have some peculiar ideas about English, however.  A few
years ago your local Northern California chapter sued an aspirin
company because their label, including warnings, was entirely in
English.  They argued that because the company was selling aspirin in
a Spanish speaking market, the label should have been in Spanish.
(The grandmother of a child did not speak English.  The child became
seriously ill and may have died.)
