* In a September statement, Joseph Sniezek, an official of the
Centers for Disease Control's National Center for Injury
Prevention, lamented the serious injuries suffered by rodeo bull
riders and suggested a solution might be to require helmets.

  (When the law is passed to require this, don't be surprised if they
tack on requirements regarding the use of child-seats for those riders
who take the children along. And of course, if they have a copy of PGP
in their pocket when they ride without a helmet...}
