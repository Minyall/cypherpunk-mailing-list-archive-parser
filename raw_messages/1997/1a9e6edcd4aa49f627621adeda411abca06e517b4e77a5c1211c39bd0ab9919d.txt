Amsterdam isn't all that far from the camp site and you can always make a
run there. I rented one of the 10x5 meter army tents used for the San
Francisco Bay Area delegation from

Purmerend
Beemsterbugwal 12  (++ 31 299 420999)

The tent is 250FL, deposit is 750FL for a total of 1000FL.

See you all in Amsterdam,
