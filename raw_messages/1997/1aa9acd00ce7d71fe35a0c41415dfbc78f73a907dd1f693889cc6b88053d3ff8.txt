NSA and NIST will set up a new lab for evaluation of 
information-security products, including crypto algorithms:

The lab will coordinate with other nations. Plans include
eventual shifting the evaluation to private testing labs
once accreditation standards are set.

With critiques by Bruce Schneier and Steve Walker,
and a slap from NCSA, which now provides testing,
"They've been talking about this stuff for years."
