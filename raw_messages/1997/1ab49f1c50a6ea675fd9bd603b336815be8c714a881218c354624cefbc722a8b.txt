You'll recall that Sandfort (as Logos) ranted without letup about
decorum, decorum, ... ad nauseam, which, now that I look back on

The List Lord made it clear "In The Beginning" that some posts would
probably be irretrievably lost due to unavoidable "mistakes".
Think "FBI Crime Lab".  You get the picture.
