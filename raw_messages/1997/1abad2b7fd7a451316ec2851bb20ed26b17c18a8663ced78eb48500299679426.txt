Wash Post reports today on a NSA intercept of
a "secure communication" between two Israeli
spooks discussing a top US official spying for
Israel.

The FBI opened an investigation in January.

Israel denies the claim.

Crypto is not mentioned, only that the Hebrew
conversation was "awkwardly" translated.

The intercept was withdrawn after 12 hours from
the distribution list due to FBI's dismay at its
spread.
