Friends:

Please post the date when this list will shift to Usenet if that is indeed to
happen. I have not been able to sort out the facts (?) from the speculation,
argument, and gas.

I have requested my ISP to add alt.cypherpunks to the mail server asap.

I don't want to miss a second of the resurrected (or is that born again?)
c'punks.

Thanks.

Alec
