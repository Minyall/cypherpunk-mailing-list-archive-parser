However, this doesn't seem to work, unless I'm mistaken about CMR
enforcement and the SEC regulations. CMR will only allow the snoops 
to read incoming email, not outgoing, and hence if Joe Blow at 
Foo-Bah.com wants to send me some handy insider trading tips CMR will 
not stop them. So this seems to be another justification for CMR 
which just doesn't make sense.
