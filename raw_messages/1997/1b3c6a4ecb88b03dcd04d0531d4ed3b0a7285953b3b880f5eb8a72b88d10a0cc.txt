	Strong crypto is useful not in building a web site, but in
providing an infrastructure that resists stupidity better.

	For example, when you telnet or ftp, your password goes in a
sniffable cleartext format.  When you send mail, it traverses the net
in the clear, and is stored in the clear.  If crypto was widely
deployed, the sensitive information people send in the clear would be
protected.

	Locking the barn after the horses are gone is not nearly as
useful as ubiquitous locks.

| Do you have any information about the ESPN/SportZone web site store being
