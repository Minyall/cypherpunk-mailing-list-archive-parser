Crowds, a system for increasing your anonymity while you browse the
web, now runs on RedHat Linux 4.2, in addition to SunOS, Solaris, and
Irix.  The code can be requested from our web site:

http://www.research.att.com/projects/crowds

We would like our next target OS to be freeBSD, but unfortunately we
don't have a machine running it.  If anyone running a recent version
of freeBSD on a machine with a direct internet connection (not behind
a firewall, not over a modem) would be willing to donate a few minutes
to helping us port it there, we would be grateful.  Typically the port
doesn't take long ... basically we just need to figure out what args 
to pass to some fcntl calls.
