I'm inclined to agree with the RC's not being The same as prodestants 
comment. Why else would you have had Luther and the other reformers if 
some of catholicism wasn't a problem ??

Is it worth noting at this point that an evangilical Christian and the 
religious right have little in common. Evangelicals (I'm one) belive the 
Bible to be the word of God etc.. but don't add anythign else to it and 
certianly wouldn't force thier beliefs down your throat. They would

I would also have a problem with Christians controlling and censoring the 
net. I would welcome (and do welcome) sites that which to argue against 
Christianity. What wrong with that ?? It simply provides a forum for 
Christians to defend thier beliefs. Besides if I censor you now because i 
find your content un acceptable whats to stop you censoring me later when 
your in the majority ! What utter stupidity to load the gun for others. 
Particularly as i am a Christian I WOULD be critical of some of the 
religious rights ideas and agendas and would happily argue from the Bible 
that they are not a good thing.

I thought school pray was outlawed in the states ??

Would they be willing to accpet my view on thiers ?? If yes then i'll

Such as ?? As has been said before you can get censorware to control 
thier access.

I must agree with that point

Christians whould read challenging stuff. IT expands thier mind and 
strengthens thier beliefs (Well i find it does), and in my expirence a 
Christian who cant defend thier faith needs to learn more. Although i 
would disagree with dismissing creationism and Biblical inerrancey. (not 
that is is an appropriate forum for such a discussion)

Well intersting post. I hope the response is of some use.
