The Exportation Restrictions section reads as follow:

    As of the release of UDCM V2.0, there are no absolutely no 
    United States exportation regulation laws that actually affect 
    the electronic Internet distribution of the IMDMP encryption 
    algorithm. Electronic distribution technically does not constitute 
    physical distribution. So because of that, it is perfectly legal for 
    UDCM V2.0 to be digitally distributed world-wide. However, the 
    international physical disk distribution of UDCM V2.0 is not legal. 
    Also note that DataET will not sell a registered version of UDCM 
    to any person outside of the United States and Canada. There 
    are absolutely no exceptions at all. DataET Research cannot 
    be held responsible for any illegal distribution actions that take 
    place outside of its direct control. However, software containing 
    or having access to the registered version of UDCM may be 
    distributed world-wide, physically or electronically, but programs 
    developed using a registered version of UDCM may not be distributed 
    outside of the U.S. and Canada unless users are not given direct 
    access to UDCM's functions or unless applied encryption keys 
    are no larger than 7 bytes (56 bits). Users are said to have direct 
    access if they can choose which files to operate on.

Could someone please forward this to Dan Bernstein and 
Phil Karn, I'm sure they'll be happy to know that they can
drop the law suits now.
