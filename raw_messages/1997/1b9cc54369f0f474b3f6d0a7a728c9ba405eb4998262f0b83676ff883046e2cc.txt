"CAST" isn't a particular algorithm, but a design process for creating 
algorithms.  The particular CAST instantiation used in PGP 5 is either 
CAST-128 or CAST5, depending on who you ask.  Other versions of CAST abound, 
including an earlier one used by MS for unknown purposes which had a 64-bit 
key, probably the one Bruce is referring to.
