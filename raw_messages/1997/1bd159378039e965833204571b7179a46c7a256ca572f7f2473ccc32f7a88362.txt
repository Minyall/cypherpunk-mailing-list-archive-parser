On June 10, BXA will present an Encryption Workshop 
at the Westin Santa Clara, in Santa Clara, California. 

The half-day program will highlight the current U.S. policy 
on encryption and will include discussion of the main 
elements of the interim rule published December 30, 1996, 
including license exception KMI and the licensing process. 

The program will also address upcoming revisions based 
on the Administration's initiative to promote the use of
strong encryption by U.S. banks and financial institutions 
and their subsidiaries overseas.
