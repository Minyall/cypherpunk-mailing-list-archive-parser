While it is true that Dmitri is a proven liar in the grand tradtion
of the Soviet Union (shout a lie long enough and loud enough and 
eventually some people will start to believe it), and a pathological
homophobic bigot (who secretly enjoys sucking cock but wears womens
clothing to disguise himself), he was absolutely right in decrying the
moderation experiment that was thrown at the list earlier.

Sandy did drop his C2 rantings from both moderated and flames lists,
because he considered them libelous.  That's a line of bullshit -- it
wasn't for him to decide libel or not.  It's for a jury to decide.
Sandy wouldn't have been held responsible in either case because he
could have hidden behind the "ISP protection" clause of the CDA.
As a moderator who was tasked with spreading the bullshit in one of
two places, he simply could have thrown it to either of the lists
and claimed it was his duty as moderator to put it out.

Of course, by that time Dmitri had so little reputation capital that
Gilmore patched Majordomo so it wouldn't even respect a subscription
request for him.

Dmitri's allegations shouldn't even have gone to the flames list -- 
they should have gone to the moderated list.  If Stronghold has a
weakness, or even a perceived weakness, it's crypto relevant.  But,
when Dmitri writes anything, he's got to attach a "cocksucker this"
or "molester that", which makes everything he writes libelous.  So,
even if he had proof that Lying Fuck Freeh were a axe-murderer, he'd
fuck it up and call him "Louis Freeh (cocksucker)", which would 
continue to throw his credibility down the toilet.

Ultimately, Dmitri's allegations of weaknesses in Stronghold, true or
not, are totally irrelevant.  Without mathematical proof of a weakness,
he simply cannot be believed to ever be telling the truth.  So, if
C2 said to him in private e-mail, "if you call Sameer a cocksucker one
more time, we'll slap a libel suit across your emigrant ass, take back
your green card, deport you and tell Russia that you called Yeltsin a
cocksucker," well, I can understand why he shut up.  

Actually, I don't think Dmitri knows of any real weaknesses.  As I
recall, I think he made up some fictitious homosexual connection 
between Sameer and a law-enforcement agent and suggested that there
was a "back door" in Stronghold (pun intended.)  Of course, I didn't
archive any of his spew from back then.  Nobody did, he raved so
long and loud at the moderation and Gilmore and everybody that it
was all my delete key could do to keep up with his shit.

So, don't hold your breath waiting for a repost of previous lies
from our dear Kook of the Fucking Century.  He might get caught,
so he's moved on to new lies now.
