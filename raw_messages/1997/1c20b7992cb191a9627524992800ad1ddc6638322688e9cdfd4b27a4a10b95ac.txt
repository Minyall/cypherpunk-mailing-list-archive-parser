Ie, hashcash is a fancy techie oriented self-labelling technique.  :-)

I didn't read the code, but it seems that the double spending
protection is just local to the recipient (ie, there isn't a trusted
central clearinghouse that checks against double spending on a global
basis).  Thus, a spammer could calculate postage for a message, then
send 100000 copies.  Hashcash would guarantee that each user only got
one copy, but there are easier ways to do that.  [If the checking was
done at an ISP level, of course, only one message would get through. 
But that requires widespread deployment at the ISP level, not the
individual user level, and checking at the ISP level requires
that the ISP keep a database of users mail preferences.]

But without a central clearinghouse hashcash seems useless to me as a 
means of combating spam.  And of course, a central clearinghouse 
brings up a whole raft of other issues concerning trust and so on...

I would rather pursue a "tit-for-tat" strategy for email, but
unfortunately tit-for-tat requires stable identities...
