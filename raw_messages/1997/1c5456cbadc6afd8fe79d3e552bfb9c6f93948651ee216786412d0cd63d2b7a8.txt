A southern Washington newspaper, The Columbian (apparently published in
Vancouver) provides a "greeked" (e.g., squiggles instead of text) version of
its front page at http://www.columbian.com (you'll have to pick the frame for
"The latest Columbian headlines") - and today's page one above-the-fold
headline is "Affidavit: Internet essay solicits murder". 

It looks to me like this is real. Yow. Jim Bell is a goddamn loon, but I
haven't seen him write anything that I thought was criminal.
