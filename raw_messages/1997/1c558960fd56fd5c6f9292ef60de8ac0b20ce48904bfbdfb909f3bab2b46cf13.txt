You neglect things like the interstate commerce provision, which means
that if it crosses state lines, the feds can regualte it. In addition,
the court (in its infinite wisdom), decided that "the people" meant
the states, then the people. So, as long as it isn't meantioned in the
constitution, the states can do whatever they want.

Welcome to America, please stay in line.
