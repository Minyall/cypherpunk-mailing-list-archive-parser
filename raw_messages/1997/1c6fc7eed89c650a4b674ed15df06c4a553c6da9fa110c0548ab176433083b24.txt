Did you look at getting an anonymous account at cyberpass.net? 

Try http://www.cyberpass.net

Note, they tend to be strict about not using it for illegal activity, but
highly supportive for general anonymous use.

Then again you could set up some type of applet scheme, but I doubt anyone
would be willing to keep it active.
