GURK!  I meant that it would take 1E24 seconds for one such
processor to factor a 2048 bit number.  The rest is right.

Use an 8K bit key and it will be 1E30 times harder than a 2K key.
Now your soccer ball is comfortably bigger than the earth.  You
will have to convert the sun into a CPU to break it with nanotech.
