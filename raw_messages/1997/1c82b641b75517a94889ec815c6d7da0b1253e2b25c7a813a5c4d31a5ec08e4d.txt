As is the first two cases the "criminal" has violated my property &
family. Such crimes are worthy of immediate death. You steal, you assault
or threaten me or my family you have committed suicide.

It is a quite simple and effective philosophy: 

"You fuck with me, my family, or my property you die. You leave me alone
and I leave you alone."

Even someone like you can understand such a philosophy.
