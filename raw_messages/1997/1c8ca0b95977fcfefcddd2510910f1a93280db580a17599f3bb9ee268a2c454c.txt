Can the LEA have a blanket wiretap in a confessional booth 
in hopes of gaining evidence of organized crime? Are they permitted
to monitor all confessions or just the ones stated in the
warrant? 

Do LEA view themselves as God?

Forgive me mother for I have sinned. I have used un-GAKd crypto
in my preperations of my writings about theology.
