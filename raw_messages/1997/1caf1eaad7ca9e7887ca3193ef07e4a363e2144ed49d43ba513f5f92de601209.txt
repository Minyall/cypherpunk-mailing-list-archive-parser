Tim, being more cynical than I am, is probably correct :-)
But still, we should take advantage of it when we can;
never miss a chance to use government statistics in ways that
annoy their originators....

Denning's previous big-publicity study was the interim report on
Clipper security (saying Skipjack was apparently quite strong),
which achieved its propaganda goals; the final report, which was supposed
to address the whole Clipper system, including the on-chip parts
and the key escrow process in the NSA/Mykotronix vault, was never
released, which I consider to be a substantial piece of intellectual
dishonesty.
