No. But close. Joichi Ito's keyboard is having that stuck key problem
again. What he meant to type was:

Which explains why that Japanese-produced RSA chip was suddenly withdrawn
from the market shortly after Jim Bidzos held it up in fron of Congress as
an example of how foolish the U.S. export laws are. The Japanese stooges
were ordered by their masters in Washington to conform to U.S. policy.
