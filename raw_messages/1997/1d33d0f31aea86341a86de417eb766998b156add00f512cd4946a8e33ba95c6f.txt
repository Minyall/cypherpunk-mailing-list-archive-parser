I take your point insofar as "NETCenter" and crypto, but you repeat a
common misperception. Although the Net is tough to control, and it is a
distributed system of networks, there are -- of course -- a number of
centralized process. The Domain Name System is completely hierarchical.
Moreover, Jon Postel of IANA represents the Net's central authority due to:
1. the IP number allocations, 2. the DNS "root", and 3. the technical
standards, such as port numbers, etc. Unless there was a certain degree of
centralized control, in an engineering perspective, the Net "Would Not
Work." That's the fact, Jack -- n'est-ce pas? Yes, it is *possible* to do
away with these centralized functions, and this is happening now, in a very
non-public way.
