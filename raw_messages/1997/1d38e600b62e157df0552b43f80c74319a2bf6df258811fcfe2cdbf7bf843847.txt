The all-time master was Rudolph Wanderone (sp?), a.k.a.
Minnesota Fats.  There was an article on him that told how he
cleaned the pool champ in Atlantic City circa 1960.

In later years, he played Mosconi on TV several times, and had
quite a few people convinced he wasn't a very good player, at
least "not as good as" Mosconi.  The movie Color Of Money shows
what this meant, and just how unprepared the public is to believe
that someone like Fats could really be the best.  Kinda like
Tom Wolfe and the pirates thing.
