I don`t think we even want to get into the issue of ISPs being involved 
in hashcash or any other form of postage, a better system is a simple 
user<->user model where the users mail reader can be configured to filter 
email without hashcash, procmail scripts to do this wouldn`t be hard 
either I imagine (disclaimer: I`m no procmail expert, and this may be 
entirely wrong).

Any form of ISP censorship, bouncing or filtering is a bad move.
