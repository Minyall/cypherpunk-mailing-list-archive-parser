If the point of these schemes is to filter content (*), there is no
reason why they have to be implemented for the entire list.  They
can always be converted to a tag on the message which readers can
use, but are not required to.

I'm sure Tim would not object to any scheme implemented in this way.
(So sure, in fact, that I will give him a dollar if he does object. ;-)

(* If the point is to stop spam attacks, then they do have to affect
the entire list.)
