 They do however need a formal letter from some LEA person to the
postmaster stating that your mail is of interest. Generally the USPS
guys are pretty specific on those counts; they have been burned in the
past. Further, if you should happen to be friendly with your
postmaster or one of your postal persons (the joys of living in a
small town) there is little to keep them from telling you that someone
is watching your mail; except of course; the displeasure of the LEA,
but its not covered by any laws, since they don't have a warrant. Of
course if you are really doing something nasty and illegal  being
anything more than 'the guy in Box 213' to your postmaster might have
its downsides.
