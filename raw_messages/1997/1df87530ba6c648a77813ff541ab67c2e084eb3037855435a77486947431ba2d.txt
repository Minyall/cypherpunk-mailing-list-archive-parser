>    WASHINGTON (AllPolitics, Nov. 5) -- A bill to reform the Internal
>    Revenue Service skated through the House of Representatives today on
>    an overwhelming 426-4 vote.
>    
>    The measure picked up the support of Democrats after its sponsors made
>    key changes that drew the approval of the Clinton Administration.
>    
>    The most significant change would preserve the president's power to
>    appoint the IRS commissioner. The original version of the bill would
>    have transferred that duty to an independent board.
>    
>    The bill's centerpiece is an 11-member board made up mostly of private
>    citizens that would oversee the IRS and help manage its long-term
>    projects.
>    
>    Bill sponsor Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said the measure marked "the first
>    time in 45 years that we have attempted as a Congress to enact
>    fundamental reform."
