:) That's an illustration that it is easy to post things that look
autogenerated, but are not.

On the other hand, it is possible to autogenerate things that look
non-trivial to a novice.

One gentleman from a third-rate educational institution is known
for sending tons of lisp-generated articles to one of the moderated
newsgroups, just to annoy moderators. They do look like they are created
by someone with a rudiment of inteligence.
