Well, remember the reason we did this:  to get the code out of the US in a
way that the government couldn't screw with at all.  Readable text is
clearly a publication, and thus unrestrictable.  There is a chance,
however small, that gzip (and tarring I'd assume) the tree and then
putting it in as text (or bar-coding it) would cloud the issue some.
(Isn't part of this to do with human-readable as opposed to machien
readable?)

Besides, this way it's easier to spot the errors simply by comparing, with
bar-codes and such you'd never ever be able to look at the errors yourself
and find them.
