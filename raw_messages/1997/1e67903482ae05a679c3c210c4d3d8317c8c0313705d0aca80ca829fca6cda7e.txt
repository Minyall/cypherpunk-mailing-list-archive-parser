But then you'll get spam on the list. Most of the spam I get is from
mailing lists.

If it's $.02 to send a mail to 10000 cypherpunks, then spammers won't
hesitate to send it. If it's $.02 * 10000 ($200) then only rich people
(like tcmay) will post here. The only solution I see is moderation and
censorship, and that can be (and has been) done without e-postage.

Exactly how do you think that e-postage would decrease spam on mailing
lists?
