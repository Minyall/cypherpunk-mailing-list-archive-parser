I don`t really want to get into this discussion/flame war too deeply 
but I will post on this thread once...

Any of the events described above are completely determined by the 
initial conditions of the system, just because a system is too 
complex for us to measure its initial conditions in enough detail 
does not mean it is random, it simply means we see it as random. 
Hence a market`s behaviour is labeled chaotic, because it appears 
random. It is, however, completely deterministic however we cannot 
know the initial conditions because they are too complicated. 

End of chat, chaotic behaviour is NOT random, it simply appears so 
unless one can accurately measure the intial conditions.
