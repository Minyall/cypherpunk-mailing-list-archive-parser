And it was even settled reasonably, and without setting new bad UK case law.

(For those who don't remember the case, the Shetland News and 
Shetland Times are Scottish newspapers with web pages.  
The News was linking from its page to some of the Times's stories 
without pointing out that the stories were in their competitor's paper,
and the Times sued them.  In the settlement they agree that the
News may link to the Times's pages, and that they'll only do so
with visible indications that they're doing so.)
				Thanks!
