I think that what Nobuku described is not a private key system (because
keys cannot be reused), but rather an approach to generating one time 
pads.

Whether something that is interesting to me should also be interesting to
you is open to question.

I think that one more good way of doing it would not hurt.

So what if he reinvents something? Most of what high school and undergrad 
students do is learning and reinventing ideas that are already known. That
does not make study less exciting.

The interesting question that Nobuku can answer is how he generates the
key from the input.
