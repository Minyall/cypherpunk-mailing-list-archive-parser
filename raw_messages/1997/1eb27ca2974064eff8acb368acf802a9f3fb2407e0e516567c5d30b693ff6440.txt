A recent publication "The Sovereign Individual"('97) discusses many of the issues discussed on Cypherpunks. The authors, James Dale Davidson and Lord William Rees-Mogg, sketch the likely totalitarian  scenarios that will emerge in the coming years. Just as we see every day in the media, they predict that we ain't seen nothing yet when it comes to the attempts to regulate cyberspace, cryptography,  and the content of online information. Portraying cellular phone triangulation as a public health concern, etc.,  are just the beginning. 
The authors also  paint a bleak picture for blanc's  'True Believer' types. They will continue to be milked "as a farmer milks his cows" while those with  techno-savvy and  'extranational' savoir faire will  grow wings and take their wealth and marketable skills to other jurisdictions where predatory taxmen and arbitrary civil forfeiture laws don't exist. 
The book is sort of Toffleresque, but written better and full of historical parallels that help the reader to understand social upheavals of the past and  how the demise of failing contemporary institutions are likely to affect Joe windowz95. 
Example: chapter 4- "The Last Days of Politics: Parallels Betwen the Senile Decline of the Holy Mother Church and the Nanny State".
