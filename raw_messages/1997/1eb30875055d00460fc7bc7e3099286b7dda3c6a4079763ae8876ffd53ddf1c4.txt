   It is in place. It feeds from cypherpunks@algebra.com. Bryan Reece 
   reece@taz.nceye.net runs the posting bot. taz.nceye.net is an open
   newsserver offering several cypherpunks newsgroups.

   I am not yet sure if taz is now a part of the mainstream usenet, that 
   is, it may not be connected to the Big USENET.

It receives some Big Usenet groups, but only for local users.
alt.cypherpunks is open, but there will be long delays, on the
order of a day, for articles there (unless someone better connected to
Usenet wants to feed me alt.cypherpunks.*---any volunteers?).
