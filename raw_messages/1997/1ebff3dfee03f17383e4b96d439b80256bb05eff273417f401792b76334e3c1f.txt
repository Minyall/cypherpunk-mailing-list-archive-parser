 no he is not .... he is repeating what we all see in the grocery store 
checkout lines and in the gutters with regularity ... even here in 
Vermonte where self-sufficiency is a way of life we see third, fourth, 
and fifth generation welfare families. I literally just came from picking 
up groceries in a Grand Union in Essex Junction (biiiggg suburb of 
Burlington, also home of a big IBM plant) the lady in fromt of me was 
playing the food stamp game ... there was more junk in that basket along 
with the beer. I teach 'at risk' students in a high school near here and 
I am dealing with kids who have some potential to do something with 
themselves and have no inclination to try. I have a kid who is definitely 
got the brains to go to college to do something with himself whose main 
aim in life right now was figuring out how to forge the slip for free 
school lunches for him and his sister so he can pocket the lunch money 
from his parents ... yeah, I know, send him into politics!
