But the changes to add GAK/GMR/CMR to PGP (or any other crypto product
that permits multiple recipients) are close to trivial.  Don't be fooled
into thinking that if PGP takes this "feature" out (can't be a bug --
it's documented :) that that will make it a lot harder to add that
feature back in once the appropriate laws are passed.

Still, in retrospect, PGP's engineers and scientists should have thought
about all the security implications of CMR -- they might have
implemented CDR to begin with.
