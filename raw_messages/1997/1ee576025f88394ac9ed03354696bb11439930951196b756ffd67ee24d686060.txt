Hi 



If you follow business journals you may have heard about a new  phone 
company that has patent pending technology that will revolutionize   
the the way we communicate.

They are using technology that allows us to use our existing phones 
in a manner similar to the the way we communicate on the internet 
now.  This is causing the long distance rates to tumble to low prices 
that have been unheard of  before this.

What's more this new technology will eventually allow us to offer an 
unlimited usage low flat rate plan as well as being able to have up 
to 8 phones, computers or fax machines all working off of one phone 
line at the same time.  All this without having to purchase any new 
phones or equipment.

This technology is so advanced that the Richard Marriott family of 
Marriot Hotels has invested 74 Million Dollars in the company for 
just a 38% interest in the company. 

If you would like more information on the service or business opportunity
with this new company just send an e-mail to" mailto:bob17@bigfoot.com" 
with the words"the rumors are true" and I will send you information 
right away.

Sincerely,
Bob
