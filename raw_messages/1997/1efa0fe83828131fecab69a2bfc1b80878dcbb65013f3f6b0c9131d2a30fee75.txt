Yeah, you're missing that Ian's a Canadian, not subject to US laws when
he's not in US territory, unlike Rivest (but not unlike Shamir.)
Taking working papers with him might be an export problem, but 
taking ideas in his head isn't, and when he's at home, he can work,
subject to Canadian limits on writing, publishing, and internetting crypto.
If he wants to sell products based on his crypto work,
there may be student visa issues involved, but there's a Canadian corporation
that can take care of some of those problems for him.
