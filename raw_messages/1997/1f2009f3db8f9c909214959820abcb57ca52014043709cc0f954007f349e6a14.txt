In Minneapolis and Anchorage (the two cities of which I have knowledge)
mail carriers have a key that opens not only apartment-style mailboxes,
but little boxes on the outside of apartment buildings that hold a key
to the building's lobby.  Snag one of those keys and a large portion of
the city opens its doors to you.  (some buildings have further locked
doors beyond the mailbox lobby to counter this threat)
