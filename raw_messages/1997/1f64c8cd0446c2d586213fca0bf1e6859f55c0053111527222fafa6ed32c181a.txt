I guess suggestions such as the one above prove that CP is still attracting 
newbies. That's a good thing. Now if they only read the FAQ.

The patents for DH (which cover the public domain ElGamal) expire this
Fall. By using SHA-1/ElGamal, PGP is moving to a technology that will soon
no longer require paying large sums of money to RSA for the use of a
one-line mathematical formula. This is *a good thing*.
