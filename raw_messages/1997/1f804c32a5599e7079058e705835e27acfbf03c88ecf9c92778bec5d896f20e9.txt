For those who are following the CPAC/Sewer frivolities, there is now
a parody of Mike Paladino's "Sewer Site" at...

         http://www.darktimes.com/thewer/

This was apparently done by "Stereotype", the editor of Darktimes
magazine, whom Paladino has been libeling for the past several weeks
on the real Sewer Site.
