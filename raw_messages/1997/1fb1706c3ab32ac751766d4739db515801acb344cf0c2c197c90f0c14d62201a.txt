The Anti-UFO movement has replaced (or is along side of) the
anti-evolutionary movement.  It is Robertson's and his ilk's belief that
UFO's are anti-Christian, i.e., Satan's plot to disprove biblical teachings
- specifically, if there is life on other worlds, then the Bible is
incorrect in that man was created in God's image since Vulcans, Klingons,
and whom/whatever would also have to be added as being created in God's image.
