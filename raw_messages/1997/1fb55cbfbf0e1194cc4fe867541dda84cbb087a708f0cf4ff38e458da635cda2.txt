You were given recommendations for Schneier's book. If you discount those
recommendations because of the opinion of one disgruntled reader, this is
your problem.

Schneier is a reasonable overview, with more of an emphasis on currently
coded algorithms than some of the more academic treatments have.  The
academic treatments are widely available, too, from amazon.com and other
bookstores.  They tend to be a decade or more old, and obviously lack
discussion of recent stuff. Denning, Meyer and Matyas, Brassard, etc. The
compendium of crypto articles edited by Gus Simmons is also pretty good.

It depends on one's interest. There are specialized number theory books,
manuals on how to use PGP (worthless, in my view, for various reasons), and
even books on digital cash.

But listen to what several people said about Schneier. Even if Vulis
dislikes it, it's still almost an "essential" book. And anyone at all
interested in crypto will likely end up with a bunch of books.
