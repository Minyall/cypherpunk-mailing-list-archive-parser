No, you die on your 30th birthday, when you ride the carrousel.

The insurance plan would only work if there was a significantly less than 
one-in-a-million chance of having the disease. Otherwise, the cost will 
be more than one dollar. The rates would be lower if you buy your policy 
well in advance, since the disease never strikes before you are 30 - 
there's money to be made on holding your premium, and you jsut might die 
of something else before requiring treatment.

As Tim pointed out, however, if you can be tested prior to obtaining the
insurance, without admitting to it, you would not obtain the insurance
unless the test showed that you had the disease. The price of the policy
would therefore be $1,000,000 or so, with minor adjustments.
