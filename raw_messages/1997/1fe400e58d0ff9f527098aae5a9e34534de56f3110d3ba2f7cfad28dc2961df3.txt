Nobuki Nakatuji, though lesser known, is like Monty Cantsin and 
Luther Blissett, well-burnished pseudonyms used by wads of 
artistes who believe them to be more artful than hoary Anonymous. 
Globalists are producing variations of nom-de-plumes to scribe a 
message to the clued - duh, in Imperialist Yanklish.

Reputation capital and persistent identity convince only the
duh-speakers who believe insider secrets, insider lies of hot IPOs, 
and MISTY/RSA chips ostensibly made in JP and NDA-ed to the 
gullible by pseudo-chipper fab-lab MD-stingmasters.
