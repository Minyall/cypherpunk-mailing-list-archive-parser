     Okay, so I'm a UNIX-head; I forgot about the Macs (a dangerous
thing to do, given the ferocity of their supporters).  If the
government were to adopt my suggestion, two major results would be:

     - The third party market for Linux software would grow rapidly
       and enormously.
     - The government's software budget would be reduced dramatically.

I consider both of these to be Good Things (tm).  The government
wouldn't be forcing anything at the point of a gun, they'd simply be
making a financially responsible vendor selection (hey, there's a
first time for everything).  Our tax dollars shouldn't be wasted on
substandard software when superior, cheaper alternatives exist.
