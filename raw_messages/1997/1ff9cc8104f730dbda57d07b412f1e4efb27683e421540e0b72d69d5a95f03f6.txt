Building in Big Brother
By Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)
  
    Hoover despised Martin Luther King, Jr. -- branding him an
   "obsessive degenerate" -- and once sent him an anonymous letter,
using
   information gathered through illegal surveillance, to encourage the
   depressed civil rights leader to commit suicide. Hoover's legacy?
   Having the FBI headquarters bear his name today.

Zooko. Maybe the agent just asks them to commit suicide.
