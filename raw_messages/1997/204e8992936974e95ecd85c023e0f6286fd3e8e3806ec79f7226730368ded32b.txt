This is too slow upstream for future technology needs.  I'll admit that the

upstream is almost as fast as a 2B+D ISDN setup, but research that I've
done suggest that 384kb is necessary for VHS quality realtime video.

So Nortel will deliver enough downstream bandwith for you to be a video
consumer, but not a provider.  How typical.

I'll wait for xDSL, thank you.
