No, I don't want censored anything. "Cypher punks" have degenerated into
a moderated forum where those who dare criticize His Royal Majesty John
the Cocksucker and his court are forcibly unsubscribed, while all sorts
of vile insults directed at John's many "enemies" are encouraged.

Of course John is welcome to do what he likes with his private mailing list.
Neither he nor his EFF (effeminate faggot foundation) have any credibility.
