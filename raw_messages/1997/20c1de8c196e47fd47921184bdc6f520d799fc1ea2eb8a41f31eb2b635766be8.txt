>>Jewish English or "Hebonics"
>>
>>The Encino School Board has declared Jewish English a second 
language.
>>Backers of the move say the district is the first in the nation to
>>recognize Hebonics as the language of many of American Jews.  Here 
are
>>some descriptions of the characteristics of the language, and 
samples
>>of phrases in standard English and Jewish English.
>>
>>Samples of Pronunciation Characteristics
>>
>>Jewish English or "Hebonics" hardens consonants at the ends of 
words.
>>
>>Thus, "hand" becomes "handt."
>>
>>The letter "W" is always pronounced as if it were a "V".  Thus
>>"walking" becomes "valking"
>>
>>"R" sounds are transformed to a guttural utterance that is 
virtually
>>impossible to spell in English.  It is "ghraining", "algheady"
>>
>>
>>Samples of Idiomatic Characteristics:
>>
>>Questions are always answered with questions:
>>   Question: "How do you feel?"
>>   Hebonics response: "How should I feel?"
>>
>>The subject is often placed at the end of a sentence after a 
pronoun
>>has been used at the beginning:  "She dances beautifully, that girl.
"
>>
>>The sarcastic repetition of words by adding "sh" to the front is 
used
>>for emphasis.
>>
>>  mountains becomes "shmountains"
>>  turtle becomes "shmurtle"
>>
>>
>>Sample Usage Comparisons:
>>
>> Standard English Phrase             Hebonics Phrase
>>
>> "He walks slow"        -      "Like a fly in the ointment he 
walks"
>>
>> "You're sexy"          -      (unknown concept)
>>
>>"Sorry, I do not know   -      "What do I look like, a clock?"
>> the time"
>>
>> "I hope things turn    -      "You should BE so lucky"
>> out for the best"
>>
>>"Anything can happen"    -     "It is never so bad, it can't get 
worse"
