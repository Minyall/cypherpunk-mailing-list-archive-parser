The trick is:

1. don't go overboard with security.  For example, I sometimes
use PGP keys without passphrases.  This is secure _enough_ for
my more innocuous messages, and it is a lot more convenient.

2. get a scriptable/configurable e-mail agent which you can
train (or have me or some cypherpunk train) to do PGP for you 
automagically.
