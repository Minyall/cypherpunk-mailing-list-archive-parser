Another point on all this that was made by Matt Blaze at the RSA
conference (and that I have been making to all my friends) is that Crypto
is basically a "solved" problem. The government's efforts to impose
GAK is in effect transposing a "solved" problem into an "unsolved"
problem - due to the inherent problems with any conceivable
GAK "solution". I thought this was a very good case against GAK.
