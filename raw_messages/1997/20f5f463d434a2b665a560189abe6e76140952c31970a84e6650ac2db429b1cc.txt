This is back to where we were four and a half years ago, when Clipper was
dropped on us. "How do we educate the users?"

Trust me, it's a hopeless task. We don't have the advertising budgets, the
staff for education, etc.

And it ain't our responsibility to "save" the sheeple.

What we _can_ do is prepare for a long guerilla war with the bastards. 80%
of the population will willingly trade away their rights ("what have I got
to hide?") for more perceived security. Ben Franklin saw this 230 years ago.

It's war. Too late for a public relations campaign so that some future
Congress will slightly relax their laws.


And in a war, gotta break some eggs.

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
