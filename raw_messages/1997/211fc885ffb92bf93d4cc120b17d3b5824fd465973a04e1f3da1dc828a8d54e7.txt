Surrender to whom? To those that had fired upon their church when first 
approaching? Remember, the ATF fired *first*. [The ATF claimed they 
opened fire when they were shot at through the wooden front door from inside 
the church. The front door was made of solid steel. After burning all the 
worshippers inside, the ATF removed the front door and stored it in an 
evidence room. The door is listed on the evidence log. That's the last 
time anyone other than the feds has seen the door. When the survivers 
wanted to present the door in court to prove that the only bullet holes 
were from shots fired from the outside (the ATF), the door had vanished 
into thin air. To this day, the steel door can not be found.]
