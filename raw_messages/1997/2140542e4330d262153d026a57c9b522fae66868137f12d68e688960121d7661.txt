I was so inspired by this guy that I had the source to sendmail tattooed on
my back and the source to emacs tattooed on my left thigh. I then figured
out I missed the point, this was supposed to be a political statement, so I
had the entire contents of the nambla web site tattooed on my left forearm.
Dont worry about mirroring it, if anyone wants to know whats on the namble
site they can visit me in jail where I am currently getting a crash course
in man-boy love.
