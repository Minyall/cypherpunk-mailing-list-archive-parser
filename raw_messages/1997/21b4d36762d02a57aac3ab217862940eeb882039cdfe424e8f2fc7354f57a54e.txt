I should have a new node up shorly.

This will be a cypherpunks-digest node.

I plan on taking input from the 3 current nodes, remove any duplicates and
then send out 1 or 2 digest messages a day (depending on volume).

I will be working this weekend on the digest code, hopfully I can have
things up and running sometime next week depending on how much time "real"
work takes up.

Once I have the digest list set-up I can start posting some statistics on
the "quality of service" on the various lists.

I do not plan on filtering any traffic with the exception of "denial of
service" attacks (100 ascii art messages, ...). I may not have to even do
this if the other lists already take care of this.

As soon as I have more info I will post it to the list.

PS: What does everyone think of CC: alt.cypherpunks with the digest?


Thanks,
