Adam,

Have you considered the logistical nightmare that this would cause?? I can
see that you are unaware of the precarious state the current PGP Public
Key Server Network is in. Right now it is getting by but this increase in
load would bring it all to a screeching halt. There have been suggestions
of moving key distributution to the DNS but I seriously doubt even it
would handle the traffic.

Also what happens to the "web of trust" in such a system of high key
turnover?

Exactly how much added security is provided by all of this?? While Forward
security via DH "may" be more secure is the added expense of implementing
such a system justified?? We all could switch to using OTP's for maximum
security but I doubt that few if any would justify the cost of such a
system.

PS: current PGP key format does have a field for key expiration. Until 5.0
it was only used in the Viacrypt version.
