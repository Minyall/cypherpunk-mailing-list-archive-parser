What's next, the death penalty for unregistered crypto?

No doubt Swinestein plans to introduce her own version of this in Amerika.

#    TAIPEI, Nov 24 (AFP) - Taiwan brought in new heavy penalties
# Monday to curb illegal firearm possession in an effort to tackle a
# rising crime wave here.
#    Under an amended law effective from Monday anyone caught
# manufacturing, selling or transporting illegal firearms faces the
# death penalty. Previously the law stipulated a maximum penalty of
# seven years jail.
#    The move comes just five days after the island's most wanted
# fugitive gave himself up to police.
#    "The amened law is expected to emerge as a deterrent force to
# effectively keep at bay illegal holding of firearms," President Lee
# Teng-hui said.
#    In the past, nearly 80 percent of offenders under the law faced
# only 18 months jail and were often released on parole after serving
# a third of their sentence, official statistics show.
