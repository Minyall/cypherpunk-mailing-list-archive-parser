First, PGPsdk has been released:

	http://www.pgp.com/sdk/

The bad news:  the licensing fees are so high that there will be no
freeware or shareware applications using it.  Here's an example of the
licensing:

License Plan #1

                            Authentication, Encryption/Decryption,
                            PGP/MIME, Key Management:  $25,000 advance on
royalties + 2% of product revenues (minimum $1 per client and $35 per
server) 

Add Certificate Server Integration: 
                                          $5,000 advance on royalties 

Support/Upgrades 
                            (includes email support by a trained
                            developer support technician) 
                            $1,500 per year + 15% of royalty payments 


Oh well, back to hacking an interface to PGPtray.
