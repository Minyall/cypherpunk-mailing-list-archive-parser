I would also recommend the classic Heinlein work,
"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress".  As an example of self-organizing
anarchy/panarchy and general libertarian views it has no equal in
fiction.  At this point Heinlein was still at the top of his game.

Very enjoyable and thought provoking read.

Of course, most of you have probably already read it.

I suppose somebody will start talking about Rand here, but I found
her writing a little too strident.
