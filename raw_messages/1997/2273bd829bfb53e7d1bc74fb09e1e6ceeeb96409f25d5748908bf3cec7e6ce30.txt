This is a problem.

How do you get rid of the illegals without infringing on the rights of the
citizens?

FWIW I have been strongly against the various laws and inititives
mandating ID for the citizen units especially the push for a national ID.
Curtailing the rights of the citizens to solve a "problem" has never been
a proper approach as it leads to invented "problems" for the sole purpose
of enacting the "solution".

IMNSHO think that the various boarder states should put the National Guard
on the boarder to keep them out. Still doesn't resolve the problem of the
ones that are already here.
