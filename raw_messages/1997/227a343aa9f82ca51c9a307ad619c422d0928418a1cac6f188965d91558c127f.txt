Electronic Frontiers Georgia has set up a key repository for PGP type keys.  
This is part of a pilot project based on Georgia's New Digital Signature Law.  
We are still beta testing the keyserver, and invite people to try it out.  The 
results of our testing will be presented at the Digital Signature Task Force 
meeting on June 24th.

To access the keyserver, change your PGP5.0 preferences to point to

    keys.efga.org

This is a closed keyserver, in that keys do not replicate to non EFGA 
keyservers.  If this model is successful, this will help move Georgia to a 
position of being pro-strong encryption.

Right now the server may only accept keys through the PGPkeys interface.  We 
appreciate comments from experienced PGP users.  Comments may be sent to 
myself, or to keymaster@efga.org

Thanks,
