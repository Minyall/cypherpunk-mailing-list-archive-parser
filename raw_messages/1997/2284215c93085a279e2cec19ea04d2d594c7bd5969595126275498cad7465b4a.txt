We aren't talking about it much.  We've released some information to
the press and posted a release on our web site.

This attack can be used to grab any file from the user's hard drive,
provided you know the file name and path.  It exploits a bug in the
way forms are handled.  You can guard against this attack by turning
on the warning dialog for submitting a form over an insecure connection.

We have a fix which we are testing now, and we'll have it out early next
week for 4.0.  A fix for 3.x will follow once we have 4.0 fixed.
