I've been trying to get a copy of the Crypto CD using the ISBN
number he used to have listed on his web page. However, every
bookstore I've checked with can find no reference to it. Has
anyone on the list gotten it via this method? I looked for
Pini's web page but it appears to be gone. Anyone know
about sources for the CD?

Thanks
