Shure you can. The operator offers a simple service, resend email
anonymously. If the result of that email is the anon user bringing hardship
on the remailer cancel their account. If they do it again, cancel it again.
Such is the woes of a commercial remailer. Outside of that, if they don't
like the fact that I won't do other things for them when they are anonymous
that is too bad.

Like I said, I offer specific services with specific goals for a specific
fee. If the results are not what you wanted, too bad. You want my other
services then you'll have to give up the anonymity because I need a certain
level of security that dealing with anonymous customers simply can't provide.
I would operate a commercial remailer, I would limit my services to keeping
the remailer up and the accounts valid so long as the money flowed in from
the users, period. I don't do dedicated lines, security audits, development,
etc. to anonymous customers.
