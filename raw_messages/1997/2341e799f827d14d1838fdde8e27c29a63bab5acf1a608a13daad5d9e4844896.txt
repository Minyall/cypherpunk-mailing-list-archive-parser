Dimitri,

Do you think you could get a copy of the list for publication? Sounds
like a most controversial blackballer. Especially if it includes the
names of the assholes who started it, keep it up to date and use it
to win by smearing whoever they can't beat openly.


>By the way, someone I know in real life claims that they've seen the "Silicon
>Valley don't hire list" and I really am on it. :-)
