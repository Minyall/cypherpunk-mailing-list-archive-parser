Good point, and note that there are many other worlds within the US
besides the LOOD stud-employer-has-manifest-destiny-control 
version.

But it is good marketing to sell fearful business owners gadgets
and to perpetuate their sense of knowing what's going on behind
their backs, as with frightened pols, spies, cops, parents and 
straights, leaky prophylactics supplemented with arms to bear 
when the hints of betrayal and inadequacy become unbearable. 

Not that the gadgets and arms work when you can't ID or crosshair 
the elusive backalley cats aprowl.

Same goes for workers and youngsters who think the bosses and
oldsters are duncemunge: WSJ, Dilbert and Phrack are funnies to 
avoid the admitting the deeper complicity of secret crossovers by
your favorite peer group into the opposing camps, political, economic, 
legal, scientific, not to say no longer secure national and sexual borders.

LOOD = Long Out Of Date
