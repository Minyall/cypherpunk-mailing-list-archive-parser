Yes. That was the Kubota/Pickens case. My lawyer represented the US
side. He lost. That doesn't mean it wasn't worth trying.

Anyway, I responded to your message for the benefit of the other members
of the list.

Go ahead and flame away Vulis. Being called a moron by you is a
compliment. ;-P Your reputation is so low that I don't care what you say
about me or what your think for that matter.

Administrative note: This will probably be the last Vulis message I will
ever respond to or refer to.
