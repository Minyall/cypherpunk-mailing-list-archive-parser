The Islamic party didn't start killing off foreigners until the
French and other Westerners supported the generals who overthrew them.
It's funny how a modern liberal democracy like the US will
go to war and kill 6000 people in Panama just because one of their
ex-employees is embarassing them by not leaving the Presidency after
his term is up ("We had to protect democracy"), but when a military
junta takes over from a non-pro-CIA government, they support the military.
