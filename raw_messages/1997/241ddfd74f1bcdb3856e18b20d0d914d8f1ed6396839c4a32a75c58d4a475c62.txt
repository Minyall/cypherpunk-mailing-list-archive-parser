What if somebody wanted to publish the source code of an encryption
program in book form, but make the book dowloadable freely from an ftp site
using postscript or PDF format. Surely, the government will be
hard pressed to argue the difference between paper media and electronic
media here, since the files downloaded cannot be used to encrypt
or decrypt data, without somebody first typing in the source.

Maybe MIT or PGP should convert at least part of the PGP book
into postscript and then request Commerce Department clearance to
make it publically available. That should make for a nice court battle.

If somebody argues that sophisticated programs can extract the text out of
postscript files, what about providing JPEG images of pages of the book?
