CyberSitter now blocks part of the CSE URL ("/spoofcentral/"), if I
remember properly. Of course it also blocks any other site that has the
word "spoofcentral" as part of the URL. Talk about shotgun-style
approaches.

CyberPatrol's "boa" blocking is abbreviated. I think the cgi script is
used for our bulletin board discussion areas, usually devoted to such
purient topics as the First Pooch.

They already tried. See:

                          To Milburn's mind, our act of revealing the
truth
                     about his company's product was, literally, criminal.
In
                     August, he told us that he had asked the U.S.
Department
                     of Justice to launch a criminal investigation into
the
                     publication of our article. He was particularly upset
with
                     one paragraph that included a fragment of his
database
                     demonstrating that CyberSitter expressly bans info
about
                     gay society and culture. 

                         He wrote: "Your willful reverse engineering and
                     subsequent publishing of copyrighted source code is a
                     clear violation of US Copyright law. While we would
                     easily prevail in a civil court in seeking damages...
we will
                     seek felony criminal prosecution under 17 USCS sect
                     503(a) of the Copyright Act, and are preparing
                     documentation to submit with the criminal complaint
to
                     FBI (sic)."
