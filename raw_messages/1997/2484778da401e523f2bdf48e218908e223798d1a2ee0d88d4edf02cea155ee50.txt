Dear Randall

I saw your post on the cypherpunks list debunking the
forgery of my good friend Phill Zimmerman. As you are
no doubt aware my Deputy Director of the NSA retired
recently and I've decided that Barbie is no longer suitable
following certain uncomplimentary remarks she made
after a fireside shagging^H^H^H^Hchat we had last night.
I am therefore looking for a supersluth to fill this
challenging position. If you would be interested in
taking the bit between your teeth, so to speak, please
email me and we'll do lunch.
