  I noticed that when my nephews buy video games, the first ones they
check out are the ones plastered with the 'protective' ratings-symbols
that proclaim that the game is the 'baddest of the bad' in terms of
violence, etc.
  Thanks to the violence-rating system, they no longer have to waste
time checking out 'dweeb' programs that contain absolutely no blood
and gore.
