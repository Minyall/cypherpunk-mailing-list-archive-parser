Well with my M ...er AR15, yeah AR15, I have sloped it through all kinds
of crap in the field with little trouble. While I have used the A2 models
I have not done extensive field testing with it. The increase in barrel
length seems to be a plus but I have concerns with the change in design of
the sight adjustments and how well they hold up under adverse conditions.
Myself I have never liked scopes on a field weapon, too much of a hassle
better reserved for hunting/snipping.

Never had any serious jamming problems with the exception of using blanks.
Nasty things, never could get through a clip without a jam. Thank god I
never have to use those things anymore, now if only someone could come up
with a "clean" tracer round. :)
