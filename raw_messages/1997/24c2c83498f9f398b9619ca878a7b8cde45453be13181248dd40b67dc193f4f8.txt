>From News of the Weird:
* The San Jose Mercury News reported in March on some working
models of the Defense Department's tiny flying machines ("micro
air vehicles"), no larger than birds, including one helicopter that
could fit inside a peanut shell, that are suited for tasks such as
locating hostages in occupied buildings, sniffing out poisonous
chemicals, and finding enemy snipers.  Each micro air vehicle
carries cameras, sensors, transmitters, and antennas.
