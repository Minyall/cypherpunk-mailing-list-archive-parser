The evolutionary definition of "competent" is "propagate your genetic 
material".  A rough corollary is that those who raise the most children 
to child-bearing age are the most competent.  In practice it seems to 
be the case, however, that intelligence and "evolutionary competence" 
are negatively correlated.  As I am sure you are aware, there are all 
kinds of evolutionary strategies...

I think this goes a little deeper, in fact.  The kind of intelligence
that leads to high technical achievement is not even necessarily a
kind of intelligence that favors survival under difficult situations. 
If society dissolves it is my belief that computer geeks, like us, are
not the ones that will be most likely to survive....
