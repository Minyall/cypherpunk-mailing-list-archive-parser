I think the current level of remailer difficulty is just fine, thank-you. 

There is nothing inherently wrong in requiring a partial clue in order to
use a remailer successfully.  Services that the inbred can use too easily
generally get nuked due to excessive public attention.  Mailmasher strikes
me as one recent obvious example. 

For technology to have a reasonable lifetime, it must have functionality
somewhere in between impossible to use, and "click here to threaten the
life of the president."
