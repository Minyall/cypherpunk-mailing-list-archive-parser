It seems like something which has been blown out of all proportion by a 
few over-zealous pinko-liberal members of the list who support free 
speech right upto the point where someone says something which upsets 
them, then they run crying to mommy or hide under the bed. 
Racist comments to me would be those that generalised the opinion to all 
Japanese, Tim insulted one particular person. If you are going to become
oversensitive about such comments the cypherpunks list is probably the
worst place to be.

No, because most people would misinterpret it in the same way you, and 
some other list members have, if I could be assured they would understand 
it as a light hearted mild insult rather than a racist remark I would 
have no problem saying it in those circumstances.

Correction: I don`t make a living as a consultant, it`s merely a 
part-time bit of cash on the side thing, but, personal circumstances 
aside, were I a full time consultant, doing it for a living, I don`t see 
how it would affect my opinion as to what constitutes a serious racist 
comment.

Most customers are too clueless to be reading such a list and won`t know 
what he said, that aside I don`t see the relevance.

I don`t shy away from saying what I think for financial reasons (at least 
not in most cases, that said I wouldn`t call my employer a 
nigger/wop/greezer/kike if I thought it would cost me my job.
