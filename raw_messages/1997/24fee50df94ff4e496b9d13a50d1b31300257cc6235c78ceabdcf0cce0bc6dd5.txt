it's amazing. in all the blathering by senators etc. over these
crypto bills (Feinstein, Freeh etc.), 
has *anyone* raised the possibility on the record
that the key recovery is UNCONSTITUTIONAL? 

maybe I'm not following closely enough, but I haven't seen a *single* 
reference. that's really eerie. can't we get a *single* 
senator to bring up that issue?
