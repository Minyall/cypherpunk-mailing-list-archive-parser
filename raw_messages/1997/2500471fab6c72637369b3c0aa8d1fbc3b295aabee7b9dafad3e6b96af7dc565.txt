  I agree. That's why I like my solution to finding my stolen car
better. A cellphone, GPS, and a little bit of glue electronics. If my
car is stolen, I call the cellphonein the trunk (or inside body panel,
etc.) enter my secret code and it reads out the current locaiton from
the GPS until I hang up on it.
