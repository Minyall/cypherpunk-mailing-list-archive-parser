Man!  Talk about burning bandwidth on politics 101.  The problem
is that you're both stuck using Orwellian newspeak for political
classification.  If people only have a single dimension to 
classify political beliefs then there can't be very many
beliefs.

Multidimensional political beliefs systems don't hash into the
one dimensional left/right axis very well.   The collision
rate is too high.

For a somewhat better map at least check out the Nolan chart.
