Yes - is this mailing list being censored by Sandy yet?

You've done many good things Kelly.

But now you advocate censorship. If you don't want to listen to
Dale, it's your private choice (and your loss).  But you want to impose
your choice on others.  You don't want me to be able to listen to Dale or
Dale to be able to listen to me, even when it's out of your hearing.
You want Ray Arachelanian to be able to post lies about people and his
victims to be unable to refute his libel in the same forum.

I'm surprised and disappointed and I urge you to reconsider your position.

And that's really a pity.

You mean your kelly@netcom.com lifetime account?
