While we do need a shorter name and I don't really care what name is used
to describe it, I do think somebody needs to figure out exactly what "it"
is.  Since I don't know what Eric Hughes was talking about at DEFCON IV, I
can't know whether his "it" is the same thing I'm talking about.
Especially since everybody else I've seen talking about "it" seems to leave
out what I think is the most important part -- value added.

So far I have yet to see anyone write a clear and concise article
describing the economic system we've been discussing.  I've tried, but to
date I haven't had the time.  I'm too busy trying to steer my business in
that directon to write about it.

I leave as an exercise for everyone, describe the difference between a
recursive geodesic auction market and a chain letter or a multi-level
marketing scheme (which I might add are rampant on the net).  What prevents
the latter from being a subset of the former?
