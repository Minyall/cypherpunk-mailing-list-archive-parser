	GIVE ME A 'B'!		"BS!"
	GIVE ME AN 'I'!		"AYE!"
	GIVE ME AN 'L'!		"HELL!"
	GIVE ME AN 'L'!		"HELL!"

	WHAT'S THAT SPELL!	"GATES!"
	WHAT'S THAT SPELL!	"MICROSOFT!"
	WHAT'S THAT SPELL!	"NEW WINDOWS ORDERS!"

 "Well, come on all you big strong persons,
  Uncle Bill is really hurtin',
  Getting lynched in old DC,
  $weet Capital of Liberty,
    So put down Windows and roll in the muck,
    We're gonna yell 'MicroSoft Sucks!'"

 "And it's one, two three, what are we whining for?   
  Don't ask me, I don't give a shit,
  Next stop is JavaScript.
    And it's five, six, seven, open up on Billy Gates,
    Ain't got time to learn command-line,
    Whoppee, we're going to point-and-click!"

DC is a natural site for the WebWorld 1.0 conference, since it is 
obvious from the political rhetoric coming from that direction that
DC is where the _good_ drugs are.
What was the name of the conference, again? "Razing Micro$oft?"
