Maybe Ian Goldberg would be kind enough to explain?  Messages sent to
ecash-remailer@cypherpunks.ca with payment pop out at anon.efga.org.
That's all I know.

Personally, I would like to see the message come from the
"ecash-remailer".  My guess is that people who pay 25 cents will write
more interesting messages.

Also, it (or a remailer after it) seems to be eating subject lines,
which is less than ideal.
