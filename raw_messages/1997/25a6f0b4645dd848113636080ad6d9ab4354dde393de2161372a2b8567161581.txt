I obviously agree with Colin on this. My communications, writings, and
diaries are *mine*.

I have no idea who this "Joe Shea" is, but he seems ignorant of basic
concepts of life in a free society. Suggesting "better" holders of keys is
beside the point.

Anyone who tries to grab my keys should be killed.

Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
