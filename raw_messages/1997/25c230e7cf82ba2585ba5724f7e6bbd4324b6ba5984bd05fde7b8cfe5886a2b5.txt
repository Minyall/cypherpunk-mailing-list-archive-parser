* In August, the Boston Globe profiled the Taiwan National
Assembly (which specializes in constitutional issues), where it is
fairly common for the minority New Party to filibuster by merely
grabbing the microphone and physically restraining majority-party
members so that they cannot call for votes.  Fights break out,
sometimes bloody ones.  Said a local political science professor, "It
may not be civilized, but it's efficient" because citizens respond by
re-electing the aggressive legislators.
