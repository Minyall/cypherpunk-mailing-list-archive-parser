Announcing Development of a FIPS for Advanced Encryption Standard

Agency: NIST
Notice; Request for comments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary: A process to develop a FIPS for Advanced Encryption Standard 
(AES) incorporating an Advanced Encryption Algorithm (AEA) is being 
initiated by the NIST. It is intended that the AES will specify an 
unclassified, publicly disclosed encryption algorithm capable of 
protecting sensitive government information well into the next century.

[Described as a successor for DES by 1998.]
