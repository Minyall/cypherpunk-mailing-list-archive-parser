This may be feasible without resorting to ActiveX.  Microsoft IE 3.0 has a
nifty security bug that allows a malicious WWW page to run arbitrary
programs (e.g. "format c: /y").  Details (and a demo that starts the
Windows calculator locally) are at

  http://www.cybersnot.com/iebug.html

There are "uploader" programs for WWW servers; one of these should be
modifiable to look for %PGPPATH%/secring.pgp without prompting... 

The great (?) thing about this bug is that, since there is no confirmation
and the rogue programs don't use ActiveX or Java, you can't prevent a site
from trashing your PC.  (Except by trashing your copy of IE.)

Microsoft will have a fix out Real Soon Now, of course...
