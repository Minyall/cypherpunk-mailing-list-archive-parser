Marc you really need to pick better examples for making your point. :)

Not only is government regulation unnecesary to insure passenger safty in
automobiles I can site what happend with Tucker as a prime example of how
government power was used to prevent the free market from bringing safty
inovations to the general public.

The biggest problem with libertarian ideals is that the never get
implemented before some statest jumps in with their own power grab
"solution" to the problem.
