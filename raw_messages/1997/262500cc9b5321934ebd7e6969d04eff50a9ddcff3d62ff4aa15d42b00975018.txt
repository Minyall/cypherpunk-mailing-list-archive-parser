Look a bit closer at the announcments:  I believe they said that they would 
compile a new version for each key that they used.  So it's not even likely 
that this could become a widespread feature.

For this to be useful for GAK, you'd have to change all copies in existence 
to encrypt for this key.  (And of course, then you'd have a very simple key-
id to search for in the executable and modify, say to encrypt back to 
yourself, and you'd have circumvented this little problem)

If you want PGP to get into widespread use in business, you have to provide 
features that they will require.  Frankly, this is good for encryption, to 
provide features that business needs.  With this, hopefully the business 
lobby will fall in line with the no-regulation-on-crypto lobby, and get all 
of us the results we want.

Phil is never going to release a copy of PGP that has built-in GAK.  We know 
that.  This is MAK (Management Access...) in a secure manner, which is better 
than the other methods of internal escrow.
