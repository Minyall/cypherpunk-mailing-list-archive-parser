Bob, Tim. You guys are doing great. i
think that the enemy is confused into
thinking that we are feckless juveniles
who are at each other's throats and are
posing no real threat. excellent. this
should give us those precious few extra
weeks needed to complete Plan A. also:
perhaps you two should get together and
re-work your contingency confessions.
wouldn't want some of your accusations
against one another to accidentally be
true! (use Bob's "Toto" nym. be careful
not to accidentally Cc: the cypherpunks
list!)


white team leader
