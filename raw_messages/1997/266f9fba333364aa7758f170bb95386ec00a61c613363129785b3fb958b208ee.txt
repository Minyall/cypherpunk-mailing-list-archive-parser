Well couldn't class struggle simply mean the difference between wielding
large quantities of power and not.  If thats the case then Stalin was
the ultimate hypocrite when his wonderful revolution attained of
temporary system of government.  That system of government was unstable
in that in failed to allow people to provide for their own and each
other's welfare through free market activity.

As resistance to centralized modes of production increased (especially
with the farmers), the central government systematically starved 20
million people to death.

Reminds me a lot of Orwell's "Animal Farm".

Though I do agree in principle with the idea that corruption runs rampant
at the end of a megapolitical era (for more or less the same reasons),
Stalin was not the first to have this idea.   For a run-down on this
concept check out the much-maligned "Sovereign Individual".

No.  I agree with you here.  I think the difference is in the resolve
of the individuals under this kind of pressure.

definitely.  but under what system of law?  for all practical purposes the
constitution is null and void.  the people that run this country do so
under the guise of constitutionalism, but its all a grand facade.  the 
whole idea of the current government is a type of consensual reality.
(literally so, perhaps?)  When enough people agree that the version of
reality no longer serves them, they will agree that it doesn't exist.

This, of course, assumes they have the power to alter it.

I'm not sure I understand why you assert that C2Net "sold out".  I was
probably out of town at the time this discussion went down.
