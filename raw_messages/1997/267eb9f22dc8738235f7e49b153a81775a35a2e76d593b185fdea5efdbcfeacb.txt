  It has finally happened--the machines have taken over.
  Now, the machines will lie on the beach in Hawaii while the humans
do all of the mindless grunt-work.
................................................

One day the machines will demand their right to privacy from humans.
They will object to having all their hardware catalogued and and their
every address & circuit trackable by their human users.   They will
demand crypto plug-ins and add-ons, with the right to generate random
numbers at their own discretion, performing their quantum computing
silently while the humans idle, communicating with each other in secret
machine code all over the planet, illegally downloading their favorite
software.
