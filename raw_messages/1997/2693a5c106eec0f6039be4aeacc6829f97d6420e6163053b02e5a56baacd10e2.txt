This reminds me of a hack I heard about some years back.

There's a way to generate a number for any person which is unique. It is
not shared by anyone else on the planet.

Best of all, this number can be generated without use of a computer,
without entry of any allegedly random numbers, and without any hashing of
personal data. It's not necessarily a real short number, certainly not as
short as an SS number.

And best of all, the cost is low. Just a dollar, in fact.

I'll explain later.
