OTOH, there is no necessity at all to think of it that way.  
Prison isn't the only punishment -- there is nothing in the 
Constitution or anywhere else that says that.  (Certainly, not being 
able to own a gun is in no meaningful sense a "cruel or unusual" 
punishment.)  A court that can impose a life sentence can impose a 
lifetime ban on certain activities -- there is nothing at all 
inconsistent here.

Another fallacy is to think that prison is a temporary phenomenon. 
"Been to prison" is a permanent state -- it marks you for life. 
"Convicted Felon" is a permanent legal condition, a title with
permanent social effects.  

You are probaboy thinking that after a person has "paid their debt to
society" things are just like they were before.  It's a nice theory,
but it's false.  It's not like money.  Your "debt to society" is not
paid off by a prison term.

"Let the punishment fit the crime".  The crime is *always* relevant to
the punishment, the punishment is *always* a function of the crime.  It
is incoherent and unjust to think otherwise.  

A punishment can certainly infringe your "Natural Rights" -- you can
be executed, after all.
