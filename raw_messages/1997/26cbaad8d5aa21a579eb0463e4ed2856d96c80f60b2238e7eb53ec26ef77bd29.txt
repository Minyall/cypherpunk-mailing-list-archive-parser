The German authorities conducted pattern investigations long before 1991.
The early 80's kidnapping of the industrialist comes to mind. [The
kidnapping that ultimately caused the suspected co-conspirators to be
sucided in their solitary confinement maximum security cells. Cells that
were under 24h audio surveilance. Unfortunatly, the tapes for that fateful
night mysteriously disappeared...]

But note the requirement you mention: "severe crimes...warranted by a
judge". Where have we heard this one before? Right. The four horsemen of
the infocalypse.
