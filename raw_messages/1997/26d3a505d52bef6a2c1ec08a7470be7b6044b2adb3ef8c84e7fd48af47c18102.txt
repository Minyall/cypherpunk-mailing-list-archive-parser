I'm going to be in Albuquerque seeing family for a week starting tomorrow.

Any cypherpunks/e$/technomads folks out there wanna quaff a few, I'd be up
for it.

Also, I'm looking a temporary PPP dial-up in the Albuquerque for the week
I'm there.  No mail or news, just PPP, so I can hit my POPserver and run
e$pam in remote-mode. Neither rain, nor snow, nor altitude, etc. can keep
the e$pamster from his appointed rounds...

Thanks!

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
