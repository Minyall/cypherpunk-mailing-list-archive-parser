Actually:
1. 49 mhz is the handset frequency, which doesn't carry both sides,
   or doesn't very well. 46 mhz is the base, and carries both sides
   pretty well.  I don't know how it works on 900 mhz non-digital.

2. My experience on cellular has been that the further the
   mobile phone is from the scanner (on average), the fainter the
   mobile person's voice is going to be, and it is often virtually
   inaudible. There are two 25-mhz cellular ranges, upper and lower,
   and I think 2600 or 411 mag. has detailed which carries what
   info.  Someone with a scanner may be tuning in the upper range
   when they really want the lower, or vice-versa.
