And none of those movies were anywhere near the real thing.

That is correct, and the Feds are going to get their asses kicked in
Court when they try to prosecute any Medical Doctors. The States have
the right to grant medical licenses, and the Feds have nothing they
should be involved with at all.

Yes, that is probably so.

And now the cabal is trying to interfere with the new
misc.legal.criminal newsgroup for medical cannabis

being prepared by that Philadelphia Lawyer right now.

licensing, etc. are PURELY under the Jurisdiction of the States, and
that the Feds must keep their fucking noses out of State business.

And this guy would end up dead.  The VFW and the American Legion
have more firearms than he does, and the only way you will take my
guns away is to kill all of us first.
