You can have the same algorithm (visible at the user side) whether or
not you have special hardware for protecting the private half of the key
pair from exposure.

Knowing the right key in the MR case is static information, analagous
to knowing the network address of the key safe in the KS case.  For
example, in the MR case, the key could be distributed on a floppy disk
along with the special software, while in the KS case the location
of the key safe could be so distributed.  OK, you also need a way of
changing the (MR) key or of moving the (KS) key safe, but that doesn't
happen often and similar issues would appear to arise in either case.

But in the KS case, there would also need to be a mechanism to protect
the channel between the user and the key safe every time the channel is
used, and that extra mechanism does not appear to have a counterpart in
the MR case.  Not really a big deal, but it is a whole extra protocol to
be designed.
