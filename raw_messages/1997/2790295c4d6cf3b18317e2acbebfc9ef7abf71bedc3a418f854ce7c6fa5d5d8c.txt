MSNBC reports today that one of the bills coming up
in the congressional session is "H.R. 3011, an encryption
bill which favors stripping all export restrictions and 
opposes any key escrow requirements."

We've not been able to find this bill in the usual gov sites. 
Assuming that MSNBC got the info right, pointers to the bill
would be appreciated.
