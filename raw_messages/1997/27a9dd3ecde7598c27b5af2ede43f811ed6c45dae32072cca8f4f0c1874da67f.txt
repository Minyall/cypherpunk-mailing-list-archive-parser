I wonder... does Iraq have a web site?

While third world contries seldom have computer specialists, it seemed
pretty easy for Iraq to get biological weapon specialists working for
them. [Other more sensible arguments exist...]

Iraq has more money than they can reasonably spend, but management
troubles. Solution: IntraIraq, the network with Sadam ads. While burning
papers has some flare to it, it's pretty likely that most of the
classified data not in Sadam's head must be in some computer system[s],
easily housed by the UN no-no sites for inspectors.

Also, can Iraq's people create [and display] web pages?
