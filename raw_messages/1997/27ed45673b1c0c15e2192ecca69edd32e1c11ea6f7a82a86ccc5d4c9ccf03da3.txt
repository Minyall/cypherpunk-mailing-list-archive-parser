Fictionally speaking, if the Prof. (when did I earn that title?) does 
hack Cyberpromo, the Prof wouldn't delete all the files, for doing so 
would simply cause them to restore their files from tape thus cause not 
much to happen.  No, were I to do something like that (and I wouldn't) it 
would have to be something that would keep them down for a long time, not 
for eight hours while their tape drive restores stuff.

Any suggestions as to what this would be for those out there willing to do
such a deed? :) My own suggestion would be to hack into the routers
surrounding them and set them up to connect any attempts to connect to
machines outside cyberpromo.com on port 25 back to cyberpromo's own sendmail
server.  Setting up their sendmail configs to do the same would also be a
nice backup.  That would be IMHO a proper hack.  (Anyone care to share router
hacking techniques, and how to do such a thing?-- Again, not that I would 
do this myself.)
