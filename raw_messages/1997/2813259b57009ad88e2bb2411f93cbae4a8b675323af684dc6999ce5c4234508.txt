This seems a tad circular, as the real number line, from which line 
segments are constructed, is a copy of the set of real numbers. 

One can construct the reals from the rationals quite easily using any
of several well-known methods, such as equivalence classes of Cauchy 
sequences, or Dedikind cuts.
