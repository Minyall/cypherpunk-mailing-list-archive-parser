Hi,

As some of you are aware, we are having a hell of a day concerning weather.
Not only are 300+ homes north of Austin simply not there any more thanks to
a monster twister (it even tore some of the slabs out of the ground) but we
have had a very wide power outage. At the current time SSZ and associated
systems are back up and working. We are expecting another heavy wave of
weather later tonite. If the current forcast is still set at midnite SSZ may
go down from midnite CST to around 7AM CST tomorrow.

Take care and some cover (if you can find it).
