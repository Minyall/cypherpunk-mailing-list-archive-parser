Yep, more pre-dawn, no knock raids.

Lists of "members of Sons of Liberty" are seized.

Apparently the First Amendment is in suspension. At least in Hollywood.

Gee, and the grounds for the search warrant were that the Internet was used
to publish instructions for converting a Mac to full auto. (Gee, and I
thought everyone knew how to file down the sear on these old open bolt
pieces of shit?)

If I publish these widely-available instructions, will the Cypherpunks be
raided?

(One can only hope. I'm getting tired of setting my traps every night and
having no BATFags to show for it.)
