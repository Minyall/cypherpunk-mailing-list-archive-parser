This is one of the few stories out of the whole mess that I do believe.

I was told about the above incident over a year ago by a friend who has known 
Jim for many years.

It is my understanding that Jim did not encrypt his hard drive at all.  (Jim 
was not all that experienced as a computer user.  (By his own admission.  At 
least what he said the time I met him.))

If the feds has stuck to the stink bomb story, it would have been alot more 
plausable.  But the "poisoning the bullrun" and "911" stuff is a bit far 
fetched for Jim.  It does not fit the way he thinks.

Easier said than done...
