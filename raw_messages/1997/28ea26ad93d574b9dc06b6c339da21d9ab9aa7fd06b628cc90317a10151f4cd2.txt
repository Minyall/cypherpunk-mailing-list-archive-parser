It is very simple as to what the legitimate activities of the government
is. It is explicitly spelled out in The Constitution of The United States.
It states quite clearly in no uncertain terms what the federal government
can and can not do. Unfortunately people like yourself and the majority of
politicians feel that they can wipe their ass with this document whenever
it suits their needs.
