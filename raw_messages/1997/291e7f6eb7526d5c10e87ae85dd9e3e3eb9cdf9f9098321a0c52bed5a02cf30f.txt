There are three engineers in a car; an electrical engineer, a chemical
engineer, and a Microsoft engineer.  Suddenly the car just stops by
the side of the road, and the three engineers look at each other,
wondering what could be wrong.

The electrical engineer suggests stripping down the electronics of
the car and trying to trace where a fault might have occurred.

The chemical engineer, not knowing much about cars, suggests that
maybe the fuel is becoming emulsified and getting blocked somewhere.

Then the Microsoft engineer, not knowing much about anything, comes
up with a suggestion.

Why don't we close all the windows, get out, get back in, open the
windows again, and maybe it'll work.
