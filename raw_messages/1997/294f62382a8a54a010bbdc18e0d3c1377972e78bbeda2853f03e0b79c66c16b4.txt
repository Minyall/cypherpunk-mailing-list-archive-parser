Dear Security Professional,

We apologize for the annoyance and confusion we might have caused to you
due to human error in our email addressing. As a result some of our
internal emails about the newly announced F-Secure VPN v1.1 software were
erroneously emailed to your attention.

It is definitively not our company policy to contribute to spamming on the
Internet, and we do hope that you'll still want to receive the otherwise
unbiased information sent to the members of our press list.

Yours sincerely,

Tom Helenius
Data Fellows
