Oh I agree with you here that there is not constutional right to social
services. I wish I had a reference to the court decisions on this. It was
a year or two ago regarding one of the balot propositions in California
that would cut off various social services to illegal aliens. I am going
off memory here but I don't think it ever got all the way to the SC. If
anyone has a reference to this case please post.
