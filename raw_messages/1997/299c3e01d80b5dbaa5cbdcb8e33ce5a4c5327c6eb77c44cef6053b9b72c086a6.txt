Press Release
Anguilla, June 16, 1997

    Anguilla surpasses US military in code breaking challenge.

The Caribbean country of Anguilla has searched through more than
2,380,000,000,000 code keys as part of the Deschall effort to break a DES
encrypted message.  This is in response to a challenge by RSA Inc to show
that DES 56 bit keys are not large enough given the rapid advances in
computing technology.  As of June 16th, the entire US military effort,
represented by Internet machine names ending in ".mil" in the Deschall
statistics pages, has searched fewer keys.  Anguilla host names end in
".com.ai".  Anguilla is a free and democratic country, that does not limit
key lengths. 

Offshore Information Services organized the Anguilla effort.  OIS also
hosted a conference in Anguilla called "Financial Cryptography 97" in
February of this year.
