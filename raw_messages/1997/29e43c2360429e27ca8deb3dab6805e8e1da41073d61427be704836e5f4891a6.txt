Should the United States
       remove restrictions on
       the export of powerful
       encryption technology?

       * 283 responses

       Unequivocally yes (84.1%)

       Yes, but only if law enforcement
       is given the keys to break the
       encryption when necessary.
       (9.9%)

       No, maintain the status quo.
       (1.8%)

       No. In fact, the restrictions
       should be tightened. (4.2%)
