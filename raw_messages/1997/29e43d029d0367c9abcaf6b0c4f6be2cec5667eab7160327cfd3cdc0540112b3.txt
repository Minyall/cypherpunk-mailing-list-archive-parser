In the discussion of the Intel F00FC7C8 problem, it was alleged that
the instruction "unlk a7" will lock up a Motorola 68040 CPU even from
user mode. 

Would someone care to test this on an old MAC?

Is anyone aware of non-privileged instructions which kill other popular
CPUs, like Alphas, SPARCS, and MIPS?
