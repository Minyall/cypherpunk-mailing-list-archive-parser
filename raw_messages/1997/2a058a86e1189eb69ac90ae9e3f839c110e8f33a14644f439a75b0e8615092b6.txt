Now THAT is interesting,

seems in Colo, they have some idea about the bill of rights, even though
the plunger-kicker is a doughnut whore, it is still present at the scene,

unlike the Bots of the Peoples Republik of Virginia.

Isn't there a wierd clause about being able to face your accuser??? Yeah, I
know, I live in a fantasy world.
