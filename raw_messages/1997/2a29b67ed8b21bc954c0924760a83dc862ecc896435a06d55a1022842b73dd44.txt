About 9 months ago, I lost somewhere between 50 and 100 email messages
because they were written to a disk with a corrupted file system.  Now
failures of this kind may be in the category of "catastrophic disk
failure", but in my unfortunate experience, they are not all that uncommon.

Note that since I lost multiple messages due to one failure, tests of the
form, "Once is happenstance, twice coincidence, three or more is
conspiracy" might say, "conspiracy" even for just one failure.  The chances
of this test criteria error increase for frequent posters.

See the above discussion of disk failure.
