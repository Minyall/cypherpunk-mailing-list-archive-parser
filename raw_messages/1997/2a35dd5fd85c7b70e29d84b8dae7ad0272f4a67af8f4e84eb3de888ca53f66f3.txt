The courier showed up, and I'm now at home changing in preparation for a
soccer game (I'm part of a libertarian soccer team), but thought I'd post
a brief note about the W.A. 

It says: "The Lists do not control 'software' which is either generally
available to the public... or in the public domain."

So what's the fuss about? Hmm....
