  At first, I was confused...
  Here I was, the only resident being held in the Cypherpunks Home for
the Criminally Insane. Yet, every day I would receive hundreds of posts
purporting to be from a variety of individuals subscribed to the list.
  "What is going on, here?" I asked myself.

  Had my Multi-Personality Disorder gotten so out of hand that I was,
without conscious knowledge, actually writing all of these posts by
myself?
... or,
  Were the voices that spoke to me when I forgot to take my medication
right? Were there others in the 'Home' who were hiding from me, and 
were also subscribed to the Cypherpunks list?

  In the end, I came to the conclusion that the latter answer was the
correct one. After all, even someone as crazy as me could not make the
rest of you people up.

- Me
"But not that far from being *you*."
