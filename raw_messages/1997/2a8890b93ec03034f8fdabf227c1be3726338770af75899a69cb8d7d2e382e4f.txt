Sophist, paranoid nonsense.  This one-month test is of a 
moderated *Cypherpunks* list.  So there was no renaming.
The unedited list was a gimme for cry babies such as Dale.  
When the test is complete, things will go back to the previous
status if that's what folks want.  If not, Cypherpunks will 
continue as a moderated list (of some sort, further test may be
conducted if list members want).

(a) If it were transparent, it wouldn't fool anyone, now would it?
(b) I've stated it all clear enough so that only the most naive
    persons could infer an attempt to fool anyone.
(c) "The public" has nothing to do with it.  This is a private list.

Maybe after the test if that's what folks want.  In the meantime,
hey Dale, knock yourself out.
