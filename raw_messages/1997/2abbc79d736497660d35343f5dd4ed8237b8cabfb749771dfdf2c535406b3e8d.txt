Maybe it is just me, but I think the whole McVeigh trial issues aren't
about whether he did or didn't do it.  it's important, but my concerns are
more about the process the government used to prove it's case.

It's built this huge circumstantial case, sprinkled liberally with weeping
mothers and children, added with a couple of witnesses who would probably
say anything to avoid execution.

None of it actually proved he DID it, just that it was possible. 

When a person can be convicted by sympathy, twisted circumstantial
evidence, and testimony given under threat of execution, you have to
wonder about the _process_ in this country, and th idea of trial by an
impartial body.

In my gut, I think he probably did do it, but I cannot see how the
prosecutors proved it beyond a "reasonable doubt".

Considering the testimony that is going to be allowed for the penalty
phase, I cannot forsee any verdict other than death.
