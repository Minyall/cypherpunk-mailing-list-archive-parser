Wrong. Exposure to pornography does not cause "brain damage" or 
"structural changes in the brain." That's like saying that holding up 
dirty pictures in front of an office building is going to cause 
"structural changes" in the building. Sure, a percentage of the 
little people inside looking out the windows are going to have a 
twisted little grin on their face, but holding up the pictures isn't 
going to compromise the integrity of the building structure. I'd like 
to know where you get your information, because it's false.
