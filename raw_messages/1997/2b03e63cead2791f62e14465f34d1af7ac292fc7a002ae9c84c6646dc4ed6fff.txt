To reduce the load on toad.com, I think it would be better to have just
"cypherpunks" and "cypherpunks-unedited".  Messages approved for the moderated
list would be tagged with an "Approved:" header and sent to both lists.
Rejected messages would still go to the unedited list, but would not have an
"Approved:" header (this would, of course, require that the moderation
software rename or delete "Approved:" headers).  The only problem with this
is that the lag time for distribution of the unedited list might increase.

I think it's a good idea.  As long as an unedited version continues to be
available, it shouldn't effect people who want unfiltered list traffic.
