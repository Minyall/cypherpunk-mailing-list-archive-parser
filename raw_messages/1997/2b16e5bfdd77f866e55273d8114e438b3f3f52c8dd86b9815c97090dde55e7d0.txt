It's a distributed system, it's more resilient to abuse than
governments.

If one person becomes too much of a nuisance (real trigger happy for
ultra minor infractions -- swearing at them, daring to look at them
when they're in a bad bood) relatives, friends, or concerned citizens
will correct (fill trigger happy person with lead).

That's how the wild west worked anyway... outlaws didn't last that
long.

So you're relying on other peoples sense of fairness ... should easily
work out better than governments.
