It is pretty absurd any way you look at it.

Most text scanning jobs for commercial use are sent off-shore.  For the
government to act like OCR scanning does not exist for those off the
continental US is absurd.

I used to work for a company that made CD-ROMs of medical journals.  These
were proportional fonts out of magazines.  (Once in a while we would get
the origianl article information, but that was not always assured.)  Most
of the text would be sent to somewhere in Asia to be scanned and proofread.
 Text scanning is big business in some parts of SE Asia.  (And has for many
years.)

Goes to show you just how disconnected from the real world the White House
and its fellow travelers have become.
