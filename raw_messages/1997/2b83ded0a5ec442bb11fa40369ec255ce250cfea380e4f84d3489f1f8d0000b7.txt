For a standard block cipher there should be no problem.  For a stream
cipher, you would have the same type of problems as for OTP reuse, but
it would still be secure as long as you never reused a key.  However...

Yes.

Having identical plaintexts raised to the same power modulo different
numbers makes the solution much easier.  If you have enough RSA
encryptions of the same number to the same power, you can solve it
outright by the remainder theorem.
