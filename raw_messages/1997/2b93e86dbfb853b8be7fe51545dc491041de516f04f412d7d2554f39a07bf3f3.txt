No spam in their mail boxes :-)

You could work around this somewhat by configuring the hashcash filter
to put nonces (a random number) in the bounce messages for messages
which arrived without hashcash.

The instructions could read:

	Email to this address requires hashcash postage.  To generate
	your hashcash postage get software from here: <URL>

	Alternatively simply reply to this message putting this number
	in the subject field: 12347651324

The danger is that the spammer could abuse this by automating the
reply to these bounce messages.  However spammers typically don't like
to include a valid reply address, so this at least makes spammers
include an address where they can be replied to.

An easily observable tag in the subject field such as: [SPAM?] meaning
no hashcash or [NEW] meaning you had never received messages from this
address before could be useful perhaps.
