Anyone who desires not to be constantly tracked should carry a one-way pager and keep your cell phone turned off.  This way you can return calls when it suits you and from a location of your choosing. In some U.S. localities I understand, it it possible to rent cellphone w/o offering any form of ID, only a deposit to cover the instrument and a prepayment for the airtime  This may be illegal in some EU countries.  To keep someone from correlating your pager info and cellular you'd want your callers to send 'coded' info, rather than phone numbers.
