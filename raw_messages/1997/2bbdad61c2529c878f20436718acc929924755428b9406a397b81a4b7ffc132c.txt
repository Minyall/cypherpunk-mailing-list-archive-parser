  Uh, don't you mean "instead of paying a large amount of money to the
government and a small amount of money for a security system, you now
just pay a small amount of money for the security system"? Or do you live
in a different reality to the rest of us, whose cops are so fuck-awful that
we have to both pay their wages and the obscene costs of our corrupt legal 
system, then pay extra to actually protect ourselves? Guns and cameras are
cheap compared to paying donut-hogs to examine rectums with plungers.
