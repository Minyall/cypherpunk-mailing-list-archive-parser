The new "Protecting Electronic Health Information" report by
the National Academy of Sciences is at:

   http://jya.com/pehi.htm  (615K)

There is quite a lot of crypto discussion.

The NY Times featured this report on Page One today.

It's worth reminding that this report and the recent one on
secrecy both fault national encryption policy and emphasize 
that it's time to break the logjam caused by NatSec/LEA
dispute with commerce, and get on with protecting the 
privacy of citizens from government and commerce working 
in cahoots.

Note that commerce is seen as much a threat as government, 
with the looming probablility that government and commerce 
will unite against the citizenry, now as ever, both claiming to
protect from the other, using their phony fight as a camouflage 
for royal screwing rights.
