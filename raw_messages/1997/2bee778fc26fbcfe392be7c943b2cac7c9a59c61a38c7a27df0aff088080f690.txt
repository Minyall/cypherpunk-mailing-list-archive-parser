The logic in this conclusion is all wrong.

The reason Hit Man, and other such "undrground" text, are not available on
the local book stores is because the major publishing houses will not
print them! Paladin Press is a mail order company because major retailers
will not shelf the books that they print. I can hardly see Paladin turning
down a 100,000 copy order from Barns & Nobel or Books-A-Million or any of
the other major chains. I am quite sure that if one looks at the records
of Paladin one will see that they sold their books to whomever wished to
purchase them (after all thet is the business they are in).

I can see it now the 1st Amendment only applies if you can sell a million
copies of your words.
