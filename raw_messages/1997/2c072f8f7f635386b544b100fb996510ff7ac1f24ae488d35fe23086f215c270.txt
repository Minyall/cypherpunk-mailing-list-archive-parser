  Also, you are not likely to see a FISA judge's name on a warrant.
Instead, you will see warrants by regular judges which are backdated
to dates such as, say...March 28 at 9:02 a.m.
  There are a variety of court systems within which they have the clerks
regularly 'skip' certain document numbers, leaving them with hard to
trace back-dated paperwork capabilities.

  This is a 'Democracy', which is why, in addition to secret police,
we also have 'secret judges', and 'secret executioners'. (Do we also
have 'secret voters'?)
