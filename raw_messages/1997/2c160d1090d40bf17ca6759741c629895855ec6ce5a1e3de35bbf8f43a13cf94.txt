I don't think CNET has any idea what they're talking about. Perhaps they
mean the Burns bill?

I was over at Burns' office yesterday, and Pro-CODE hasn't been
reintroduced yet -- they're looking for more co-sponsors -- so that's not
even correct.

*shrug*

I have a report on this at netlynews.com in the Afterword section, BTW.
