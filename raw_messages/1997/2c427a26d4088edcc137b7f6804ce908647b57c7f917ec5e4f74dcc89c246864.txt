The answer is YES, although it requires a little work.

Suppose that you point your browser at http://www.A.com/index.html.

Suppose that file contains an <img src="http://www.B.com/X.cgi">.
The CGI file displays a little picture, and also gets or sets a cookie.

Suppose you next browse http://www.C.com/index.html, and it too
contains the same <img src...>.  Since the cookie is "owned" by B.com,
not A.com or C.com, the cgi file can track your movement from A.Com to
B.Com.
