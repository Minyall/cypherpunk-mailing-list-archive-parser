He would have had support among his counter cultural group (us).  He wasn't 
accused of very serious acts like OJ.

All the sedition cases of the last 60 years (2) have been lost by the Feds.  
Sedition is really hard to win (and of course JB wasn't accused of same).

The "911 Document" prosecutions that grew out of Operation Sun Devil were for

they really bit it when forced to go to trial.
