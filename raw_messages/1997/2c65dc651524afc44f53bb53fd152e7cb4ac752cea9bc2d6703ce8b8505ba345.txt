It's a shame that more shareware/freeware authors don't sign their code.

I wrote a small Rexx script that signs all my source code, signs the
binaries, creates the zip archive & signs it then creates a wrapper zip
archive for the archive & the detached signature file.

For C, H & CMD files you can clear sign the text files and still be able
to compile them without revmoving the signatures.

Example Test.C

  main(){
  .
  .
  .
  }

Add the following to the top and bottom of the file:

  */

  main(){
  .
  .
  .
  }

  /*

Now clearsign the file.


  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
  */

  main(){
  .
  .
  .
  }

  /*
  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
  Version: 2.6.3a
  Charset: cp850
  Comment: Registered_User_E-Secure_v1.1b1_ES000000

  iQCVAwUBM6m/I49Co1n+aLhhAQGI4gQAgdJ8wU8PZezxO+DHFAzLoMmrnPoi7xBV
  4YVGablxDRO16cELE8p2YVaNeZ+dOOLiZYnpZKPoPW2w8Ze7gDxAz5ODJ8ZBd+Ta
  x/3o3jkFGednnlJoEQcpS/R4bmoKy9hMzO7KJpXJB8YiWrbbGfiA3YidGMtYhWUf
  bDPiuD+rqXI=
  =gNYv
  -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----


Now add the following to the top and bottom of the message:

  /*
  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
  */

  main(){
  .
  .
  .
  }

  /*
  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
  Version: 2.6.3a
  Charset: cp850
  Comment: Registered_User_E-Secure_v1.1b1_ES000000

  iQCVAwUBM6m/I49Co1n+aLhhAQGI4gQAgdJ8wU8PZezxO+DHFAzLoMmrnPoi7xBV
  4YVGablxDRO16cELE8p2YVaNeZ+dOOLiZYnpZKPoPW2w8Ze7gDxAz5ODJ8ZBd+Ta
  x/3o3jkFGednnlJoEQcpS/R4bmoKy9hMzO7KJpXJB8YiWrbbGfiA3YidGMtYhWUf

  */

Now the PGP Signature has been commented out of the source code so it will
not interfere with compiling. The end user can verify the signature
without any modifications.

I don't know if this will work with other languages that use different
dilimiters. It all depends if you have the ability to comment out a block
of text or if you need to add a dilimiter to every line.
