Now that pictures of Princess Diana trapped in the wreckage have been
printed in European tabloids, it is only a matter of time before someone
scans them and posts them to alt.binaries.pictures.tasteless.

Clicking on such pictures, of course, is not the moral equivalent of
having personally run Princess Diana off the road, regardless of what your
neighborhood CPAC member would like you to believe.
