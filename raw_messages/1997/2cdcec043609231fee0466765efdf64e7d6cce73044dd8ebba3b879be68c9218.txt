Uh, Mr. Thorn, you already have wasted time in exactly that way.

Calling the moderation plan on the table "censorship" is quite a stretch.
I'm sure it serves your rhetorical purposes, but other than that it is
merely hot air.

When those examples are chosen in a logical and directed way to
accomplish the intended association, yes.  You, however, have failed on
both accounts here.

Your propaganda knowledge is sorely lacking for one who would aspire to
influence thought by invoking Hitler and Bush in consecutive sentences.  I
admire your honesty in admitting yourself that those names were poorly

Seems your reading habits and choice of material have twisted your psyche
a bit beyond the point of reason.

I mean you have no clue what prose is appropriate and what is not.
Selling snake oil on this list, for example.

That you don't flaunt ideas clearly flawed to the experts in the field
would be a better example.
