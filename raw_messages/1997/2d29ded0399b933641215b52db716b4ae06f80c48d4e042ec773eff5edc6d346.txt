Awwww, Caaa'monnn.

You mean they can license handguns, but not reporters???

I think reporters, particularly the lapdog Whitehouse kind, have killed
more people in the last century than domestic handguns, don'tcha think?

Heck, now that I think of it, we should also license printing presses, and
xeroxgraphy, and computers...

... And e-mail groups!  Yeah, that's it. License e-mail groups...

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
