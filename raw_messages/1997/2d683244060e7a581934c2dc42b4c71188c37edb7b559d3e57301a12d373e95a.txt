	Now how do you convince people that strong encryption is a very

	I'll lay odds that the majority of those people think that all

	I know where I work, the idea that encryption should be legal

	Hypothetical question:

	How will law enforcement deal with my 
	Enochian to Linear-B / Egyptian Hieroglyphics / Maya translation
	program, if encryption is banned?  It does provide clear text,
	albeit is a language that they don't understand.
