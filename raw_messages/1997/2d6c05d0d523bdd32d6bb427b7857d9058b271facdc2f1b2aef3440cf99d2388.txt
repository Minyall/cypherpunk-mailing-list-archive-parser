  Govt doesn't need to use a reasonable interpretation. They tell you
what you can and can't do--the judge areees with them--ten years later
the Supremes tell you to go ahead and use it but it no longer runs on
any of the machines in existence.

  Yes. They declare it to be so.

  Make it work simply for everyone with the push of a single button.
It doesn't have to be secure, it has to be convenient. The only thing
the masses need is the illusion of security. Then they will cry loudly
when someone tries to take it away.
  Make it so that those who want strong security can jump through the
necessary hoops to get it from the same program so that they can't
take away yours and leave them with theirs.

  Strong encryption, officer? Yes, my Bouncing Betty Security Disk
is right there in the top drawer. I'll just step back here a little
and let you go get it.
