   Well, I still use my RSA key for all signings and encryptions since
about 85% of PGP users don't use the new Diffie-Hellman keys, and some
asshole forgot to make PGP 5.0 freeware RSA key-generating.  Luckily I
can still use my RSA key.  Plus, some assholes didn't take into account
that not everyone uses Windoze95/NT 4.0 or Macintrash, and didn't make
one yet for Unix or OS/2 or DOS or Windoze 3.1 users.  My friend still
uses 3.1 and I have to use my RSA key to talk to him.

I hope you guys with the international PGP get to use 5.0 soon.  It's
really nice, all things about it excluded.
