How ironic that Vulis supports the right of private libraries to refuse
service to bad-smelling readers, while whining about Gilmore's refusal
to allow Gilmore's own private machine to pass Vulis' foul-smelling posts.

Private actions are not censorship, and Gilmore had the right to do
anything he wanted with toad.com.  Likewise list members had every right
to move to other hosts.

Vulis's infantile name-calling is easily seen to be totally lacking in
justification, unsurprising given his demonstrated lack of reasoning
abilities on this issue.
