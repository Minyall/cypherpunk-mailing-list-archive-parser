Would this work for GSM phones as well? I believe that GSM-spam is becoming
a wide spread problem. In Finland the GSM phone numbers are published in
online databases where spammers get the numbers and they use free
Internet-to-GSM/SMS message services.

Using hashcash on the smartcard in a GSM phone would be really neat!
