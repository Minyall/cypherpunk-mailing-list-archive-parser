This _is_ pretty amazing. Previous to this, the only software I've seen
that's even similar are the realtime translation products offered by
Uni-verse, at <http://www.uni-verse.com/products.html>. Like this AV
Translation Service, the software is proprietary, but (worse), it must be
purchased and (as far as I can tell) only runs on Windows. Wonder how long
this is going to be free to use?
