* In July, police in Lexington, Ky., were searching for Delbert
Buttrey, 47, who they believe is the man who kidnapped a transient
couple from Indiana, took them to an isolated spot, and forced
them to perform oral sex on him while Buttrey's girlfriend snapped
photographs.  After that, according to police, Buttrey took the
couple home with him and forced the man to mow his lawn.
