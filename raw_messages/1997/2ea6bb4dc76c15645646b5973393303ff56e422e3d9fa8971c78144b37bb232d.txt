    I'm too old for this!  I never thought I would see the day that
    Dorothy Denning would terminate her star role as a shill for the
    Clinton/LEA encryption ban!

    from: http://www.news.com/News/Item/0%2C4%2C13000%2C00.html?nd

           Two supporters of Clinton
           administration's stance on
           encryption released a report today
           finding that encryption has not
           inhibited law enforcement efforts,
           with at least one author
           questioning her belief in the
           administration's position. 

           The authors--Dorothy Denning, a
           Georgetown University computer
           science professor, and William
           Baugh Jr., vice president of
           Science Application International
           Corporation--
