If You Build It, They Will Con
by Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)
   
        Perhaps the thinking behind DefCon went something like this: Lure
   hundreds of hackers to Las Vegas in the middle of the summer, ply them
   with cheap beer, talk about packet sniffing, and observe. Last year
   the result was self-organizing chaos, capped by an event where the
   hired strippers were upstaged by a band of exhibitionist
   conferencegoers. "The pimp was like, 'Oh my God,'" says Dark Tangent,
   DefCon's organizer.

        Last weekend's fifth annual DefCon may have been a little less
   raucous, but it was no less important as a place where hackers from
   around the world gather to socialize, gamble -- and glance around
   furtively trying to spot the government agents who infiltrate the
   convention. (Bonus: If you guess correctly, you can take a prized "I
   Spotted the Fed" T-shirt home with you.)
