Hey, try learning to _edit_. You foolishly included my entire article, .sig
lines and all, before adding your little gem of wisdom. Learn to include
only what is needed to reestablish context, or for specific discussion.

Another illiterate discovers the Cypherpunks list, and then presumes to
tell _us_ what the "purpose" of it is.

A great many things are talked about. Learn to use a kill file, or to
delete what you don't want to read.

If you think the "purpose" of the list is, as some do, to talk about what a
neat book "Applied Cryptography" is, or where to get a copy of PGP, then,
fine, talk about that. Like so many yokels do.

Even better, go back to where you came from.
