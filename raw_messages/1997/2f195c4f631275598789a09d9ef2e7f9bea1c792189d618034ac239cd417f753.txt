Try this scenario:  I have 150+ audio cd's, many of which are rare, import,
out of print, or even all of the above.  Since a fire could leave me
missing many pieces of irreplaceable music, I had come up with a plan.  Get
a cd-r burner, make backup copies of my audio discs, and store them in a
safe deposit box.

With this law, my plan would make me a felon somewhere around the 66th
disc.  With the 'victimized' record company getting to create the impact
statement, it might even be sooner.
