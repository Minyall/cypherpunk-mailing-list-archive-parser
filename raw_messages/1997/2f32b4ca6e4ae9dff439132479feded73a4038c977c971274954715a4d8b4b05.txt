I'm a little concerned with the usefulness of this idea in a
legal sense.  Imagine the physical analogue:  Alice buys the
guns and masks, and leaves them in a pre-arranged place.  Bob
anonymously buys a car and leaves it, with the keys inside, in
another pre-arranged place.  Carol and Dave collect the guns,
masks, and the car, and use them to rob a bank or hijack an
airplane.  Do you suppose the feds will have any problem
prosecuting Alice and Bob for their part in the conspiracy?

This part is somewhat more useful.  However, n copies of the
message are probably better.

I think the general problem here is unsolveable--running an
Eternity server is just going to be a dangerous thing to do if
you live somewhere where the police are likely to see
possessing, distributing, or selling some of the information on
it as a crime.  There are two possible solutions I can see:
Either make Eternity servers so widespread that taking down
individual servers in individual jurisdictions is futile, or
find some jurisdictions where virtually *nothing* will provoke
the police to act.  (Note that legal jurisdiction isn't the only
issue here.  Some groups may be willing to use terrorist tactics
to shut down these servers.)

Note:  Please respond via e-mail as well as or instead of posting,
as I get CP-LITE instead of the whole list.
