You are here, and they are not?  Then what's the problem?  I thought you 
had a problem with the fact that they ARE "here"!

This is simply and obviously not the case.  You do care what they do.  If 
not, you wouldn't express such violent feelings towards them.

Oh, now I understand.  You mentioned the southwest U.S.A. earlier.  
Obviously you have a house in the U.S.A. southwest, and some furners are

private security firm would do a better job for you.
