Ok, Monty, explain how my use of remailers is going to help me when my
son-in-law (for example) decides that he wants my property and decides to
have me examined? The mere fact that he can prove I use anonymous remailers
will only boost his assertion that I am a paranoid. If my hard drive is
encrypted that is further proof of my 'illness'.
