I disagree. Remember when a widely available C implementation of the Blowfish
algorithm was found to have a bug that significantly weakened its security?
The bug was in the C implementation, not the algorithm itself.

By the way, I requested the source code from Mr.Ramos within minutes after
he made the offer on this mailing list and haven't heard back from him yet.
