Ray you seem to be missing the point here.

Any state issued permit is public record. This includes your drivers
license and your auto registration.

It is imperative that in a democracy that the public know who and what the
state is giving permits to (there whole other issue of wether the state
should be issuing permits at all but that should be left to another
thread).

In a free and open society the public must be able to review the actions
of its government.

If Joe Sixpack has run over 20 people because he gets his kicks out of it
and the DMV still issues him a license the public has a right to know.

If the California DMV is secretly denying driving license to anyone who
posts to the cypherpunks list the only way anyone would know is by
examining the DMV records.

If the state is going to issue permits on what people can and can not do
the it is crutial that the public can examine these records to insure that
the state is not abusing this power.
