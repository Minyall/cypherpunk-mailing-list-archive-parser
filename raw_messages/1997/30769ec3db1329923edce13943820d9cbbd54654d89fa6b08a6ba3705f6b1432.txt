Bob, just a quick question, have you heard/seen anything on this:

|            The SANS Network Security Digest                   |
|                 Contributing Editors:                         |
|    Michele Crabb, Matt Bishop, Steve Bellovin, Rob Kolstad    |
|   Gene Spaford, Marcus Ranum, Gene Schultz, Dorothy Denning   |
----A Resource for Computer and Network Security Professionals---

It's an $80/yr e-mail newsletter; there are a lot of recognizable names
there, but the thing isn't digitally signed.  Also, isn't it "Spafford"?
Anyway, anything you know would be appreciated, and if you don't know
anything, could you ask around (e.g., some of the likelier mailing lists
which I no longer subscribe to.)

Thanks,
