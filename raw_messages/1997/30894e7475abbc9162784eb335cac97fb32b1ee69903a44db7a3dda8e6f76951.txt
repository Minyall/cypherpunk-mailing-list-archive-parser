Hey, don't forget to shoot the messenger. Chemerinsky's statement is a
concise summary of at least the last 70 years of double jeopardy
jurisprudence. The only thing that's unusual about the use of the "dual
sovereign" doctrine against the cops who beat King was that it's usually used
against ordinary citizens, not cops. 

Do you suppose it's possible that some of the other evil conspiracies you see
lurking behind every bush are also just reflections of your own fears and
misunderstanding?
