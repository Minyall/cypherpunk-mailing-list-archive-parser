Agreed, but there remains a risk even for conventional remailer uses. It
all depends on latencies, numbers of messages, etc.

Let us imagine Lucky and I are corresponding through a remailer network.
Imagine the average latency, in total, is 2 hours. (Not unreasonable.)

The kind of pattern analysis I'm talking about would look for "digrams"
between my sending a message and Lucky receiving one.

--Tim sends a message, a couple of hours later Lucky gets one.

--then nothing, and Lucky gets nothing for several hours or more

--Lucky sends a message and a couple of hours later Tim gets one

--then nothing for several hours or more

--Tim sends one, Lucky gets one a couple of hours later

It all depends on:

- how many other messages are being received by Lucky and Tim (PGP messages
arriving from remailers, obviously, not just ordinary traffic, though
ordinary traffic helps a bit)

- the latencies, the longer the better (related to the above number)

What I am picturing is a scatter plot of transmissions and receptions. I
think an adversary with access to the sends and receives, even if encrypted
(of course) could make some plausible deductions.

He could certainly rule out some message pairs, e.g., Tim sends a message,
but no message is received by, say, Perry. Or Perry sends a message, but
this is not followed within statistically expected periods by messages
received by, say, Duncan.

So the "Tim-Lucky" digram might be "0. 6" and the "Tim-Perry" digram might
be "0.003" and this would be useful in implicating likely comunicants.
Throw in the reverse paths, e.g., the "Lucky-Tim" digram and the
correlations could become quite strong.

(Closely related of course to traffic analysis in general.)

As we have been saying for years, there's a nice MS thesis in this for someone.
