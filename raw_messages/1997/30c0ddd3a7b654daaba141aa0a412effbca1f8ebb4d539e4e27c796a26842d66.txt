Sending mail is your problem alright.  It's where you get hit by
spammers etc.

Wasn't there an email forgery web page around for a while.  The idea
was that you filled in the details of who you wanted to send to, what
address you wanted it to appear you had sent it from, and paste your
message in this form box.  It did some kind of crude sendmail forgery
for you.

No problem -- run it through www.anonymizer.com first :-)

You'd not want to use the same public access account regularly.

I think the connecting to the web based interface of one of those free
web gateways via www.anonymizer.com web based interface has potential.

However I wonder how long it will last...  I mean rocket mail or
whatever admins are going to get complaints like you do as a remailer
operator.

If it gets bad, they'll do what?  Not sure -- yank your account?  You
could get another one...

Turn the whole thing off?

Might last for a while.

Really we could do with some more general distributed solution to the
delivery problem.

Email forgeries seem like an interesting solution, either via an
exitman remailer which is basically just an email forging service, or
perhaps we could add capability "forger" to the remailer code.

How much trouble can you get in with ISPs for forging email?  Do they
care?  Would wide-spread practice of forging to avoid getting spammed
in USENET would cover you well enough?  How much extra security would
it give you?  Probably quite a lot -- the sorts of person who gets
spam baited is clueless almost by definition, and won't have a clue
where the mail came from.  Unless they enlist some technical help,
they'll be forced to just discard the email.
