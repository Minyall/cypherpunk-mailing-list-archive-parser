  I was responding to Bill and Lance's comments in regard to forgery
victims being set up as targets of retribution. I think references to
"deplorable content" indicate some measure of judgement in regard to
defining what is considered 'abuse' of a remailer.
  However, you are right about the thread basically dealing with the
reprecussions to the remailer operators and their resources as an end
result of the particular modes of remailer use. At the risk of actually
being on-topic in a thread, I should point out that I have always been
of the opinion that it is up to the individual remailer operators to
judge what level and types of use they are able to provide as a service
with their given time and resources.

  True, but I doubt that the artificially generated attacks on a 
remailer are possible to fully deter, no matter what convolutions
one puts themselves through in order to stop it.

  If you are in a position where it is unwise for you to simply tell
certain people, "Learn how to use a Delete key, shit for brains!" then
this is obviously a personal cost to you for your connection to the
Cracker remailer.
  Everything you do cuts into the time you have to do other things.
Personally, I appreciate the time and resources you provide for 
supporting remailer services.
  However, when I email politicos and other public figures I often
advise them that they can only fuck so many people for so long before
the lynch mob is going to show up on their doorstep and I don't want
to hear them whining about their fate in life. I sometimes use a
remailer, even when I cc: public mailing lists (thus making the
source/identity of the post/poster obvious), just because I find
that there are many self-important jerkoffs who love to fuck with
people for the smallest of reasons, unless it actually requires
them to make a real effort to do so.
  Feel free to provide my email and/or home address to any legal
entity who has a problem with anonymous posts from my shallowly
disguised identity, but you might want to warn them that unless
their penis is long enough to reach to their own asshole, they
are not likely to profit from any suggestion I might make to them.

 Tell them you'll send them a faq/fax for their edification, and to
contact you again only if they are too ignorant to understand the
basic concepts.
  And why do you have to make him prove he's a policeman in order not
to tell him anything?
  When I deal with John Law I tell them that I will be happy to deal
with them at my convenience, unless they can provide a reasonable need
for expediency. Their alternative is to explain to a judge why they
arrested you for considering your own time as valuable as theirs, and
giving you cause to refuse to cooperate, in the process.

  You're a public figure. You're getting your fifteen minutes of
'flame'.
