        Without reviewing the list, these are all people from NGOs,
non-governmental organizations. They speak for no one but their
organizations if then. These people are no more representative of what they
might claim than is David Duke or Simon Wiesenthal. 

        Rather where it the public outrage at UN money being wasted on
giving self-important assholes a platform to promote their agendas?
