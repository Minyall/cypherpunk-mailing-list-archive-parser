you are forwarding messages to me... stop it.

remove markk@ra1.randomc.com from your mail list...


all of a sudden I'm getting mail from bunches of people

i don't know and who don't know me.


help me out... go to the place where you got my email

address and have them correct their links.




Thank you.              markk
