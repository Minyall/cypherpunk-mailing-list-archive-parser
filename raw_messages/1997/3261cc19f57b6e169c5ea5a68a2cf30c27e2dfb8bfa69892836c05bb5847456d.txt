We've kind of got throw away accounts recently, Ian Goldberg wrote a
perl script to open accounts and sendmail through a couple of the free
web based email services.

On the remailer operators list use of this script was discussed as an
alternative for remailer operators moving to `middleman' operation, or
closing down entirely in the face of threats.

There might even be a remailer or two using this ... perhaps some
remailer operators could fill us in.
