www.wired.com has a little blurb about the people at 
<http://www.auricweb.com/Accesscard.html>, apparently they're 
offering/planning to offer prepaid net access cards (similar to prepaid phone 
cards) whereby one can dial an 800 number, then enter a username/PW for 20 
mins of dialup PPP. (they don't provide E-mail accounts, you have to have 
your own provider for that.) 

More tools for tentacles.
