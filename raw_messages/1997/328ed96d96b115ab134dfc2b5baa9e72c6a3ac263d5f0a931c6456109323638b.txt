By this reasoning the mutual fund companies don't have restricted
speech either -- they are perfectly free to put whatever they want in
their prospecti -- the government will just come along and restrict
their actions, later.  Therefore, their freedom of speech is in no way
being impinged.

The fact is, a contract, by definition, implies that there are 
remedies, and an authority to enforce those remedies.  Furthermore, 
the rules that the authority uses need to be clear and explicit, and 
people entering into contracts under that authority better follow 
those rules.  In particular, they would be well advised to use speech 
in the contract that the authority understands.
