  No. Stun guns are increasingly illegal because some guy once
used one to rob a 7-11 or something, for $15.00.
  Since stopping rape is worth less than $15.00 to those who make
the laws, they have decided that a few thousand rapes is a small
price to pay to protect minuscule corporate interests.
