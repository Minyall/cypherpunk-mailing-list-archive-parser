Yes, some pathetic strange little boys swaggering around in never-never 
land.  Lonely individuals with shriveled hearts, stunted morals, and 
feverish imaginations, who brag contemptuously of their superiority
over "sheeple", and boast of their heroic roles in the coming 
revolution.

And thank you, Lucky, for enlightening me -- it isn't the OKC bomber
who is the criminal, it's the people who put their children in the
daycare center!  There's only one punishment suitable for such 
"criminally stupid" behavior!  Lock and Load!
