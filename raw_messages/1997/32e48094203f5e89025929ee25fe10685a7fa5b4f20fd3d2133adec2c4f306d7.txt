Uhhh... that's what I meant to say.  (Although I can't think of a
circumstance where the fingerprint matters if the reputation is bound
to the key only.)

While we're on the subject, why are key IDs used anyway?  People don't
really use them for anything.  Software might as well use the complete
description of the key internally.

For that matter, I'm not sure the the e-mail address and user name are
good things to associate with the key.  The e-mail address changes all
the time.  The user name should be assigned by you as part of the
authentication procedure, not by the person offering the key.
