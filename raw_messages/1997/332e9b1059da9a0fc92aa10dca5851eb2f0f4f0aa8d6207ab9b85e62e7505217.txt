It's a nice idea, and it's my preference as well.
The main schedule conflict is that someone had arranged with
Lee Tien and Cindy Cohn to talk at Cypherpunks on Jan. 10,
and I haven't heard back on whether she's been able to reschedule them
to the 17th.  Lee, Cindy, does the 17th work for you?

				Thanks!
