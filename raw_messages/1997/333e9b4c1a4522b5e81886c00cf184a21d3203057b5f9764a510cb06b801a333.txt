Why not?  It is quite convenient for coping with the non-cross posting
policy of other groups.

Also what is it with the <cpunks@manifold.algebra.com> forwards, why
are these coming to the list forwarded from that address?  Are they
things which failed your procmail filter manually forwarded
afterwards?
