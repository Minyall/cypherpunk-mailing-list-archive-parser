Yep, that's definitely Second Dynamic out-ethics to the Scienos. Of course, they'd be glad to sell you some auditing to bring you up on the tone scale.
Got a few thousand extra dollars sitting around?

I didn't make up any of this stuff -- if you care enough to learn about it, do an Altavista search on "Operation Clambake." See L. Ron Hubbard's mind in action! Read about the Galactic Confederation! Thrill to the Xenu legend! Enjoy NOT spending your money to learn this stuff!

"I mock up my reactive mind." -- A great $cientology $ecret, their Clear
Cognition. I just saved you a few grand. Tip your waitress.
