    hell, no!  I did mine, gave it all I had in the face of it until the 
    youthful idealism from the farm (despite Harvard) was shot and the 
    pure bullshit of the American ideal was exposed as the world's bully 
    --at least you knew where the commies were; our great American idealistic
    motherfuckers were nothing more than an oligarchy of military-industrial
    opportunists and power freaks.

    if I had not carried too much rank, they would have assigned me to
    retrieve the dead from the jungle detail...  the ultimate in one way
    tickets.

    even if they would pardon me for my sins of telling them to fuck-off, 
    I'll join you in potters' field --probably safer anyway....
