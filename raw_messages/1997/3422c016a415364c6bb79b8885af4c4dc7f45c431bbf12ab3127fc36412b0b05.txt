Declan forged quotes from me in his nutly news piece about Gilmore pulling
my plug.

Also, seeing much traffic cross-posted between cypherpunks and the fight-
censorship list, I sent a subscribe request to majordomo@vorlon.

I got back a robotic response saying Declan is reviewing my request...
Then nothing.  Apparenttly Declan doesn't want me reading his list.
