I would assume that, if they're interested in your postings, they'll
record them at the source, either by tapping your phone or wiretapping
your house. In that case, signing your postings would make it more
difficult to forge a posting with your name on it. On the other hand,
if they break your private key's password, you're in bigger trouble.

PGP is coming soon. In the meantime, you can use FileCrypt, which
works well with Eudora on the Mac (I'm running it under an 8.0 beta
without problems). There's a time-limited demo version at
<http://www.highware.com> It is not encumbered by export control.

Martin.
