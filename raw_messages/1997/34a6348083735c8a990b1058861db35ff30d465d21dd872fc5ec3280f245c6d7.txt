I can't think of any other way. Each congressman has one 
concern:Getting re-elected. Thus, they frame each decision in terms 
of:"How will this sound in a 30 second TV commercial aimed at the 
clueless clods who live in my district/state?" and "Could this be 
exploited by my opponent in a similair commercial?" In order to 
convince a congresscritter to do what you want, you have to put it 
into those terms.

Forget the rule of law, the Constitution, ideals, principles, values -
- - those things are *meaningless* when discussing the making of law in 
this -- or any other --  nation.
