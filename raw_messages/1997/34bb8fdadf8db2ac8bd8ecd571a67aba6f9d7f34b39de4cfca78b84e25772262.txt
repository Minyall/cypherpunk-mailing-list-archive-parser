Not identical, but we have large groups from various parts of the world,
and we are by no means ethnically uniform.  The two most numerous, of
French and British Isles descent, have very different cultures; Vancouver 
has large communities from Asia; etc. etc. And my brush is no broader than 
the "all government workers are lazy, corrupt little power-trippers"
mantra that appears here so often, uncontested.

Granted that the guns are a symptom and not the underlying problem.  
However, having them readily available makes it that much more likely 
that a person will do something regrettable in a fit of rage (or just 
plain annoyance).

Our history is not squeaky clean either, but at least we're trying to 
settle things by negotiation and referenda instead of violence.

Agreed.  There are also dedicated, hard-working, community-oriented 
policemen out there. (I'm probably going to get flamed for daring to 
say that, but tough.)
