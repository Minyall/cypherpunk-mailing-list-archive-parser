<sigh> This is really no suprise considering who is issueing the numbers.

This is rarely a problem from a data managemant posistion as SS # are key
fields. Any attempts at adding duplicates produces errors which then have
to be resolved usally manually by human intervention. Rarely are SS #'s
used exclusivly but in combination with other data (name & DOB is usaully
suffecient).

I doubt that 2 or more SS# would be issued delibratly. The only reason for
multiple SS#'s would either be screw-ups by SSA or by design of the person
applying for the SS#. I imagine that new SS# may be issued in some special
cases such as witeness relocation, perhaps after adoption, but then the
old SS# is not being used so it is not really an issue.

For all practical purposes it is. with the exception of screw-ups by SSA
ones SS # is unique and with the exception of a few rare cases mentioned
above it never changes. compare this to other identifiers and it is
obviously the most convienient id # available. Atleast 50% of the
population has 1 name change durring the cource of their lifes, Addresses
change numerious times during an average americans lifetime, and DOB's are
not unique enough to be used.

While problems do exsist with using SS#'s as id they are quite small when
compaired to using other less stable data to generate id #'s.

Really much to complex to be of use not to mention the lack of reliable
data to form the id #.

The use of DOB + Geographic Identifier + Unique Code would work quite
well.

19970601 - DOB.
0123     - Sample Geographic Identifier (say NY City).
0142     - Unique Code added to handle collisions of the above two.

I beleive that this is very simmilar to what the SSA uses though I beleive
that they only encode the year of birth when calculating SS #'s. Using Hex
rather than decimal for encoding would help greatly in redicing the number
of digits required. I would imagine that the SSA will have to go to a Hex
or complete Alphanumeric codings system as the population increases.
