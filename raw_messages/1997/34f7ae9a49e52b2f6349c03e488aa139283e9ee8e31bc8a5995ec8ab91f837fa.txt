Already been done.  RSA in 4 lines of Perl, etc...  Heck there was even a
site out that that cut a UUENCODED copy of PGP into many bits and asked
people to grab one of the bits to use as their signature.  I.e. Part 50
out of N of PGP, etc...  Someone with huge usenet archives (or cd's) could
search for all of these outside of the USA and put them together into the
whole. :)  No need to pay someone $40 to spam when people will freely do
this.

You could also take a packet radio modem and spam short wave (or
whatever packet radio uses or can use that can get outside the usa) and
send PGP that way if you like.  Or take PGP, uuencode it and fax it
outside of the USA.  Or feed it through a voice synth and read it to
a foreign phone number that has a voice decoder, or compose it as a
MIDI song as Kent suggested and broadcast the song...  Or tatoo it on your
ass then when you visit russia have someone take a picture. :)  (Though
you might then be arrested in russia for porno or whatever the laws are
there, heheheheh....)

Don't even need to use the internet to piss off the feds. :)
