Can someone post a short review of Blowfish, CAST, and IDEA? In particular
I'm interested in relative strength, resistance against known plaintext
attacks, resistance to brute force attacks, key size, relative complexity of
the algorithms, and relative computational time required for encryption and
decryption.

Pointers to prewritten documents welcomed.
