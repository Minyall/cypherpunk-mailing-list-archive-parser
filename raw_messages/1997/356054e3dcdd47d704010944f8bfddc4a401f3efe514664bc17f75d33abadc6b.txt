Trivial.  Just have pgp look at the file without giving it any commands.
I.e. instead of

	pgp -ka <filename>
do
	pgp <filename>

Pgp will examine the file, tell you it contains keys, show them to
you and then ask if you want to add them to your keyring.  This is
the way I normally add keys, just because I like to look at *any* file
before I add it to any system.
