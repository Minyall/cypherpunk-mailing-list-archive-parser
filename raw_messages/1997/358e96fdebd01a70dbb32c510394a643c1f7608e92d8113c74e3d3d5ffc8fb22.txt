I believe in separation of church and state.  The state must get out of
things like education and welfare (charity) and other things that are not
their responsibility.

The mistake was when the courts ruled that prayer could not occur in
public (government) schools.  The very next day, every government school
should have been closed down (this would also have shown the court that it
should be careful with its rulings).  And society would not have
experienced as much decay as it has.
