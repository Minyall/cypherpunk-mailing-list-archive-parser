Remailers using this could be configured to not modify the "date" header
until final delivery.  Then you can base the probablity of final delivery
upon some function of date/time or another header
"X-Remailer-Max-Delay-Time:"   If you're worried about traffic analysis,
it is possible to randomly modify the date/time header by small amounts
at each hop.  (This however only helps and somewhat loaded systems..)
