I rather doubt that it was a "slip." It takes at least a little bit of
conscious effort to type in "dlv@bwalk.dm.com".

And this will have what effect, other than harassing him? If any of the
charges made about Pomes, Burnore, Bryan and friends are true this would be
an astoundingly bad idea. And if the charges aren't true, then we'd be
harassing someone who doesn't deserve to be harassed, which is also bad.

Well, I tend to think I'm fairly harassment-proof, but I'm open to
suggestions...
