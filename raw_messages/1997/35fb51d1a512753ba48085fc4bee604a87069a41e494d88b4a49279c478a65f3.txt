C'mon Gary, why would anyone want to bother with all of this crap?
Chip implants are already in millions of pets.  It's simple, cheap,
and there's no work for the owner.

Thousands of humans are also implanted, i.e., Green Berets, Seals, and
similar types, women with breast implants, and so on.  There's a move-
ment on to implant most children, so they're not as vulnerable to kid-
napping, etc.

I realize most people are still afraid of the 666 stuff (direct evidence
from the phone company shows most people will not accept #s with 666
prefixes), but they'll get over it when they see the benefits, and how
it frees up their time so they can watch more TV or play on the Internet.
