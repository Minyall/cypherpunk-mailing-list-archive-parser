Hi again,

In the the help documentation of the shareware version of UDCM, there may
appear to be a message that reads:

Describing the algorithmic contents of the IMDMP encryption algorithm is well
beyond the scope of this on-line manual. In fact, there is currently
absolutely no documentation that exists outside of the corporate domain of
DataET Research that actually explains the IMDMP encryption algorithm in any
true detail, and DataET Research does not intend to release or disclose any
such sensitive documentation to the general public, ETC. ETC. ETC. ETC. ETC.
ETC.

PLEASE DISREGARD THE ABOVE MESSAGE COMPLETELY.

Jeremy...
President
DataET Research
