That's not as embarassing as the fact that we're running low on speakers
of Navajo in this country now.  It would be kinda convenient to have that
ability available again.  My gut feeling is that Navajo remains one of the
most poorly documented languages in the world....  government research
(funny name for it, come to think of it) into the language is probably
quite classified....
