Dear Sir,
 
I would like to request a copy of the crack 
files for Windows 95 and WFW "pwl" files if you have them.  I am 
a network engineer and I'm doing some small-time network security for a couple 
of clients.  I would like to show them just how vulnerable their network is 
to even the simplest of file utilities.  Thanks in advance for any help you 
might provide.
