   TEXTO - Text steganography
------------------------------------

   Texto is a rudimentary text steganography program which transforms
uuencoded or pgp ascii-armoured ascii data into English sentences.

   Texto text files look like something between mad libs and bad poetry,
(although they do sometimes contain deep cosmic truths) and should be
close
enough to normal english to get past simple-minded mail scanners and to
entertain readers of talk.bizarre.

  Perhaphs this explains why, when I tried it, it signed Paul Bradley's
name to the output.

_Mr._ Nobody to _you_, pal.
