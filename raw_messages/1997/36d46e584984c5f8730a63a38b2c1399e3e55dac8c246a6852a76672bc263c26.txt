How about a variant on this idea: a cypherpunks web filter that filters 
out all content which has any of the following:

Superstitious religious claptrap
Moralising on porn etc.
Anti free speech rhetoric
All government departments
All Anti-drug "war on some vegetables" rubbish
etc.
etc.
etc.


And specifically filters in as a random start page for the browser any of 
the following:

Pornography
Free speech advocacy
Hate speech 
Violent, filthy, disgusting, explicit pages showing images of death and 
torture.
Any pages graphically depicting the stories and parts of the bible the 
religious types like to forget about.
