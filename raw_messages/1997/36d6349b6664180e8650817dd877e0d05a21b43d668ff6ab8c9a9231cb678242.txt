Okay, Vulis, that's it, you have made an explicit threat in a public
forum, I know where you live, I know your phone number, in fact I once
spoke to you on the phone, and I will be suggesting to the rather slow
witted people at my local police precinct that you have already 
demonstrated unstable, threatening behavior toward many people, giving me 
good reason to believe that you are capable of assault.

This is the last you will hear from me online. Anything further will be 
stated in person.
