Some of the papers on this site don't paint a hopeful picture that quantum
computers will live up to some of its biggest boosters insofar as crypto
and factoring problems are concerned.  For example see:

http://feynman.stanford.edu/qcomp/plenio/plenio/plenio.html

Others seem down right gleeful:

http://feynman.stanford.edu/qcomp/bennett-nature95

They all seem to agree that practical quantum computers are still a long
way off.
