Sounds like what you really want is to be able to buy through these
companies without buying the insurance.

This would be a real easy service for them to provide because if they
mark it up a little bit, it's basically free money.  (They are doing
the negotiations anyway, after all.)  They don't even need to know
your name until you show up wanting to use their health care network.

The Emergency Room Scenario is a little more challenging.  One way to
deal with it is to wear some obvious signs of wealth like a $10,000
watch.  In a pinch you can give them the watch.  ;-) (Some of the
nurses won't know what it is, but the doctors will, I am sure.)

I'm pretty sure that if you are an unconscious wealthy looking person
they don't turn you away.  You really only need to survive until your
lawyer gets to the hospital with a suitcase of cash.

How do super rich people solve this problem?  You can be pretty sure
that Bill Gates self insures and protects his privacy at the same
time.  How does he do it?  How does he solve the Emergency Room
Scenario?
