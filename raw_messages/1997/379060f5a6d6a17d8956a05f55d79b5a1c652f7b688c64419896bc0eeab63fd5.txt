After reading all of these people babbling on about giving a vote of
confidence for Sandy I decided that I should also.

I have full confidence in Sandy:-)

(Well it normally works over here in the U.K...if a football manager
receives a vote of confidence from the board of directors it is a
foregone conclusion that his resignation will be handed in or his P45
will be handed out within days!)
