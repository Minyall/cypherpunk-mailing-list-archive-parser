An NBC News story this evening on the threat of CB
terrorism full-screened a closeup of Jim Bell's mug shot, 
the same as the lead photo in US News last week. The
story presented much the same line and Internet
sources of frightening information but did not balance
it with a sidebar on burgeoning anti-terrorist opportunism
as did US News.
