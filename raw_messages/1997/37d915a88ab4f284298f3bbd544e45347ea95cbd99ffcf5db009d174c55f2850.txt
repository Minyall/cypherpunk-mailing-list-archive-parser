I got the impression the author was struggling very hard not to say
	"I swear I'm not making this up"
"But I can't say that - it's Dave Barry's line"  :-)

I was also guessing keys - truck keys are a less subtle target than
box storage keys, and telling every thug in the country that 
mail trucks are an easy target, just take the keys from the carrier,
seems almost worth sounding really stupid in public to avoid.
They did say that it wasn't something they carried in their pockets,
but do mail carriers hang their keys on their belts?
My wife's guess was that they didn't want to admit they carry Mace
or equivalent, though everybody knows it.

I also enjoyed the description of one of the weapons as a
"steering wheel locking device" 
	"The Club - Police recommend it!"
