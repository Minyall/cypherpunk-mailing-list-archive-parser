A DC cypherpunk working meeting and party is tentatively scheduled for
Sunday, November 2. The party is open to all, including non-cypherpunks and
even (especially?) NSA spooks. (I somehow got suckered into organizing this
portion.)

Folks who showed up to my party and the cypherpunk meeting before it last
month remember that Marc Rotenberg and his wife at that time volunteered to
host the next one. Their home is near the National Cathedral in NW
Washington, DC. About a 20 minute walk from the Woodley Park Metro, lots of
parking.

Special guests likely will include Peter Neumann and Simon Davies.

Details forthcoming.
