The information regarding the security flaws in Stronghold comes at a
pretty dear price currently. With the increasing value of this type of
information in the corporate underworld, the bugs and backdoors in
security software that are revealed to the world make up only a small
portion of those that are known to exist by those who have the funds
to purchase them.
For every free spirit who publishes a security flaw, there are a dozen
enterpreneurs who recognize the value of the information they hold.
