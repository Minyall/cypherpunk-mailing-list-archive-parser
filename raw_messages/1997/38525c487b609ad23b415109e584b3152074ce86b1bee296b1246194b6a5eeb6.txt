It seems that unknown Cypherpunks have yet again shown their disrespect of
US export laws by exporting the latest version of PGP. The Windows version
of PGP 5.5 is now available for your downloading pleasure at
ftp://ftp.replay.com/pub/crypto/incoming/PGP55.zip

PGP 5.5 features superior LDAP keyserver integration, multiple signature
categories, and automatic decryption (set Preferences -> Email ->
Automatically Decrypt).

"You heard the rumors. Now try it yourself." :-)

-- Lucky Green <shamrock@cypherpunks.to> PGP encrypted email preferred.
   "Tonga? Where the hell is Tonga? They have Cypherpunks there?"
