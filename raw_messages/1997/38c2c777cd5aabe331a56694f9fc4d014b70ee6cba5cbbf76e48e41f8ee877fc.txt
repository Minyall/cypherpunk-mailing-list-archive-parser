I forward articles to cypherpunks that are copyrighted by my employers, or
magazines like Playboy and Wired for which I write freelance pieces. 

I like to think these articles have some value. I will not forward any of
them, nor would I be able to, if they magically became "public domain."

"De facto public domain" is an idea that deserves to die. Now.
