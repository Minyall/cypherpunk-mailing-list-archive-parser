I received a copy of this earlier today via a low-traffic mailing list
devoted to discussion of prisoner's dilemma games.  Upon receiving
the message, the connection between PDG and Jim Bell wasn't 
immediately obvious, but then I remembered that Jim Bell was
also a subscriber to that mailing list.

It's quite probable that the IRS sent a copy of their press release
to all of the forums where they had records of Bell's involvement.

Did others receive this message directly, or via mailing lists?
