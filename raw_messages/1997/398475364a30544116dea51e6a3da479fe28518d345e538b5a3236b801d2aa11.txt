The Real Revolution: Net Guerrillas
by Elizabeth Frantz
   
       The recent kidnapping and assassination of Spanish politician
   Miguel Angel Blanco by the Basque separatist group ETA has ignited a
   violent backlash that is spilling into cyberspace.

       In the wake of the widespread protest against ETA, the Spanish
   government requested last week that the Cable News Network (CNN)
   remove its link to the group's web site. Miguel Garzon, spokesman for
   the Spanish Embassy in Washington D.C., defended the move by saying
   the ETA should be considered terrorist and not separatist, and
   therefore links should not be made to them. The ETA has killed nearly
   800 people since it took up arms in 1968 to fight for independence for
   Spain's northern Basque provinces.

       CNN refused the Spanish government's request, saying that it was
   standard practice to provide links that relate to the subject matter
   -- even if the subject is terrorism. More and more terrorist groups
   are creating pockets of resistance online, a fact that is beginning to
   raise serious questions, especially for educational institutions,
   where John Q. Taxpayer might be indirectly paying for a Zapatista web
   site.
