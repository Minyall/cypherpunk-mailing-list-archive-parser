Forty years ago Singapore was poor and at risk of being wiped out by Malays 
or Commies or both.  (Maylays killed 1 Meg of their own Chinese in the '60s.) 
 I'm sure that a few decades of being rich and safe will engender in that 
population a liking for social freedom.  They are currently more economically 
free than we are.  We rate 5th and they are 2nd or 3rd on the two indices of 
economic freedom.  They have many personal freedoms as well.  They have 
speech restrictions but are quite outspoken in any case.  The gum and 
spitting and smoking restrictions are no different than the smoking bans and 
such we are coming to live under.  We have one-party rule too.
