I'll be participating in a Time Online chat this
evening at 8 pm EST. Our guests will be Chris
Hansen from the ACLU and Bruce Taylor, a longtime CDA
supporter and head of the National Law Center for
Children and Families.

We'll be talking about the White House censorware
summit, self-rating of news sites, and free speech
online in general.

You can participate in the chat as long as
your browser supports frames, but the Ichat client
software is more stable:
