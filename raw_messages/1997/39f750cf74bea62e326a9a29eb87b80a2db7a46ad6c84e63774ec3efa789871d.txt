I gave the original program a quick try.  I looked at /proc
and saw the correct number of file descriptors, but a 
netstat|grep on my userid did not show any actual connections. 

I put it aside and was going to step through it with the
debugger when I got a free moment, and report back when
I had figured out what the problem was.
