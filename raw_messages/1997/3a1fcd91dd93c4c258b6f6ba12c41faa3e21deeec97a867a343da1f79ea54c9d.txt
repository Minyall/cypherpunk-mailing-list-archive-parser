Follow your own advice.  All this crap about NETCenter has nothing 
to do with our civil liberties.  Whether NETCenter is a good idea or 
not is a completely separable issue (which I see Tim May just covered
thoroughly), and is merely a fig leaf offered to spineless
Congresscritters to deflect some of the "criticism" they might
otherwise be subjected to on the law enforcement "issue".  The fact
that White offers it shows that he is just as spineless.

We shouldn't have to "trick" Congress into doing the right thing, 
or provide cover for them either.

As you say, though, let's keep this debate framed with our criteria:
Do you, Congressman, support the constitutional guarantee of free
speech, or not?
