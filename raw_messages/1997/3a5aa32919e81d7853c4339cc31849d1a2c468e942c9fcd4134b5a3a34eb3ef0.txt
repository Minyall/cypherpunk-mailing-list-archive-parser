"French coders go on strike"

France's 260 Foreign Ministry coders, who decipher top security messages,
went on strike yesterday for the first time since their department was 
set up in the 1960s.

The strike is over career status, the lack of recruits and the impact of
new technologies. Talks are to be held tomorrow. AFP, Paris
