Not maybe at all. The IETF will require a second, interoperable
implementation for standardization of OpenPGP.  Its sad that the
interoperable SSH was written for Pilots, since it uses some libraries
there that are not portable.

Pretty Good, not Perfectly Strong.

Never underestimate the value of pretty good security.  The bad guys
use scanners that need to work in real time; even 40 bit crypto with a
30 second delay creates huge headaches.  I see a PGP encrypted
message, even with encrypt to self on as pretty good.  Sure, its not
sealed with a two color wax seal in a tyvek envelope, but its pretty
good.
