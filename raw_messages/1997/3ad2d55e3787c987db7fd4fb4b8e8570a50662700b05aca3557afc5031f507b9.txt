During a recent application for crypto export approval, which should have
been routine, we were contacted by an individual from the *FBI* (not from
BXA) who refused our export license because we didn't have a key recovery
system *in place now*. This is despite the facts that:

- the export license was to use our strong cryptography products for
  communications between our international sales offices and head office;
  this used to be a rubber-stamp license, and

- we are in the process of implementing key recovery technology as part of a
  a seperate export approval for our DES-56 products.

I couldn't even get an answer as to why the FBI had jurisdiction over our
export approval.
