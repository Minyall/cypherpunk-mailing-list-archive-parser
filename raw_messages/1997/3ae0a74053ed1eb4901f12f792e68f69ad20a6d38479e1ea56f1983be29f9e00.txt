Sigh, as we well know this is another ammendment (for another good example 
look at say the 18th) which degrades the US constitution and bill of 
rights by making the whole thing self contradictory. I now assume that 
flag burning will have penalties, and that "inciting" flag burning will 
be criminal???

All of those in the US: Time to get out the stars and stripes, some gasoline 
and the matches.
