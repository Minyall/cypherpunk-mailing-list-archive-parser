Zooko Journeyman sez:

[..]
: In other news, I'm going to  HIP  
: and I'm thinking I should have a t-shirt made to piss off the
: self-righteous socialist anti-spam activists.  My favorite 
: slogan so far is "I may disagree with every spam you send, but
: I will defend to the death your right to spam it. --Voltaire".

Hehe, bring me such a T-shirt *g*

: I consider this to be a powerful meme to broadcast at those
: low-tech lawmongers, but it isn't sufficiently.. um.. offensive.
: Any suggestions from the peanut gallery?
