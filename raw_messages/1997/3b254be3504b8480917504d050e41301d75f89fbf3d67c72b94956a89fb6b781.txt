As I stated in my previous post the Nolan chart is flawed. In it's
attempts to be "two-dimensional" it artificially separates interdependent
philosophies. Economic Freedom = Personal Freedom. You can not have one
without the other. The major failings of the socialist is their
unwillingness to accept this fact. A free society can not survive under a
socialist regime any more that a totalitarian society can survive under a
capitalist one.
