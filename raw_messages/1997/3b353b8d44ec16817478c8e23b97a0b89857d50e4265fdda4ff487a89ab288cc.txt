The militia is different from the military force.  The U.S. Constitution
explicitly states in Article I, Section 8, that the militia may be called
forth (by the federal government) to enforce federal law.  The army and
other military forces, however, were not given this power and were not
intended to be permanent establishments, either.  The reason for the
establishment of the militia was to provide for a permanent defense force
avoiding the dangers to liberty of a standing army.  The army was never
intended to be used for law enforcement and could only be used against
American citizens in a time of rebellion, such as the Civil War.  Over
a hundred years ago, the Posse Comitatus Act was passed which forbid the
military from arresting or questioning American citizens.
