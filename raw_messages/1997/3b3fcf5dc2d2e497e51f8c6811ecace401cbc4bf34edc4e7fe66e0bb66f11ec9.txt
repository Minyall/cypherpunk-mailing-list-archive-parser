This sounds absurd but similar things have happened.

The translation team for the Dead Sea Scrolls tried to keep the actual
texts secret so they would be the only ones with the "Official"
translation.  They did, however, publish tables of what words were used
and their location for use by researchers.  A couple of them got the idea
to use the lookup table to reconstruct the text.  The results were a copy
of the original text.  (Needless to say, the "official" translation team
was quite upset.)  It did finally result in the publication of the
scrolls, since the information had been "leaked".

I wonder if it is legal to provide comprehensive cross-references of code.
(Probably not, as the laws seem to be formulated under the legal principle
of "I win, You lose".
