I like this. Writing effective program code -- computer instructions -- is
important, but so is writing effective language code. Language is
essentially another kind of "code" with its own set of interpreters etc. So
quite possibly the Horsemen "meme," a hardy, propogating viral code, could
be rendered useless when the right antiviral meme is introduced to the
datasphere. William S. Burroughs has already outlined language hacking
details in what I consider to be a seminal proto-cypherpunk text, _The
Electronic Revolution_. Long out of print, but online at
