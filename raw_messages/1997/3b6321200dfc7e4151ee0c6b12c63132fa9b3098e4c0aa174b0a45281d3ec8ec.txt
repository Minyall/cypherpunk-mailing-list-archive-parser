An excellent idea!  Also reposting their garbage from bofh.*
to news.* and alt.flame. :-)

I'd suggest:
 1. "Reposting the article so it can be archived" on top;
 2. Slight alterations of the text (introducing spelling errors etc)
 3. A disparaging remark at the bottom ("what a maroon", "get a clue", etc)

This can be done better by a computer program than by a human being...
