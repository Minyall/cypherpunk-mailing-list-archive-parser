In today's (06/18/97) Wall Street Journal there is an article on Anonymous
e-mail in the corporate environment.  Talks about companies who have set
up systems to recieve anonymous e-mail from employees to deal with
specific situations in the workplace.  Interesting stuff and very
positive.  (A few negatives were listed, but more as sidenotes than
anything.)

Page B-1 has the article.  This time I will be making a copy...
