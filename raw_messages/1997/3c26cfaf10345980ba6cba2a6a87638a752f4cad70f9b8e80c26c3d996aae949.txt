We've received another doc by cryptographer William H. Payne 
that preceded his NSA suit, sent to the Director of NSA, which 
claims to contain classified information on NSA crypto algorithms:

It amplifies information in the suit, and includes provocative material 
that was suit-and-tied for court.

There's governmental information via Altavista about Mr. Payne's 
parallel dispute with DOE.
