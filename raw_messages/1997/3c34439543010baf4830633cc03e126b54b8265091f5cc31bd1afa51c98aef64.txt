[COAL DUST SALOON, Bienfait, Saskatchewan: CNN] A BAR WHORE donated to
the TruthMailer operator by the local chapter of "Ladies Against Women"
announced to gathered reporters, after showing them her tits for ten
dollars, that the bodies of the Whitehouse occupants and the scattered 
body parts of the members of the Mayonnaise Mountain assault teams had
been examined by the Coal Dust Saloon bar owners, who had declared,
"Those fuckers were crazy, alright, messing with the CypherPunks."

  Chief CypherPunks Spokesperson, Anonymous, declared that the merry
band of anarchists was happy to be exonerated in the face of claims
by the head of the American Medical Association that those slain by
the CypherPunks were mentally stable.
  "We were certain that the opinion of our own psychiatric specialists,
Dr. Dimitri Vulis, KOTM, and the world-renounced Dr. Grubor, would be
upheld by the Circle of Eunuchs schills who count on the Last Canadian
Outlaw to singlehandedly keep their bar operating in the black."

  When asked about the Coal Dust Saloon bar owners' decision in regard
to the mental stability of Jon Bonet Ramsey, Anonymous leaned over and
whispered to the Canadian Nutly News reportwhore, "If anybody asks, I
was with _you_ when the little tart 'bought it', OK? Can I buy you a
beer?"
