Hmm, let's see: increased taxes, increased interest rates, banning all
handguns, the current hunting ban boondoggle, British Airways on strike... 
somehow I think that 'New Labour' are doing pretty well at instigating
their own program of mismanagement.

Of course, a government which made banning handguns one of it's first
priorities and banning hunting one of the second is hardly likely to be 
a government which will look gladly on the unrestricted use of cryptography.
I won't mention the 'Prevention of Terrorism' act.
