Sounds like a headache to me: people use wildly different machines to
handle their e-mail. Some places use 25 MHz '486 machines, others use
300 MHz Pentium-IIs, a difference of 1-2 orders of magnitude? Collision
search is also easy to parallelize over a network, so the load can be
shared using, say, 50 Pentium-II 300MHz PCs, costing less than $100,000
(we don't need lots of disk or memory, just a fast CPU). Here's at least
three orders of magnitude for you.

The '486 may be used by a school, while the 50 Pentium-II machines
are owned by Spamford W., Esq. Now we're faced with a dilemma: we either
limit the school's outgoing e-mail capacity severely, or Spamford will
keep on sending spam. For every thousand messages the school sends
Spamford can send a million. 

The risk: starting a CPU arms race.
