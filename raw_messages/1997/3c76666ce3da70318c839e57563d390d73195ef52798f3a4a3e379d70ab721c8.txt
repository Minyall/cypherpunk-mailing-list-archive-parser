I assume that the draft KRAP legislation at CDT Peter Junger cited 
here is what Markoff refers to:

   http://www.cdt.org/crypto/970312_admin.html

Anyone know of other KR/TTF drafts in the US, UK, FR, JP, AU or elsewhere
among the 29 signators of Wassenaar?

The Wassenaariors have a wider ambition than the OECDistes.
