No, it is time WE take responsibility back for our actions and control our
own lives and quit abrogating it to some asshole who will promise anything
to get us to give them money for nothing (ie taxes).

            Sometimes it is said that man cannot be trusted with the
            government of himself.  Can he, then, be trusted with
            the government of others? Or have we found angels in the
            forms of kings to govern him?  Let history answer this
            question.
