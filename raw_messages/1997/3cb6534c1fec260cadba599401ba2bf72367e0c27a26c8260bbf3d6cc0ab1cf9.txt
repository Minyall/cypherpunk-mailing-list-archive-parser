This is actually not the case. I live between Santa Cruz and Salinas and
Monterey, home to some of the most fertile soil in the world (most of the
lettuce, strawberries, artichokes, and other vegetables consumed in the
U.S. is/are grown within 30 miles of me). Every day I see stoop laborers,
up from Jalisco or Michuchan or other provinces, glad to make more in a few
months here than they make in a few years back in Mexico.

And every day I see bums, drifters, winos, layabouts, and derelicts,
holding up their pathetic "Will work for food" signs. (Which are lies, of
course. Anyone trying to get some decent work out of these bums will find
zilch.)

I saw a great bumper sticker on the back of a truck filled with spray
painting gear. Driven by a black guy, interesting enough. It said:

"I _do_ work for food."

By the way, this massive purchase of votes is now being rolled back.
Immigration is planning to reverse many of these "instant citizenship"
deals. Too late to have an effect on Clinton's '96 election, but nothing
could have saved Dole.
