While it _is_ totally uncensored again, it's the Net, you can be
flamed for anything, so you have to decide what level of annoyance
to ignore and what level to make you give up.  

In the case of Cypherpunks, there are a few consistent flamers who will 
not only flame you for everything you post, but will also reply to your post
with a flame against Gilmore and Sameer :-)  Flaming back doesn't make them
go away (one of them has even started roboposting flames to the list
in response to his other flames), but Eudora or procmail filters make 
them vanish almost entirely.....
