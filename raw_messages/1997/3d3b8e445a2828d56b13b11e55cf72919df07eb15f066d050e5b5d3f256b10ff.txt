You have been paying NO attention at all, no wonder you are having a hard
time trying to figure it out. Concentrate now, I DO NOT want to picket
anyone for anything at anytime. I have better things to do with my time like
spend my money in another store.

It HAS been my contention from my original post that I DO NOT think this is
a good idea.

I am going to decline responding to the remiander of this since it is a
waste of my meta-carpal tunnel syndrome.
