Spoofing Congress

  Fake e-mail floods Capitol Hill

  NO, THESE weren't lobbyists pummeling members
  of Congress with propaganda, but apparently
  pranksters under the guise of legitimate Net users. In
  recent weeks, they have flooded lawmakers with
  hundreds of e-mail threats to delete all files in the
  Capitol Hill computer system. One of the identities
  used was that of Mercury News Computing Editor
  Dan Gillmor in the ruse that included 200 messages to Sen. Barbara
  Boxer, D-Calif. The FBI is looking into the incidents of "spoofing,"
  but apparently no damage has yet been found.
