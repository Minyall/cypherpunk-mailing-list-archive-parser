The advantage is that it doesn't need to be online, and being online
is sometimes inconvenient, and sometimes increases your transaction costs.
For some applications, such as wallets, being online means trusting the
telecom facilities provided by the person you're exchanging money with,
which also requires more protocol support.

There is another approach, which is the observer stuff from Stefan Brands,
or whatever he's working on these days, using some sort of "trusted" 
processing component in the wallet to prevent double-spending.
