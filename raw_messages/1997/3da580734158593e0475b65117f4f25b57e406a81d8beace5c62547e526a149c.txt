Jim,
  I suggest getting in touch with Lance Cottrell (loki@Cyberpass.net)
ASAP and coordinating with him as he has the facilities to host the
entire list, but desires the distributed approach.  He is currently
gating Cypherpunks-unedited@toad.com to subscribers of
cypherpunks@Cyberpass.net.  He would make an excellent third link in
the chain and seems to be willing.

Furthermore, he has also indicated that he is eventually interested in
gating back and forth to the newly created and already-active
alt.cypherpunks.  He needs help and information on just how to do
that, though.  This would complete the circle, syncing all the
available routes to cypherpunks.  All will benefit by having the
choice of mail-filters and/or newsreading facilities to experience the
unfiltered/unedited/unstoppable list.

Hope the experiments prove sturdy and wish all best of luck.

me
