Not just cities, quite small towns and residential areas have now taken 
to using citizen-units tax money installing systems to spy on the very 
same people. I have now taken to not visiting a town near me (Hastings) 
because of the CCTV systems in place. Not content with spying on citizens 
going about their business in towns a number of state funded colleges and 
universities are now installing CCTV systems. Presumably audio "bugs" 
will also be in order to ensure the student-units do not say anything 
unseemly or hinting at some form of intellectual heresy.

Also, a number of car alarm manufacturers are now producing systems to 
track cars using GPS so if the car is stolen the police can track its 
movements. I can quite easily envisage a situation in a few years time 
when it is mandated that all new cars produced must be fitted with such 
systems so that the government can track the movement of citizens.

One cannot now go out of ones own house without being monitored, and for 
those of us who are known heretics maybe even that is not true.
