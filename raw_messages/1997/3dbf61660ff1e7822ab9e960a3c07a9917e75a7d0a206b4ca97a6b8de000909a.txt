Very good.  If I had the time, I would have used the same #ifdefs used in
my cancelbot (available at http://www.thecia.net/~kibo/cancelbot.html, btw)
to make a Windows 95 binary.

Somehow I think the people most likely to use this would be running W95 and
have no C compiler, rather than running a flavor of Unix/Linux.

Perhaps someless than busy than I am can do this. :-)
