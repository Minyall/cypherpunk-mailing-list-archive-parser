Hi,

For those of you that may be responding to some of my post you should be
aware that the To: & Cc: lines are being modified. This is being done by
my PGP auto-encrypt scripts. A complete distributution list is provided in
the header of the message on the X-Distributution: line.

This is just to make you aware that even though your address is the only
one in the To: or Cc: lines the message may have been distributed to
others including to one of the cypherpunks list.

Please check the X-Distribution: line before assuming that it is a private
correspondence.

Thanks,
