-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Not too long ago, I attempted to post a PGP signed
message to a STUMP moderated newsgroup. Even though
the moderators approved my post, it never arrived
because of sme technical problem with PGP and STUMP.
The people running the newsgroup never could figure
out what went wrong, and my post never made it
in spite of the best efforts of those running the newsgroup.

I advise caution with STUMP.
