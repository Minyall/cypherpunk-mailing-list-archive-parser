Eric's phone I thought operated as a bump in the line for landline.
The phone was acting as a speaker and microphone, and also is used to
make the connection via tone dial?  The `bump' switched to 14.4k modem
when you pressed go secure, and did A/D, D/A, encrypt, and decrypt.

An encrypting cell-phone would be an interesting project.

What about starting from a digital GSM phone - it already has all the
A/D, and ability to maintain digital connection across hand-offs.

I would have thought the extra hardware would be minimal - a RISC chip
with on chip RAM and EPROM to encrypt and decrypt.

GSM includes A5 encryption here, so basically the whole design is worked out
- all you'd have to do is rip out the A5 chip and replace with a decent
encryption system.  Anyone know how modular the design is, for instance if
it would be possible to give a GSM A5 based cell phone a crypto upgrade
using published electrical interface standards?  (I want one of those -
Nokia phone with IDEA + 2048 bit RSA signatures + DH forward secrecy!)
