Got a cite for this? I can't seem to find any authority for it. It sounds
to me like a simple economic calculation (it's not worthwhile to sue
noncommercial users for infringement because they usually don't have enough
$ to even pay for the litigation, and "IBM sues 70-year old grandmother"
makes for poor public relations) that got turned into "law" by the
machinery of urban legend.
