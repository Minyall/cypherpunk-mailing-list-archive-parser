  Jeez, Ray. If you follow this twisted train of logic, you end up
expecting the President and the Legislature to take responsibility for
the State of the Union.
  Are you some kind of godless Commie, or something? You'll certainly
feel foolish when the FBI lab proves that the trigger was pulled by
a drug dealer who was told to do so by a child molester. It's just a
shame that those poor federal agents had to be there to witness the
tragedy.
