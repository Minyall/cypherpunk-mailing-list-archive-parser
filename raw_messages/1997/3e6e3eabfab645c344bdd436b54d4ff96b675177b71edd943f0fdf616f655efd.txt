Sources of pictures aren't really the problem, though -- it's
developing the widespread habit of people sending references to
pictures along with their email.  For example, if the "cool thing to
do" was to note a link to a favorite photo in your sig (as I have
done, below), then people who were interested in communicating
privately could build up a significant cache of shared pictures.  Code
to automatically compare pictures with the previous version, and
decrypt the embedded messages is no big deal -- the big deal is 
getting people to habitually include links to pictures -- or sound 
files, or whatever...
