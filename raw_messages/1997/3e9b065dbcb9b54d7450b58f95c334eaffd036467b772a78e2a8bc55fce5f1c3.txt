Well Dimitri has his own unique way of putting things. :)

This is my understanding of the issue that Dimitri has brought up:

- -- Chris Lewis is activly persuing a cource of censorship by forging &
canceling messages on USENET.

- -- Because of this activity Chris Lewis has low reputation capital.

- -- Nortel, by employing Chris Lewis, has reduced their reputation capital.

- -- Because of Nortel's reduced reputation capital their security products
are suspect.

Now, myself would require more information as to Chris Lewis' envolvement
with Nortel & their security products before I would be willing to come to
the same conclution that Dimitri has.

If Chris Lewis is only a janitor for Nortel I can not see how is
reputation capital would affect Nortel's. On the other hand if he was
activly involved with their security products or in a management position
where he could influance desisions about thier security products then I
would be apt to call into question just how secure their products were.

Of cource if they released thier source code then one could check for
themselfs the trustworthyness of their product.
