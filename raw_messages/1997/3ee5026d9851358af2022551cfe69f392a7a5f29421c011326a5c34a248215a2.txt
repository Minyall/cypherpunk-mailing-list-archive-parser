	To whom it may concern:





	My name is Nadeshda Vargas Stepanenko, I`m  a Law Student from Mexico

City and I`m writing this letter because in one of my classes I was

asigned to do a discertation on what can be done to control the Internet

in relation to it`s content and use, to protect the public at large

using the methods to protect your privacy.  I have found a lot of

information of these servidors, but the reason to write this e-mail is

for asking some questions about the subject:





	1) It would be convenient to legislate this methods?



	2) You can use them, for example, in Mexico?



	3) Do you think it would be necessary to create an International

Association for solving the problems in the Internet?



	4) What do you think about legislation of the Internet, and how the

lawyers may resolve these situations?





	I would be very thankful if you send me only a briefly opinion about

this questions, it is very important for me because it is not an easy

job.
