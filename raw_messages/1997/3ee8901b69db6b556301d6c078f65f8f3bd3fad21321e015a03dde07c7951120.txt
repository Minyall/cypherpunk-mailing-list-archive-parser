The (comparatively) free market telecom system in New Zealand is due
to a LEFT WING, pro liberty, government, that adopted a strategy 
"let us privatize first and let the free market sort out the chaos 
later"

The equivalent in America is almost unimaginable.  Here in America left
means statist, left means big brother is in charge.  The same is true,
or used to be true when I was there, in Australia, though not to the
extreme that it is true in America.
