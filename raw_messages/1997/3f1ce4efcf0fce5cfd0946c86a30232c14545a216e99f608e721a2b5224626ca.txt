Yep. While there are much better options, I think PGP's CMR would be a
tolerable short-term solution for stored data. The problem is that it's
not for stored data, it's for email (or so 'Commerical MESSAGE Recovery')
would imply.

Note that solely using CMR for stored data would not require that the CMR
'feature' be built into freeware or personal versions of PGP, but only into
the corporate version. That in itself would be a big win.
