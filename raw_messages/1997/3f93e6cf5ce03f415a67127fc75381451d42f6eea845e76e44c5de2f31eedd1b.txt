There are plenty of Net-cams watching traffic or sunsets around the world.
Since these images tend to change a bit from frame to frame they could
cheaply and reliably provide the sorts of images which are ideal for stego.
I'm not sure if you can frame-grab from such a changing Web page with the
current browser features, but this should be a significant hurdle.
