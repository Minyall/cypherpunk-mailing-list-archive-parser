  If I had a dime for everyone who wants to make my life 'better' by
'protecting' me from 'bad people' (others, not 'them'), then I'd be
able to contribute to CypherPunks under the 'dollar a post' system
evisioned by the guy (I have escaped his name) willing to put a few
gallons of gas less in his Cadillac every week so that his viewpoint
won't have any competition from the masses.
