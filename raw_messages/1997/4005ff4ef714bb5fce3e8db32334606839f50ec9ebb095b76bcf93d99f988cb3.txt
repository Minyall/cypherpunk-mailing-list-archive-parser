Welp, I've been on this list for a long, long time, since its inception
way back when.  I haven't posted much, lately; mostly lurking and watching
and, occasionally giggling at the foolishness that has gone on in recent
months (i'm a sociologist by education, so watch this list as a "culture
in motion" may someday make for an interesting paper :-). Ever since the
internet was shot in the foot by a pair of lawyers selling green cards, I
was waiting for the chaos to reach this list.  It's here now. 

I have no problems with the idea of moderating this list.  If people wanna
waste my time with SPAM and petty flamewars, they shoudl do it in an
appropriate forum.  I've been here since the beginning, and continue to be
here, because I have an interest in crypto, crypto policy, and the
politics surrounding it.  Not to irk my system administrator with a daily
dose of CypherSPAM coming through her system.

And if a don't like the moderation decisions, by golly I can go somewhere
else.  Nice thing is that anybody else can as well.
