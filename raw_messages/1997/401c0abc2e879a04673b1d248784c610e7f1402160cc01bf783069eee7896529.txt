I've been enjoying the 1996 Wiretap report.  A couple of my favorite
observations are:

(1) Of the 1149 intercept applications authorized for 1996,  
    821 were for "Narcotics" and 114 were for "Gambling".  
    I.e., 81% of the authorized intercepts were targeted at good old
    fashioned entrepreneurs.

(2) In the past 11 years (1986 - 1996) a total of 9,912 intercept
    applications were approved.  Of that number 5 (five!) were for
    "Arson, explosives, and weapons."  Unless they've classified wiretaps
    against "suspected terrorists" in the "Other" category, it looks
    as if the LEOs don't think (targeted) wiretaps are useful for stopping
    small groups of modestly skilled people bent on blowing things up. No Shit.
