<sigh> I would have thought that Jim would be smarter than leaving such
info on his computer unencrypted. I find it equally troubling that he
would put such info in "writting" to begin with.

Ofcource since no inventory was done of the documents contained on his HD
the FEDS could plant anything that they wanted with little hope of proving
that they did.

I'm not quite sure how one could counter against such an attack. Even if
one stored all documents in an encrypted partition there are still
protions of the HD that the OS will require to be unencrypted. Perhaps
have a boot disk that would decrypt the OS section of the HD then boot the
OS off the HD which then would use a crypto IFS to accesses the remainder
of the drive. Even going to these lenghts they could just put what they
wanted on a floppy and claim that they "found" it.

I guess the only *real* solution is to get rid of the thugs.
