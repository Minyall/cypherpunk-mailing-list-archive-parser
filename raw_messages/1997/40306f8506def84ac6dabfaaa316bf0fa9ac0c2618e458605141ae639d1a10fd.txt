Fuck GATT!!

This is one of the reasons that I opposed GATT as it subverts the
Constitutional powers of Congress to International bodies that I had no
say in electing!! (even if I did I don't want some fuckup from the UN or
the EEO determining US law.)

Do not take this as an advocacy for submarine patents, as it is not.

Personally I hope that the patent issue will be a big enough of one to
piss Washington off enough to pull out of GATT!!
