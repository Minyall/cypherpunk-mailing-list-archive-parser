  No, it's really fairly simple if you remember a few basics:

1. Tokens will be used for posting on Sunday through Wednesday.

2. Left-handed people can only post between 4 and 6 p.m.

3. People whose last names start with the letters 'a' through
'm' will not have to follow the 'Random Rules'.

4. People whose last names start with the letters 'n' through
'z' will be required to follow the 'Random Rules', but they 
will not be told what they are until the day following their
post. (otherwise, it would destroy the whole idea behind 
randomizing the posting rules)

5. Dr. DV K will be given two seperate tokens each day.  One
token will allow him to post a message containing the word
'cock', and the other one will allow him to post a message
containing the word 'sucker'.

6. People posting messages such as 'this' one will, eventually,
after reading their own postings, realize that they don't have
a 'real' life, and kill themselves--thus becoming a solution
to their own problem.
