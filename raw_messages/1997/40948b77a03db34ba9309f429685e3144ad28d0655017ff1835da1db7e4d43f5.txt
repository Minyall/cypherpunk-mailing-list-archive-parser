Here's another good idea for a cypherpunks project: *don't* use the
Eternity Server to post even more bomb-making instructions all over the
Web and Usenet.

You might remember I wrote recently about the DoJ report released this
month that calls for new legislation to ban bomb-making info online. Now
Feinstein's office tells me she's going to introduce a bill. 

No need to throw red meat to the hounds.

(Hmmm. Looking back at my message, I'm essentially saying "censor
yourself or the government will." Not sure I like that argument.)
