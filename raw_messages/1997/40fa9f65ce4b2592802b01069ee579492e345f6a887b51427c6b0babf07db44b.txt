Two May 13 Federal Register notices by NIST:

NIST is planning to develop a FIPS for Public-Key Based 
Cryptographic Key Agreement and Exchange. This notice 
solicits comments regarding techniques for consideration
specifically including RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and Elliptic Curve
techniques. This standard will be for use in designing and 
implementing public-key based key agreement and exchange 
systems which Federal departments and agencies operate or 
which are operated for them under contract. More than one 
algorithm may be specified, consistent with sound security 
practices, to enable Federal departments and agencies
enhanced flexibility in the design, implementation, and use of
cryptographic systems.

NIST is planning to develop a proposed revision to Federal
Information Processing Standard 186, Digital Signature 
Standard. This revision would specify additional public-key 
based digital signature algorithms (in addition to the Digital 
Signature Algorithm [DSA]) for use in designing and implementing 
public-key based signature systems which Federal departments 
and agencies operate or which are operated for them under 
contract. The purpose of the revision will be to enable
Federal departments and agencies greater flexibility, consistent 
with sound security practices, in the design, implementation, 
and use of public-key based digital signature systems.
