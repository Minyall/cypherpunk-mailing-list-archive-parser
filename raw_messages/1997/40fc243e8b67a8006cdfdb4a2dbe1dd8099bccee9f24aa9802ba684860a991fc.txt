Does anyone here who didn`t recieve a copy of the mail recall if they 
ever mailed Jim directly, and not through the list?

The way I see it there are two possible ways the motherfuckers got the 
addresses, either they found the lists Jim subscribed to and did "who 
cypherpunks" etc. to the servers, to get the list of participants, or 
they used any adresses off the mail jim has recieved in the past, I got a 
copy of it and I have privately emailed Jim several times so I can`t 
really say which is more likely.

If it is the second I am hereby giving Jim a public dresssing down for 
not encrypting the filesystem ;-)....

The sending of this email to people Jim has communicated with, if it was 
a real mail (I haven`t checked before but other people have and have said 
the headers indicate it passed through several .gov hosts), constitutes 
cowardly harrasment. Lock and Load.
