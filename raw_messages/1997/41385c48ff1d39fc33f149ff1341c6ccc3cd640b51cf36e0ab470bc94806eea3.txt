Choosing to not become a member of the collective society/mindset the government
has put in place will soon become illegal.  Money laundering is illegal for a
very simple reason everything is becoming illegal: Control.  Money laundering prevents
the government to "control" your money.  When they could not take your money in the
interest of national/public/child safety for such wasteful ventures like the perpetual
war on drugs ,and when you thought for yourself and realized how wasteful it all was 
and that you would not willing give your money the government made it illegal to hide
your money.  Then they came up with asset forfeiture laws to legally take your vaporware,
commonly referred to as 'money'.
