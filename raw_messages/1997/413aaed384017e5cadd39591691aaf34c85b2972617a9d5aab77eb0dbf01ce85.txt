Thee InterNet is not a collection of machines, but a social
relation among people, *mediated* by nothing.

Thee InterNet is *capital* to such a degree of accumulation
that it becomes a machine.

Thee InterNet which eliminates all geographical distance 
reproduces distance internally as *spectacular* separation.

InterNet theory is now the *enemy* of all InterNet ideology
and knows it.
