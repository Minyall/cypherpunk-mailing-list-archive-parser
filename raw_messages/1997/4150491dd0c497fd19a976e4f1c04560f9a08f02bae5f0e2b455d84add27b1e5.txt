IANAL, but if I convert my MAK-90 to fire full-auto, and I get caught with
it, I am going to spend some serious time in prison regardless of whether
or not I had a clue that doing so was illegal, or whether I even knew the
weapon had been converted.  Mere posession of such a device is sufficient
to convict me.  I think the antipiracy law will probably be enforced
"cherry on the sundae" style--I doubt cops will do house-to-house searches
looking for illegal copies of things, but if you get busted for something
else, they will probably throw piracy charges in to get you to plea
bargain.
