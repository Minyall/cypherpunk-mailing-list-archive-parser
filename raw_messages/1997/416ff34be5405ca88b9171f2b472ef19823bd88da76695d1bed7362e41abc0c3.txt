I can think of many examples of very bad code that is difficult to use but
is very popular, an obvious one is that Apple wrote better code than MS.

Even most sheeple rely on whatever is built in to MSWord or Excel than on
PGP, so on that basis there is *NO* existing example of such code.

So, not only do cypherpunks have to write code, it has to be better
quality than Apple, with more marketing push than Microsoft.  And it must
do something useful so they also have to invent a new application that
would justify using the crypto it contains. 

All while they do something else to pay for things like food and heat. 

At this point it is easier to write laws.
