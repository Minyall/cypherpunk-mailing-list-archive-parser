Not only that, but single DES with a 56 bit key is just not being used 
anymore in any company which has the slightest clue. If they can run a 
distributed crack on 3DES with independent subkeys then I`ll give them 
some attention.

I`m not downgrading the effort, Joe "wired reader" Sixpack doesn`t know 
the difference between DES, 3DES and his ass anyway, so it is a 
significant publicity stunt that will get normal non-specialist people 
thinking about the export laws, and about how quickly DES can be broken 
by the government if it can be broken by a few guys on the internet in 
months. All I am saying is that looking at it from a purely scientific 
point of view it is not a great cryptanalytic achievement, merely a PR stunt.
