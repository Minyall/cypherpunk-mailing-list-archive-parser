	I think you should rotate through a list, in case they're
keeping track of it in conjunction with your other information.  Thus,
have the same cookies comeing from different user agents, say rotate
between Rhapsody on PowerPC and Linux on an Alpha.

	Alternately, have it come from Internet Exploder on various
UNIX boxes.  (Unless thats now generally available.)
