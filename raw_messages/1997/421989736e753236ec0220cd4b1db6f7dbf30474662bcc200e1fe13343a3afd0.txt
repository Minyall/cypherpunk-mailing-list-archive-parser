I don't watch much TV, especially comedies. However I accidentally saw a
bit of "Seinfield" the other day and was surprise to note that they picture
Tom's restaurant, on 112th and Broadway.  I worked for 7 years upstairs
from that restaurant in a very secret organization.  I'm socked they even
show that building on TV. :-)
