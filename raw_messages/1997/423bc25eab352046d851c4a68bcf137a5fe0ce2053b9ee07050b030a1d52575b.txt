Been looking at the RC5 crack project.

http://rc5.distributed.net/ has loads of flashy graphics, stats,
etc. but no instructions!

I've got the linux command line client, and I want to take off 16
hours at a time as I am using a dial up slip link, and it insists on
taking 20 mins worth.

I read the FAQ, nada.

Help.

Also, no source code.
