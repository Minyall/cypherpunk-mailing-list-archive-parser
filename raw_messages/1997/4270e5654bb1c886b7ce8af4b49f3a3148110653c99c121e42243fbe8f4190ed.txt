A new grocery store opened down the street from me.  They have lots of special 
prices, but only available to "club members".  Club cards are free, but you 
have to fill out a form.  The form asks for:

1.  Name
2.  Address
3.  Phone Number
4.  Spouse name
5.  Social Security number

In exchange for giving this information, the store will give me a 35 cent 
discount on each package of soft drinks I purchase.  This is not a check 
cashing card, that is a separate form.  This is a cash transaction.

Why does the store need my social security number for me to purchase soft 
drinks and eggs?  (40 cents off on eggs this week)  I see no reason for it.  
If I provide a false number, I have probably committed some crime.

Yes, I would support a law that forbids private companies to ask for social 
security numbers except for tax purposes.
