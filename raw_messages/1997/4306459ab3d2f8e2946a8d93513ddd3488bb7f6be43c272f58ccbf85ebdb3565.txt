I can't help wondering if some former SPECWAR guy somewhere 
out there who took his oath seriously, just one, may not get 
a little sick of watching this stuff on the news and give 
the old lady a present and the Nazis a message one morning... 
a SWAT team sleeping the eternal sleep at their posts, their 
necks having been mildly adjusted during the quiet night.

"Whatcha gonna do when they come for you, come for you...?"

Nighty-night!
