Well, this isn't entirely true. Some of the loudest voices in 
banning/regulating crypto come from the left:Senator Lieberman, 
Senator Feinstein,Rep. Dellums, the Clinton Administration in 
general, etc. The fear of 'bomb making information' and 'terrorist 
militia groups' is almost entirely a left-wing fear, one about as 
realistic and plausible as the 60's John Birchers fear of 'Communist 
insurrection' behind every middle-class loser youth who grew his hair 
too long or waved around (but probably never read) Mao's Little Red 
Book.
