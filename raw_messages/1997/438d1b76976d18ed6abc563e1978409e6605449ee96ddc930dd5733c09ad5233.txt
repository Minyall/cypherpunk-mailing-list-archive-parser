I think this analogy is inappropriate for modern communications
forums.

Mailing lists have the wonderful property that the drunken boor
cannot shout everyone else down.  This is what is so great about
the Net.  It is trivial to filter the drunken boor.  This cannot
be done in a crowded auditorium.

Another neat property is the fact that people can't interrupt
each other and everybody can "talk" at once.
