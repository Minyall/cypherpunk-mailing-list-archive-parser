 But of course Adam was seen within U.S. borders wearing such a shirt. This
means the act of importation had occurred, regardless of where Adam came
from (and regardless of where the shirt was made, etc.).

And once imported, code becomes subject to all of the usual ITARs and
related laws. (They changed the name "ITAR" to something else, which I've
forgotten...no doubt 5 people will post one-liners telling me what it is.)

So unless Adam disposed of this shirt, to a bonafide American or
America-approved subject, before his departure from the U.S. last summer....

Perhaps a DEA snatch team can be pressed into service to nab him in
England, drug him, wrap him in tarps, and spirit him onto a C-5 cargo plane
headed for the Land of the Freeh.

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
