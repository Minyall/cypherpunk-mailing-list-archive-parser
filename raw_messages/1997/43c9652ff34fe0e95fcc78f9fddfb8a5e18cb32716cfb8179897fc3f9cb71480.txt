Was wondering if anyone could help me with short explainations on the
cryptanalysis of SKIPJACK and DES.  If ya hit www.sauge.com/crypt you
might get a better idea of what i'm trying to accomplish.

Vague explanations are OK.  Dont want long drawn out explainations on
the implementation of an attack (source code, proofs, statistical
analysis and the like), just a short explaination of the attack.

Thanks all, 

Scott
