Dear One Nation supporters in NSW,

Pauline Hanson's One Nation is now establishing an on-line working group of
One Nation members.

Conditions of involvement in this working group are:

we approach the next federal election.

We do not want to say too much more until working group members have been
selected. If you would like to enquire about joining this group please
