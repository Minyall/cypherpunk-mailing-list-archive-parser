Well said, Lucky.

The next step to gaining the wide-spread and richly deserved acceptance
that should be PGP's fate is to certify it as a recognized, codified, and
testable method for using strong crypto.  That is what the IETF effort is
all about.

Remember the IETF is devoted to enabling anyone, anywhere who possess the
wit, perserverance and means to communicate over digital networks to do so.
As we are all aware, that means having the ability to do it privately and
securely.  That is way the standardization effort in the IETF is so
fundamentally important.  No other standards body has the world-wide
breadth nor the commitment to the individual's right to use and develop
computer technology than the IETF.  It is our best shot to make PGP a
standard.

We can't afford to blow it.

best,
