Hmm...I haven't checked any signatures or headers yet, but something tells me
that this ain't PRZ. For example, the Organization: header refers to Orwell's
1984 as a "blueprint"...forget the signatures (just got a message saying they
match -- either that person's lying, "they" cracked his key, or it's some
detail that has the program using a different key/ignoring some text), it is
psychologically impossible for someone to go from privacy advocate to
1984-as-a-blueprint that quick.
