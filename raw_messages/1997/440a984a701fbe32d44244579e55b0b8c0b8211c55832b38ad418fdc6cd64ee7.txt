"legal" means several things
1) If a US citizen in the US exported it, was that legal?  
	(probably not, though arguable in court.)
2) If a non-US-citizen located outside the US downloaded it
	from an account on a system in the US, does the US government
	have jurisdiction over them?  (probably not, so "legal" is moot.)
3) Does Nederlands law prevent you from exporting it to Turkey?
	(probably not, though if you were in Iraq or North Korea the
	answer might be different.)
4) Does Turkish law limit your importing or use of the software?
	(I don't know - you'll need to check that yourself.)
5) Does US law have any say over whether you can import it from
	the Nederlands to Turkey?  (Not really...)
