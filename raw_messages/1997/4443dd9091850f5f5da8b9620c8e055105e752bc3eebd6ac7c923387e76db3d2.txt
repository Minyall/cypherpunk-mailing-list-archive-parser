Indeed I have, as I have said in other posts I have no particular 
sympathies with the IRA, they are thugs who kill indiscriminately. 
Wishing someone dead is not that great a step from accepting that
they commit crime against you. I don`t wish the queen dead because
of her clear opposition to terrorist violence, there are other reasons
for this. Maybe wishing her dead is a little too strong in this 
particular case.

I live in mainland England. NI, although still violent, is now not the 
only place bombed by the IRA, until a few years ago they mainly attacked 
targets in NI, they now bomb all over the country.
I do not claim that violence is a global solution, merely that in some 
cases it works. And I don`t believe labelling retaliation "violence" is 
really correct, the word violence is derived from violate, ie. to violate 
someones rights in a material and tangiable manner, I don`t believe 
retaliation or defence is a violation of rights, merely a response to 
agression. I personally see other ways than violence out of most 
disagreements, but I believe the only way to remove the power of the 
state is through selective violence as part of an overall strategy 
including strong cryptography and associated technologies.
