Then the search engine would list the wrong URL. The idea is to get
people to use crypto. In  fact, as soon as I find the time, cypherpunks.to
will reject weak crypto browsers and provide those unfortunate enough to
use such a browser with pointers to upgrade options.

Actually, there are pages on the server that do require client certs.
Of course these pages need not be listed  in any search engine. But now
that you mention it, it might be fun to set up an automated enrollment
page and require client certs for everything.
