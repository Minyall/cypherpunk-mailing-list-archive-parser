Today the Government filed a 22-page brief arguing to the 9th Circuit
Court that it would be so injurious to the national security for
Prof. Bernstein to be able to publish his Snuffle 5.0 software on the
Internet, that a complete stay of Judge Patel's injunction is needed.

They also propose that the entire appeal be done on an expedited basis.

The brief is accompanied by two seven-page personal declarations,
one from William P. Crowell, Deputy Director of NSA, and one from
William A. Reinsch, Under Secretary for Export Administration.

These will be up as page images on the Web shortly, under
