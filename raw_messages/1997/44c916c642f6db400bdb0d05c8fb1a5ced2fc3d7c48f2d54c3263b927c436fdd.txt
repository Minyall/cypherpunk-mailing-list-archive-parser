Mitsubishi Electric Corp. has developed new secret-key cryptosystem 
MISTY1 and MISTY2, which are ciphers with 128-bit key and 64-bit data 
block. They are provably secure against differential and linear 
cryptanalysis,and also fast on software implementations as well as on 
hardware platforms. Using ciphers on wide-area networks requires a 
method to maintain security as long as its encryption key (password 
commonly shared by a sender and a receiver) is kept secret, even if the 
mechanism of the encryption is made public. However,possibilities of 
unauthorized access will increase when the encryption mechanism is made 
public. In fact,several encryption algorithms, whose specifications were 
made public,have been compelled to make
specification changes, and to sacrifice their encryption speed in return 
for an increased cipher strength to protect against recent decoding 
methods. This is why an encryption system whose security against these 
decoding method is strictly evaluated at the design stage has become 
necessary. Since announcing its linear cryptanalysis,Mitsubishi Electric 
has been making efforts to develop 
encryption technology backed by adequate security. In January 1994, 
Mitsubishi Electric performed the first successful experiment to decode 
the Data Encryption Standard (DES), an American standard commercial 
encryption system, to quantitatively
evaluate its strength using this linear cryptanalysis. Using this 
evaluation technology, Mitsubishi Electric has developed an encryption 
algorithm that provides sufficient security and achieves high speed 
encryption.
