I believe the first version of the Exon Amendment was introduced in late
summer of 1994. I believe PICS postdates this, but I am not certain.

Does PICS inhibit speech in e-mail or in Usenet newsgroups or in FTP sites?
Isn't PICS just the Web?
Conversely, doesn't any version of the CDA inhibit speech in, e.g., e-mail,
Usenet newsgroups, and FTP sites?

I cannot conceive of any version of the CDA that does not restrict speech
more broadly, and have a greater chilling effect, than PICS. Note that this
is not a defense of PICS.

I don't believe PICS, whatever its other flaws, poses any threat of putting
speakers of unapproved speech in jail.

Perhaps it is a flaw in my legal education, but I was always taught that
criminal laws were a form of regulation.

I cannot speak to what Declan's argument actually was, but I note that
these two positions are not, in fact, logically inconsistent.
