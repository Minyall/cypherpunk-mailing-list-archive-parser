I'm curious about this...

Did DEFCON IV happen before, or after, the rump session of FC97 (February
26? 1997), when Jason Cronk talked about recursive auctions on geodesic
networks? Actually, now that I think about it, Ian Grigg did a talk about
the sell-side inverse of the same idea in the same session...

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
