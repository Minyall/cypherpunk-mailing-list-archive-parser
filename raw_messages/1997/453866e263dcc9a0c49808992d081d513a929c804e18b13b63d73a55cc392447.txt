Run your own remailer. Tell your friends to run their own remailers.
Use one or more of those somewhere in the chain, then you *know* your
messages are secure. The software can be found at

You may want to read the paper "Untraceable Electronic Mail, Return
Addresses, and Digital Pseudonyms" by David Chaum (CACM, 2/1981).
It is available at http://world.std.com/~franl/crypto/chaum-acm-1981.html
