* The Michigan Court of Appeals in April ruled, on a technicality,
in favor of a prison inmate who had tossed a cup of liquified feces
in the face of a guard.  Alphonso Gaines, 34, already serving time
for assault, could not be punished further, said the court, because
the prosecutors forgot to prove that Gaines was "lawfully"
incarcerated in the Ionia facility at the time he threw the feces. 
Prosecutor Gail Hitchcock was incensed:  "Did they think we were
charging someone who had sneaked into prison?"
