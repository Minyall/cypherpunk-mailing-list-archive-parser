Nah, it's just Paul :-)

Perhaps he should rephrase that to no one with a clue _should_ be
using single DES.  Clearly lots are in practice, in spite of their
better judgement for political reasons.  The US government influence
via their export controls being a major factor pushing the practice of
using too short key lengths.

What's cryptography.uk?
