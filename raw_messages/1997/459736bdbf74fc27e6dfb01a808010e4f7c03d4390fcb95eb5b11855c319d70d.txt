Remember when Bush barfed on the Japanese guys?  I thought Inman's
performance on TV after losing the nomination was even more
embarrassing.

When Inman was first nominated, I was reading about it in the L.A.
Times they provide at McDonalds, while waiting patiently in line for
the great American meal.  When I saw who it was, I pulled out my
165 mb pocket computer and looked him up, and showed everyone else
who were standing in line who this guy really was.  The reaction
in that line alone was a good predictor of what was to come for
the "admiral".  Hopefully some day the EFF putzes will come to an
equally glorious end.
