        How can I get snefru and the detailed snuffle algorithm?
I am not from USA(I am from India)....I also wanted the perl
implementations of the algos.....
  I heard that C implementation of DES is also available for public use...
I donot want to break any law...and i donot know what exactly  the US
say about encryption and related stuff...
TIA
