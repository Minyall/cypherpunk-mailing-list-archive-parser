On behalf of the non-racist cypherpunks, please accept an apology for
Paul Bradley's racist message:

> uneducated and foolish arabs such as Parekh should stick 
> to what they do best: running kebab shops and/or selling cheap fake rolex 
> watches to tourists. 

This does not reflect the mainstream view on the list.  Cypherpunks
understand that disparaging the racial background of others is a weak
and invalid form of argument.

While it may be appropriate to criticize actions taken during the list
moderation experiment, casting the issue in racial terms only reveals
the ignorance and bigotry of the writer.
