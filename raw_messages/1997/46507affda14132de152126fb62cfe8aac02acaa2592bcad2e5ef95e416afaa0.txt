Erm, mayhaps, but they haven't lost their evil touch yet.  In recent news 
Borland is suing them for raiding their employees. :(  (Borland made the 
best intel compilers I've ever seen in terms of both compile speed and 
resulting code...  Microsoft has done everything in their power to crush 
this competitior including forcing them to give up ObjWin so for MFC 
inclusion.)  Nasty bastards.
