Yes, but  -  Freeh said all products needed to have the _option_ of a 
key-escrow backdoor built in. The actual deployment of the system 
should be at the users' discretion. Then again, Sen. Feinstein 
suggested he needed mandatory key escrow since there was no way to 
make a voluntary system work. Freeh seemed to warm to the idea of 
making key escrow mandatory.

"Mandatory key escrow would the best solution - I have to be candid 
with you on that," he said. 

Unfortunately, he added, mandatory key escrow isn't a possibility - 
or foolproof, either.
