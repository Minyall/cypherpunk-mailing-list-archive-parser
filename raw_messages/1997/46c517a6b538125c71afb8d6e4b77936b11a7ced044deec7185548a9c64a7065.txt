        It is interesting that while almost the entire body of copyright
law deals with materials other then what is to be covered, the industry has
enough clout to get their's singled out for the first criminal penalties
for violation. 

        This leaves the bulk of copyrighted material, printed material,
photographs and the like open to being stolen as does nizkor for example.
