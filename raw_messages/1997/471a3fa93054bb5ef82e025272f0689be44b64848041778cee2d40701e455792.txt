... This is from the log file that pgp keeps on my machine,
\WINDOWS\PGPWS_32.LOG.

There appears to be a lot of interesting information here:
 -- I did not encrypt with IDEA only
 -- the recipients of the message I sent are shown along with the public
key IDs
 -- The SIZE of the message!

I have obfuscated some of the details from the actual log.  The "?"s
indicate removed details.
