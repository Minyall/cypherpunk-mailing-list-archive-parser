On http://csrc.ncsl.nist.gov/ , the 3rd and 4th links are to requests for 
comments on changes to encryption standards.  Apparently, NIST isn't getting 
many comments and would really like some.

Maybe someone should tell them that publication in the Federal Register isn't 
the right way to communicate with netizens :)
