   My
   bill merely provides a means for Internet users to filter out e-mails that
   they do not wish to receive by requiring that senders of unsolicited
   e-mails to include Advertisement as the first word of the subject line
   and that the real street address, e-mail address and a telephone number
   be contained within the body of the message. Routing information that
   accompanies the message must also be accurate. 

Could this be the end of remailers?
