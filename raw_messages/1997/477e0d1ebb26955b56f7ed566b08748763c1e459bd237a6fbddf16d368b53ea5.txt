Tim's problem is not lack of compassion for government workers - his 
problem is lack of compassion, period.  He wasn't talking about 
governments -- he was talking about a billion or so people -- the 
"sheeple", the "herd", the "underclass" -- whatever cute word he can 
overload with the considerable bile and and contempt at his command.  

The old saying, Ray, is that you can travel any path you want, but be
sure to choose one with heart.
