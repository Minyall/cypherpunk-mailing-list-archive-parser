Sorry for this somewhat off-topic post, but I figured it was the best
way to reach people who would know.

Does anyone know what happened to the remailer-operators@c2.org
mailing list?  I get:

  rcpt to:<remailer-operators@c2.org>
  550 <remailer-operators@c2.org>... User unknown

Thanks.
