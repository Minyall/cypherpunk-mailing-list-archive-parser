Richard Crandall, NeXT scientist, writes eloquently on large 
numbers in February SciAm. He cites cryptographic strength as
one result of research on the gargantuan googol and googolplex. 
He reviews current work on sieve techniques for factorization 
-- Quadratic, Number Field, Elliptic Curve Method and others -- 
as well as advanced algorithms. And exclaims:

   Blaine Garst, Doug Mitchell, Avadis Tevanian, Jr., and I
   implemented at NeXT what is one of the strongest -- if
   not the strongest -- encryption schemes available today,
   based on Mersenne primes. This patented scheme, termed
   Fast Elliptic Encryption (FEE), uses the algebra of
   elliptic curves, and it is very fast.
