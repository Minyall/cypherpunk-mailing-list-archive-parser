The "lock and load," "Best Cypherpunk long gun" and other similar threads
have gotten me thinking.

Can any fellow Cypherpunks suggest any books or documents on the net
concerning urban warfare, generic non-urban warfare (e.g. plains),
differences between weapons, suggestions, etc. Basically a survivalist's
almanac, I suppose.

Threat model: For whatever reason the U.S. just collapsed. Civil war is
imminent and there is little or no civility in the streets.
