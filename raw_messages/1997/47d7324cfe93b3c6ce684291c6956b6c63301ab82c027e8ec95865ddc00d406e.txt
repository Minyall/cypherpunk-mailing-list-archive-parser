I find the term "encrypted criminal communication" rather intresting.
Exactly how does on know if a certian communication is crimminal unless
one decrypts it and reads it?? Or is this yet another example of "guilty
until we are forced to admit that you are not" type of logic followed by
the LEA's in this country.
