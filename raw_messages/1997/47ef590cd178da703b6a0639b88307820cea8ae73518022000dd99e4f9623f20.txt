Internet companies demonstrate portable security

Six Internet companies have joined forces to develop a joint
demonstration of smartcard technologies at the 1997 RSA Data Security
Conference. Consensus Development Corporation, Gemplus,
Hewlett-Packard, Litronic Inc., Netscape Communications Corporation
and VeriSign, Inc., Monday announced "The Get Smartcard Demo." The
interactive demo will allow each conference attendee to load X509v3
certificates on crypto-enabled smartcards. Participants will interact
with the demo through mutually authenticated SSL connections and
document signing. For the full text story, see
