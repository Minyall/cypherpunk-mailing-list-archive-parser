We're having a crypto-gathering in Washington, DC today to coincide with
the end of IETF. It probably would be a DC cypherpunks meeting if we had
enough notice -- but since we don't it'll be a less formal gathering
instead.

Guests -- John Gilmore and Hugh Daniel
When -- 3 pm, Saturday, December 13
Where -- Adams Morgan, Washington, DC
What -- Probably IPsec, Bernstein lawsuit, crypto legislation

If you're interested, email for details.
