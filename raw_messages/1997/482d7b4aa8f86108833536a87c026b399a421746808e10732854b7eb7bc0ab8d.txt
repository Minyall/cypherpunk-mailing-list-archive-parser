Have you considered the actions of the news-admins that are auto-canceling 
anything with more than a certain number of cross-posts, or posts with "Make 
Money Fast" in the subject? (I think excessive posts to certain newsgroups 
may also fall into this category.  I think the big 6 get auto-covered by 
this..)

:-)  

"Make Money Fast" are killed because they're illegal scams in the US and I 
think in most of the world.

My question is, are you including these in the above comment, or not?
