Hardly any traffic at all today.

Is cyberpass.net ok?

I sent a `who cypherpunks' to majordomo@cyberpass.net and got a
response back instantly from sirius.infonex.com, so it's _there_.

Most of the small amount of traffic that there is, seems to be from
algebra.com and toad.com.

I've just subscribed to algebra.com, in case I'm missing out on
articles (my procmail will kill duplicates if any).

How are people on algebra.com finding the traffic?  (2 articles dated
12th in total as of 21:40 GMT (+0)).
