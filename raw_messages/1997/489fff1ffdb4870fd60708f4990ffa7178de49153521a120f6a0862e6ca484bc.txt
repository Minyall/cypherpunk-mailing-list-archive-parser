Correct.

Wrong. One trusted mix is enough to guarantee anonymity: There is a
large number of fixed-size messages coming in and a large number of
messages going out in random order.  (Consult the archives for
information about possible attacks, such as flooding a remailer with
dummy messages, and how to detect/prevent them.)

So you say Raph actually *is* part of the cypherpunk conspirary??!

BTW, that list is the "list of reliable remailers", not the "list of
cypherpunk approved remailers".  Now guess how a remailer qualifies to
be listed.

Remailer operators share the belief that it must be possible to use
the net anonymously, without leaving traces.  Is that what you mean?

PS: Did you know that one remailer operator formerly was a soldier in
East Germany's National People's Army?
