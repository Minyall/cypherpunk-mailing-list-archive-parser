  We are seeing a globalization of what has long occurred in the
U.S., wherein the govt will 'shop' for a state with laws on the
books which are needed to screw over a citizen in a different
state, and then proceed to set them up to violate laws that
don't exist in their home state.
  In the future, we will be subjected to prosecution for violating
"international law" every time Upper Mongolia passes laws against
being left-handed, or having warts.
