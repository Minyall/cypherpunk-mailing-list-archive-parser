Requiring encryption is a win, of course.  However, requiring 
encryption increases the value of CMR, because you have more 
opportunity for important records to be lost.  Especially as legally 
binding digital signatures become common -- you could have an actual 
contract, worth large sums of money, lost forever because someone 
forgot their passphrase.

My wife works for an "investment banking boutique" and my freedom to
invest is pretty tightly constrained.  I have first-hand experience
with the controls involving insider trading, and I have a fair
familiarity with the business practices there.  IMO you have it
exactly backward: the CMR model fits extremely well with the type of
controls I am familiar with.  Indeed it is true that there is
extensive record-keeping and auditing -- highly secure record-keeping;
secured conference rooms, careful procedures controlling who has what
information, etc.  CMR would fit right in as a valued addition, not a 
useless redundancy.
