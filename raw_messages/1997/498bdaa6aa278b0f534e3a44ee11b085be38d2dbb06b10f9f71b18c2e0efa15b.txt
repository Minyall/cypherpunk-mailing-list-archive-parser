Actually I seem to remember that U.S. citizens have full constitutional
protection (only from the U.S. government of course) no matter where they
reside, non-citizens have full protection within the borders of the U.S.,
and non-citizens have partial protection outside the borders of the U.S.  I
don't remember how much is covered by the last though.
