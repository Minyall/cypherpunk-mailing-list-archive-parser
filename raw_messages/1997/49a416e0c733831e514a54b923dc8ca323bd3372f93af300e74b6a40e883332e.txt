That would be for Dimitri to decide for himself, and not for some 
cocksucker to take a unilateral decision on. Of course disabling cancels 
on all news-servers would mean such a freak article couldn`t be 
cancelled, even by it`s author, but that is better than having the cabal 
removing genuine articles because they don`t like the content.
