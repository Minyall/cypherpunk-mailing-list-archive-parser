I just got my news admin to add alt.cypherpunks.  Unfortunately, I can't
remember the names of the subgroups (which weren't added), and I
deleted the mailings which listed them.  

If I remember correctly, they were along the lines of

alt.cypherpunks.technical
alt.cypherpunks.social
alt.cypherpunks.announce
alt.cypherpunks.ebonics :-) Sorry, couldn't resist!

Did I miss any?  Name-mangle?

I also have listed the following alternate list hosts

cypherpunks@algebra.com
cypherpunks@cyberpass.net
cypherpunks@ssz.com

If anyone has a more complete list of hosts, I'd be happy
for additions to the list.

Thanks!
