It certainly sounds like blackmail to me.

Surely people on this list are aware of how fallible governments are? 
Those punishments are a bit too final to be within the power of a legal
system so prone to mistakes and corruption. 

Although current western legal systems constrain citizens, they also
constrain the government, which is probably a good thing.  The media is
very weak on reporting abuses of power by police and the military, but at
least they're not always completely covered up.  

Yes, both individuals and governments can break the law, but it stops them
sometimes.

Other common oversimplifications include:

 The United States has a large gap between rich and poor and a lot 
 of crime.

 The United States has a lot of lawyers and a lot of crime.

 The United States has a lot of guns and a lot of crime.
