If you use PGP 5.0 many people will refuse to read your messages and send 
them to you. They won't be able to decrypt your messages, verify
your signatures, or use your keys. In general, using 5.0 just pisses people
off. 5.0 is purposefully incompatable with all previous versions of PGP,
they purposefully haven't released usable versions except for Windows and
possibly Mac, they've purposefully broke any scripts and programs which
invoke PGP, they purposefully made command-line versions of PGP many times
more annoying to use, and PGP 5.x encrypts to a "CMR key" without having the 
decency to ask. 

Generally the PGP 5.x folks are being complete and total assholes about this 
entire thing and haven't done anything to improve the state of cryptography
today and a whole lot to worsen it. 

Somebody recently posted a large rant about this titled "PGP 5.0: What were
they thinking? (revisited)."
