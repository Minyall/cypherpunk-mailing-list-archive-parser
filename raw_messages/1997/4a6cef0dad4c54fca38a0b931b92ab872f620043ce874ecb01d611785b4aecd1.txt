I like this idea.
However, I would suggest an additional refinement:
	Implement a cypherpunks-moderated list which
is all the 'approved' messages. This way, people who wish
to have the benefits of a filtered list are happy, people who
wish to have posts rated for them (but be able to check on
the "rater") are happy, and people who wish to see every
message are happy.

(I know that John has concerns about toad's mail capacity,
and this may be too big a load)

ObCrypto policy:
	Was anyone else besides me amazed by the guy
from Deloitte-Touche at the Internet Privacy Coalition luncheon
last week? I mean, he all but advocated violent overthrow of
the government. D-T is the most "establishment" of the big-6
accounting firms, last time that I looked.

It's a weird world when we have a representative of a
company that makes a living advising people on how to
obey government regulations advocating civil disobedience.
