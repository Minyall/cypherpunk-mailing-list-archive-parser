According to you, remailer using people are cowards.  So quite frankly, why the hell are you helping remailers if you get so pissed at people using them?

If that's what you think of the blessed gift of anonymity, then, quite frankly, FUCK YOU.  Theres's nothing childish about using remailers, and if you think otherwise, then stop making them!
