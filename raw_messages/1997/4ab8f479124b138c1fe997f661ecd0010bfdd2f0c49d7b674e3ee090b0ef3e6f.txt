But if you drive for several miles, and get pulled over for speeding, the
fact that it's still in the truck is probably going to land you in jail,
if the cop finds some reason to search the truck.  (The smell of marijuana
or seeing the roach sitting the ashtray are valid reasons I believe)

If you haven't disposed of it, you're probably going to land in jail.

between your story and that of a person who's actually smoking?  (Honest
officer, it was in the truck when I got in!)  the evidence is there, and
you'll probably need to depend on character witnesses to get out of a
conviction...
