I wonder how expensive it would be to put a GPS receiver in a cell phone and
have the option to transmit the coordinates on a separate channel.  There
would be little difference between this and forcing cell phone companies to
triangulate every call.  The primary motivation for this is almost certainly
"location escrow" to make it easier for the feds to track drug dealers.
