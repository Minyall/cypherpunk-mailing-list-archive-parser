	I don't want to discourage anybody from trying their
cryptanalytic skills against this, but this particular cryptogram
has already been decrypted and the plain text posted to sci.crypt a
few days back by Jim Gillogly. The message ID is <32D445A4.3DF@mentat.com>

	The snake oil vendor then came out with another cryptogram
using the same algorithm. It is titled `decryption' and the plain text
starts with "There are plenty of programs you could buy such as".
Mr. Gillogly broke that too. See news:<32DA7FE4.1F41@mentat.com>
