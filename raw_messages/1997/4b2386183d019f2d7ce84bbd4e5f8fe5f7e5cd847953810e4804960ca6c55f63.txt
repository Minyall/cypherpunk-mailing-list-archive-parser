I was wondering if perhaps a way to minimize the hassle with sitting
on one's thumb while waiting for unwanted email to download could be
eased by an email program which retreived only headers, allowed you to
delete the unwanted ones, and then retrieve the wanted ones, deleting
the rest.
  Is this feasible?
