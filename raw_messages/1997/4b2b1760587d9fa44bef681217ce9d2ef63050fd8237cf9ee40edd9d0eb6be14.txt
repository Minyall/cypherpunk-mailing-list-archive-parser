I just saw the principle author of the recently released report of the
"Commission on
Critical Infrastructure Protection," interviewed on CNBC, a business
program. Robert Marsh called for increased use of encyption to proect the
nation's computer networks against hackers and crackers and
info-terrorists.

The catch? It's the FBI proposal he wants to see adopted.

Personally, I think this issue, and Marsh in particular, are sleep-inducers
to most people, so I don't see this as a driving force for GAK the way a
building being blown up, or a child porn ring, will be.
