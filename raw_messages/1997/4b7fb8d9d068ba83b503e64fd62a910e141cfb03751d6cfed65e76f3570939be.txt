Well this moron, whoever he may be has threaten to "have papers served" on
me in regards to my last post of this topic.

I am still unsure if it is actually someone from this company making these
posts. The poster still has not figured out how to make use of digital
signatures nor is he/she/it willing to put a name on their posts (hmmmm
what was their remark about cowards hiding behind anonymity??).

I guess we will see how far they are willing to take this or if it is just
the work of crafty operators from the EFF (Electronic Forgery Foundation).
:)
