I notice that PSM has had a name change concurrent with its availability
change. Could the unavailability have to do with a trademark dispute
between Highware & PGP, Inc.?

Is Highware going to release the source code of VSM?

Is PGP, Inc. going to release the source code of PGPMail 4.5?

If the answer is no, I am sticking with the free PGP. If the answer is no,
I guess these firms are expecting ignorance to be the primary
characteristic of their customers.
