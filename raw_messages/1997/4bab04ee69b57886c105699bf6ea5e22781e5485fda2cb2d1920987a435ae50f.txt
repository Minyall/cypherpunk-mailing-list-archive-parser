I agree that testing on a 32-bit machine is kind of dumb.  I also think
that testing it on a 64-bit machine is just as dumb.  We're talking about
a standard that will be with us for 20-30 years; whatever the current
archetecture is, it will be outdated before the standard is.

The lessons of computer are:  the high end always gets faster, and the
low end never goes away.  Anything will run fast on the high end, if not
now then in a generation or two.  We need something optimized for 8-bit
smart card processors.

Again, all that matters is the low end.

We discussed that.  If a group thinks they have six months to develop
something new, they might decide not to even both.  Then, if there is
a six-month extension, we haven't gained anything.  I argued that a full
year should be given.

That's why I want triple-DES approved now, and then to let everyone take
their time with AES.
