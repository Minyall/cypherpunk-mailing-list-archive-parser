In my opinion, the hnorable way to deal with multi-posts is to detect them
automatically and to ignore them. A NoCeM 'bot like the one run by the
Venerable CancelMoose is a good thing.

A compression scheme where many copies of the same text would be transmitted
only once even if they're posted once would be an excellent thing (given that
such traffic is a very substantial
portion of a full uncensored feed), but it's not crucial.
