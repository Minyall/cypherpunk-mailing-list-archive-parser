It's true that in the absence of public libraries this would not be an
issue; however, it is an example of the state acting as sovereign, not
employer. We're concerned with the right of patrons to access material, &
they are not state employees. The situation is analogous to a public park:
just because the state owns it, does that mean it can forbid, say, criticism
of the state in it? No, of course not, though it has broader discretion in
limiting the speech of public employees in the park, while on-duty.
