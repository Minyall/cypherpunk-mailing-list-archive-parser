I take a certain sad pleasure in reminding people that among my first
posts on this list I warned that cypherpunks had better design a
commercial key recovery system, or one they didn't like would be
forced down their throats.  Attila now spouts my line exactly, Adam is
busy designing (though he still can't bring himself to use the term
'key recovery', being meme-dominated as he is), and Tim nods
approvingly. 

Good luck, gentlemen -- you should have been doing this a year ago.
