The Congressional Record reprinted July 23 "Anti-Government,
Anti-Social Attitudes," a news column which examines the
increasing discontent caused by governmental programs. It
describes the increasing psychopathology by those who have 
suffered economic harm due to shifts in the nation's and 
international resources and the appeal of anti-government and
anti-social acts in response to failure to meet obligations to the 
citizenry. Not a few think OKC bombing is the the way to fight 
government-sponsored terrorism against civilians.

Couple that with reports on DoD's efforts to combat terrorism 
against its troops abroad, more funding of counterterrorism
and more sharing of "dual-use" weaponry with jittery, trigger-
itchy law enforcement and IRS infohighway bandits around 
the globe. Boil the frogs.

Says the snarling marshal (OSFOR trooper), just back from 
stress counseling and a beer, to the neighbor (rapee) kicking and 
screaming: It's dog eat dog, in the battle to keep our family fed, so 
sorry, but we gotta enforce order and the law (our exculpatory Bible), 
burp, tell it to the judge (the President), my therapist (godfather).

Meanwhile have a pleasant remand while the court's on vacation.
