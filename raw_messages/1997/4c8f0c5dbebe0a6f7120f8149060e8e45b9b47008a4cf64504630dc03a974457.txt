Actually, I didn't write that. Just another forgery from "Toto" (I am
presuming, from past admissions and from the "wombat.sk.sympatico.ca"
origins).

This is getting tiresome. It may be time to just head up to Ottawa, or
wherever, look this guy up, and do something about him. His overly long
drunken rants are one thing, and are easily deleted, but impersonating me
is straight out of Detweiler's book. Must be something about Cypherpunks
that brings out this urge to impersonate.

Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
