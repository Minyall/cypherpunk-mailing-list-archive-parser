While your at it why not ask if she (see her post to this list dated 1 
Sep 1996; and several EFF board members referred to in John Gilmores post 
to this list on 2 Sep 1996) are still having problems with anonymity. 

I didn't think she was a GAKer way back then so who knows which way the 
wind is blowing her now.  Garfinkel refers to her long held belief that 
controls on encryption were necessary so perhaps I am wrong and she was a 
GAKer all along although her reference in her email of 1 Sep makes no 
mention of it when she sought to distinguish her comments on anonymity 
from the issue of encryption thus:

"Please note that this is not the same as the right to *private* 
conversations and the use of encryption; this is the issue of being 
accountable for what you publish in public."

Then again her comments appeared to be a slipery as an eel in terms of 
meaning so who knows what the hell she means/meant/will mean at any 
particular point in time.
