Congrats on starting a remailer in a new jurisdiction!

Lots of jurisdictions on long chains is very useful because the
attacker must break all of them, and the more different jurisdictions
the more expensive and politically difficult it is for the attacker to
compromise the whole chain.

Jurisdiction shopping is good, too -- wonder what Japan offers as a
jurisdiction opportunity -- are there things legal in Japan which are
not legal in Europe, or US?
