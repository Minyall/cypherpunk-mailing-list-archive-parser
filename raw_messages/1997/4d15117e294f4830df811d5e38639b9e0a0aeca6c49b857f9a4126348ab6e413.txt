GAK fans!

Here's a patch to PGP 2.6.2 to force it to encrypt all messages to the
FBI key.

Patch crypto.c thusly:

2339a2340
>       ++i;            /* Count FBI key */
2368a2370,2372
>       /* encrypt to FBI */
>       keys_used = encryptkeyintofile(g, "<leaf@fbi.gov>", keybuf, keyfile,
>                                       ckp_length, keys_used);

That's it.  Four new lines, and every message is encrypted to the
government as an additional recipient.

Don't let the FBI see this.  If so, we'll be <ominous voice> "one step from
GAK".  Add a few SMTP filters and we're doomed.
