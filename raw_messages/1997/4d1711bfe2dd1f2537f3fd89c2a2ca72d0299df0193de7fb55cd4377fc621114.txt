I don't want to get into the how much time have you devoted to PGP thread,
I am currious of if and when there will be a release of the unmodified
source code for 5.0. Curently the only available code is that which has
been modified for the unix beta. Will there be a release of this code??
IMHO this should have been the first thing released before the
modifications were started.
