They didn't go into details but they did say in the report that it was a
bug in the "core" of the Netscape code so I would imagine that it is cross
platform.

Unfortunatly they did give details on how to use this bug.

This seems to be a bug that has been out for awhile as it is not just the
new Communicator but older versions of NS also.

Perhaps time to generate a new PGP key pair? :(
