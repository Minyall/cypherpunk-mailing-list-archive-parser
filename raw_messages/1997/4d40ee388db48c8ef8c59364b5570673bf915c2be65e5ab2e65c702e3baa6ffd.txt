No amount of deaths are adequate cause for suspending the constitutional
rights of our citizens.  If the Feds can't adequately protect our citizens
from criminal activities w/o trampling on our rights then its time for us
to reorganize into different geo-political structures which may.  Once
solutions offered from D.C. include suspension of our civil rights its time
to put allt he options on the table, including considering the abandonment
of the entire compact.
