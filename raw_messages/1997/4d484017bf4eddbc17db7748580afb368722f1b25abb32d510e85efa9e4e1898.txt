The reputed Jap pedophile Hoichi "no clypto fo fo politically incollect
lacist holsemen" Ito must have an impressive collection of JPEG pornographic
pictures of underage Jap girls.  Yes, the Japs are happy to export child
porn, but not clypto. Why do your countrymen find one more irregar than the
other, Ito-san? The same reputed pedophile Ito also advocated allowing
gubmints to outlaw the possession and manufactyure of certain chemicals
and plants - what an asshole.
