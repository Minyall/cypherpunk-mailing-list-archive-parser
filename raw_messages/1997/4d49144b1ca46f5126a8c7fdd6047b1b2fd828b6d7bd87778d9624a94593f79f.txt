I was kidding, but that's awful nice of you, even if I still must pay for
the rest of it.   Yes, I'll still go visit JimBob - I'll have to find out
about his location, hours, etc.    Again, if any of you in this area would
like to make the trip or meet there, perhaps meeting later as well for
dinner and scholaryly discussion on the perils of free speech and such,
please let me know.
