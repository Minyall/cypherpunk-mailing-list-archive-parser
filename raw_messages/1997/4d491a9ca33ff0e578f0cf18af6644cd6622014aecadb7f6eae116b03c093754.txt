It is really true.  Cable and Wireless has disabled the pound and star
keys on *all* of the pay phones in the whole country (20 or so).  I am
sort of amazed because I have been here 2.5 years and never heard of this
till this last week.  I don't use pay phones much, but I wonder if maybe
this is a new thing.
