No, the "-------- Forwarded Message Follows ------" line is before the PGP
begin line, so I think it should not corrupt the signature.  I can't see
any '>' quotes inside the message.  I suppose probably there's an extra
space or newline in there.  I'm not 100% sure if PGP collapses
whitespace to avoid this or not... I imagine probably not.
