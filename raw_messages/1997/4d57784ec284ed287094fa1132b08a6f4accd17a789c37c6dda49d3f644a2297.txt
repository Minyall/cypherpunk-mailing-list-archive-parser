Hi!
 
We are Bell Labs researches currently experimenting with a new tool that
helps you easily create and use consistent unique personal identities at web
sites that provide personalized services.  LPWA (Lucent Personalized Web
Assistant) creates these unique identities on demand. LPWA supports these
features:
- Privacy: Your true identity remains unknown to the web-sites. When a
     web-site asks you to provide a username, password, or e-mail
     address, you instead enter '\u', '\p', or '\@', and the LPWA proxy
     submits to the web-site an alias-username, an alias-password, or
     an alias-e-mail address. LPWA computes a different, but consistent,
     alias for you for each web-site.
- Convenience: Because LPWA computes your alias identity for you, you do
     not need to invent and remember multiple usernames and passwords. Instead,
     you only need to remember and protect one secret ("universal
     password").  You provide your secret to the proxy, along with your
     e-mail address, exactly once during a browsing session, after that
     you browse the web transparently.
 
Check    http://lpwa.com/      to see how to use LPWA.  To obtain more
information about LPWA, see   http://www.bell-labs.com/project/lpwa/
Pointers to personalized web-sites, where you can open and maintain
accounts, are given in
http://www.bell-labs.com/project/lpwa/background.html#personalized
 
Please note that this project has not yet been publicy announced and that
documentation and code are currently being revised. Also, the current
(temporary)  set-up,  where you have to connect to LPWA over an insecure
connection is not "optimal" (to say the least, but all in all much better
than if you browse the "usual way"). Hence, we are really looking for
"friendly users" at this time whose feedback will help us to make improvements.
 
Regards,
   Alain Mayer
