Certainly I trust the courts at least a little more than I do the
legislature. The current Supreme Court, for example in the _McIntyre_ case
and the CDA, has been quite good on traditional free speech cases.

But courts are much more deferential to the government on national security
issues, even trumped-up ones. While the right to speak privately is (I
believe) an important free speech issue, traditional jurists may be
reluctant to agree.

In other words: don't rely on the current Supreme Court to overturn a
mandatory-GAK law, especially if it has holes cut out of the escrow fabric
for corporations, etc.
