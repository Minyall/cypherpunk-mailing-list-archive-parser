Dimitri,
  I laughed till I cried, when I read this.

  I hope you were trying to be humorous. If not, then seek psychiatric
help immediately!
  (See if you can get us a group discount, because I have come to 
   believe that the 'moderation experiment' was a clever ruse to
   weed out all of the 'sane' people from the Cypherpunks list.)
