There are a number of hardware vendors with PKCS#11 modules for smart
cards
and other hardware devices.  These include Litronic, Chrysalis-ITS and
DataKey.

You can import X.509 certificates and private keys.  The data format is
an
early version of PKCS#12, which is actually more similar to MicroSoft's
PFX.  I believe the spec is available on our web site.  There are also a
number of other CAs on the web, including Thawte in South Africa.
