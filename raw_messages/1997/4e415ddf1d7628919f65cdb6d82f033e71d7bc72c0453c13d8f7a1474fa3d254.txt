In fact, the problem is not corporate sponsors.  Rather the problem is
that lobbying groups often tend to get captured by the government.  They want
to get their fingerprints on legislation, so that they can extort money
from their corporate sponsors, and are therefore eager to do the politicians 
bidding in any way whatever in order that they can get their fingerprints on
any 
legislation whatever.

This problem is unrelated to civil liberties issues.  Lobby groups for
the milk industry, small business, etc, are infamous for selling out the
interests of the businesses that support them.

I am not saying that the CDT is guilty of this, but the fact it persists
in trying to get legislation passed under present circumstances should 
not only alarm civil libertarians, it should also alarm big business.

My congratulations to EFF, who I have vigorously flamed in the past.  I hope
that one day I will be able to similarly congratulate the CDT.
