Thanks for the sort-of compliment, but I haven't been using anonymous
remailers much at all the last couple of years.

Someone wrote to me saying he suspected I was "Monty Cantsin." Nope.

I know denials like this mean nothing to some of you--they certainly meant
nothing to Detweiler several years ago. But, for the record, virtually
every comment I have made on this list in the last couple of years has been
under my own name.

I agree that some good comments have come from anonymous posters.
