Pictures like coffee pots are likely to have parts that change
(e.g. the state of the coffee pot) and parts that don't change 
(e.g. the part of the wall that isn't blocked by the pot.)
This means that it's easy to tell which bits are being messed with,
if somebody's watching successive pictures.  If the digitization's
random enough in the low bits, it's a bit better, but a picture of
something moving helps.  Oceans and fog are great....
