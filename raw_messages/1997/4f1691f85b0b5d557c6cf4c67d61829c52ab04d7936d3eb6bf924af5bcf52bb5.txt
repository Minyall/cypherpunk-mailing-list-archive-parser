Two possibilities:

First, the law might not apply to remailer operators.  It only applies
to originators of messages.  It might make it illegal to use remailers
to send commercial messages, but that would apply to the users,
not to the remailer operators.

Even if it does apply to remailers, they can comply with it.
Put "Advertisement" at the front of each subject line, and put the
remailer operator's contact info in the message.  Remailer operators
are not generally hidden, so this does not hurt them any.
