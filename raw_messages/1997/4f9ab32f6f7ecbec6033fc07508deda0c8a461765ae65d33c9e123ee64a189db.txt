so we have myself, Jim Choate, and you who colunteer to host
mailing lists for the distributed cypherpunks.

I have already created majordomo@algebra.com and cypherpunks@algebra.com.

We can coordinate our efforts. Actually, we can even have a mini
mailing list for people who want to participate in the distributed
cypherpunks experiment. If there is any interest, I can create such 
a list.
