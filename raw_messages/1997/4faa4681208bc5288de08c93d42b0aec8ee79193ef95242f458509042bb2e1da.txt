I don't know the details of the agreement between VeriSign and the
USG.  I'm curious: how will the CRL for this revocation get distributed?
Since Communicator doesn't automatically pull CRLs, how can any action
on VeriSign's part disable crypto for that server?  Or are you
suggesting that as part of the revocation process, the USG will bust
down their doors and grab all copies of their private keys?
