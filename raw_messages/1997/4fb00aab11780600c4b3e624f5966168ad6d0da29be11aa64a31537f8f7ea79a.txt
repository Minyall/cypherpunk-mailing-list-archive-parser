My computer is generally down these days - I brought it up for a short
while to check the e-mail, but will be taking it down again soon...

Not that it means much, but: we both live in NYC.  I have a licence, but
I haven't driven the car in probably 3 or 4 years (my wife takes the darn
thing all the time).

One can live in NYC or SF and not have a car or licence. On the other hand
one can live in NYC and drive a gypsie cab and not have a licence (apparently
lots of people do!) because if you're pulled over and you don't have a
license, you're not arrested, and your car is not impounded - you're just
given a ticket which you don't have to pay.  Tickets are for suckers like
us who are in the system.

It's public in some Scandinavian countries.  I recall that there anyone can
check the balance on your bank account.

But of course not just the conviction record but the arrest record is
public information.

These are public in the U.K.  Indeed they'd find electioneering much
harder if they weren't.

Why, to round up all the japs, to confiscate their homes and businesses,
and to ship them to concentration camps. :-)

I don't see why anyone other than a buglar should be interested in the
intrnal layour of someone home. :-)

How about: patient X complaint about Dr. Y.

How about: Mrs. X is suing Mr. X for divorce and alleges that he's
been sexually molsting their kids.  In practice, this happens very
often, and is usually dismissed by the family court as pure bulshit.

How about adoption records...

But of course: if private casinos were allowed to compete against
the gubmint-run lotteries, they'd offer better odds, and no one would
play gubmint lotteries.
