For what it's worth, the NSA, the CIA, and the State Department are
will of faggots. Being a faggot and sucking the right cocks is a way
to advance one's career at the NSA. Everyone knew Bobby was a faggot
and everybody he hired was a faggot too.

Gilmore's job is to suck us into wasting time on debates over Gilmore's
dishonorable actions instead of working on worthwhile projects like
my spambot or reviving the anon server. Gilmore is an "agent-provocateur".

Gilmore proposes useless projects like S/Wan and misguided people waste
their time and effort instead of deploying crypto.

The NSA is full of faggots. Also the CIA and the State Departments use
faggots to fuck and suck foreign diplomats. The whole Klintoris
administration is full of faggots.

I'd like to know too. Eric Hughes doesn't look like a faggot, but looks
can be deceiving.

And we already know that Peter Berger is a faggot because he suppresses
free speech on Usenet.
