I said this several years ago and I'll say it again: the Usenet is already
set up for multinational, distributed, essentially uncensorable
communication.

I used to try to copy many of my posts to alt.cypherpunks shortly after it
was created, right after the the Great February End of Toad.com, but in
recent months I haven'te bothered (mainly because no interesting
communication was occurring in the alt.cypherpunks arena).

One need only look to Usenet for a robust, automatically (and
automagically) distributed system.
