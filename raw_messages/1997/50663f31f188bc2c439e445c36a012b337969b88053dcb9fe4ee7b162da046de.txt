One is reminded of:

"When compared with the suppression of anarchy every other
question sinks into insignificance. The anarchist is the enemy of
humanity, the enemy of all mankind, and his is a deeper degree of
criminality than any other. No immigrant is allowed to come to our
shores if he is an anarchist; and no paper published here or abroad
should be permitted circulation in this country if it propagates
anarchist opinions."
  - President Theodore Roosevelt
