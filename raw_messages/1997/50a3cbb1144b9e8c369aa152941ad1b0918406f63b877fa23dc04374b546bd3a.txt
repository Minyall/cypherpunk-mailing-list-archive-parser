What was I on when I wrote that crap!?

But I have a better example :D

I take a blood sample from our plunger wealding cop,  its the blood of a
homospapian i.e. a human.

The cop makes use of the plunger.

I take a second sample from our plunger wealding cop, its the blood of a
homospapain i.e. a human.

The cop can't become inhuman by any action thay take.
