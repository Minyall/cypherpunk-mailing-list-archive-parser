"Big Brother or the Boss?"


Are you SURE that's a dichotomy?

Big Biz and Big Gov are almost inextricably intertwined these days.  If dot-com pushes for snoopware, it is called CMR.  If dot-gov pushes for it, it is called GAK.  The real question is, if the interests of Biz and Gov coincide, and "real cooperation" is achieved, does it really matter where the idea originated?  Either way you still have snoopware.
