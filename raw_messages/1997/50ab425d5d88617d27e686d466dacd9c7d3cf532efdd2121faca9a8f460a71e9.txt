Another reason for keeping physical security over keys, nym keys, if it 
is important enough that the nym stays unidentifiable, should be kept on 
a different secring.pgp, which should be kept physically secure on a disk 
and encrypted using some other key than your own real-name secret key 
(this is just a measure to prevent breaking one key revealing the nym).
