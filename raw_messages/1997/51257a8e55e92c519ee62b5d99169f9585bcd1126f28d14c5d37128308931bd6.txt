Igor, I must disagree with you in detail.  I believe that some of the
problem this list is experiencing is because one or more people wish to
destroy it.  They are attempting to fill this list with so much junk that
all the people who read it will go elsewhere.  In the recent past, they
have subscribed it to other high-volume mailing lists, and given its
address to direct marketers as a "person" interested in sales pitches.
Perhaps these people already feel they are being treated unfairly by the
management of the unmoderated list.

These people will be perfectly happy to forge the names of preapproved
posters to further their attack.  While I suggest that, if we have
preapproved posters, we should try it first without digital signatures, I
predict that forgeries will be used to get around this policy.

I note in passing that at least one person has threatened to, "KILL
cypherpunks !!!".
