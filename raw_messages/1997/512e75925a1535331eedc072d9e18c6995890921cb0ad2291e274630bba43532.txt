Hi. I am aware of this remailer and am very happy to see one started in 
Japan. However, I am having a little problem adding it to the list 
because the Type-1 side of the remailer uses PGP 5.0, causing some 
compatibility problems with the remailer list software, which is based on 
PGP 2.6.2. Hopefully I can resolve these problems soon and add the remailer.

Thanks for your interest!
