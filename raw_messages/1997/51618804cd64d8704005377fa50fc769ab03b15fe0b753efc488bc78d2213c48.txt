Shit, I learned that in the service of my great country.  Who's 
sig-line talks about liberty being taken away little bits at a time?

As I said before freedom of speech has a price other than the blood 
of patriots.  That price is the tolerance of IDEAS!  Any fucking 
ideas that happen to come the fuck up!!!!!

I'm gonna tolerate who-the-hell-ever I want to!  There are not any 
grey areas when it comes to free speech.  You censor one because of 
bad manners or downright bad taste, then you censor all.

And fuck all you guys who *plonked* me over my last flame war with
T.M., cause you just missed a great post!  (I learned that in film
school: you have to like your own work).  

So my question is: is there going to be a maximum number of times I
can say fuck in a good post? Like a 3-fuck limit?  Or will you take
out the magic marker and draw through them?

Ross
