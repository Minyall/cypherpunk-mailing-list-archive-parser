Yes, this was reported earlier by others. Fabrice Planchon, a native of
France (I believe), discussed it at length.

And it is not surprising to any of us who have been following developments,
vis-a-vis the OECD, Wasenaar Agreement, and New World Order in general.

Nor is it by any stretch the first non-US GAK measures proposed. Cf. the
Trusted Third Parties plan in the U.K., the Australian developments, and
various measures in the Phillipines, Singapore, Germany, Sweden, and, of
course, the People's Republic of China.
