Will all those people who are talking about set theory and
the countability of various number systems take their discussion
to sci.math, please? 'Cuz

1) All that stuff is irrelevant to crypto, its science or politics.
2) Not a single math comment made by anybody on any of those
	threads is even remotely correct.
3) You will recieve your proper chewing out on sci.math

and

4) This bullshit is extremely annoying to those of us who has some real
	training in math, even more so than the regular bullshit on this list.

Hey Sandy, you gonna censor these creeps once you start censoring?
