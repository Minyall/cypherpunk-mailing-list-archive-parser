The only thing I can think of is if you use something like CFB mode, and
the IV is also the same at the beginning, the first 8 bytes will leave a
hole - I don't remember exactly, but I was burned by exactly this when I
saw 8 bytes of plaintext after resetting the IV in an app that xors some
encrypted blocks of data to do something else.

A PK to encode the conventional key works better since you can do a long
or complex conventional key and other material such as an IV once, and
then bury that several times.
