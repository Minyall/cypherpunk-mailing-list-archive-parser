Absolutely.  One wonders also if she may be concerned about loss of
reputation capital (i.e. her ability to be an effective advocate for
the NSA/LEA types).  The recent report by a panel of well-known

economically infeasible has made her look pretty out of touch, since
she's been arguing exactly the opposite for years.
