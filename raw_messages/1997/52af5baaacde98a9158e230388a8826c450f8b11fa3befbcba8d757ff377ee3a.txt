Beepers are also universal with sales people, partly because
cell phones don't have enough battery life; the new PCS phones that
combine the two capabilities may change this.
Computer dealer; drug dealer; - the latter knews what he's selling...

These days, beepers are being marketed for school kids,
partly so the parents can reach them but also so friends can.
Works fine in yuppie-spawn schools, yet inner-city schools consider
beepers to be evil and ban them.
