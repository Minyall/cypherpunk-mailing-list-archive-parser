*** FBI chief calls for computer crime crackdown

FBI director Louis Freeh said Tuesday that criminals were moving
increasingly into cyberspace and without new laws "drug dealers, arms
dealers, terrorists and spies will have immunity like no other".
Freeh told the International Association of Chiefs of Police that
software manufacturers should be required by law to include a feature
that allows police to descramble encrypted communications. Freeh said
he supported a cyber surveillance law with these features which
passed out of the House Intelligence Committee. For the full text
