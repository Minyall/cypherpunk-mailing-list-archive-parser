I think there is a large difference between storage key recovery and
message key recovery.  Also a difference between message key recovery
and including information with the message allowing it to be recovered
by fourth parties.

Yes, governments would like to come take your disk, but they've got to
come and get it first.  And when they get there they may find you are
not using GAKked keys on your disk encryption.  They won't know until
they try.  With email GAK and recovery info with the email, they can
tell from remote snooping if you are cheating.
