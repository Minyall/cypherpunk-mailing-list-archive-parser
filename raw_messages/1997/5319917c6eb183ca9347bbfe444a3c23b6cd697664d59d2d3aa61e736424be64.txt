Bob, you can forward this if you like to any appropriate newsgroups (but
only if it hasn't already been mentioned).  If it isn't entirely clear,
let me know.

According to Netscape's press release of 12/10/97, their new Mission
Control software solution includes an LDAP directory server and a
certificate server.  That certificate server boasts an interesting new
feature: the ability for the server to generate not just certs but also
the keys, and install them on remotely managed browsers.  They are
positioning this as a feature for organizations that want to use keys
but don't want to lose access to corporate data.
