I guess the real question is whether the messages/files generated just add
an extra key or if they leak the key through some harder to identify method.

The current version of PGP no longer shows you the list of recipients, so
it is more difficult to determine if extra keys are added.

Is the method they are using for this new version to "escrow" the keys
obvious to the recipient or not?
