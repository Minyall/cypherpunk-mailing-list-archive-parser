You need to understand Newspeak to understand any crypto documents
written by the government, or government toadies.

To them the key recovery, key escrow are just different PR terms to
try to con people into going along with goverment backdoors in crypto
software.

The key recovery alliance program (KRAP) is a government program to
bribe companies into building government backdoors into their crypto
programs.

The KRAP program requires it's participants to agree to fast track
installation of GAK (Government Access to Keys -- master government
backdoor stuff) into their software.  In exchange for doing this the
companies get permission to export ridiculously weak 56 bit crypto
instead of even more ridiculously weak 40 bit crypto.

They have a 2 year time frame in which to install government master
backdoors into their crypto software.  And there are reviews of
progress made every 6 months -- failure to meet deadlines results in
loss of 56 bit export permission.

I fully expect Schneier spoke out against KRAP -- the companies
involved are government sell outs.  This is why people are upset that
PGP Inc was just bought out by a KRAP company McAfee (which recently
renamed itself to Network Associates).
