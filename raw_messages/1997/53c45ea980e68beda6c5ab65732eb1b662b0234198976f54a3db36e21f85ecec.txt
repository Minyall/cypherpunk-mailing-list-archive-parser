This is a real problem to me. As I recieve mail via cslip using
popclient there seems to be no way to get it sorted. Though I'm not a
programmer at all I could instruct procmail to do what I want. It works
fine when I'm sending mail from one account to the other locally. You can
find information on procmail on the net (and this list). But nobody seems
to know about popclient, which according to the man-pages may be
influenced by an awk-script to do sorting.
Does anybody know about an example script on that? An URL?
Not that I know about awk. But you can't do anything w/o trying.
