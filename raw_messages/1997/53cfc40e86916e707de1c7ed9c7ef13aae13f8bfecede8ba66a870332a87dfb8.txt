I can see where they want to make a profit, but the licence makes the
software virtually undistributable by normal shareware channels.  

>From what I have read of the license it is against the license agreement to
ship the libraries on a CD of shareware products for which a price is charged.

If I were to create a program using the libraries and upload them to Simtel
or one of the other big archives, it could not be distributed on a Simtel
CD-ROM that someone was charging money for.  (Ignoring the usual export
issues.)

I see this as a big problem.
