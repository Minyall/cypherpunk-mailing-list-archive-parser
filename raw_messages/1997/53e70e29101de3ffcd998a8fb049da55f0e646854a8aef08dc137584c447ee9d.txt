THE SOVEREIGN INDIVIDUAL
How to Survive and Thrive During the Collapse of the Welfare State
by James Dale Davidson and Lord William Rees-Mogg 

In their newest work, the authors of Blood in the Streets and The Great 
Reckoning predict increased autonomy for the individual as information 
technologies advance and old institutions crumble-including the welfare state 
itself. Along with an array of provocative predictions (government will 
declare war on groups that try to circumvent income tax through cyberspace; 
central banks will lose control over the money supply as cybercash supplants 
paper money; the U.S. government will shrink) Rees-Mogg and Davidson offer 
investment advice and strategies for coping.
