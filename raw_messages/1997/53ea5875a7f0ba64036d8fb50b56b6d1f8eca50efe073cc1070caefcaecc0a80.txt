Hey guys,
2 quick questions:

Are there any known hacks or weaknesses in S/Key?

Has Anyone heard of a new product called SecureWin from Cipher Logics 
Corp. It looks like vaporware but is a little more sophisticated than 
the usual product spams (like IPG, POTP, Encrypt-it, WinKrypt etc.)
[I checked there web page some interesting fuctions, , No software 
available yet and Phone numbers are either busy or not in service, go 
figure]

thanks 

Steveo
