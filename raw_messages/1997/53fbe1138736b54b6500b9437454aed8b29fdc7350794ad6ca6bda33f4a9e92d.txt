Tims post made a good point, people soon forget the causes of conflict 
and only see the effects, today, hardly anyone in the UK sees the IRA as 
an organisation devoted to liberating NI, merely a bunch of thugs. Of 
course they have brought this on themselves by indiscriminately blowing 
things up. Talking of which the Queen is visiting Hastings (a town about 
5 miles from me) today, I hope the IRA blow her up...
