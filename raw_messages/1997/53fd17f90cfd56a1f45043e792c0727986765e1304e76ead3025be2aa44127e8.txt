What the bill punishes with five years in prison is the use of encryption
in FURTHERANCE of a crime.

I will demonstrate at the next SF Bay Area Cypherpunks meeting on Saturday
May 10, 1997 the use of encryption in furtherance of a crime using only
three mouse clicks and three keystrokes. No custom scripts, macros, etc.
involved. In fact, I will gladly perform the demonstration on a computer
provided by the audience.

That's right folks! Three mouse clicks and three keystrokes will buy you 
*five* years in the federal penitentiary should SAFE become law as 
currently written.

[Since this is a controlled demo, no actual crimes will be committed. Do 
not try this at home! You will be breaking the law.]
