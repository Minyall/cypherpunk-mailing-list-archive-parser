The Interdisciplinary Centre for Law and Information Technology from the 
University of Leuven is currently carrying out a study on the legal aspects 
of Digital Signatures. The current and draft legislation, policies and 
practices of the European Member States as well as the EC's most important 
trading partners is being investigated and analysed. Final aim of the study 
is to provide tools for a common European legal instrument regarding Digital 
Signatures.
