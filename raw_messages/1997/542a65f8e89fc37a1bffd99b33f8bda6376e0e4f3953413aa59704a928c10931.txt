Seems to me I-Planet can't trademark a word which has been in usage by many
of us for several years. What could they do, demand that we stop using a
word we in all likelihood coined? Remove our old writings from the Web?
(How?)

We were using the term "cypherspace" in '93-94, especially in the physical
meetings in Mountain View. I recall first hearing it from Eric Hughes, who
may have gotten it from Jude Milhon, or elsewhere. The context was of a new
slogan:

"In cypherspace no one can read your screen."

(This being a takeoff on the "Aliens" tag line: "In space no one can hear
you scream.")

This usage was probably around mid-1993. I started using it to describe the
obvious thing, the "space" our messages, list, etc. live in.  There are
references in my Cyphernomicon, published in September '94, but written
over the previous 8 months, to cypherspace, as in the section on "Data
Havens," where I wrote: "One of the powerful uses of strong crypto is the
creation of journals, web sites, mailing lists, etc., that are
"untraceable." These are sometimes called "data havens," though that term,
as used by Bruce Sterling in "Islands in the Net" (1988), tends to suggest
specific places like the Cayman Islands that corporations might use to
store data. I prefer the emphasis on "cypherspace.""

I don't know about trademark law, and about whether "prior use" invalidates
an attempted trademark.  It seems unrealistic for them to lay claim to a
word someone else invented.

Certainly if this company gets a trademark, it'd be interesting to repost
some old posts, or make references to the comic book, Java applet, etc.,
and then see if they demanded that history be expunged.
