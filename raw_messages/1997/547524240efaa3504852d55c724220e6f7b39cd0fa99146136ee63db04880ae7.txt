I would think that with all the recent publicity about the IRS abusing
citizens, limited only by the agency's creativity and its ability to
select citizen-units preceived as unable to fight back, that we should be
able to spin the Jim Bell case in a way which further damages the public
image of the IRS.

After all, the IRS is hardly the agency charged with discovering alleged
plots to overthrow the government, and the fabrication of such a plot in
order to harrass and imprison a tax protester would seem to constitute
antics similar to those disclosed in recent Congressional hearings. 

Of course, it would be difficult to wash away all the FUD the government
has disseminated about the Bell case by now.  Still, I think sloshing the
IRS with a bit of the excrement they have been dispensing to the press
might not be a bad move.  Perhaps a noisy statement about the Bell case at
one of those public meetings the IRS has been commanded to hold to discuss
its past abuses might be a good place to start.
