Ok I'll take this slowly

1) All of humanity is equaliy human

2) If someone is made less then human then we all become less human by
that amount

For esample if Alice, Bob and Paul all have say 10 units of humanity.  Now
Paul shoves a plunger up Bobs datehole,  we could say that Paul should
have 5 units of humanity.  By rule one every body else is now also 5
units.

As you can planly see assining humanitiy and inhumanity is a pointless
esasize.

Please excuse my spelling as I suffer from agraphia see the url in my header.
