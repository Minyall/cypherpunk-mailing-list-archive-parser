I'm already getting multiple copies of messages I can't account for.
The frequency and number seem to be random, and I'm not counting
forwarded stuff.  Take the posts from the most "trusted" people.
Subtract out any personal cc's, account for additional lists subscribed
to, compare for similar (but not identical) posts, and still the
numbers don't add up.
