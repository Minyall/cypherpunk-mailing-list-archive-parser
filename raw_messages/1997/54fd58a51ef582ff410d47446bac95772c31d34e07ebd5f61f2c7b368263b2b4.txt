  I've also heard that some have hacked cellphones so that they can
become a 'clone' of an existing phone, receiving all commands to swap
channels, etc. But not sending anything back to the cell sites. (This is
different from the usual cloning that goes on where they duplicate the
phone and use it to run up enormous bills). I haven't found any concrete
refrences to this in my recent browsing though, so it may just be a
vapor-hack.
