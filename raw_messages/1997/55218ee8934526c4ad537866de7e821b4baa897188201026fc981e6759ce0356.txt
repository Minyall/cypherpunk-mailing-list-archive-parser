Correct.  Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin, and others were Deists, and
Masons, and would have laughed hysterically at the absurd notion of the
divinity of Jesus Christ.

In fact, Jefferson once attributed the large mass of Christian theological
writings to the fact that "Nonsense can never be explained."

It is most entertaining that in spite of these undisputed historical
facts, the modern day Christian FunnyMentalists continue to spew forth the
revisionist notions that the Founding Fathers were Christians, and that
the United States was founded as a "Christian Nation."
