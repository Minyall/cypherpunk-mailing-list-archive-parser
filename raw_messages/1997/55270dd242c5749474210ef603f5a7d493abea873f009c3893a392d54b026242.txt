                   JOHN PAUL GETTY II NOW A BRITISH CITIZEN

     LONDON (AP) -- American billionaire John Paul Getty II is an
     American no longer.
     
     The London Sunday Telegraph says the philanthropist has become a
     British citizen and revoked his U.S. citizenship. Sources in the
     British government confirm the move.
     
     Getty is 65 and has lived in Britain for 25 years. During that time,
     he's become one of the country's major benefactors. In 1986, he even
     received an honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II.
     
     The Forbes magazine list of the 400 richest Americans estimates
     Getty's fortune at $1 billion.
