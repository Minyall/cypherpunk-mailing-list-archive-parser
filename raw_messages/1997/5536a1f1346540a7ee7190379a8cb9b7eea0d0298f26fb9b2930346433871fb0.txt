While Blanc is only joking, I want to take this opportunity to comment
on the Find The Mole game.

Moles look just like everyone else.  Speculation on who is actually a
provocateur or an informant or a saboteur or whatever only has the
purpose of creating unhappiness and undermining anything worthwhile
that is going on.

It is likely that there are informants lurking amongst the
cypherpunks.  The secret police watch and infiltrate far less
interesting groups, and this one has received more than its share of
publicity.  (In a couple of decades we'll probably learn who they
were.  Hopefully things will work out in such a way that this will be
worth a good laugh.)

The right thing to do is to assume there are a certain number of moles
around and engineer your activities accordingly.  If you really think
you can Find The Mole, then I would think your first step is to keep
quiet about what you are doing.
