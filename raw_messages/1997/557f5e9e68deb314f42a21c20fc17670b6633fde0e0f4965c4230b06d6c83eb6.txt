The main difference between Timothy May and shit is that shit smells 
better.

The only `culture' Timmy May possesses is that 
cultivated from his foreskin scrapings.

I think Vulis needs each of us to send ten copies of this back to him.

Timothy May's 16Kb brain's single convolution is directly 
wired to his rectum for input and his T1 mouth for output. 
That's 16K bits, not bytes. Anal intercourse has caused 
extensive brain damage.

  We are truly indebted to Barely Anonymous for reminding us of the
hallowed, non-vuterpertative history of the cypherpunks list, which we
should revere and hold in great piss-stream, as ? the Platypus would
surely tell us.
  I look forward to Barely Anonymous' posts containing "narc'ing 
cryptographic technicalities" in the future.
