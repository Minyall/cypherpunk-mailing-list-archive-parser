No, I did not.

I feel that Apple's "lack of participation" is much more a preoccupation
with other matters (like losing $700M) rather than a stand on principle.

However, I suspect that if Apple management actually started work on
such a project (or were ready to begin seeding), there would be a lot of
opposition, both inside and outside Apple.

Martin, do you have any comment on this?
