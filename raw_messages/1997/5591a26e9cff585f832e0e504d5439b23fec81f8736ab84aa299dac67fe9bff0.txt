I also did a frequency analysis on letters of the ciphertext. Here's the
output of my frequency program: 

a:71 b:72 c:66 d:55 e:48 f:57 g:68 h:49 i:72 j:52 k:59 l:48 m:77 n:80
o:41 p:70 q:59 r:63 s:62 t:63 u:53 v:55 w:62 x:60 y:45 z:66

Min = 41, Max = 80, mean = 60.500000, std = 10.044899

16 letters' frequencies are within 50--70, 10 are out, which 
suggests that the distribution may not be "normal". For a normal the
proportion should be something like 84:16.

I also tried xoring the plaintext line with the ciphertext line, w/o
much enlightenment.

yes

I also likes "follows": "vkbcjtp" note how ll gets translated to "bc".
That suggest that after some encryption of each letter from the plaintext
there is a consecutively increasing number added.

agree, there is a lot of other similar stuff
