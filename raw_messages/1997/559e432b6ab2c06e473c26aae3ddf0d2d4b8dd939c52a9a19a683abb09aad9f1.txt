Dimitri, some time ago there was a vote on a certain soc.culture.* 
newsgroup.

As you know, the group passed, but if there was one YES vote less than
the number cast, the group would not pass.

That one vote came from you (thank you). Do you think that your influence
in the vote was not worth shit? I think not.
