I am of the opinion that Hettinga still has some value, but he should
work on his style and do a little more homework before posting.

I think what he is trying to convey is relentless positive energy and
friendliness.  This may work in person, but it tends to fail in ASCII.

He also doesn't seem to be aware that a good portion of his articles
are insulting.  It's somewhat understandable if he is a recovering
Democrat.  I've seen cases like this before and they are treatable.
