  All's fair in love and Penis War.
  Your argument seems to center around the theme that those who dick
everyone a little have no right to expect to be repaid in lump (pardon
the pun) sum.

  You neglect to point out that those who use technology to send spam
to millions of random addresses go to great pains to prevent those who
receive their crapola from replying to the source of the spam.
  The fact is, anyone who chooses to return their crap in kind has my
personal proxy to send them my share, as well. I am certain that if you
take a poll on this you will find a few million others who will also
give them this proxy.
