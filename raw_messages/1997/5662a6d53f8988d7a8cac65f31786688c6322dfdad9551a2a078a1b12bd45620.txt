How about this simple policy scheme:

  1) posts from known list members forwarded to list automatically
  2) posts with "approval cookie" also forwarded automatically
  3) otherwise, forwarded only after approval by moderator, whose charter
	only permits spam filtering.

People who don't want to use their own name in a post, and also don't
want to be bothered with creating a cookie are the only ones whose posts
are delayed.
