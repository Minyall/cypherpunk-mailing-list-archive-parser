Sorry, I misunderstood the earlier message.  I thought that it referred
to news propagation between a small set of hosts versus mail propagation
between the same small set of mail/news hosts, and I did not see why
it was obvious that mail would be faster than news.  But actually the
earlier message refered to news propagation over the whole planet versus
mail propagation between a small set of hosts, in which case of course
news will be slower.
