Nope. Though Canada allows export of strong crypto generally, 
Canadians may not re-export US products once they enter the country.

Yup. As you could imagine, US export laws are set up to try to avoid 
such compatibility whenever possible. This is also a reason why PGP 
Inc.'s recent shift to crypto services and away from relying on 
crypto sales exclusively is a relatively big deal. If everyone has 
the software, PGP Inc. can provide services to those folks a lot more 
easily. PGP 5.0, of course, is out there on the Net for the taking 
worldwide.

Cheers.
