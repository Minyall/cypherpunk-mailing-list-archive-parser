I gave several examples.

I never said they would.  You asked what motivates people to use an
anonymous remailer irrespective of cost.

I think you answered your own question:

The money laundering issue has very little to do with the remailers, and
more to do with the structure of the economic/banking system, how easily
one can convert wealth from one form to another, and whether there is
incentive to do so.

You seem to feel that people are unlikely to pay for any of the most
common uses of remailers - you're probably right - which brings us back
full circle.
