* New York City special-effects artist Matt McMullen, 28, has
been offering his lifesize, authentically detailed, steel-skeletoned,
silicone dolls, under the name "Real Dolls," for several months on
the Internet, for around $4,000 each plus options.  So far, Stacy,
Natasha, Nina, and Leah are available, with choice of hair color,
skin color, and height (either "supermodel" or short and
voluptuous).  His original doll was intended as sculpture until lonely
men bombarded him with price inquiries.  Said McMullen, "There is
no way this can compete with the real thing, but it can fill a deep
void in someone's life."
