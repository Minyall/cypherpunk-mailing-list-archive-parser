It's interesting that in the various recent developments over crypto, the
needs of business are taking priority over the basic rights of citizens. In
fact, the debate is being driven by issues of "competitiveness."

* In the latest round of crypto export policy, relayed to us by Will Rodger
of "Interactive Week," it is relaxation of export for financial and banking
software that is being pushed. (Possibly connected to the next item,
though.)

* Meanwhile, the Administration's "Crypto Import Restrictions" (officially
entitled "The Safe Streets, Child Protection, and Public Safety Act") are
about to be introduced, as reported to us by Brock Meeks (on this list by
Bill Stewart). It is possible that this is also related to corporate
interests, as this would stop certain offshore developers--unhindered by
U.S. laws--from competing in the U.S. against U.S. companies (this is mere
speculation on my part, but it may be part of the big picture).

* And SAFE has special provisions for financial cryptography (read: Banking
interests), while also putting the screws to any citizen-units who step out
of bounds with crypto.

...and so on.

What these trends add up to is an almost complete disregard for basic,
fundamental issues of civil liberties and freedom in favor of various
craftings of laws to advantage some American companies, disadvantage other
American companies, and manipulate the international competitive scene.

This is what politics has always been, of course. Pork barrels and pigs at
the trough, to mix some porcine metaphors.

It shows how far we have degenerated as a nation. Exactly which parts of
the First, Second, etc. Amendments do these porkers not understand?

May they all be vaporized.
