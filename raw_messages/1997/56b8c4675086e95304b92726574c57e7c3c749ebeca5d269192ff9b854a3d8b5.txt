    Mike Duvos <enoch@zipcon.net> expostulated:

+In an interview to be aired on "60 Minutes" this Sunday, Alexandr
+Lebed, former Russian National Security Advisor, will reveal that his
+country has lost track of more than 100 nuclear bombs made to look like
+suitcases, and has no idea what happened to them.

+Probably not a good time to visit the Zionist Entity. :)

    that only takes two at most --probably not a good idea to live
    in the top 98 metropolitan areas of the United States --or down
    wind from same.
