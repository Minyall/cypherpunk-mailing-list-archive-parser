Contrary to the Marxists, the Nazis did not advocate public owner-
ship of the means of production. They did demand that the government 
oversee and run the nation's economy. The issue of legal ownership, 
they explained, is secondary; what counts is the issue of control. 
Private citizens, therefore, may continue to hold titles to property, so 
long as the state reserves to itself the unqualified right to REGULATE 
the use of their property...
