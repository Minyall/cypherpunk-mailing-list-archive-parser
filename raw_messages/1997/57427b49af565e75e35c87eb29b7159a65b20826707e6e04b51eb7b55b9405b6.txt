Sigh. I've experimented with "hide" NoCeMs for traffic that in my opinion
was off-topic in certain badly infested newsgroups, and wasn't quite happy.
If the saboteur posts 10,000 junk articles that must be distributed
before the NoCeMs are issued and applied, then he has succeeded in
causing damages. "Hide" NoCeMs work fine against plan old "spam" (multi-
posting a few articles), but not against deliberate flooding with tens
of thousands of articles.

A better idea might be "select" NoCeMs first suggested by the CancelMoose,
but not implemented in any reader I know.
