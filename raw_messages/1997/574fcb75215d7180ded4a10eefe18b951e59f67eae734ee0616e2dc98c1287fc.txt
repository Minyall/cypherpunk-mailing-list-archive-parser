No you couldn't. If you wanted to. :-).

In a geodesic economy, things will settle for bearer cash, unless you
borrow money to pay for them, and even then the loan will be a bearer
certificate loan, and not a book-entry loan like a VISA card is.

Ignoring for the time being that you're using a floatless "loan" when you
buy something with a VISA card...

Cheers,
