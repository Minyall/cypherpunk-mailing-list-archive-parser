Ok, we write code.  But as James S. Tyre pointed out, if the code is
too difficult to use it will not be.  And as Declan pointed out
many/most people will not use the crypto if they must think about it.

Writing the code is no longer enough.  The code must be usable by the
sheeple to work.  How do we do that?
