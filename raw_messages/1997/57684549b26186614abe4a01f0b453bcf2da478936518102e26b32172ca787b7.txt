Until that manual becomes available, the reader may wish to take a look at:

"Intelligence Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP) for Operations Other
Than War (OOTW)"
G2/S2
82nd Airborne Division
Guidelines and Lessons Learned

About $7 at the gun show.

In Europe, shit has long hit the fan. The member of the German parliament
under indictment for linking to the Radikal webpage is now also being
prosecuted for making the charges against her public. Seems it is illegal
in Germany to publicize any federal charges filed against you. The Geheime
[Secret, ed.] Staats Polizei roams the German streets again. Truly scary
stuff. And, yes, it can happen here.

[The defendant has a facsimile of the official court document on her
webpage. Guess that's going to be another count].
