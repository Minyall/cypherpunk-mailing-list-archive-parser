 I would be almost as inclined to think that a company using PGP5.5
with a forced encrypted to (company) self in addition to whomever else
... might even put up a bigger fuss about passing out their 'master
key' to Freeh-dumb et al. than many CP individuals ...

  ... another passing thought, could the anticipated implementation of
this have had anything to do with removal of the 'conventional
encryption' options in PGP5 ????
