Question: Are the Feds involved, or is it just the State of Illinois?
If the Feds really are involved, what possible justification do they

The best way to help Mrs. Allen is to find ways for her to communicate
with the civilized world.

Maybe use a model airplane deliver a CB?  Or a spread spectrum radio?
