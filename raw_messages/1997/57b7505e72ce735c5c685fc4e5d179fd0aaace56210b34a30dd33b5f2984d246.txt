Any particular methodology you might care to share on stopping WWII?
Being an avid amateur historian concerning WWII I am very much interested in
any insight you might have.

As to taxation and withholding:

 
			       ARTICLE XVI. 
 
	The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on 
incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the 
several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration. 
[25 February 1913.] 
 
Notice the date of implimentation, considerably before WWII, it is in fact
the year before the US became involved in WWI. Perhaps you meant WWI instead
of WWII? Citizens of the US have been paying taxes since 1914.

What war? The taxes came about because of issues other than fighting a war
which hadn't even happened yet.
