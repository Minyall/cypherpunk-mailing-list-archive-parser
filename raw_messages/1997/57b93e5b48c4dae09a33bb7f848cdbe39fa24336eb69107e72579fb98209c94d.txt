PGP 5.0 is the software formerly known as PGP 3.0. Viacrypt, which sold
commercial PGP licenses before PGP, Inc. was formed, used to sell a PGP 4.x
GUI version based on 2.63 core. Rather than trying to explain to their
customers why 3.0 was more advanced than 4.5, PGP, Inc decided to name the
rewrite 5.0.
