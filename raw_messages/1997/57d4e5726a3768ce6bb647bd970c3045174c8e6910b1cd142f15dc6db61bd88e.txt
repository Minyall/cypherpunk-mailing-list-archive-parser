Which is why it is a good thing that Libraries are state funded.

I don't think I saw TM's analysis, since I am on fight-censorship, but I
don't see where there is any confusion.  Except in very limited
circumstances (National Security), the government cannot hire or fire a
contractor (or employee) based on unrelated speech.

It may be legal, but whether it is moral is certainly debatable.

Why is this confusing?  It is very simple to tell the difference between 
the State as employer and the State as censor.

A Public Library is allowed restrict Internet Access to its employees on 
the job, since it is acting as an employer.

A Public Library may not be allowed to restrict Internet Access to its
patrons (we will see how Loudoun turns out).

Not necessarily responsible, but it is legal.

This is correct.

Again, I don't see what is confusing about this.
