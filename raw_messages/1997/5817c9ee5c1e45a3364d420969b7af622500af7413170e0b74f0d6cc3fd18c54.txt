Why does everyone still have cypherpunks@toad.com in their Cc: list, or
how can I get it to work so I don't have to edit the headers (back to the
procmail manual...)

One correction.  She was released by a special law passed by the house of
representatives after a media blitz about her case.  The law only let her
go and did not generally limit the period of time people could be held in
contempt.  It was not the judge, but a legislature trying to quell some
outcry without doing any real reform
