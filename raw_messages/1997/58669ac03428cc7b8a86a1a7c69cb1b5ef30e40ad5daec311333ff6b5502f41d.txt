 Considering there is a LARGE workload on the employees as it is.. they dont
need more work suddenly that is unneeded. Basically EVERY system has some
kinds of security holes. If noone knows about them.. then it isnt a problem.
If someone is exploiting them and using money from the company illegaly (free
phone service) .. even though it may only be 5 of you doing it.. it has a
LARGE potential to become globally exploited by tons of people. So.. they
have to invest time and money to research the hole and fix it. Thats why.
