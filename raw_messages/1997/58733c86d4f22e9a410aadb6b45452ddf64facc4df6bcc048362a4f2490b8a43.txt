I think that looking towards Europe on issues of Civil Liberties is the
sillist of notions. The Big 3 players in Europe (UK,Germany,France)
wouldn't have a clue how to operate in a free and open society the smaller
players are even worse.

We have right now in Europe the universal embracement of
Socialism/Communisim/Statism at the same time that Eastern Europe & the
former Soviet Empire are struggling towards Democracy & Freedom.

Anyone who can point towards the actions of the Eurocrats as an example of
how we should go does not have the intrest of Freedom & Liberty for the
citizens at hart.
