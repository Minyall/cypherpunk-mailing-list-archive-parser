Yep see Electronics and Computer Science added to the Evil Book Topic
list:

Evil Book Topic List
====================

Chemistry  -- could be used by "Terrorist"
Physics    -- could be used by "Terrorist"
Biology    -- could be used by "Terrorist"
Mathematics -- could be used by "Terrorist" 

Not to mention the fact that if you have any equipment related to any of
these evil topics and you are not a state approved scientist automatically
elevates you to either "terrorist" or drug manufacture if not both.

Basically it is getting to the point where having an IQ greater than 100
is a crime (no doubt generated out of jealousy by those who work for the
State).

One has to wonder how far Edison would have gotten in times such as today.

"Beware the bureaucrats as they do far more damage than all the Hitlers
and Stalins combined."
