Has Lynx been ported to the Mac? You might want to just write your own. If
your not intrested in all the N$ crap (frames, animated Gifs, cookies,
...) it is really quite easy code to write a few socket calls and parsing
of some text. I wrote one over a weekend that handles 99% of my web
browsing needs.

I haven't looked at the Macs in a long time, when I did the hardware was
not up to handling the GUI, does the current OS support a "text mode" or
must everything be GUI?
