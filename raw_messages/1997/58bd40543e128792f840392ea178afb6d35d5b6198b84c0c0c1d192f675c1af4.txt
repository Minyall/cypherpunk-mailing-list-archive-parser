>     Amendment XI
>     
>    The judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to
>    extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against
>    one of the United States by citizens of another state, or by citizens
>    or subjects of any foreign state.

Of note is that this amendment *only* covers cases where a citizen sues a
*single* state, not 49 of them.

There is no Constitutional rule that covers the process between a individual
and more than a single state. It simply ain't there.
