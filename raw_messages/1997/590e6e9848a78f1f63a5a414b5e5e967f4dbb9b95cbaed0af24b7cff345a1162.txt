  Ya know, this shit really pisses me off. I understand that we have to
protect everyone's rights if we wish are own to be protected. This is a
classic case of what is causing the mainstream public to hash so hard
about porn and such. I did nothing to solicit this beyond posting to a
news group. This troller comes along, scarfs my email address and then
sends me this email. If you click on the link it sends you to a place to
sign up for accessing a hard porn site. This is what feeds the initiated
Johnnie Q.Public's desire to control the net, and endangers all of our
rights on the net. I understand that we have to protect the enemies'
rights too, but can't we just shoo a few of them first? Lowers the
numbers needing protection and might help us out in the end.
Grrrrrrr!!!!
