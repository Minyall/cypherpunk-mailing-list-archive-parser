There is little hope unless we kill around 70% of the population of 
the planet, those untouched by western "democracy" or the 
totalitarian autocracies of the mid and far east are the only people 
sure to be mentally capable of comprehending the ethical theory and 
idealogy of anarchism.

One does not need to be an optimist to see the good in AP, merely 
capable of following a logical chain of thought without allowing 
yourself to react to things rather than really considering them.

I am low on Jack Daniels at the moment, so I too am not 
functioning as usual. Reality is merely a halucination brought 
on by lack of alcohol.
