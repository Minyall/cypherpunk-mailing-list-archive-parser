Those of you in urban soft target areas, expecially any of you living or
working in DC or NYC, may want to consider getting vaccinated against
Anthrax. It might come in handy before long.

>From an US Army (?) press release:
| The immunizations, requiring six shots over 18 months followed by annual
| booster shots, will begin next summer with 100,000 American troops in
the
| Gulf region and Korean peninsula.
