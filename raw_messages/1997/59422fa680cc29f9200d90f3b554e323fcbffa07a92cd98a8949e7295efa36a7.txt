I wrote two remailer programs, I ran several remailers, and I am working
on bugfixes for replay. I couldn't care less about your founding
fathers who killed the native americans and raped their women.
Killing virtually unarmed  people with guns is an act of cowardice.

Flaming me through a remailer is the equivalent of shouting 
'hey asshole!' and then running away. Children do it often.

I also cannot reply to you privately, so all other members of
this mailinglist have to suffer our private flamewar.

	hugs and kisses,
