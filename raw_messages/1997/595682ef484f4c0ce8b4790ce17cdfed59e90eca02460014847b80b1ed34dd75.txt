Excellent idea, but a lot harder to implement than simply having the 
system return a message that stated that your account is "overdrawn", and 
then notifying the security organization of your choice.

"Dude. I told ya, I don't have more than $10 in that account ..., just 
paid my rent/ alimony/ child-support/ bookie / parking tickets ... "

Since the criminal will no doubt be aware of this tactic, they'll be in 
the position of determining if the victim is lying about their lack of 
assets, or is using the security code. Will they be willing to risk 
murder against the possibility that the victim can be persuaded to give 
up the "real" number when other options are available? Possible, yes, but 
the average petty street criminal is looking for an easier mark.
