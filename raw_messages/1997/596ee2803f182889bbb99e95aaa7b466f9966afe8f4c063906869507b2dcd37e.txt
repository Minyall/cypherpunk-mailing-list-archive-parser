Would cult members kindly stop bickering and straying from the party
line?

All this argument questioning sacred dogma is anti-cypherpunk, and
clearly bought on by failure to recite the daily mantra:

 "Krispin-hare-hare-krispin government is evil
  Krispin-hare-hare-krispin nuke washington DC
  Krispin-hare-hare-krispin gun down graffiti kids
  Krispin-hare-hare-krispin sterelize the proles"

You're becoming so unpredictable, this is sacrilege, cult members
are supposed to unquestioningly follow sacred dogma.

Hare-Krispin
