There we go!  The all American strive for compromise.  Yet, very few 
people are willing to compromise on this issue, for some reason.  I'd 
like for more people just give it up and come to the realization 
that the INet is going to be commercial, and no laws can stifle the 
commerce that goes on here.  Or stop Spam.
