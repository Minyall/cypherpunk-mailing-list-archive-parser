I can think of a couple of scenarios in which pasting in a From:
header pointing to a 'nym might be advantageous:

1.)  Posts when the nymserver is down, or;

2.)  Posts from an insecure location where installation of one's secret
     keyring is not desirable.  (The "newnym" servers require that send
     requests be PGP-signed with the nym's secret key.)
