TruthMonger's post is sorta funny, actually. But I wouldn't say that about
Time (at least now -- I don't know what the organization was like
internally before I joined). I've been at Time one year. The people I work
with in the bureau are top-notch reporters.

And for a change one of my articles actually seems to be staying in and not
getting cut for Diana updates -- at least not yet...
