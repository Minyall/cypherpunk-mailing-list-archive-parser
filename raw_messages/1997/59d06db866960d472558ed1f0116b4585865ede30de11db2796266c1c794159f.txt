 no questio about wear, but I saw the barrel after it colled and it had a 
warp to it. I said 1000 rounds straight and I meant it. They kept linking 
onto the belts and I will bet he didn't let up on the trigger  a dozen 
times through the ten belts .... my LRRP team had stumbled into a bit of 
hornets nest and half the NVA in that end of the province were chasing 
our asses by the time we hitthat LZ. the guy just kept firing til the 
barrel glowed and it did warp slightly when it cooled, enough that he 
didn't want to chance another round down the barrel. my guess is that it 
had been abused more than a few times and the overall temper of the metal 
had chnaged , but for sure there was probably very littel rifling left in 
the barrel as well. I have seen M-60 barrels so worn that they appeared 
to the naked eye as smoothbores.
