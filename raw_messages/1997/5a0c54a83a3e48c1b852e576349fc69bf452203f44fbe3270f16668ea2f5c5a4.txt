A law to collect "tribute" money will be supported by people who 
want to leech "competent" value producers of thier property. 
A collection of such incompetent parasites is a "herd" 
in the current context. On the other hand a collection of 
good value producer who dont want to live of other people and 
dont approve of a law that enforces such a behaviour is the "competent". 

Though, to identify competent from incompetent, is quite besides 
the point. Collection of any tribute money at a point of a gun, 
is a bad thing and is ethically wrong. I want call it
"cult" thinking. Its a simple _objective_ law that
ensures freedom of choice. And one has to identify it and 
learn to respect it. 

best,
Vipul

one has to identify and act accordingly if want to live 
peacefully.
