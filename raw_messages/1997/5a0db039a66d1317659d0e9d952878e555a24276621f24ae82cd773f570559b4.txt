No.  But here's a joke:

    The pope and President Clinton died on the same day, but due to an
    administrative foul up, Clinton was sent to heaven and the Pope
    was sent to hell. 

    The Pope explained the situation to the devil, he checked out all
    of the paperwork, and the error was acknowledged.  The Pope was
    told, however, that it would take about 24 hours to fix the
    problem and correct the error. 

    The next day, the Pope was called in and the devil said his
    good-bye as he went off to heaven. 

    On his way up, he met Clinton who was on his way down, and they
    stop to chat. 

    Pope: Sorry about the mix up. 

    President Clinton: No problem. 
          
    Pope: Well, I'm really excited about going to heaven. 

    President Clinton: Why's that?

    Pope: All my life I've wanted to meet the Virgin Mary. 

    President Clinton: You're a day late.

I don't think anyone who knows me would say I have lived a cloistered 
life.  "Checkered" is the word that comes to mind.  Though I've been pretty 
stable the last 20 years. :-)

My youth was similar.  But now the tables have turned, eh? Last
Tuesday I was coming home from a doctors appt., and saw a guy 
standing at a light with a sign "Homeless -- will work for food".  It 
was getting dark; I happened to have a $10 bill handy, so I rolled 
down my window and gave it to him -- just another bleeding heart 
liberal, I guess.  But I didn't give him a lecture.

I just tossed that out to think about.  The relationship between 
courtesy and censorship is pretty subtle.

Hmm -- I've been robbed at gunpoint 3 times, pistol-whipped once.  The
perpetrators were all minorities; none were ever caught.  Possessing a
gun at the time wouldn't have made a positive difference in any of the
cases, incidentally.  (I own several guns; I am quite familiar with
guns; I no longer really have a use for them, though.)

I don't clench my teeth over it.  But racism does get under my skin,
in a very personal way.

Hardly an exhaustive list of options.

It's because there are enough people on the list who see a distinction
between preservation of freedom, and hate and fear mongering.  Even
more, I think that many feel that the hate and fear mongering is
actually contrary to the goal of preserving freedom.

Right.  I never pay attention to anonymous entities.
