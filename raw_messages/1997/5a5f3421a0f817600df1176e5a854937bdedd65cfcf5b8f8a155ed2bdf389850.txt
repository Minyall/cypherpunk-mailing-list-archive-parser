As follow up to the Stewart Fist report on new findings
of cell-phone hazards, the Jerusalem Post says that
the report is causing alarm in Israel -- where cell-phones
are heavily used -- and that the government intends to 
investigate. Motorola et al are hunkered.

The scientific study is in the journal "Radiation Research,"
Volume 147, Number 5, May 1997:

   Michael H. Repacholi, Antony Basten, Val Gebski, Denise 
   Noonan, John Finnie and Alan W. Harris

   "Lymphomas in Emu-Pim1 Transgenic Mice Exposed to Pulsed 
   900 MHz Electromagnetic Fields" (p. 631)

However, there is not an on-line version, unless someone knows
of it elsewhere. What say the cellular folks here to this story?
