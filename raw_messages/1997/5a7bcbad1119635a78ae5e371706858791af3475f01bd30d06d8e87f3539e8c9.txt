John - You're absolutely right.  I haven't had a phone connection fail
after connect for a coon's age, but I remember the bad old days of living
in GTE-land.  (For example, the time I called my wife from work and she
asked me to call Kristine and have her call because no one in Los Gatos
could call out.)

A comm failure during authentication should be enough reason to go to the
next set of 16 words.

N.B. I was assuming that Alice would only commit one digit to Bob before
having Bob commit one digit to her.  It seems from our analysis that doing
it one digit at a time greatly improves the chances of catching Mallory
early.
