We're having a Time Online chat this evening at 8 pm
EST to discuss Net-censorship. I'll be joining
Chris Hansen from the ACLU and Bruce Taylor, a
longtime CDA supporter and head of the National Law
Center for Children and Families.

We'll be talking about the White House censorware
summit, self-rating of web sites, and free speech
online in general.

You can participate in the chat as long as your
browser supports frames, but the Ichat client software
is more stable:
