Alexis,

I'd be glad to help you in your quest to learn more about cryptomography. 
You can start by reading every article I've written on cryptomography; you
can find those in the http://www.hotwired.com/netizen/ and
http://netlynews.com/ and http://www.time.com/ archives. 

I no longer phrank, so I'm afraid I can't be of much help to you there.
