Privtool (my PGP-aware mail program for Unix) has supported Mixmaster
remailing for years (just click a box and off it goes) and would also
support nym.alias.net if it hadn't gone down just as I started building in
the capability (it currently supports decryption but not posting). Anyone
who wants to use my remailing code is free to rip it off under the GPL.

Currently there are at least two people developing Private Idaho and
possibly more. However, even command-line Mixmaster remailing is much
simpler than using the Type-I remailers.

I've been playing with Premail and found it pretty easy to use. As I said
above, reliability is the main problem; particularly when you lose the
entire domain now and again.
