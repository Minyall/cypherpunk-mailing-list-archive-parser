Charles Platt, the alcoholic yellow journalist, is a pathological liar.

Just look in sci.cryonics for the testimonies from dozens of people
(former business partners and clients) cheated from thousands of
dollars by Charles Platt's failed "frozen corpses" business.

Charles Platt almost got arrested recently when he showed up drunk
at a public meeting and began shouting obscenities at people.

Please take any additional comments to alt.2600.moderated.
