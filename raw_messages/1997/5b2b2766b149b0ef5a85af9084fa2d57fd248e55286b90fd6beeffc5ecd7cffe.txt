Their controversial GAK ready policy enforcer works as a a local SMTP
proxy.  You set up your normal SMTP server on another machine, and
configure the policy enforcer to forward mails to the normal SMTP
server.  Or presumably if you can configure your SMTP server to accept
connections on a port other than 25 you could have the SMTP enforcer
on the same machine.

The same thing could work for a hashcash filter, and it is one
feasible solution.

The functionality which is lost is the possibility for the sendmail to
be configured to do a reverse DNS lookup on the IP address which is
connecting to it, and check that that domain is the same as the domain
in the From field.  Also ident lookups don't work anymore either.
However I am not sure how reliable either of these mechanisms are, and
I'm not sure that many people are using them because they would be
unlikely to be reliable in the general case.

So probably this is not a problem.

A local SMTP proxy to add hashcash on the way out should work fine.

The difference is that it allows the ISP which is hit by spam attacks
to install a hashcash filter.

With simple resource metering at the spammers ISP side, the spammers
typically abuse other peoples open SMTP agents to forward their spams
for them.

Their ISPs can do little about this.

Really it's best if the sender is left to generate his own hashcash,
the motivation for working out ways to have the originators ISP's
outgoing SMTP hub generate hashcash for them is that it is simpler to
install in the short term.
