Lived all over So. Cal. for 12 years, 4 years in SE Tenn., close to
Atlanta.  Atlanta has some nice babes, warm weather.  I fell totally
in love with a girl from Chattanooga, who was probably the best college
radio D.J. who ever lived.  Lived in Charleston for a short while.
Much smaller than Atlanta.  Very cozy.  Spent a lot of time in
Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Detroit. The best babes there are usually the
Chrissy Hynde (Akron) types.  Spent 2-1/2 years in Southern Germany.
Very, very nice.  Loved Berchtesgaden (sp?).  Interestingly enough,
I have a fondness for English girls.  Must be the ancestry thing.
I'd really like to talk to some Welsh girls - my mum's grandparents
came to the U.S. from there.  What about you?
