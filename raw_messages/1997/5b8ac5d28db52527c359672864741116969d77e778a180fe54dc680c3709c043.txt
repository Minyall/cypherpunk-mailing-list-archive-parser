And the blank tape I stocked up on, and paid taxes on?

And of course enforceability with these kinds of laws is unarguably almost
nonexistent. As someone said, this is a "cherry on the sundae" sort of law,
designed to pile on extra charges.

I would guess that 80% or more of all households will be in technical
violation of this law within a matter of months of its offical start.
Anyone with a home computer will likely make more than the number of
allowed backups, or will commingle several titles on the same ZIP drive, or
will (horrors!) share the use of a program between husband, wife, and
children. Or even (send in the SWAT ninjas) share with the neighbors.

And it's unclear (to me, at least) what this does to home taping of t.v.
shows and movies, which seemed pretty well-solved by the Disney-Sony
"Betamax" case.

The law will be used against folks like Jim Bell to pile on charges.

Lock and load,
