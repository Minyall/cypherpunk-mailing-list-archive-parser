  I can't believe that there's no one taking advantage of this to make a
'shareware' version of their software available, and having available, 
for export and sale, an 'enabler' to bring it to full functionality.
  I know that this was done in the past, by several small companies in
southern California, but perhaps on a larger issue, such as this, the
Feds would slam the door quickly on what they would surely regard as
a 'loophole'.
