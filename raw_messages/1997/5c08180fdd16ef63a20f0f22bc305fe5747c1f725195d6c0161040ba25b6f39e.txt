Nothing. Timmy C[...] May has exposed himself once again as a statist scum no
different from the reputed Jap pedophile Hirochi "no crypto for the four
politically incorrect horsepersons" Ito, geodesic baron Hettiga and the
jackbooted Nazi KKKent KKKrispin[1]. National borders are an artifact of a
state and must be destroyed together with the state. What makes Timmy any more
"legal" in California than some poor slob who was born a few hundred miles
south? People should be free to live where they want to / can afford to.

[1] Sandia means watermelon in Spanish.
