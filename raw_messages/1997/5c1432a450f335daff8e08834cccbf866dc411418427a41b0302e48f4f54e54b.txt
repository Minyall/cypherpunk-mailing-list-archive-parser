I believe (according to their page) it's in the works to add support for

It might also be that the MS CryptoAPI may impose limitations on crypto
plug-ins that require annoying hacks to use conveniently. But maybe not...

I'm surprised the didn't mention Pegasus Mail, which is an amazing "hot"
mailer, with a sort-of built-in crypto plug-in capability... it's also free.
