How about also having Alex' Backup Server, and using some
shared-secret/whatever tech to ensure that you need to contents of _both_
servers to actually reconstruct the data. This would be a 'Distributed
Encrypted Backup Sysyem'.

This might make it very hard for anyone to access your data without your
knowledge/cooperation.

And if you use something like Onion Routers, it might even be quite
impossible for some lawenforcement agency to actually find out which one
of those encrypted files on the servers contains your backup.
