Apparently, Dale does not understand the how the list is 
moderated.  When someone posts to Cypherpunks, it automatically
goes to the unedited list.  I am subscribed to the unedited list.
When I read the unedited list, I forward each message I see there
to either the flames list or the moderated list.  I have no 
control over the unedited list.  It goes out to everyone else at
the same time it goes out to me.  I don't have a clue as to what
Dale is talking about.
