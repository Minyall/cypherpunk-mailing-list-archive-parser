This is way off. We used ~457,000 MIPS years to search half of the 
DES keyspace. Factoring a 512 bit modulus using the General Number
Field Sieve (GNFS) would take about 28,000 MIPS years (see Schneier
for the exact number - I don't have AC2 at hand)

Lenstra has estimated that with 500,000 MIPS years, you should be
able to factor a 600 bit modulus using GNFS, if your workstations 
had enough memory.

Go back and check the numbers - if you don't the journalists will. 
(I don't have this paper to hand either :-( ) The Wiener paper is 
much more recent (93?) , and the cost much lower (I think it was 
about $1M for HW and $500K for development costs, for a 3.5 hour 
machine).
