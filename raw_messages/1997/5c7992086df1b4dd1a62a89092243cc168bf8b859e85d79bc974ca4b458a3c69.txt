I also thank Vladimir for posting the article.  I was going to post a
summary, but I found myself buried under a kilomessage or so of back email
after my trip to Switzerland.

I think this article is principally interesting because Senator Gephardt is
the Democratic leader in the House.  It seems to indicate considerable
disarray in the administration on what our crypto policy should be.

As the ever optimist, this article, along with Dorothy Denning's new stand,
and the Burnstein decision indicates that the forces of crypto repression
are in retreat.  GO TEAM!
