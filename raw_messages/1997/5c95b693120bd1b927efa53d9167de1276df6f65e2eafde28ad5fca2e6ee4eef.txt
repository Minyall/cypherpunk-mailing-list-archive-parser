Yes, I'd be interested in seeing a copy.  Better yet, I'd be nice is a copy was posted on Eternity.

Ditto to above.

I talked with Bret Tobay, Tritheim Technology, (813) 943-8684, a Mondex certified developer at COMDEX.  They have a complete line of SC readers (SmartPort DT and LT) and software.  Development kit $495.

BTW, also had a very interesting discussion with the Chipper folks at COMDEX.
