If I get spammed, one of my responses is to use a software agent to fill
out whatever response forms they have with nonsense that gets past their
filters.  Lynx has some very nice features for this.  Some sites charge by
the hit, so continually hitting a web page (so the counter is incremented) 
can also send the message.
