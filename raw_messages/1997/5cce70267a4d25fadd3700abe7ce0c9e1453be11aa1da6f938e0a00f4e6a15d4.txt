Oups... of course I made a typo, and everybody read "in 1812
yadayadayada".
And yes it counts and I like it (just because the initial reason for
this mess was the tentative to take over Canada, and it just illustrates
that the US were already as any other country, trying to take over their
neighbours ;-) Of course nowadays you don't see that they miserabily
failed on that occasion)
