This is known as "structuring," as with structuring of funds transfers with
the apparent intent of avoiding certain laws.

(Not really, but I would not be surprised if the courts give some latitude
to prosecutions along these lines, or if specific language is eventually
added to make such circumventions a felony.)

All in all, as the various posts about Bernstein, Karn, OCR, the MIT Press
version of PGP, etc. have shown, attempting to block cryptographic code
from leaving the U.S. is a lost cause, for many reasons.

On a related topic, my hunch is that it is much more likely for a
prosecution to involve a major software company skirting the ITAR/EAR rules
by subcontracting with offshore companies (e.g., RSADSI using the NEC
chips, or Cylink using Israeli programmers) than it is that some lowly Net
person will be proscuted for dribbling out a few hundred lines of some
crypto program.
