When I'm quiet, it's probably because I'm busy.  It's certainly not
because I was spirited off to Fort Meade by the black helicopters for
brain washing.

Let's look at this another way.  Given the opportunity to discuss your
views with a senator, whouldn't you take it?  Even if there's very
little chance of changing his mind?

We aren't going to suddenly do an about face and start saying that GAK
is good.  Even if anyone here believed that, there's no way that we'd be
able to sell it to our overseas customers.
