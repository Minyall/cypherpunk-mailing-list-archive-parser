Dale,
 I love your attitude, and I enjoy many of your posts.  I also love
being
able to laugh at you for getting sucked into the oldest trick in the
book.
 In the ruins of Rome, you will find a Chariot Dealership which sold
both
Pontiac and Chevy Chariots. Once they had you on their sales lot, they 
would attempt to get you sucked into a mindset where your choices were
limited to choosing between 'their' chariots.
  Our political sytem is a grand 'play' in which the Democrats and the
Republicans 'contend' to see who gets to slip us the cold, hard one.
The bottom line, is that what is dripping out of your butt is either
a Democrat's sperm and a Republican's saliva, or vice-versa.

  Have I misjudged you?
  Could it possibly be that you can still hear the small whisper in the 
wind that warns you that it's all done with mirrors?
  "Believe nothing of what you hear, only half of what you see, and if
you
meet the Buddha on the road, kill him!"
