Cypherpunks Tonga announces yet another version of SIO/STEST, the
universal smartcard software.

Quick summary of changes:
 - Philips, Gemplus, and Schlumberger reader support added
 - Chipknip (IEP) specific commands added
 - new internal commands
 - infrastructure for implementing card specific commands has been added
   (which the chipknip commands are built on top of)

At this point, we need others to start writing tables to support
additional cards. If you have an ISO7816 compatible smartcard with
programmer reference manual and minimal C knowledge, you can contribute to
the project.
