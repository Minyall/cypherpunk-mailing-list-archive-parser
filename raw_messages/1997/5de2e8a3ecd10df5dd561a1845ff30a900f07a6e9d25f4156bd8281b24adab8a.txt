Not in the evening/night, which is when I tend to use my box at home.

Assuming you can get 56k over your POTS line. Less than 20% of US
households can even link up at 28.8k. ISDN is a clean solution that will
work over just about any old wire. And now it has become rather
inexpensive. I see little reason to stick with analog. YMMV.
