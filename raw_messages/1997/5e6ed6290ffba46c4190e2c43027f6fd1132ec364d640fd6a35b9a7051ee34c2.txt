>From Post Office Credit Union' _Credit Union Post_, Spring 1997:

Congress recently passed a law making it mandatory to receive government
payments by direct deposit to a financial institution. It's called
"Electronic Funds Transfer Expansion Act," and it requires all federal
payments, except an IRS refund check to be issued by electronic funds
transfer (Direct Deposit).

It will affect anyone who receives veteran's benefits, Social Security,
federal government and military pensions and salaries, or any government
payment. Members who have their payments sent to Post Office Credit Union
will have _immediate access_ to their money.

So what are you waiting for? If you don't already have direct deposit,
consider signing up for it. It's not only easy, convenient, and safe, it
will soon be mandatory for all!

Give us a call at 244-3518 to take advantage of direct deposit today!
