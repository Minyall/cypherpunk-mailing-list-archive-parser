Step back a sec, folks, Tim's article _was_ satire... (at least for now.)

On the other hand, a number of Senators have emailed me about the CDA and
instructions for making bombs and blowing up government buildings
(Amazing what you can get an auto-responder to do! :-)  Some of them
truncated their replies to 80 characters, and the House's email responder
was far more boring.  

Remember - November 5th, barrels of gunpowder in the basement,
and don't get caught this time!
