For security, you need encryption.  There's really no question about it,
and a non-encrypted remailer chain is a joke.

For convenience, you'd rather not need user-visible encryption,
but SSL lets you do an encrypted web interface without the user
needing to do any work.  The catch is that it becomes much harder
to do chained encryption - if the cgi remailer program does it,
the connections from the web remailer through the chain are secure,
but the user still needs to trust the web-remailer.

You may not _want_ too much convenience, to discourage spammers,
but you may be willing to tolerate a joke level of security
as long as the joke is good enough and enjoyed by enough people....

On the balance, I'd say encrypt.
