I have read quite a few of your messages related to this, Tim, and I find 
it quite interesting that the quintessential Crypto Anarchist has such a 
conservative attitude.

Long drawn out court cases are not "paid for by taxpayers".  They are 
paid for by the government, which happens to have stolen the funds from 
its victims (taxpayers).

Why does the fact that they (the government) have initiated force against 
you (or stolen from / taxed you) somehow imply that they now have an 
obligation to further their crimes by initiating force against others?
