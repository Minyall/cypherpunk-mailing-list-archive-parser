Well, I never talked to Gilmore, but I will tell you this:
I have never seen him come outright and say "I am straight and not
gay."  So until he says that, he is a default faggot.

The default faggots are the worst kind.  If a guy would just say
"o.k., I am gay," I can respect him and drop the subject.  It is the
ones who refuse to admit they are gay that bug me the most.
