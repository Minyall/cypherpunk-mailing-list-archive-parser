Maybe this was misleading, that was indeed a purpose of the list but 
it was also supposed to be a free and anarchic list where people were 
not prevented from posting whatever they want.

Even if it were the case that we accepted content based censorship 
that is no defence of the obvious class system that is in place 
whereby certain posters are automatically sent straight to the 
moderated list and others are censored regardless of the content of 
their posts.
