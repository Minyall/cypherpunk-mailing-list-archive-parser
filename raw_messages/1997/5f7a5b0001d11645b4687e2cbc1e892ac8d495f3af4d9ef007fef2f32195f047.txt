Sure.  We get the same right to bear it as we have to own rocket
launchers, machine guns, or flame throwers--none.  The second 
amendment hasn't protected our right to possess those things, 
which pretty clearly fall into the realm of its direct intentions--why
would it protect our right to use crypto, which isn't even that clear
cut?
