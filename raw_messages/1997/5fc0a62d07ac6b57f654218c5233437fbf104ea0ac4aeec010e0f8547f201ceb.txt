That doesn't mean "Nobody's allowed to use this for identification."
It means "The Social Security Administration doesn't claim that
this card is useful for identification so don't blame them if
the person using it isn't who the card says they are."

The only people you can press charges on are government employees
asking you for SSN information in ways that violate the 
Privacy Act of 197x, which has been amended several times to 
water it down, and while the employees can theoretically be
fined for violating it, your chances of collecting are near zero.
