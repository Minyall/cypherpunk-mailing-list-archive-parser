Well, it was an interesting experience. ...

Professor Joyce Malcolm of Bentley College in Massachusetts
was the chair of the panel on which I sat.  She showed me
something quite disturbing from another presentation that
she had attended.  The paper attempted to determine if the
Montana Militia could be considered a "hate group" or
not.  Among the methods by which they determined this was
examination of the phrases and concerned in Montana Militia
literature.  Among the phrases or subjects that would
classify a group as a "hate group" were:

1. Discussion of the Bill of Rights, especially the
Second Amendment.

2. Discussion of military oppression, in the U.S. or
elsewhere.

3. Discussion of the Framers of our government.

She showed me a copy of the criteria used by the criminologists
in question, and these were among the criteria.  I guess
the ACLU and Amnesty Internationl are hate groups also.
Very disturbing.
