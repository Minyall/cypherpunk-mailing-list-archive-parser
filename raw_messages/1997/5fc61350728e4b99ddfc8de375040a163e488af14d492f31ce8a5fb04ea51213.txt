       In some ways, Singaporeans are more free than U.S. citizens.
   Income taxes and sales taxes are lower. Prostitution is legal. The
   government does not impose rules on whom private landlords can and
   can't rent to. Unlike some cities in the states, Singapore has no
   curfews. Being able to walk outside safely at night in any area of the
   city, even the poor excuse for the city's red light district, has its
   attractions.
