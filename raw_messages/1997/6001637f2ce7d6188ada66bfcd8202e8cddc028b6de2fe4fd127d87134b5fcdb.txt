I do not believe this to be true.  Of course, concepts are valid
regardless of their source.  It would be unwise to take the statements
even of established identities on faith.

The advantage of persistent identity is that it allows the exploration
of more complicated ideas.  Use of the persistent identity places a
particular post in a greater context.

There is only so much that can be done in a single post.  It is the
mailing list equivalent of a sound bite.
