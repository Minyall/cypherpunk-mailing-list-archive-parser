This is really going too far!!!  I was told, when I first got 
on-line, that this was a "polite" way to get your product or service 
out there, without spamming.  By posting on-topic replies to usenet 
and high traffic mailing lists, like this one...  Shit, I hate this 
"one bad kid gets the rest of the class in trouble" mentality.  I am 
really pissed at this whole issue and the goverment trying to get 
it's grubby paws on the net any way they can!

I am also irked at the public's desire for this government 
intervention.
