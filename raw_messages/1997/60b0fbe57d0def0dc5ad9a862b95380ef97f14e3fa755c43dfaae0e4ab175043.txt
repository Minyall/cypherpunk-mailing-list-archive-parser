The only "software" I have newer than 1989 is Win95 and Netscape.
I only run these on one computer, to make net and email access easier.
My other computers run straight MS-DOS.  I had UNIX in 1986 on a
portable HP computer, but HP dropped support for it (what else is new).

If I had the time to do it, and I could get a concise written spec of
how to interface with whatever I need to, I'd write my own O/S and
datacomm software. So I make compromises where necessary for expediency.

PGP to me is not necessary (I can encrypt without it), but I do recognize
its proliteriat values.
