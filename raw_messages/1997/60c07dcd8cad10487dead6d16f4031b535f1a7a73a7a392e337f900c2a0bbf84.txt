Nice ASCII art, Pedro.

Are you the one contributing the 2 ASCII pictures of Timmy Mayonaise / day?

Here's a Simpsons picture for you:

Stop jerking off and look at your own picture. Try to concentrate when you read
the next paragraph.  I know it's hard for a "cypher punk" to think abstractly,
but if you try real hard, and think about it for a long time, you might get it.

THE MOVIE INDUSTRY, THE ADVERTIZING INDUSTRY, THE NEWSPAPER PUBLISHING
INDUSTRY, THE MUSIC INDUSTRY, THE MAGAZINE PUBLISHING INDUSTRY, THE BROADCAST
RADIO INDUSTRY, THE CABLE TV INDUSTRY, ETC, ARE ALL PARTS OF THE (ALWAYS HIGHLY
CONCENTRATED) MEDIA INDUSTRY. IF THE RICH MOTHERFUCKERS WHO OWN THE BIG MEDIA
COMPANIES HAPPEN TO BE PRO-MCGOVERN AND ANTI-WAR, THEN THE WHOLE MEDIA INDUSTRY
BECOMES PRO-MCGOVERN AND ANTI-WAR, AND THE PARTS OF THE WHOLE (LIKE THE MOVIE
INDUSTRY IN YOUR PICTURE ABOVE) TOO BECOME PRO-MCGOVERN AND ANTI-WAR.

Hmm...  Is it too much to expect a "cypher punk" to understand that a part of
the whole sometimes inherits some of the properties of the whole?  Probably.

Dr. Grubor invented the whole Internet while in Viet Nam.
You better show some gratitude, punk.
