This is the crux of the matter (and for Seamer the relevance to FC). It is
*NOT* the job of the STATE to play social engineer. There is no
Constitutional mandate for it and in numerous clauses and Amendments it is
strictly prohibited from doing so.

It is this concept that the STATE can disregard the Constitution whenever
it feels like it is the reason why we have ITAR/EAR, CDA,
Volentary/Mandatory Ratting systems, ECC, FCC ...etc.

When you support the blatant violation of the Constitution by the
government because their actions fit your political/social agenda you
loose all credibility when you go to oppose them on a separate violation.
This is why the so-called civil rights groups have very low credibility
with many.

Either we have a government which must obey the laws of the land (with the
Constitution being the supreme law) or we have the current system where
the law is disregarded whenever it is politically expedient.
