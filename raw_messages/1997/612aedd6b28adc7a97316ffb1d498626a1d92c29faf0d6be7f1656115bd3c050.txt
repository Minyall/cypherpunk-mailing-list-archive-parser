  Actually in Florida its illegal to even have a scanner in your car!
These folks have broken several state and federal laws, as well as the
congressman who leaked it to the newspapers instead of turning it over to
the head of the Ethics committe as he should have. Everyone involved here
is, or should be, in deep yogurt.

  I don't like the laws they passed, but since they passed them I want to
see them enforce them to the full extent posible. Then maybe people will
start to wonder why the transmission wasn't encrypted. Which also leads to
another question. How much information is in the clear from congressmen
and government employees who are clueless about the security of their
cellphones, cordless phones, etc?
