A splinter group of cypherpunks will be taking a boat from Anguilla to the
volcanic island of Montserrat for a religious experience.  The prophecy is
that at 2:33 during the afternoon of Feb 26th, 1998 the island will be
consumed by total darkness. 

T-shirts expected.  Watch http://fc98.ai/ for details.
