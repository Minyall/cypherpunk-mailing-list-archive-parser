    after I mailed the rant, I thought maybe the paragraph below
    was incomplete:

#   of course, I may be presumptuous PGP would even want to hear
#   from us, let alone have any form of "Cypherpunks Inside" 
#   (yuk) label on the box! particularly with the round robin 
#   multi-teaming of the sleepless Jon Callas.
#
    should have said
    
        ..."Cypherpunks Inside" label on the box: of course, 
        they might it consider it preferable to being labeled:

                "Big Brother Inside"
#
#
        this has been an addendum to an attila rant...

        attila, out, again, one more time....

  it aint over 'til the fat lady sings and vahalla is burning!
