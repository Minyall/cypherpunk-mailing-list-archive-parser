I personally see hashcash as the ideal way to solve this problem, and in 
Adam Back`s analysis of the hashcash solution he mentions mailing lists 
and suggest that filtering software have an explicit "filter in" command, 
so you could eliminate any mail coming from the list from needing to have 
cash attached. Of course the spammers could then just spam mailing lists, 
but that it a much smaller problem than the current random UCE problem.
