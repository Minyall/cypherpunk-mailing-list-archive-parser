 It seems to me that it should not necessarily compromise all keys,
though it does in effect provide for a goodly number of 'known
plaintext' objects. Could some of our hardcore crypto experts comment
on IDEA's susceptability to known plaintext which then provides
'plaintext' to the DH/DSS or RSA keys and what is their susceptability
to 'known plaintext'

 It occured to me while proofreading the above that in effect a
digitally signed cleartext document provides 'known plaintext' every
time its used, since the SHA-1/MD-5 can be computed the hash is a
'known plaintext' on the  DH/DSS and RSA keys ... is this one of the
reasons for the two key types in PGP5 ???
