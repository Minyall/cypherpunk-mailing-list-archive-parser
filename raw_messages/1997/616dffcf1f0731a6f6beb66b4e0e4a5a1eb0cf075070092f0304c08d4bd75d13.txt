Hello Team Members,

  The following is a new company offering Internet services on 
the Web.It's free to sign up for the pre-launch. You are not 
obligated to become a member it is simply designed to allow 
you to make a descision on the package when the complete details 
are released in March. I think it's a nice way to find people 
interested in this MLM Internet service concept. When someone 
signs up under you you receive an e-mail telling you they signed 
up for more info in March.

 Check out the Web site when you have time.
