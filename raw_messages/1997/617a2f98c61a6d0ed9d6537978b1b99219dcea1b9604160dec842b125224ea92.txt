With STUMP robomoderator, the great majority of posts are autoapproved,
because they come from preapproved posters. In the newsgroups moderated
by STUMP, moderators review only a small fraction of incoming messages.

It gives two benefits: 

	1) Saves lots of potentially billable time for moderators
	2) Increases speed with which posted articles reach the public.
