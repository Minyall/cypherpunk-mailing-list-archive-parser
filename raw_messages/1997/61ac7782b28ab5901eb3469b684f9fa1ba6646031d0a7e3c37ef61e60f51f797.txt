Man whose home was raided by IRS agents is charged

A man whose Vancouver home was raided by IRS agents in April has been
charged with two felonies in Tacoma.

James D. Bell was charged Wednesday with interfearing with a federal
officer and using false Social Security numbers.  He has been held without
bail in the Pierce County Jail since his May 18 arrest.

Bell, 38, is scheduled to be arrained July 18 before U.S. Magistrate J.
Kelly Arnold.

However, sources close to the case said Thursday that plea negotiations
are under way and are likely to be concluded before then.

Bell's home was raided and searched April 1 by an IRS task force of 20
agents.

In an affidavit for the search warrant, IRS Special Investigator Jeff
Gordon said that Bell was "directly soliciting others to set up a system
to murder government officials" and that he had devised a plan to
overthrow the government.

At a detention hearing in Tacoma, Arnold ordered Bell held without bail on
both allegations.
