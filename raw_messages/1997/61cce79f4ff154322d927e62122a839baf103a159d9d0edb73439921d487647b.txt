Bill, Bill, Bill....

That was not "time served," that was "psychological counselling." Bell was
under the benficent care of mental health workers, seeking to allay his
fears of the government.

The six months he spent in psychological counelling were not prison time,
just as the Soviet hospitals for dissidents were not actually prisons.

With enough further care, Citizen-Unit Bell will _love_ Big Brother.
