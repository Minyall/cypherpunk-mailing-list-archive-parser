Sigh. She is my Senator. [Don't blame me. I voted against her. But she hits
the feelings of the Bay Area head on. "Big brother will bring you

after Moscone and Milk were shot and she thought herself in danger. Once
she felt safe again, she went on TV and said that if she could get the
votes in the Senate for total confiscation she would push for it. What's
good for the goose...]
