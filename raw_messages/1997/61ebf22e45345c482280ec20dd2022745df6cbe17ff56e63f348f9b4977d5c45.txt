    over-frequent compulsory changes

    forcing a change at no notice
    (password expired - think of a new one RIGHT NOW)

    forcing a new password on Fridays
    (Monday morning: I know my _old_ password!)

I have practically no trouble remembering numerous passphrases upwards
of 20 mixed chars if I use them semi-regularly and they don't change often.

Anyway, when I have forgotten a long passphrase it has only been
temporarily - a few days.   If your employee is reasonably confident
of decrypting his work within the week you're no worse off than if
he'd fluffed his cooking ("stand in boiling water" or something).
