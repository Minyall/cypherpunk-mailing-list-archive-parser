The crucial part here is "you may not engage in any  activities
prohibited by Sec. 744.6 (a) or (b) of the EAR"

I you read 744.6 EAR you will find the the provisions cited below only
apply to nukes and missiles, not crypto. Why the quote you are citing even
made it into 736 EAR is beyond me. I asked Commerce and they couldn't give
me an answer either. 

I would assume it was either for FUD or perhaps more likely wishful 
thinking leading to a screw up. Regardless, the financing, etc. 
provisions *do not apply to crypto*.
