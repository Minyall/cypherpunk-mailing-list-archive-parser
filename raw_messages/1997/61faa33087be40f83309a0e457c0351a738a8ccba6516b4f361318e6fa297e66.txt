Just for the record, here, I should note that e$ is completely unmoderated,
though I've been sorely tempted (he said, dislocating his arm to pat
himself on the back...).

e$pam, on the other hand,  as a filter of other lists (whenever it's
running, that is... :-/), is a non-interactive, one-way channel from me to
the rest of the universe. :-). It don't say e$pam until I say it says
e$pam, in other words.  I'm just providing an opinion; letting people read
over my sholder, and all that.

So, I don't feel like I'm "censoring" anyone, in that regard.

Cheers,
Bob
