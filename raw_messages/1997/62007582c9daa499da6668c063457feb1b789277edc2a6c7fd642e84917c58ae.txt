Actually the coin is intercepted and spent by Mallet.  Alice gets pissed
at Bob because she feels cheated by him.  She implements a blinding
protocol on him with an ice pick, as described by Dr. Thomas Dolby.

My understanding of the protocol is that the identity of the purchacer is
revealed only if the coin is double spent.  What prevents the person
wanting to find out the identity of Bob from just spending the cash more
than once?
