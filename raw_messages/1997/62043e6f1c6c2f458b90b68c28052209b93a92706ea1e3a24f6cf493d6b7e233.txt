You've done an inadequate job of implementing your protocol,
endangering your customers far more than your targets.
[And your customers are _cheapskates_ as well :-) ]

A proper bot would accept contributions from
Public Key 0x23DEADBEEF9999999
Public Key 0x45BEEFDEAD9854355
and similar one-use identities.
