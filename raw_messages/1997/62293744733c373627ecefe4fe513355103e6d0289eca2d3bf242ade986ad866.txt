The insurer can't determine whether you've taken the test.  The
insurer may insist on the test anyway or offer you unfavourable odds,
basically assuming you have privately tested and found positive
otherwise you wouldn't be refusing to have the test.  (A variation of
the `he must have something to hide' theme).  Unless you can afford
the premium for withholding this test, you're stuck.

The insurance company would have no financial incentive to take on
such risks -- I reckon they'd sooner let the wanna-be customer die.
Nasty, but it's reality.

I reckon your only option would be charity.  If these $1,000,000
treatment 1:1,000,000 odds genetically testable diseases are rare
(1:1mil is rare), perhaps a charity would be able to cover the costs.

The increased choice in insurance would ensure cheaper medical care
for all.  A deregulated medical profession with third party rating
services rather than top down government services should reduce prices
dramatically also.  Same for medical drugs, third party ratings.  Buy
your ratings service.

And being a hard line anarcho capitalist, I draw the conclusion that
if you can't afford to keep yourself alive, that is your problem.
(Heartless ain't it:-) Aside from comments about evolution in action
(perhaps I personally don't want to fund propogating these genetic
defects, and that is my choice), my suggestion is that such cases
would have to be met by charity.

A charity could also refuse to help people who hadn't donated, if
it chose.

I bet it would work too, and a lot more efficiently than the
government regulated setup now.

Heck I might even donate to it, with the savings I'd make from
the breakup of the medical cartel.

(UK is as socialist as it comes with medicine, and your taxes reflect
this.)
