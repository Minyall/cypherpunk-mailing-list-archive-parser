The URL was missing a ':' after the http, otherwise worked fine for me.

I suspect there are slight differences, but will need to confirm, between
Advance's mint protocol and MT.  If I understand correctly, they use a
somewhat different customer authentication procedure (PIN).  Even so, it
should have all the same anonymity features (or lack thereof) of MT ecash.

It isn't clear to me, from their lengthy regulation list, whether a
non-Australian can open an account.

Several items of interest.
1. No Mac support.  This is an opportunity for a non-Digicash purse.

2. Fee schedule.  Advance plans to charge a 0.5% discount to funds entering
the mint, like traveller's checks.  Either banking competition must be
different in Australia or they know something I don't.  This would probably
not fly in the US under current competitive conditions.
