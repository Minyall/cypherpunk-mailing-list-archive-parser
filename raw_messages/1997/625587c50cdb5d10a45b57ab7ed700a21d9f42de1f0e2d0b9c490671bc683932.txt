  For you old farts who have not been out in the real world for a
while, you should make note of the fact that the price of memory
has dropped, and it is now feasible to implement RAM disks to
store temporary files.
  You can also direct a program to use a RAM trash-disk for its
temporary files, wiping it immediately after use without having
to worry about fucking up your other temporary files.
