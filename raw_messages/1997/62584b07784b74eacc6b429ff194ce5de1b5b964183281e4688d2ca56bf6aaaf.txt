What products could be used for dial in authentication? I am interested
in something like a piece of hardware that shows one time passwords and
allows users of Win95/NT4 to dial in to an NT/Unix network and use
NetBIOS/TCP file servers.

Can anybody recommend something is this area? Is it possible to export
strong authentication products from the US, or is it necessary to
purchase the hardware from abroad to allow international users to dial
in?
