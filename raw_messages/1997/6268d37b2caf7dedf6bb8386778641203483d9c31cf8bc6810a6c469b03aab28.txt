Yes, I think there might be problems for the feds in this case.  Your 
analogy is not at all accurate, since the remailers have no knowledge 
of what their individual shares contain, and didn't supply any of the 
input data to begin with.  Here's a different analogy:

Alice and Bob and Carol and Dave run mailbox outlets.  Elmer and Fred
jointly rent several mailboxes.  Elmer mails a single piece of a gun
to each mailbox in a sealed package -- ABCD can have no way of
knowing what is in each package.  Fred goes to each mailbox and gets
the package inside, takes them all home, and assemble a weapon used 
to commit a crime.  It is hard to see how ABCD could be included in 
any conspiracy, because they were providing a general, legal service, 
and they had absolutely no knowledge of the conspiracy.
