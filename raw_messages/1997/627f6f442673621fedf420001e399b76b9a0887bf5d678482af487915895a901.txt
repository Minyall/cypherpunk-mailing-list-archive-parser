Give me a break. The "he must be drunk" argument is the cheapest shot, no
pun intended, in the book.

(And, please, knock of the use of "Timothy" is a post where one disagrees.
If "Tim" is fine for most responses, why the sudden formal "Timothy"?
Another rhetorical device.)

Never ascribe to alcohol what can be explained by righteous anger.

I _said_ that innocents died. But there never should've been a day care
center in a soft target.

Innocents died in Dresden. No doubt compelling stories and images could be
dug up of little Frieda slowly suffocating as the firestorms sucked the air
out of her underground shelter, or of little Hans screaming for his mother
as his hair bursts into flames. 300,000 died in that fire bomb raid, freely
admitted to be a  "public demonstration" of allied willingness to destroy
civilians in what was primarily a "cultural" city, not a significant center
of military production.

McVeigh probably did not help the cause of liberty, in the long run. But I
can better understand why he acted. He saw that Federal building as a
military target. Innocents died. Such is the nature of war.
