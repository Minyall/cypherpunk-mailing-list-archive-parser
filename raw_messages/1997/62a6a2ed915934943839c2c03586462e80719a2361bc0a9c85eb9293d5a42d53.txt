Soon after the Nazis formed the German government in 1933, a fire was set in
the Reichstag (parliament) building in Berlin. The Nazis accused Communists
of this senseless act, put some prominent Communists on trial, and used this
as a pretext to ban many non-Nazi political organizations. Has it ever been
conclusively proven that the Nazis themselves had set the fire in Reichstag?
