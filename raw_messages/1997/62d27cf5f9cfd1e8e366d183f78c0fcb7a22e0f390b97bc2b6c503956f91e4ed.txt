  I kiss it goodbye and forget about it.
  The police are too busy pursing imaginary crime to bother with
real crime.

  I caught a kid breaking into my camper by the Rose Garden in 
Berkeley. I handcuffed him to the bumper and gave him the option
of my calling his mother or the police. When the Berkeley police
cruised by I explained the situation and they had no problem with
it, but I got a pile of shit from various Berkeley bleeding-hearts
while we waited for his mother.
  I would have turned the kid loose before turning him over to the
police, since I regarded him as a lesser criminal than many of
them. I've lost a few thousand dollars worth of goods to thieves,
but criminal cops have cost me tens of thousands of dollars in
the legal system.
