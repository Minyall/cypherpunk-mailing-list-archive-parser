This is a bad thing? In the Land of the Freeh "children" are defined as
"anybody under 18 years of age." A 16 year old is a "child" according to the
government but obviously isn't such. 

The "before 18 they're too immature" argument doesn't fly too well. At 18
they don't suddenly become "mature." If they aren't "mature" by about 14,
think of it as evolution in action.

As for homosexuality and/or uniqueness, this is supposed to be protected. Of
course it won't be if Klintonkov gets his way.
