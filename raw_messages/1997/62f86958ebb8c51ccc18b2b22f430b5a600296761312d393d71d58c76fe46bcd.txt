 This is no more of a surprise than the results of studies which show
that inbreeding among those in cloistered geographical areas severely
limits the genetic diversity of the enclosed population.

  "Family-friendly" inevitably boils down to being a dishonestly used
simile for "ignorant christian-values."
  Despite the fact that 'family-unfriendly Jesus' spoke of his aim of
setting family members against one another, the followers of his 
mainstream religious cult are determined to institute their own
religious values in the legal system, by working toward forcing their
own religously-oriented filtering system on all citizens.

  Tell me, please, who among the organizations claiming to work for
freedom of speech are ready to demand that the words of Jesus be
subject to the same filtering as those of Aleister Crowley?
  Who is going to demand that the works such as the Bible be subject
to the same filtering values as the works of Lenny Bruce?

  The filters are not "faulty." They do exactly what they are meant
to do--imprison the minds and life-experience of those who are forced
to use them.
  Those promoting volumandatory content ratings want to imprison 
everyone, not just their own children. I't the same old lying
religious fascists up to their same old oppression of those
who breed outside their own genetic family.
  Fuck 'em.
