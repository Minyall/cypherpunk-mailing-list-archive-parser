When an incident like this happens with remailers, people will say:

"You morons, look at the headers, obviously it was bogus"

Some time ago somebody used remailers to spread what purported to
be an embarrassing political memo far and wide.

The newsmedia that picked it up were promptly and rightly ridiculed,
most of the media interpreting the disclaimer that the mail was not
from the entity that it appeared to be from as effectively an admission
"spoof:  Do not take the following seriously"


Suppose you got what purported to be a bill for dirty pictures
from a business, but the headers said "huge cajones remailer".

You would have to be a right loon to take it seriously.
