This whole "non-violent demonstrators" stuff is the conceptual flaw.

If I return to my home or place of business and find that "demonstrators"
have placed a 700-pound tree trunk in the center of my living room or
office and have chained themselves to it, or surrounded it with a human
chain, as a form of "protest," my response will be simple:

"I'm going to go get my assault pistol and a couple of other guns. If
you're gone by the time I get back, we'll settle in civil court for the
damage you just did to my front door, my carpet, and my peace of mind. If
you're not gone, I'll consider you intruders in my home or business, and
probable threats. Take your choice."

Sounds fair to me.

"Non-violent demonstrators" are still trespassers, and possible security
threats.

This is what guns are for.
