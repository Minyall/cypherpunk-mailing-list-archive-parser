    attila sez:

    Dresden was probably the first highly visible of America's
    willingness to literally destroy civilian populations with the
    express intent of demoralizing a nation.  however, history seems
    to indicate in was a Churchillian "revenge" for the Blitz carried
    out by both British and American bombers --however, the latter
    were capable of greated payloads at greater range.  apparently
    the American bombers carried primarily heavy ordinance, the 
    British lit it up --however, the functions were probably mixed.

    Hiroshima may have been later, but Dresden set the stage. Hiroshime 
    undoubtedly saved hundreds of thousands of both US troops and 
    Japanese civilians from further war --the Emporer stepped in and 
    made the broadcast without the approval of the general staff 
    --basically, "enough is enough."  Dresden served virtually no 
    purpose on the German front --the war was over. Churchill and 
    Roosevelt approved Dresden for revenge; Truman just ended a war.

    Obliterating Iraq and continuing to grind the heel is just another 
    round of power politics and US Middle East foreign policy.  To the
    rest of the world, the US is a militaristic bully bent on economic
    advantage -- the old British lion reincarnated.

    government is its own end:  power corrupts, and absolute power 
    corrupts absolutely.  hasn't changed yet in history.  even the 
    greats, Solomon, David, etc. fell prey to the siren song of power;
    why should far more inferior men like Bubba, who has absolutely 
    nothing to his credit except deceit, be exempt?
