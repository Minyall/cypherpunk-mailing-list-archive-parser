Jonah, mon ami, I had almost forgotten the details of this little episode
in 1995 where CDT praises the "harmful to minors" version of the CDA.
Thanks for reminding me to refresh my memory. This excerpt is from a
document called "CDT-led Coalition letter to Telecomm Conferees, 11/9/95"
that lives at your web site.
