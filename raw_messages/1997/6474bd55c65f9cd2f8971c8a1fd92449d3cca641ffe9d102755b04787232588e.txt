Where can I find a copy of PGP 5.0 which handles this "SHA1" hash extension,
and the new forced incompatabilities? I'm looking for a Linux distribution.
All I've found are Windoze versions, really old betas which break
*everything* which calls PGP from a script or command line, and betas which
have a lame expired timebomb in them. Source is prefered for obvious reasons.

Any ideas? (Yes, I'm in the U.S.)
