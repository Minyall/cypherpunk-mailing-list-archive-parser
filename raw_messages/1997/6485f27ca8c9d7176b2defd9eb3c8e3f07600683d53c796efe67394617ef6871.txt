Bill Payne has provided his 1992 Sandia report:

   "Data Authenticator for the Deployable Seismic 
   Verification System"

Marked "For Official Use Only."

The 185-page paper describes in fine detail the
design, data security and fabrication (with photos and 
technical drawings) of the third generation authentification
device for verfiying seismic data in connection with the 
nuclear weapons control-START treaties with the USSR.

The paper also cites deficient cryptographic algorithms 
provided by NSA for the device.
