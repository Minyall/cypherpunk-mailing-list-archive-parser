They could try.  The Communist government of Mongolia couldn't come up
with any information worth classifying, so they made the locations of
the dinosaur bones (plentiful there) secret and even executed some locals
for "spying" (revealing to white devils where to dig for dinosaur bones).

Why is this any more silly than "classifying" the A-bomb recipes or
forbidding a college professor to explain crypto in his classroom?
