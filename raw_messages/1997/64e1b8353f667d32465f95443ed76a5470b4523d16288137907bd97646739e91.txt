Thanks.  This contains (among other things) the interesting Executive Order:
 
>Continuation of National Emergency Declared by Ex. Ord. No. 12924

>On August 19, 1994, consistent with the authority provided me under the

So the fact that Congress won't continue a law is justification for declaring
an emergency which is justification for continuing it by presidential decree
instead.  Scary.
 
Unfortunately it doesn't list all the earlier, expired decrees which would show
what was originally used to start this thing off ("... the unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of
the United States in light of the British army currently marching on
Washington" perhaps?)
