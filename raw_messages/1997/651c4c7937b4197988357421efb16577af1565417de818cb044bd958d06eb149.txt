Well I went and got a PCS phone (Ericsson), and was pilfering through the 
manual, and came across this amusing text in the "Operating procedures"
section of the "Guidelines for Safe and Efficient Use":

  Portable PCS telephones are subject to the rules and regulations
  of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Following
  these rules will help eliminate confusion, ensure the most efficient
  use of the existing frequencies, and result in a functioning
  radio network. The following offenses are punishable by fine,
  imprisonment, or both:

   o Use of profane, indecent, or obscene language while using your
     phone.

   [a bunch more snipped but somewhat more sane regulations]

Joy. More laws to break.

Jeremey.
