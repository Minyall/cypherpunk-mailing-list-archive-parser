By the way, a more recent example than that of the Whiskey Rebellion of
U.S. troops (regular army, not state Guard units) being used within the
U.S. against U.S. citizens was the action by Hoover against the
strikers/rioters and "Hooverville" residents in D.C., circa 1930. Hoover
sent in Army troops, led by either Gen. Pershing, as I recall (and maybe
Patton and/or Eisenhower...my CD-ROM encyclopedia is not handy, and a Web
search on some of the terms didn't quickly show any hits of direct
relevance, and I don't have the time to do more searches).

Also, I recall U.S. Army regulars being sent in in several of the riots of
the last 30 years, including, as I recall, Watts, Camden, and the recent
L.A. riots.

What the constitutional issues are I have little idea.
