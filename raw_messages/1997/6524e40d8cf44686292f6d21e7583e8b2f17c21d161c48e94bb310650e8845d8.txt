as I've said before, I really hate the "cat out of the bag"
saying, as Aaron's recent comments indicate.

ONLY A TYRANNICAL GOVERNMENT WOULD PUT THE CAT IN THE
BAG IN THE FIRST PLACE

maybe we can distill this into a new saying, instead of
the favorite "cats out of bags". 

I've said repeatedly that pro-crypto advocates using the
"cat out of the bag" analogy is actually damaging to the
position that the constitution guarantees crypto freedom
via free speech and privacy. it encourages the government
side to do exactly as Aaron is doing-- arguing that the
cat is not out of the bag, when *that's*not*the*point*

how about, GOVERNMENT SHOULD STOP SUFFOCATING CRYPTO CAT!!!
