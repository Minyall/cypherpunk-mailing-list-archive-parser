  Optical character recognition converts an image into usable text.  
  But what if the character you want to recognize is a human being?

  Try Visionics Corp's FaceIt PC 3.0, which works with a digital 
  video camera to secure a desktop computer against intruders.

  The GCN Lab staff members were skeptical at first.  After all, OCR 
  and voice recognition are still not mature technologies, and face 
  recognition applications are greener still.

  FaceIt surprised us -- pleasantly.

  [description of test environment, and test]

  The software can be set to require a smile or blink from any person 
  attempting access...[I suppose you could stick out your tongue...]

  ...During testing, the software never misidentified anyone, nor was 
  it fooled if a user wore or removed glasses.  Visionics claims that 
  changes in facial hair will not cause misidentification, but we 
  didn't test that claim.
