  It seems to me that many of the government's fascist goals for
stopping strong crypto and anonymous financial transactions could
be realized merely by whacking out Alice and Bob.
  An analysis of the cypherpunks list archives shows that most of
the undesirable activities being perpetrated in the crypto-anonymity
arena are the result of a conspiracy between Alice, Bob, and their
shady friends.
  Anybody know their last names?
