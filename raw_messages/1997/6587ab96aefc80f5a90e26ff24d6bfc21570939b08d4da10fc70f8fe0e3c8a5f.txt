                      Nortel Unveils 1-Megabit Phone Line
                      Ethernet

                      By Peter Lambert 
                      1:00 PM EDT 

                      Northern Telecom Inc. announced the Nortel 1-Meg
Modem, a
                      modem designed to extend Ethernet-equipped
personal computer
                      access across standard telephone lines. 

                      The company plans to deliver plug-in modules for
its DMS phone
                      company central office switches and its Internet
Thruway voice switch
                      bypass device in the first half of 1998. It will
license the 1-Meg
                      Modem technology to modem makers. 

                      The 1-Meg will deliver 1-megabit-per-second speeds
downstream
                      into homes or businesses and
120-kilobit-per-second speeds in the
                      other direction, and like Ethernet-connected local
area network
                      (LAN) interfaces, the modem will always be on,
requiring no dial-up
                      connection. 

                      The technology will offer compatibility with both
frame relay and
                      Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) backbone
networks. 

                      Separately, Nortel finalized a deal to gain an
unspecified equity interest
                      in NetSpeed Inc. and rights to integrate
NetSpeed's Digital Subscriber
                      Line technology into its own products. NetSpeed's
ATM-based
                      LoopRunner Digital Subscriber Line Access
Multiplexer is designed to
                      terminate up to 560 users per central office
system rack.
