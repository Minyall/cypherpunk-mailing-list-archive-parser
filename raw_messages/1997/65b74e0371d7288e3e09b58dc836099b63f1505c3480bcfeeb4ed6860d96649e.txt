Why, death of Jim Bell from his own murder machine is a very exciting, I
would say a very Kafkian thing to happen. I am looking forward to it. I
even think that Jim Bell would not oppose such an outcome that much,
since his assination bot would be such an important invention for the
humanity. Maybe it will reverse the course of world history!
