First off, congratulations and thanks to Stale and everyone else for
scanning in the source to PGP5.0i (http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/)

However, theres an ugly problem with the license.
(http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/pgp50i-license.txt)

In Section 1.c.(d), permission is given to port PGP to other
platforms.  However, permission to distribute those ports is
explicitly denied.

Could the license be modified to allow people who port the software to
redisctribute ports?  There is enough FUD about using PGP without PGP,
Inc contributing to that by overly tight licensing.
