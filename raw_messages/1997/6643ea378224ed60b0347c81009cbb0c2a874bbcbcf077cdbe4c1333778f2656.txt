Hi Dekan,

I think that there is plenty of case law of extending constutional
protections to non-citizens. One that comes to mind were the rulings
against California inwhich the courts ruled the they were obligated to
provide schooling and social services to illegal aliens (a really fucked
rulling IMNSHO but if some good can come out of it no sense not making use
of it).
