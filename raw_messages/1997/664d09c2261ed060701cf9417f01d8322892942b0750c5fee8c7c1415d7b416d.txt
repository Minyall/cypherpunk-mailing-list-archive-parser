This seems to be a Goodthing(TM) for residential X-10 as it would seem to
take care of a lot of security issues by effectively isolating each home
from others who may be running the same system.

Has anyone researched the security issues around X-10? Is the Transformer
isolation good enough protection from a dedicated attack (as opposed to
accidental signal leakage)? Are their alternative routes for transmitting
the FM signal (Airwaves) that the X-10 devices would pick up?? Do any of
the current X-10 devices use signal authentication/verification?
