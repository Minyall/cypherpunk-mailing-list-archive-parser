Dear Citizen-Unit May;

It is not easy working in the Washington area. All of us have to devote a 
significant amount of time to inventing newsworthy activies to keep the 
media well-fed and all of you west-coast slackers entertained. We would 
appreciate it if you showed more respect for our efforts. While you're at 
it, try to pay a bit more in taxes; things are getting to be almost as 
expensive over here as they are out in the valley. I was knocking back a 
brew with Bill the other day, and it cost me five bucks.
