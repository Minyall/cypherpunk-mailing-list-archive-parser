Do a search on ANDF -- not sure of the acronym's meaning anymore, but
I think there is a GNU version, so perhaps there is a working system
that can be had.

I think it's for architecturally independent distribution -- "compile"
or mangle your source with the ANDF system, and then finish the
compile (compile the garbled C code) on the target system.

(Odd thing for GNU to get involved in what with their source
availability theme.)
