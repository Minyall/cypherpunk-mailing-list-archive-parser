The Clive Feather person is emphatic only real child porn
is being deleted and reported to the police; he clarified
that the 1800 items listed for Sep 1997 are *total* for
the existence of IWF.

So, it's probably going to take me several weeks to
verify his claim.

I back off from my claim (based on his dialog) that
they are canceling mere nudity, for now.
