"David Lesher / hated by RBOC's in 5 states" <wb8foz@wauug.erols.com> writes:

Why are you hated by RBOC's in 5 states?  I think I saw you at a DC punks
meeting last August and you didn't look like a kind of guy capable of
generating much hatred. :-)

Also, are these 5 separate RBOC's, or the same RBOC servicing 5 states?
