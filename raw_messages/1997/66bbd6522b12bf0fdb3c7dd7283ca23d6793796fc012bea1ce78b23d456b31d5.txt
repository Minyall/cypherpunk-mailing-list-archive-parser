This is true but with everthing there is a trade off between securaty and
efficency.  There are many posts on usenet that are just not worth the
cost of checking there sigs.  If I had to depend only on the sig reather
then having the chouse of only checking the sig on susouse posts I
wouldn't be able to read as much usenet as I do.

Not mean clients have the capsity to issue NoCeMs,  a lower number of
peaple have anough reputation to issue them.

Not realy, when finished I will distrabute the sourse.  The hope is that
we will have a number of compeating retraction servers around the world.

True.  But building up that type of trust is possable.

No you simply more to the other retraction server.  There will be nothing
unqueek about one server then anouther.

This is true of cause.

Its not going to only be one machine.
