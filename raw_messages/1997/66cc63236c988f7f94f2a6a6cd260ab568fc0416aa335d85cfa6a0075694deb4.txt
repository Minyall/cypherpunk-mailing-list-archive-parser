You've got a lot of nerve accusing PGP, Inc. of being "sellouts" when
you're over on open-pgp pushing KEY ESCROW, of all things.  I can see it
now, the new product name, "PGP with Key Escrow".  Motto: "Lose your key?
Don't worry, we've got a copy."  Do you really think cypherpunks are
going to support key escrow?  Fat chance.
