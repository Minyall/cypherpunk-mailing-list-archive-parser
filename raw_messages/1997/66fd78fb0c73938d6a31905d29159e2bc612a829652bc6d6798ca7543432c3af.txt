It looks pretty good, but the description only says USENET. Can it also be
used on mailing-lists? If so, can someone who have the resources please
run it on the cypherpunks list (just the pseudonym feature please, not the
moderation)?

I suggest also putting the PGP key fingerprint into the From: field,
because the user ID can be forged, making it less useful for filtering
purposes.
