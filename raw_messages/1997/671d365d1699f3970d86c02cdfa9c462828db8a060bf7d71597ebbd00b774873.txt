  Kind of like trusting a friend not to bugger you while you are
drunk and passed out. (But he can't prevent the police from hauling
you in for public intoxication and locking you up with someone who
might do so.)

  This is much like having a Dominatrix who chains you to the toilet
and brings out a mixed bag of utensils and instruments which are about
to be used for purposes that are a far cry from what they were created
for, and to access areas that Nature never intended to be subjected to
large amounts of sunshine.

  Perhaps someone should come out with a GAK T-shirt which has a
citizen "assuming the position" while a GAK cop stands behind him
with a crowbar stuck halfway up the citizen's ass, and saying,
"If you don't have anything to hide, then you have nothing to
worry about."
