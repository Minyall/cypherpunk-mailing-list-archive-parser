An entity claiming to be Jim Choate wrote:
: 
: Q: Don't want to be beaten about the head and shoulders with a large club?
: 
: A: Stay off my property unless invited.

I just had the laugh of my life imagining Jim shouting this through a
bullhorn on a South Dakota Indian Reservation.


: 
: The PRIMARY rule of a successful society:
: 
: Treat others the way you want to be treated, NO EXCEPTIONS.

That would be why it was considered Golden, eh?
