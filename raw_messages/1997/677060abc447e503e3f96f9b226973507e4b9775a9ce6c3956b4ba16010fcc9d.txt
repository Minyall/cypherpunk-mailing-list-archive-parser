Just discovered an online magazine at http://www.pretext.com.  The Nov/Dec
issue is on "Privacy & Security".  They feature articles on 

. The End of Privacy - are secrets safe in cyberspace?
. From Cowrie Shells to Computer Bytes - the history & future of currency
. Breaking the Codes - why National Encryption matters to you
. Herman Cohen, PI - on the trail with a virtual gumshoe

and an interview with Phil Zimmerman, plus a conversation with Lance
Cottrell on The Anonymizer.
