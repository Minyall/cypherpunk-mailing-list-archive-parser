I have to disagree here.  The junk fax law is a restraint on unauthorised
use of property, i.e. *my* fax machine, *my* phone, etc. 

That tort of unauthorised use of property applies, whether someone's sending
me a fax to sell me spamming software, or whether it's some kid ringing
my doorbell and running away.  It's not the speech that I'm fighting, it's 
the misuse of my property.

Freedom of speech does not confer a right to use other people's property.
