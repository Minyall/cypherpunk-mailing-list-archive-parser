Actually the PGP "buttons" don't appear in Eudora unless you are reading a message, replying or creating a new message; which makes sense.  Simply retrieving mail won't make the "buttons" appear.  With Netscape you must also have the "mailer" maximized or the Netscape Logo will overlap some of the PGP "buttons".  

The only thing I would like to see added to it (and perhaps PGP 3.0 will address this) is the ability to En-DeCrypt WIN95 Files folders and files "on the fly" without the necessity of clicking OK for each file like F-Protects' "Secure Desktop" program.

It is plain in "appearance" but a terrific interface, nonetheless, for $29.95 (for 2.6.2 users).  Can't wait to see how PGP 3.0 will enhance it's performance.
