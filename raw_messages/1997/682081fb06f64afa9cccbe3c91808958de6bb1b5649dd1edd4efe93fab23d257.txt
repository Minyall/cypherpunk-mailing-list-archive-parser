Greg brings up a number of very good points.

A small correction: robomod does not necessarily require authentication
of posters from the preapproved list. It is merely an option that can 
be turned on and off.

We should all understand that forgeries in the names of preapproved
people are only a SYMPTOM of a problem, not a problem in and of itself.
The true problem in such case would be that the forgers feel that they
are treated unfairly by moderators. Such people may think that the
purpose of moderation is to get rid of their persons altogether.

Therefore, if moderators face a problem of forgeries and perceive a need 
to turn this authentication option on, they should step back and this 
what THEY did wrong. Did they give the forgers an impression that 
moderators want to silence them? Do they treat everyone, including the
former "problem" people, fairly and equally?

I have a suggestion, actually. I can rewrite STUMP in such a way that
when moderators receive messages for moderation, they would not see any
header information indicating who wrote the message (this information 
would be in the packet that arrives to them, but it would be encrypted
with Internal Traffic Key). This way, a moderator would not know if the
message is, say, from Tim May or from Dr. Vulis, and would make their
decisions (including decisions to preapprove) based solely on the
message contents. That may give some way towards fairness.

Greg mentions several important and real dissadvantages of preapproved
lists, but the huge advantage that they give is a reduction in costs of
human moderation. Namely, human moderators do not have to work as hard,
and the latency (thanks, Rich!) of most posts is dramatically reduced.

DISADVANTAGES (Greg):

1) creates two "classes" of posters
2) somewhat arbitrary
3) possible forgeries require authentication and that's a pain

ADVANTAGES: 

1) reduces moderators' effort
2) reduces latency
3) depends on how you look at it -- required authentication may be "good".
4) for people like Eric Murray, who post on-topic articles, the list
   becomes essentially unmoderated, as it used to be.

Note that another important feature of STUMP that we seem to overlook was
designed specifically to address the problems of preapproved lists. This
feature is the presence of "bad words list". This is a set of regular
expressions, stored in a file, such that if incoming messages match
these expressions, they would be considered "suspicious" even if they
purport to be "From: " preapproved persons. That goes a long way towards
security and fairness because now nobody (including, say, Paul Bradley
along with Dr. Vulis or myself) would be able to call someone else
"cocksucker" without review by human moderators.

*If* moderators are fair, that would ensure that people are treated
equally even if some of them are preapproved and some are not.
