Abstract
The Army is developing the brilliant antiarmor submunition, with acoustic
and infrared seekers working in tandem, to autonomously search for,
track, and destroy moving armored targets. This submunition is to be
carried deep into enemy territory by the Army Tactical Missile System
(ATACMS) Block II missile, which is still in development and is a
modification of the in-production ATACMS Block IA missile, which carries a
different submunition. The brilliant antiarmor submunition and the ATACMS
Block II missile are a $4-billion system designed to support the Army's
"deep fires" mission, which calls for the destruction and/or disruption of
enemy forces at ranges exceeding 100 kilometers. Each Block II missile is
to carry 13 submunitions that will be dispensed over large clusters of high
payoff targets to attack and destroy individual targets. The advantage of
the submunition is that it can cover a large area when dispersed, which
allows it to compensate for target location errors.
