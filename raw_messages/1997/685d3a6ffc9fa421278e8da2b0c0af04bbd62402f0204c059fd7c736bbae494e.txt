Fair enough, and that's exactly what the focus of the Bernstein and Junger
cases is on.

The Washington nonsense would do essentially nothing about the issue of
whether crypto is speech, and might even weaken the pending legal cases.

My understanding was that you had to do most of your work in Canada because
of U.S. restrictions on those with student visas?

Certainly you are just as much in violations of the EARS by going to Canada
to do your crypto work as Rivest and Company would be in by crossing into
Canada to develop stuff for RSADSI.

Am I missing something here?
