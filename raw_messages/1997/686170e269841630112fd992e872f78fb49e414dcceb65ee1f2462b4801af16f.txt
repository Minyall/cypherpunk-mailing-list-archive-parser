More precisely, people only respect other's property when they have 
property of their own.  If you don't own anything, it doesn't matter 
to you what other people own.

The question is, do they have a realistic opportunity to aquire 
property of their own?  If they do not, then the crime will be there 
whether or not they get welfare.  That is, if the best job available 
is being a criminal, guess what?

True enough.  One possible outcome of eliminating welfare would be to 
change the crimes back to stealing bread to survive.

The dream is that if you eliminate welfare the cold glare of reality 
will force the "welfair class" to become productive citizens or die.  
There are other possibilities.
