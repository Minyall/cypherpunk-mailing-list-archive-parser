But that applied to non-citizens on US soil. IIRC, it removed the 
distinction between "good aliens" (i.e., those who had green cards) and
"bad aliens" where availability of services was concerned.

I don't think non-citizens who aren't on US soil have any particular
protection under US law. They can bring a lawsuit against the US or a US
entity, but I think that's about it (cf. Jim Choate's posting of the
relevant Constitutional sections).
