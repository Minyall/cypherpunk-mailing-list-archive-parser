Dear BA'ers,

Recently, I acquired some BA crypto machine photos courtesy of the Canadian 
Security Establishment. If anyone wants full size, selected, JPEG copies of 
these photos, please let me know and I can send them as attached files to 
E-mail. As a reminder, there are two stories beginning with the same file 
name in the BA archives which accompany the photos.

KWR37.JPG   B & W   51 kbytes   

BTW, does anyone know the meaning of 'order wire mode' in the context of a 
crypto broadcast? This mode is found in the KWR-37 online crypto 
receiver. Please send all photo requests or responses via private E-mail.

Regards,
