:Jim Bell's essay is, IMO, definately free speech.  And, as you can see from
:the IRS Inspection report, he was not charged with anything relating to the
:essay itself.  In fact, the raid happened a long time after he published
:the essay, and may truely be unrelated.

Of course, the papers only talk about this.  Anytime they get to use two
cool buzzwords like "Interet" and "Militia", they're happy.  They're even
happier when they get to use them in the same sentince.  It'll sell.
