Hi Adam,

Why bother with all of this. If you want to export crypto then just do it.
As long as we keep up with this mickymouse approach to exports trying to
appease the FEDs who are acting unconstitutionaly on this matter things
will never change. Put up a web page or a ftp site with the crypto
binaries and let whomever wishes to download them download them.

I have done this and I will continue to do this dispite what the goons in
DC have to say about it.

We must all hang together or we will all hang.
