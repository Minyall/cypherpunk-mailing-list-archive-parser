Depends on what and where you are buying, TruthMonger lives in canada 
(saskatchewan <sp>), in the UK a typical street price for an ounce of 
black is around £100 (about $170), but for good weed or skunk it can be 
up to about £150 (nearly $300), maybe the US market is sligtly more free 
resulting in lower prices...
