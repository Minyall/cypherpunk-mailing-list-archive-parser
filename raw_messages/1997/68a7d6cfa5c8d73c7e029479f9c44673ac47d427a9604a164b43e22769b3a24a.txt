I found the cause of my problem with connecting.

It seems that those sites have started doing reverse DNS lookups (probably
because of the l0pht hacks).  Reverse DNS is screwed up on my domain, so I
am getting dropped.  (The least people can do when denying addresses from
reverse DNS failure is to give a short message as to why so it can be
fixed, not just drop the connection with no error message.)  The thing
that had me confused about the whole situation is that I was able to get
in on a sporatic basis on one of the machines.

Fixing the problem on my end is going to be a pain.  I have to get it
resolved through two different ISPs to get the gordian dns knot
straightened out.  Blech!

Oh well...
