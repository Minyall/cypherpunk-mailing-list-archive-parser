Other people are suggesting things like this.  I think it is a bad
idea to tag the -unedited version of the list with moderation
decisions, because then even the -unedited versions of messages would
be delayed until a moderation decision had been made.

Some people already have suitable mail/news filters, and would rather
make their own article selections.  Please don't make those people
wait for moderation decisions.

Instead, moderation summaries (for instance in NoCeM format) could be
posted to another list, for those who want to know about moderation
decisions.

No matter what happens, there should definitely be some address
through which people can receive a completely unedited, undelayed,
unmoderaded copy of the mailing list.  So if you want a tagged version
of the list, there should also be a cypherpunks-raw or something.
