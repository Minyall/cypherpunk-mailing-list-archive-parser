No apologies needed.  You don't have to make things up - we have lobotomized 
civil servants and ministers to do that.  On the other hand, some of the users 
of public toilets themselves are or need to be lobotomized!

Another issue: The Singapore Broadcasting Authority has issued "clarifications"
to their own lobotomized Internet Code of Practise (issued July 1996).

And for banning the sale of chewing gum, purchase of guns, jaywalking,
speeding, armed robberies, rapes, defamations suits, murders etc.  Damn,
we are beginning to sound (smell??) like New York City. *shivers*

Enjoy.
