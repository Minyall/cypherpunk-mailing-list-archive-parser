What's the difference?  The SSA fund just has IOUs in it now and is being
funded from current revenue.  For those who do well in the market, don't
give them any SSA.  For those who invest poorly, use general revenue to
keep them off the street.  If the market collapses and most lose their
shirts how is this any different than the comming debacle.
