Note also that the standard date format for OS/360 and its descendents is
the "Julian" date, a YYDDD format.  This means those old compilers have to
be changed to use a different system call to get the current date.

In 1969, my wife participated in a previous "expand the date" project for a
company in San Francisco.  They converted from one digit dates to two
digits.
