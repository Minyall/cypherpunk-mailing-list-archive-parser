I am a German patriot who wants to
publish my ideas without of fear of the German goverment.
But my concern is
that the U. S. ISP I use can hand over my subscriber infoation and logs to the
German goverment.
Does anyone know a U. S. ISP who does not censor hate speech
and who has a _known_ strong privacy policy?
By the way, is hate speech
protected in United States?
