Sen. Judd Gregg (R-NH) is the chairman of the Senate appropriations
committee's subcommittee that funds the FBI. Today he spoke at
Digital/AltaVista's "Summit on Internet Content Filtering & Third-Party
Rating." He said that he "disagreed with the Supreme Court" ruling that
struck down the CDA as unconstitutional. He praised the FCC and the V-chip.
He also said:

"In a recent study, the Carnegie Mellon Institute found 917,410 sexually
explicit pictures, short stories, and film clips online within an 18-month
period."

Uh-huh.
