For those with the source, (mine says july 9, 1997 and isbn 09649654-8-8
so it may be a variant - it also says second edition) check out page 1342
around the words "Key Recovery" near the top of the page in the pgpMakeSig
routine.  I know, it is only for future corporate key recovery ;).

Also, having 16 bytes for salt and iv fields which are supposed to be
"random" can hide a large amount of other data.
