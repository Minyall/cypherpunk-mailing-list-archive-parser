But woudn't some of them enjoy it?

Anyway, I'm aways glad to see a country take up arms against faggots.
Didn't somebody report discovering a strong correlation between homosexuality

identified and killed early in life. Perhaps even foetuses can be screened
for the telltale homosexual abnormalities in the brain and aborted.
