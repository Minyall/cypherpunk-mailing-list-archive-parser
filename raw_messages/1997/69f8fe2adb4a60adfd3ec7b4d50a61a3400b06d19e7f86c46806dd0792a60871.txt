Both sides, in this case, is pretty much everyone at the FTC 
roundtable last June. 

The one exception I recall is the position taken by the Competitive 
Enterprise Institute. The CEI took the position that no regulation at 
all was needed and that marketplace forces would police the Net. 
Their view, for better or worse, is not very visible elsewhere.

Another solution, of course, is a techno-arms race solution to 
privacy. That works for readers of this list, but that's not who the 
FTC worries about. Libertarians will, of course, shudder at the 
notion that they should.
