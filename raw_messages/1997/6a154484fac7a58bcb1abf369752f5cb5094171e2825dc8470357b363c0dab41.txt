Well, first of all, one of the reasons I now have money is that I was
frugal in my high-earning years. And that means not paying $200 to send my
words out to 10,000 readers.

"Spam" is a controversial topic. The term itself is too overloaded and
fraught with various meanings to be useful. Some refer to _anything_ they
don't want, or didn't specifically request, as "spam." And so on.

As for the claim that "The only solution I see is moderation and
censorship," Mike needs to go back an revisit the list's experiences with
moderation and censorship in the January-February period this year. It was
neither cheaper nor more effective.
