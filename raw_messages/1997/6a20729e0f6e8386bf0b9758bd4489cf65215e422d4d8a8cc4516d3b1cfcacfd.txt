Not all lies are libelous, nor should they be. "I love you," no?

And these are divisive issues in the circles I travel in.

But no, technically you are arguing for property rights in //personal
information//. This is not a new concept. Brandeis and Warren first laid
the groundwork for this in their landmark (and misguided) 1890 law review
article. That article was written before the advent of modern First
Amendment jurisprudence and does not take free speech rights into
consideration.

Your scheme -- which is hardly novel -- is worthy of the same contempt.
