Granted, ISDN gives you only twice that of a 56k modem (ISDN gives you
128k), the major benefit of using ISDN over analog is latency.  The
latency of analog modems is as high as 300ms, whereas the latency of
an ISDN link is about 10% of that.  MUCH better for real-time
interactive connections.

It all depends on how you define "performance".  If you really want
good performance, get MediaOne, RoadRunner, of @Home service.
