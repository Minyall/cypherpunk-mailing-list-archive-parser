Agreed.  The time I met Jim he seemed like a loon.  A harmless one at
that...  (The stinkbomb attacks are about as far as he would go.  (And I
happen to know that he is guilty of at least one of those.))

The government seems pretty afraid of someone who only has a history of
petty vandalism with chemicals.  I wonder what else they are afraid of and
to what lengths they will go to stop it.

Reminds me of some of the "government is dead" threads of a couple of
years back.  My response was something to the effect of "The government is
not like an old man dying in a corner.  It is more like an old man having
an epeliptic seizure in a crowded mall with lots of guns.".  If the
govenrment is on the way to losing its power over the people, they are
going to take as many of us down with them on the way out.
