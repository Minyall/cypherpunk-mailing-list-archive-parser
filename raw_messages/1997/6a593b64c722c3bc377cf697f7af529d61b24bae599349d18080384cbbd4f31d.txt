Dave is offering a single mailing list, which, while I am sure Dave is
a great person, still represents a single point of control and a
single point of failure.  A distributed mailing list has a potential
for being much more robust, and for supporting a wide range of
viewpoints.  Furthermore a distributed mailing list is an interesting
minor technical problem, and a good solution could have wide
applicability.

So I think that people would like to get the distributed list going...
