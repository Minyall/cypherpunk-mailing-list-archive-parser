Andrew Grosso is the former prosecutor. I've also been chatting with Bruce
"I wrote the CDA" Taylor to see what his views are, but I suspect he'll
fall into line with his pals at the DoJ. Last week after a TV show I was
telling Donna Rice-Hughes about how crypto can protect against stalkers,
but I don't know if she understood my argument.

Others will be able to suggest many more people, I'm sure. I'm still
frazzled from my trip. Yesterday I was wandering around Chile's socialist
museum; the day before I was climbing an active volcano in the south.
