I'm not sure anymore who wrote what, but I think the idea
of having another three-letter agency involved with this is
very dangerous.

Lets take the almost unlimited abuses of the FDA, BATF, IRS etc.  These
agencies have been assigned law enforcement powers by proxy.  The
laws they enforce are administrative law.  There is nothing to
stop them from declaring administrative regs and then calling out
the jack-booted nazi's to enforce them.

Tell me this isn't true.

Plenty of cases of the FDA and BATF doing just that.

Have a better one,
