I believe in New York State the car owner is liable for the fine, but no
one gets points off the licence based on the photo.

In some jurisdictions one can get a ticket for having too much mud or dust
on the licence tag, making it hard to read.

P.S. Also in NYS cars have a paper sticker on the inside of the windshield
listing among other things the recent mileage, the year, and the licence #.
Tim's idea of using another car's tags won't work here.
