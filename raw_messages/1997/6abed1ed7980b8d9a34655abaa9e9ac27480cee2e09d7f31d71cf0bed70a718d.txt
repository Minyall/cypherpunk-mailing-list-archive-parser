Folks on f-c and cypherpunks have mirrored holocaust revisionist web
pages, banned books, and censored newspapers. Now I understand that NAMBLA
is in danger of losing its home on the web. Anyone up for mirroring the
(text-only)  publications of perhaps the world's most controversial
organization?
