Homosexuality was pretty well accepted in GB in 1930's, as evidenced by the
success of Comrade Philby and his friends.

Homosexuals have a strange attraction to cryptography, perhaps because of its
connection to privacy and anonymity. But they haven't made any contribution to
it (or to any other area of human knowledge). They ascribe to Turing the
results of heterosexual cryptographers; they libel prominent heterosexuals
like Leonardo da Vinci to argue that their perversion somehow leads to
intellectual superiority.

While homosexuality used to be a detriment to obtaining a security clearance,
being gay at NSA was a big plus under Inman. Of course now being gay is a big
plus anywhere in the KKKlintoris administration.
