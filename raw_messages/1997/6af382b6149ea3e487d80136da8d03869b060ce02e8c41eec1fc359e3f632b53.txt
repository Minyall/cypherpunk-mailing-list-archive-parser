I saw part of this on CSPAN. Yablokov made one point that I felt was 
interesting.

These devices were made during the Cold War period, and it's 
extremely unlikely that any could have been made since
the Soviet Union fell apart. 

The plutonium cores of thermonuclear devices have a limited shelf
life - he claimed 6 years, which jibes with what I've heard from
other open sources. Fission products build up in the cores which 
can poison a chain reaction. Thus all Pu based devices need to have
the cores periodically removed and replaced with new ones, while the
old ones have to go through a non-trivial reprocessing stage to 
remove the fission products. 

Thus, a nuke left on the shelf eventually turns into a dud. The time
since the Soviet Union fell (which is the upper limit of the last 
time these particular 'suitcases' could plausibly have been repacked)
is long enough ago that they are now either duds or becoming 
unreliable (I don't know if the degredation results in gradually
decreasing yield, or if one day they simply don't work).

Of course, even contaminated Pu in the hands of a terrorist (or a
State) is a disquieting notion.
