Finding a judge to sign an order to decrypt the email of a suspected child
pornographer/drug dealer will take all of 30 minutes. I don't think a 30
minute delay will be of any consequence to the government's agenda. Not to
mention that Freeh lied to Congress when he claimed that they would always
use a court order. Even today, court orders are not always required for
wiretaps. This will be no different for future "mandatory" or "involuntary"
GAK.

[BTW, does anybody here have any idea why Freeh might stated that he
preferred "mandatory" GAK over "involutary" GAK? Just curious...]
