We offer a paper distributed at the recent NYC crypto 
forum, 

"Private Groups and Public Policy: Cryptography 
and the National Research Council," 

by Kenneth Dam, professor of law at the University of
Chicago, a panelist at the forum, and chair of the 
NRC panel which produced the report "Cryptography's 
Role in Securing the Information Society," May, 1996.

Professor Dam recounts the impact of the NRC report
on the Administration's encryption policy as an example
of how private groups help shape public policy.
