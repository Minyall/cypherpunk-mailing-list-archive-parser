In case you think I came up with this question
with the goal of proposing a stronger form of feedback:

I did not; I am not qualified to attempt such a thing. (Also, my intuition
matches Bruce's, there's no cryptostrength difference). Instead, the question
came up in an implementation context, where I wanted to know whether the 
more knowledgable community would seriously question such a variant on 
a well-known feedback mode if it were necessary in this implementation.

Thanks
