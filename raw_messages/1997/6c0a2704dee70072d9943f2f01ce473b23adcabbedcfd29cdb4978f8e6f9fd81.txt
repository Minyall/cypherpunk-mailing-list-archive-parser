Wow, anonymous, you're a genius!

Errr.. there is one problem anonymous, _deployment_.  How are you
going to deploy the above patch.  Who is going to use it?

Close to zero I suspect.

However there are simply loads of people using pgp5.0, and I'm sure
pgp5.5 will be the same in a while.

It's not the triviality of making something that can be used for GAK
that the argument is about.

The argument is about PGP Inc pre-deploying it in 5.0, 5.5 all ready
for the switch to be flicked.
