A logical conclusion is that rather than specifying no subject header,
you must specify one that's most likely to get the readers to read it,
not necessarily related to the contents. I suggest the subject
                         $$$ MANE.MONEY.FAST $$$
unless you do write about John Gilmore's PGP MLM scam.

P.S. Is the "hole point" another nickname for Sandy's orifice?
