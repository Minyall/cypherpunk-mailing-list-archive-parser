How do you know that someone is not a citizen?  My mother-in-law has no
green card, can barely speak English, yet can legally stay in the US for 
as long as she likes.

Of course, that's because she has been a US citizen for over thirty years.

How do we know that you are in this country legally?  The last time you
were outdoors, would you have been able to prove that you are in this
country legally?

Innocent until proven guilty.  Unless he speaks Spanish.
