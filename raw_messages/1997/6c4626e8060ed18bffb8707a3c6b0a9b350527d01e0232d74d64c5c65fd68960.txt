One major problem with these features is that the security
implications become far more complex when you start combining them.
For instance, autoloading images without referer are safe - but
images + referer gives enough information to run doubleclick.
Cookies without referer are pretty safe - but cookies+referer
make cookies far less safe, and doubleclick more effective.

Then you start putting HTML capability in news readers,
and anybody who reads an article with an IMG in it
creates a record for spammers (or Arbitron) to use.

Rich Graves said that if you don't like the feature, take it up with the 
folks who wrote the spec - but the RFCs say that Referer needs to
be handled carefully, and should be optional...

Perhaps too much commercial advertising capability already depended on it?
