The risks of allowing pasted From: lines far outweigh the benefits. Pasting
of From lines makes remailer operators much more vulnerable to charges of
fostering forgery rather than simple anonymity.

Spam baiting is another obvious risk. Forged postings with deplorable
content will bring down retribution on the forgery victim. Forged From
lines can also be used to subscribe victims to thousands of mailing lists.

The uses of this "feature" can be duplicated with other mechanisms such as
nym-servers, which provide persistent unique From lines without the
possibility of forgery of arbitrary addresses. Users desiring greater
security can simply point the reply capability of the nym server at the
nearest /dev/null.
