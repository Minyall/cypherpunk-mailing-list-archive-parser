The novelty in this patent is an algorithm that uses Fiat-Shamir to
prove that the mixes operate correctly.  The general idea of using
non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs to verify that mixes follow the
protocol was already published by Rackoff and Simon in 1991, although
that is not acknowledged in the patent specification.

Does anyone have details about Kilian's patent application on identity
escrow, other than the paper at <http://www.princeton.edu/~erez/ident.ps>?
