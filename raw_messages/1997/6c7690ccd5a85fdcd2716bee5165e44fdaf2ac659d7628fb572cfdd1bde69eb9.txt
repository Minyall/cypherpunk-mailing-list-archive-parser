Sadly, I have to concur with the previous comments - but I'll go one better.
Send me twenty bucks a month to cover the local phone company's charges
for a second line, and I can get latency down to under an hour.  I'll just
put in an every-15-minutes-or-so crontab to dial up, fetch my system's mail,
and process it.

I wouldn't, and I hope not many other remailer operators would either.
A lot of the security on my machine comes from having physical control over
it. (That includes the ability to rapidly delete things with extreme
prejudice should the spooks come knocking at the door.) If I'm not sleeping
in the room next to my machine, I don't have that kind of control.

Also, I can't afford a second machine so I have to keep this one around for
personal use :(
