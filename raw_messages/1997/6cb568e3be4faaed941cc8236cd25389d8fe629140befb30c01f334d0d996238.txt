I put a lot of bwalk mailboxes on the iemmc's off list, and I still
get a lot of shit in those mailboxes, stating in the header
'x-ad: see iemmc for removal instructions". Fucking liars.

That must be a recent development. I broke my Web browser and
can't look t it. [If I had realized what a buggy piece of shit NT
is, I would have kept OS/2 on bwalk and installed NT on another
