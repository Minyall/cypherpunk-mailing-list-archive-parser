I came across a couple of very good Office of Technology Assessment papers,
"Electronic Surveillance in a Digital Age (July 1995)."  Download the .pdf
at:

Another paper sure to be of interest to many CPs is the excellent
"Information Technologies for the Control of Money Laundering (September
1995)."  Get the .pdf at:

Its too bad OTA got the budgetary ax.  I met several of the staff and I
regarded them highly.
