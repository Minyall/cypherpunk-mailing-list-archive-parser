No more so than your trying to decide what bookstore might carry the
magazines your articles appear in. Further more, even if your page were
commercial access only that would in no way prohibit me from linking to it,
unless you care to claim that a library or used bookstore with a computerized
listing of your articles constitutes libel (it doesn't).

Give me a break and go pick a fight you can win. And if you are serious
please enough with the vailed threats, just give me your lawyers name and
number like a good little boy.
