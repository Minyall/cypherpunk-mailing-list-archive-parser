Hi,

Thanks for clearing up that file size query for me. You are right about that
258 (it's actually 256) header attribute. In that header is where the IMDMP
special security option settings are stored (if they are indeed enabled). But
the options are rarely ever used by most developers. For more information,
download UDCM V2.0 from: http://members.aol.com/DataETRsch/udcm.html and view
the help documentation. Also, the 256 byte header itself is encrypted with a
128-bit encryption code.

Thanks again! :-)
