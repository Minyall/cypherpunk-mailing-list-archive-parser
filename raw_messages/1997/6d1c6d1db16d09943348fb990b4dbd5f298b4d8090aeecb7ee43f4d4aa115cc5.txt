We offer the April 1997 report of the G-10 countries*
"Electronic Money."

   http://jya.com/g10emoney.htm  (121K)

This is a survey of the electronic payments systems
of the ten countries, and the status and prospects 
in each for policy, law enforcement, privacy and related 
issues.

The report is by a Working Party set up after the Lyon 
conference in June 1996 to examine three policy areas:

   (1) consumer issues; 
   (2) law enforcement issues; and 
   (3) supervisory issues 

It was presented at a G-10 conference in DC on April 28 
and publically released in the US on May 7 by the Treasury
Department.

* Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,
Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom
and the United States.
