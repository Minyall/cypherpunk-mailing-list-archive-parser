I saw your listing for accessing senior citizens newsgroups through
compuserve.
Do you think, by chance, that the same would be possible through america
online?
I'm a senior citizen of 59 but find myself liking middle age to older and
find the only source on line (that i can locate as am anateur) is netpics.com
and you have to pay for this service.  But I do enjoy looking at older GUYS
and find mostly girls--even on netpics.

Thanks.
Dave
