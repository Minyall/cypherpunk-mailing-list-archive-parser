Recently a hollywood pair's home sex video was stolen, duped, and sold.  

This makes the mass market aware.
You could sell video cameras that required a passphrase to play.

This would be easier with pure digital recording cameras, which are the
next generation of consumer vidcams.  A fast stream cipher is easy in
hardware,
and there *will* be a market for it.  

You have no privacy if your bits are not encrypted when your space is
violated,
by feds or other criminals, but you want the convenience of a videocamera.

(forward this idea to other lists/newsgroups as appropriate)
