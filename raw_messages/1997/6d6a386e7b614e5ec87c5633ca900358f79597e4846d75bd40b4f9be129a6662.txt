In my community, it is even illegal to buy spray paints and give them or
make them available to those under some age (18 or 21...I don't know).

I like my solution a lot better: anyone can buy the fucking spray paint,
but taggers are shot down by those whose property they're trespassing on.

Seems consistent with personal freedom and responsibility.
