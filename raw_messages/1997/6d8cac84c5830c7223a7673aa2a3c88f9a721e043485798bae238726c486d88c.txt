  I visited your "Hack Crack and Preak" page, and I'm sure that you are
indeed a real 'Preak', not just another phony who claims to be a
'Preak'.
I had an East Indian friend who thought most everyone was a real
'Preak'.
  Speaking of which, I noticed that you had a pointer to "The Official
Cypherpunks Home Page." 

  Thanks for the pointer, I certainly found it enlightening. Up until 
now, I didn't realize that Sammeer was the head CypherPunk, and the
official host of our homepage.
  It certainly makes me feel foolish for disputing his right to have his
employees control the CypherPunks list and throw my posts in the
garbage.
  Silly me.
