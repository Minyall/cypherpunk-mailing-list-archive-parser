3-17-97:

NYP reports on "white-hat" hackers who work for IBM 
and the like, breaking into corporate systems, testing
insecurity

   "It's hard to find good people in this field who do
   not have criminal records."

Like the NatSec gang -- Shimomuras using secret tech
to chase Mitnicks for the king's coin, praying the infowar 
smoke and mirrors never end, hoping they're on the winning
side of the looking glass.
