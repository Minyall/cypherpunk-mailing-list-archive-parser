Like duh, citizen unit privacy protection is anathema to Big Brother
snooping on said citizen units, why should they care about our privacy?
They slowly chiseled away our constitutional rights to the point where we
can barely fight them.

I've recently attended a SpyKing seminar here in NYC (same week as HOPE)
and it was amazing the amount of info you can social engineer out of
people.  The biggest leaks: your bank, Cable TV, gas & electric companies.

Big Brother might as well not bother to keep records with the wealth of
info kept by the corporations.  But that won't stop them.
