Last week soon after I took a KRAP, I cracked IDEA using
my Windoze calculator in 2.7 hours, smoked a pipe bomb I 
made from a formula I found on the internet, got invited 
onto the Jerry Springer Show to embarrass myself but a 
midget without arms somehow put me in a headlock.
 
  I love being on the Cypherpunks list!!!
