An inherited Windows NT system that I am involved with has a lost 
administrator password ( no one no longer knows what it is ). Can 
anyone point me to software products/companies that can help in the 
recovery. Given Microsoft's dismal record on  security I am sure there 
must be solutions to this dilemma. Any help would be greatly 
appreciated.

Best Regards
