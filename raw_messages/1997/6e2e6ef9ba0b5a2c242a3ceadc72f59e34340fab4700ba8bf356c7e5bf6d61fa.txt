This was posted to a financial information site on Friday:

OPEN MARKET INC (OMKT)  Yesterday, stock was given a modest lift from news
that company received approval from the Department of Commerce to export its
Internet-commerce software with a very strong version of encryption
software, becoming one of the first companies allowed to do so without first
agreeing to go along with a controversial White House requirement.
