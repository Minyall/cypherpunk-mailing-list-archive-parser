Even better, the Pilot is about the same size as the new Ricochet wireless
modem. Keeping the modem in your pocket and the Pilot in your hand, you can
run Emacs over SSH from anywhere in the Bay Area.

For the GUI addicts, Ian's team just wrote a browser for the Pilot. In all
fairness, the browser for the Pilot does not interpret the HTML, but relies
on a proxy on the network to do much of the work.

But here is a device that is smaller and lighter than my wallet. A device
that gives me Emacs, a graphical web browser, and a contact manager and
scheduler that syncs with my scheduler at work. All wireless from anywhere
in the area. Did I mention that it has an Indiglo screen?

I'm sold,
