Denizens,

     I can provide a pentium box running Linux with a T1 connection to
MAE-West to host the list, if there is still interest.  The domain
name would be hidden.net (reserved in anticipation of running a
remailer).  I'd use majordomo.

     Before doing this, I'd need the answers to a few questions:

     - Is there still any interest in a cypherpunks mailing list?

     - Is alt.cypherpunks a better alternative?

     - Should posting to the list be limited to subscribers?
       Naturally, one could subscribe from a nym.alias.net account.

     - Majordomo can be configured to require confirmation of
       subscription requests, thus avoiding some attacks.  Is there
       any simple way to protect against mailloops?  Directly
       accessing the listname-outgoing alias?

     - Is a pentium up to the task of running a list of this size and
       volume?

     Let me know what you think.

Regards,

Patrick May
