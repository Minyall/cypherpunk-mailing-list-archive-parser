Subject: PGP Linux 5.0b11 feedback?

PGP for Personal Privacy 5.0b11 Linux is available for public beta in the
US and Canada via: <http://www.pgp.com/products/50-linux-beta.cgi> and we'd
appreciate expert feedback.

Should you by some miracle find an actual bug ;) please report it to
<PGPlinuxbeta@pgp.com>, which is read by those responsible for developing
and testing this version. It helps us if the first sentence or two
summarizes the problem, and if you include details on how we can reproduce
it in SQA, including any hardware/OS configuration info you think relevant.

If you have a general [comment] or [feature] request, those are welcome
too, but please prepend those meta-tags in the subject so we can easily
separate them from a [bug] that needs squashing. The 5.0 code is
feature-frozen, but we will definitely put all good ideas in the hopper for
the next rev.

Thanks!

   dave
