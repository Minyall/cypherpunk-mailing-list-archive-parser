        You might check out my article on "Markets, Self-Regulation, and
Government Enforcement in the Protection of Personal Information."  Among
other topics, I talk about self-regulation by licensing organizations.  The
piece is posted at my web site.  It is also the lead chapter in a recent
report by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration on
"Self-Regulation and Privacy in the Information Age", on their web site at
http://www.ntia.doc.gov.
