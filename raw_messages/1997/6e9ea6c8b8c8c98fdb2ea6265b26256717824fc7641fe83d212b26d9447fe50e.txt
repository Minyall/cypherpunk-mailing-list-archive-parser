How can that be? A good question. It can be because Misha submits
dozens of articles containing autogenerated garbage. He does it because
he does not like our newsgroup. We moderators have no other choice
but to reject these autogenerated articles because our charter prohibits
us from approving them.

To protect moderators from mailbombing our charter tells us to put
such mailbombers into our blacklist, which I do.

Once a month I remove Misha from our blacklist, and let him know that
he indeed had been removed. That usually results in another flood of
bogus submissions.

Apparently Misha likes it this way, and it probably lets him feel more
important than he really is. Well, if that is so, I have no problem with
that.

Check out http://www.algebra.com/~ichudov/usenet/scrm/archive/maillist.html

Otherwise, if Misha decides that he wants to post anything of substance, 
a single request from him to remove him from our blacklist would suffice.
I do not need to keep him blacklisted as long as he does not mailbomb us.

But I will not bow to him.

That's the sad story.
