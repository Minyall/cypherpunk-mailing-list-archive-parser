At last year's Hacker's Conference, a programmer/analyst from the CIA told
me that the Cypherpunks list was well known to folks there. I don't know if
they're still reading it, what with the list hiccups earlier this year and
subsequent drop-off in number of subscriptions.

At this year's CFP, an NSA guy said the same thing about NSA getting the list.

I assume the government agents know exactly what we're talking about.

Someone who has corresponded with me privately said he works for a defense
contractor on intelligence matters, and he said they took my posts about
how unbreakable crypto would facillitate perfect espionage and perfect
black markets in information very seriously. He also said "Blacknet" was
used as an example of the dangers of info-terrorism.
