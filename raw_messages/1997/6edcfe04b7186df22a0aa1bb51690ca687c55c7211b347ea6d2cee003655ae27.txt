That is like saying "by decreasing the human population 
by mass murder, our resources are conserved."  Censorship
is not justified by stating that it causes the information
to be reduced so as to lighten the load on a network.

What constitutes "due notice" in the present context?
If an ISP were to advertise "Newsgroups censored through
forgery", then that would be "due notice".

Given the proposed "due notice" above, ISPs with such 
administrators are not likely to attract many customers.
