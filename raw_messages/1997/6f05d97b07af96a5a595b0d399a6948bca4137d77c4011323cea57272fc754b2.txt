That makes a lot of sense for data security in the general sense, but I'm 
uncertain how useful that would be in terms of helping the user have more 
secure email.  Is there an offline mail reader for standard Unix systems

Thus the time may have come to abandon the cool, measured language of
technical reports -- all that talk of "perturbations" and "surprises" and
"unanticipated events" -- and simply blurt out: "Holy shit!  Ten thousand
years!  That's incredible!"
