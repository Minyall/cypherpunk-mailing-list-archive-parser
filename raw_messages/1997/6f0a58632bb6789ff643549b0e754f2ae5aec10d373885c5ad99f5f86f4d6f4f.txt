* In May, police raided a construction site in Oporto, Portugal, and
discovered that 12 drug addicts were working dawn to dusk on an
apartment building in exchange for employer-provided heroin
shoot-ups at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  According to police, the
doses were just enough so that the men would remain employed to
get the next fix.
