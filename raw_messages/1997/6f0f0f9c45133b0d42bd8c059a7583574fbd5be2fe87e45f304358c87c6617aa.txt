Lets see how many years before winblows were there computers??

It may be hard to believe for some of the "youngsters" on the list but
people got quite a bit of work done before the fancy GUI's and the ever
insistent push to "upgrade" every six months by Micky$loth.

A well train and experienced secretary will be much more productive with a
text-mode WP with a good set of macro's and keyboard accelerators. A mouse
and a GUI is not only unnecessary but counter-productive.

I would take a good multi-threaded, multi-tasking, text mode system over
the drivile that keeps comming out of Redmond, WA. anyday.
