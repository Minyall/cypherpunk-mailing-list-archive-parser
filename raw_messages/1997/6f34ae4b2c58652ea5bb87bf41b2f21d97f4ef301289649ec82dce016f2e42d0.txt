I agree. A real life crack of DES can almost always assume a know plain
text. Why should the demo crack take the 10% hit?

I have been running the distributed prime search software (see my .sig) for
about two months now. [2^1398269-1 is prime!] If you haven't tried this
software, I'd urge you to do so now. Not only because it might make you
famous, but because it will give you some ideas how a distributed DES crack
might work.

I always liked the screen saver idea, but a crack using screen savers only
works while the screen saver is active. The mersenne prime program runs on
the lowest priority thread under Win95/NT/Linux. It works even while you
are working, using all the idle cycles it can find, while at the same time
having no effect at all on any of the work you do. Install it and forget
about it. It's better than a screen saver.
