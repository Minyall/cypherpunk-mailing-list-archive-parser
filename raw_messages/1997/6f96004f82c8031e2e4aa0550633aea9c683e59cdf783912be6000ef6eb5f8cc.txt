Sure, but Oz is onshore. An offshore bank is one that offers their services
primarily to foreigners, and it is usually located in a tax haven.

As far as I know, Mark Twain is the only bank in the known universe that
accepts foreign ecash customers, and their client software is the only one
that can lose your money. Chaum really has his priorities upside down.
