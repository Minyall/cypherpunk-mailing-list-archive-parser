The logic is about patterns of discrimination of society and the State
acting as a social engineer to remove the patterns.

It is about basic human decency, and giving a person a fighting chance.

If society, in general, discriminated against people with freckles, it
is likely that it would be made illegal.

No majority group has a right to discriminate against a minority.

Oppression is done by a society.  It can only be stopped by acting
against the individuals in the society that are doing the oppressing.

That's a good point.  However, the alternate doesn't have the same
rhythm:

Freedom of association is not the same as freedom of oppression.
