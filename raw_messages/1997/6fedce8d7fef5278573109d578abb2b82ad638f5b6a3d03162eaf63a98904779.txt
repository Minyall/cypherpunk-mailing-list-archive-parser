WASHINGTON--Computer industry captains called
on President Clinton yesterday to drop efforts to
regulate data-encryption technologies, a move the FBI
warned would cripple law enforcement and leave the
country more vulnerable to terrorism. 

In an open letter to Clinton, Bill Gates, chairman and
chief executive officer of Microsoft, and 12 other
industry titans said U.S. competitiveness in
electronic commerce was at stake in the debate.
