I agree wholeheartedly.  Uncontrolled guns do not solve problems, they 
create them.  If most households have at least one firearm, it makes it 
that much easier for a criminal to obtain one by stealing yours while you 
are at work.

Canada may be regulated to death according to most libertarians, but I for
one like it that way.  I can walk alone and unarmed at night in Ottawa,
Toronto, etc. without fearing for my life.  Can a female resident of
Washington or New York say the same?  Our schools do not have metal detectors
at the entrances because they are not needed. 

IMNSHO the best way to fight crime is not with bigger guns than the "bad
guys", but with better social programs such as universal health care, and
improved day care so single parents can show their kids what a productive
lifestyle looks like.  This takes longer than blowing the brains out of some
teenager that feels his only path to a better life is through crime, and it
doesn't give the same adrenalin rush.  However, it works at the source of
crime, and not the consequences.
