He's the loudest one. However in the week his system has been down,
the amount of shit from Quantcom, newvest, etc hasn't subsided.

The answer is a technical solution that doesn't let the spammers drown

I mean, I used to get more unsolicited junk mail, which I deleted, but
occasionally I saw something of moderate interest - say, someone
selling blank CDR media reasonably cheap (not that I'd buy them from
someone advertizing this way).  Now all I get is pure crap. :-)
