There is no such thing as intellectual property rights period. All 
patents and copyrights are violations of free speech, technology is the 
only way to protect so called "intellectual property"... If you don`t 
want people to have information don`t release it.

No, I wouldn`t mind one that made bugs in Micro$oft stuff criminal ;-)... 
BTW, I`m pretty sure it was pi=3.2 on that bill.

Declan put this point very well here, don`t confuse listening to other 
peoples speech with breaking into their house and reading their private 
diary. If you don`t want the information free keep it confidential, 
simple as that.
