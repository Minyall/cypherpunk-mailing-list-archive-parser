In a just published article in CyberLaw, patent attorneys Patrick Flinn 
and James Jordan rise serious questions about the validity of the RSA 
patent in the US. The authors conclude:

> Due largely to luck, bluster, and the naiveti of potential competitors, 
the owner of United States Patent No. 4,405,829 has enjoyed a virtual 
monopoly on all uses of the RSA Algorithm. However, a careful scrutiny of 
the RSA Patent claims, and other details of its disclosure and 
prosecution, reveal both significant limits to the scope of the patent 
and material questions regarding its validity.
