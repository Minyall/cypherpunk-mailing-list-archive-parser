YELLOW C's NOW AVAILABLE...

Be the first on your block to comply with HR-666/S-7, 
the 'Freedom and Sane Conservation in Social Technology'
(FASCIST) Law, recently signed by Chancellor Clinton...
As you know, new Federal Regulations require all
cryptographers, both professional and amateur, to 
register with the State Department, surrender their 
passports, and sign Form 11065-R (Int'l Travel Prohibition
Ban Consent Decree).  The recent amnesty granted to the
cryptographic community due to the shortage of YELLOW C badges
ends January 1, 1998.  The badges are now available at your
local Post Office, Federal Building, or authorized
Microsoft retailer.

Remember, 'Export a Cryptographer, Go to Jail!'
