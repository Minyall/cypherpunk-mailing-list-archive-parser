If I want to send an important message to you and I get a hashcash rejection reponse and I'm given a Web site where I can get a Java applet to create the hashcash, I'll do it.  We all know we must affix postage to our snailmail. Its time to embrace the postal system's paradigm and educate the reminder of the Net.  Those who risk missing an email or two will totally stop their SPAM. Those who won't, won't.

All we need is a small, influential, group to sing the praises of hashcash.  I'm sure Declan and Wired will pick up the banner if what we come up with works.  After that IETF activity is a far gone conclusion.
