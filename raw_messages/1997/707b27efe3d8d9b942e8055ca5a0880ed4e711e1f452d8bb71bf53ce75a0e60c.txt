Today's "Svenska Dagbladet" has an article on a policy paper released
by the Swedish Foreign Office that follows the American agenda. "Only
simple encryption that is easy to decypher should be sold outside the
country without restriction." Also, "it is required that capability
is created for legal access to clear-text or keys." (My ugly, but
precise, translation from the article's quote from the report.)

The report authors suggest a complicated structure with key depositories,
"preferably privately owned" that "can be granted control over all
of the encryption keys that are used on the Internet." Police and
proscecutors can obtain these encryption keys as needed to access
secret documents.

The report has been widely criticized.
