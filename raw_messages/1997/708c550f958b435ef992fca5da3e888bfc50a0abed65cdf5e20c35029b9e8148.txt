I saw a reference to an FAQ by Adam Back, explaining the mailing lists
that are being set up to replace cypherpunks@toad.com, but I didn't see
the FAQ itself, on either cypherpunks-unedited or cypherpunks@toad.com, which 
I read as mail.cypherpunks. Maybe it fell through the cracks. Could Adam
or somebody else repost it? Thanks.

Btw, one of our many news servers has alt.cypherpunks, but it has very
low traffic. I doubt people are not posting. Must be alt.cypherpunks
missing from some upstream sites.
