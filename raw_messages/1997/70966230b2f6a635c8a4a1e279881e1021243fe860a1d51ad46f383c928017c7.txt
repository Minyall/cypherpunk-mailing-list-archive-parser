We've updated Jim Bell's court docket to show July 18 entries for
the plea agreement:

   http://jya.com/jimbell-dock2.htm

It lists a waiver of indictment, a plea agreement "filed under seal"
and a hearing for sentencing set for October 17.

Jim's remanded to jail until then, making a total of five months of time
served since arrest.

Consider that everyone in the case is supported by the tax-extortion Jim
was fighting. The Federal/Community Defender program is bribed at
$308,000,000 for FY 1998.

Keep up this self-serving banditry, you millions of members of Crispin's 
extortion-by-law-mil/gov big-gun-show world, and reap what you sow.
