There have been numerous proposals on the list to accomplish the above
goals in a way other than the method employed by PGP. I have read the
proposals and I am not convinced that said proposals are less intrusive.
IMO the vast majority of the proposals I saw are more intrusive. One
subscriber even argued, make that screamed, that PGP 5.5 was evil because
it didn't automatically cc: the email to the corporate recovery agent. The
mind boggles.
