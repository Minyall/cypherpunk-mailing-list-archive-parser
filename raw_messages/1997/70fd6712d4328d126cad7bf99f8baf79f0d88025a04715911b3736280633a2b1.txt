You shouldn't.

Maybe someone should print up a batch of "Voyeur Enabled" stickers for all
the GAKed products  (or should that be KRAP products, since it is the Key
Recovery Alliance, but that is redundant) we will be seeing at our local
software stores.

Sometimes I think the reason for all this snake oil we have been seeing is
the Feds need it for extra lubricant so they don't chafe themselves while
getting off on reading our mail.
