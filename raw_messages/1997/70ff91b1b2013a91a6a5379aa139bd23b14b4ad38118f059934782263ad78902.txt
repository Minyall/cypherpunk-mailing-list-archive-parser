Everyone has a "right" to speak to the government on
any subject whatsoever, which cannot be abrogated by
contracts, agreements or willful desire. A populace
that holds no secrets is a safe populace. This
is why we are officially announcing the formation of
a federal agency, the Government Agency of Knowledge.
Its role will be to obtain - by whatever means
necessary - any and all knowledge of all actions,
desires, means and ways of everything transpiring on
US soil. Duties will include holding cryptographic
keys in escrow, monitoring and assuring the 
wholesomeness of private and encrypted data traffic,
and analyzing all available "knowledge patterns" of
US citizens.

Since honest, good citizens have nothing to hide, GAK
will be a major advance toward protecting American
citizenry from crime, terrorism and other
human-meditated harm. 

After all, your government has a right and duty to
protect you.
