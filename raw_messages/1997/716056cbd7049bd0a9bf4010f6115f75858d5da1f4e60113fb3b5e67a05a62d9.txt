Horsefeathers, Adam. We've been talking about this with you a lot and you
know it. We set up a mailing list to discuss it, you've received personal
phone calls, and lots of people have bent over backwards for you.

If you think you're being ignored, perhaps you should re-examine the
signal-to-noise ratio of your posts.
