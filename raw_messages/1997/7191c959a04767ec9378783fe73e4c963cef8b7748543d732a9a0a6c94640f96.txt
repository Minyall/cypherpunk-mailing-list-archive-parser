Currently I believe that pay phones are treated like any other phone
number for incoming calls and billing to the customer (what money exchanes
hands between telco's is another thing). While it would be possible for
the telco to charge an inflated rate for calls to a pay phone some
mechanism would need to be in place to inform the caller that it was a
toll call (all payphones had a 999 area code as an example).
