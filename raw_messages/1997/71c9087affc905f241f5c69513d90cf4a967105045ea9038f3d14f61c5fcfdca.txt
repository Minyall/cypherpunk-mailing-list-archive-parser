NEW ON THE NET.

How would you like to have been part of the first group to join Amway in the 60s or
purchased stock from a small company called Wal-Mart in the 70s or had invested in a
small computer chip maker called Intel of the 80s.

Anybody that made these decisions above are sitting pretty good at the moment
Here in the 90s a new company, was launched on the net,   This young company has
positioned itself to be among the major players for years to come.

This is not a get rich scheme.

This is simply a new company, with fresh ideas, a new company that people are going to
hear a lot about.

If you would care to become a part of all the excitement, and learn more, just simply
send e-mail to sales@scarlett.org  Please put MORE INFO. in the subject field.You will
have info. vary soon.

THIS IS TRULY A COMPANY AHEAD OF IT'S TIME.

Thank You For Your Time.
