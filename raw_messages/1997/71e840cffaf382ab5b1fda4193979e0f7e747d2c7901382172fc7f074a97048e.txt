If that was the extend of the story, Bell wouldn't still be in jail.  The
USC violations above may be the official charge, but they hardly justify
keeping somebody locked up without bail. Bell is still in jail because he
wrote a politically incorrect essay and made the mistake of publishing it.
Come to think of it, that makes him a political prisoner.

What is the penalty for using a fake SSN? Does using a fake SSN warrant
keeping the suspect locked up without bail? I would think not.
