Well, in theory, requiring a licenced press would violate the 1st
Amendment.

Requiring any kind of rateing on a web page would seem to be the same as
requiring a newspaper to rate itself to protect someone from reading a
story that would be offensive to her/him. I don't beleave the newspaper
industry would stand by and let that happen to them.
