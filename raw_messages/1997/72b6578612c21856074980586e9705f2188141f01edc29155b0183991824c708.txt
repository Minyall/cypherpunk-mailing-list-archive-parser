some idiot subscribed me.

I know how to use majordomo
I know how to read mail headers
Majordomo says that the address that it is sending this shit to is not
 on the list
Much & all as I sympathize with the ethos and practice of cypherpunkery,
 please stop.  
I have asked in the proper approved way many times, and am still deluged.  
GET ME OFF THIS LIST!
Thank you.
