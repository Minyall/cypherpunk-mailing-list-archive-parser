There is another, more insidious attack to worry about.

Joe Cypherpunk has his PGP secret keyring in the "standard location".  Joe
Cypherpunk has also been posting to "Unpopular Usenet Group #666" (be it
alt.religion.scientology or alt.clinton.fisting) using a nym(s) which have
keys on the PGP keyring.

All the perp has to do, once the secring.pgp is obtained is "pgp -kvv
secring.pgp" and he now knows that Joe Cypherpunk and Secret Nym are the
same person.

This is a *BAD* thing.
