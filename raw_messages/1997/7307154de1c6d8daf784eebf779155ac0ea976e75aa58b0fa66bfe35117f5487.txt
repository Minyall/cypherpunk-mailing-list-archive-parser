I think there's one class on crypto (explicitly), but there's some
talent here. One who was interested could get an independant study or
a research job without too much trouble. After all, MIT isn't the only
place that writes kerberos, AFS, and the like.

(In case you're wondering, the "A" in AFS stands for "Andrew," of
Andrew Carnegie.)
