Or my favorite of all time:  "Human Action" by Ludwig von Mises.   It's a
large book - it could keep a collectivist New Age philosopher busy for
hours.    But even just reading the first few chapters would be sufficient
to provide some usefully deep ideas to explain fundamental things about
economic truths, of the kind which many cpunks are already in agreement with.
