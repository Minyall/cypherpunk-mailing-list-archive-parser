Wait a second.  Are you claiming that because one (1.) racist is on a
list, that everybody on the list is a racist?  How curious.

Could this be an artifact of Japanese culture?  I have heard that
Japanese culture emphasizes collective responsibilty to a higher
degree than in the United States.  So, for instance, a group like this
one would be both more formally regulated and also informally socially
regulated.  That is, when Tim makes some sort of comment, everybody
else would be somehow responsible for it.

I am glad this is not that kind of group.  I believe such groups are
not very interesting and have difficulty exploring novel ideas.

Perhaps it would be better to think of this list as a park which can
be visited by anybody in the world.

(1. Even that one is greatly in doubt!)
