Note that I didn't say "fecundity".  And note also that I said "rough
corollary".  Furthermore, it is simply false to state that "fecundity
is in no way related etc etc".  A dominant gene that causes a fecundity of
zero, for example, will not propagate.

Thanks -- I will look into it.  I know of Dr Mayr's work from other 
sources, but I didn't know he had a new book out.
