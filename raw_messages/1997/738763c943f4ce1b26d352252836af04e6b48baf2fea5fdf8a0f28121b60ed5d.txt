Just so.

I'm actually delighted the Joichi Ito has, on the basis of my humor,
denounced me as a racist.  As a member of a "mongrelized society," as one
prominent Japanese put it a while back (and not back in the 1940s...it was
the 1980s), I am always happy to be called a racist by someone from one of
the most racially homogeneous nations on earth, a nation which of course
did not allow any "boat people" to settle in their nation, all the while
denouncing the U.S. for letting only several hundred thousand boat people
in.

The history of our "Nobuki Nakatuji" <bd1011@hotmail.com> is apparently
unknown to Joichi Ito, else he would not have been so quick to brand me a
racist for my humor.

I'm not even sure Nobuki Nakatuji is even an actual Japanese, given his
hotmail.com account and his stereotypically
Japanese-trying-to-write-English skills. It may just be a troll. Or a
get-rich-quick scheme.

I've probably deleted most of this Nakatuji guy's posts, but I did manage
to find a dozen or so. Here are some excerpts for those who have forgotten
what he has written. (Oh, and he seems to never engage in any discussions,
never responding substantively to anything people say to him. I suspect a
bot at work.)
