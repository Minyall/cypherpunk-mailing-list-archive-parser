soon you too will disappear :)
  as to the budding facist comment
  I got death threats and called
traitor when I published PGP 1.0 and I endured
5 long years of federal harassment to listen to YOU???
   no I dont think so...
PLEASE consider this an official request 
to MODERATE the cypherpunks list
   kelly goen - Publisher PGP 1.0 June 5 1991
   
   now it seems not only a traitor but a budding facist...
BTW this account is being deleted tonite and I will gladly resubscribe
to a moderated list under a different name and host.domain than cypherpunk
