        Announcing: Circ 1.0.4 -- RSA and 3DES for Internet Relay Chat!

        Circ is an IRC script and C program which allows for secure
conversations over Internet Relay Chat (IRC).  It has been designed for
ircII, but may work (with help) on other clients as well.
        'al' wrote circ 1.0, but this is more advanced.  Much is fixed,
but multiuser channel-chat is temporarily broken.  If you still use circ,
you should switch, and your old keys will still work, but Circ 1.0.4 and
circ do not talk together very easily. 
        It uses AT&T truerand library, Martin Nicolay's RSA-Verfahren,
and D3DES.  It is licensed under the GNU GPL.
