-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

    If Geiger's software works as well as his ongoing comprehension of
    the problem 90 to 100 character long mail message lines cause, we
    are all in trouble.

    mail which might be forwarded, commented a few times, etc. really
    works best with 72-74 characters maximum per line.
