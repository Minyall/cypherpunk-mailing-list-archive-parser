There was a significant glitch in the version of the stylometry aid I
posted...read on if you care. 

Also, does anyone know where I can find some *real* stylometry programs (i.e.,
ones that do the math, etc.)? 

===============================================================================

I added the conjunctions-as-sentence-splitters after originally writing the
message with the program in it, and messed it up while updating the message to
match. Once you change this, it should catch most of the intended conjunctions
(not all of them -- specifically, not the ones with the comma on a different
line from the conjunction). 

> echo [and/or/but as sentence-splitters]
> grep -c "and,"<$1
          ^^^^^^
Should be ", and"

> grep -c "or,"<$1
          ^^^^^
Should be ", or"

> grep -c "but,"<$1
          ^^^^^^
Should be ", but"
