Actually toad.com is no longer the active list; it is just forwarding
posts back to the real list(s) to ease migration.  Subscribing to
toad, you'll get some small fraction of real traffic.

You ought to subscribe to one of:

cypherpunks@cyberpass.net
cypherpunks@algebra.com
cypherpunks@ssz.com

Which theoretically all contain same traffic.
