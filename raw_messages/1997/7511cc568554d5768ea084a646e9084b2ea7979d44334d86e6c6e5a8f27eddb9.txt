This is obviously false.  Zero liberty and zero security is a quite
possible situation (laying strapped to the table, waiting for your 
lethal injection, for example), as is some liberty and some security (the 
normal situation).

Of course, in this context "liberty" is a religious word, with little 
semantic content.
