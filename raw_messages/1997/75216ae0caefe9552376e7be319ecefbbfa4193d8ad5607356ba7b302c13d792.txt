Copyright laws will do nothing to prevent the text from being distributed.
All copyright laws will do is make you able to punish "offenders" after
the fact.  They have no mystical value to "protect" anything, especially
digital medium, which is easy to copy.

I can understand Bruce's view on this though.  We want these things to
spread.  The more copies that get published, the harder the task becomes
to supress info on crypto.  Kind of a fine line between making it
available and making it available for everyone...
