I've read the complete article twice, & I still somehow don't think you're
critical enough of Singapore. Oh well, maybe I'm turning into a pissy,
rabid, anti-authoritarian ideologue in my late youth. It's possible --
besides, I hate Christmas.

I'd kiss your P.S. under the mistletoe ["I value economic freedom quite
highly. Besides, it's part of other freedoms....Forget fetishizing
"democracy," already, and give me freedom!"], though we might tussle over
the exact shape of the Tax Rate vs. Economic Freedom curve. But that's for
another week, & perhaps another mailing list. Time to get drunk & stumble
out into the cold...

Season's greetings,
Paul
