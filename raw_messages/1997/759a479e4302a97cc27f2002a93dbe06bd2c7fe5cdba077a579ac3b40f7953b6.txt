The most interesting abuse the ActiveX thet I've heard of was a company   
that released an ActiveX control that modified the security manager used   
to verify and pass ActiveX controls, essentially registerring their   
company as a trusted provider.  Thus once this one control was accepted,   
all other controls signed by that company were automatically accepted by   
the browser.

The company quickly retracted the control and claimed that the   
authentication abuse was a feature put in while the control was in   
beta-cycle and accidently left in when it was finally released.  Oops!   
(This was reported on the www-security mailing list, but I have lost the   
ref)

Perhaps an interesting "nudie screensaver" control could be made to mail   
any Root.cer Cert.cer and Cert.spc (I guess) files lying around on the   
target computer to a well known mailing-list...

One wonders whether it would even be illegal. *sigh* I suppose it would   
be.
