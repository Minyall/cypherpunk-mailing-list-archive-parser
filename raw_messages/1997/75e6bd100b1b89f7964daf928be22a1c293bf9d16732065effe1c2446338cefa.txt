One minor difference is that most cults don't manage to convince the head of 
the FBI and various other national leaders that their scenario is possible.  
[I'm not saying that we actually convinced anyone ourselves but we certainly 
share a vision of a possible future with Freeh and various intelligence 
types.]  They talk about their fears of digital anarchy all the time.  I 
don't remember the FBI director talking about the Lamb and the Book of Rev 
like Koresh or about the saucer behind Hale-Bopp like Heaven's Gate.

Not an ordinary cult.
