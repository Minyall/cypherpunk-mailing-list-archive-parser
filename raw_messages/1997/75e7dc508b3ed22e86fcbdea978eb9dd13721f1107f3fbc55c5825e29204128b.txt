However, I've been waiting many years for some patent-law-knowledgeable
person to explain why mathematics, which was widely seen as being absolutely
unpatentable prior to the invention of public-key cryptography, suddenly
became patentable just in time for RSA, etc.  

Until I hear such an explanation, I _DO_ begrudge RSA and others that "right."
