Hi.

I'm gonna give a talk on the subject of hacking/security soon. Need your
help with it.

Things that I'm gonna include are: 
	what is hacking, 
	ethics of hacking,
	psychlogy of hacking, 
	other abstracts. 

	Some technical stuff, such as hacking tools and tactics, including
		IP spoofing,
		packet sniffing,
		cracker programs, 
		keyloggers, 
		progs like satan, etc.


Can you suggest some additional stuff to be included, or if you have any
resources (URLs, articles, progs, HOW-TOs, graphics, anything!), related
to any of the above topics, technical or whatever, please please do send
it over. 

Your suggestions will be a great help, as well as any info.

Thanks.
