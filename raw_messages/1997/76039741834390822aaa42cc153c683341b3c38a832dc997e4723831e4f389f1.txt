DEBIT YOUR CUSTOMERS' CHECKING ACCOUNTS ... COLLECT CHECK PAYMENTS FROM YOUR
WEB PAGE, OVER THE PHONE, OR AS AN AUTOMATIC MONTHLY DEBIT!

Close sales at your Web site, close telephone sales immediately, ship
merchandise immediately(!) ...by drafting the customer's checking account.  

No more waiting in vain for "checks in the mail."  This service increases
your cash flow, and reduces the cost of billing, mailing, bookkeeping, and
collections associated with your customers who pay by check...for far less
than the cost of accepting credit cards!
