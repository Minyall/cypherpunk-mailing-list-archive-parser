Even more disheartening is the realization that the war probably wasn't
ncesassary to free the slaves, as the South was already in decline and
slaves were leaving (via the Underground Railroad) in record numbers.  Like
the West's 'victory' over communism, there's good reason to believe that
the South would have collapsed sooner than later due to its untenable
economic structure.  It seems the war substantially fought over economic,
idiological and egotistical reasons.  Big sigh...
