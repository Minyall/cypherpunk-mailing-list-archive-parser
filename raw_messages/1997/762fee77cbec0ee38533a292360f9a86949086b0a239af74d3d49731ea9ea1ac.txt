	For person's currently living, maybe the data is lacking.
	However, tagging an ID at birth, for future citizen units,
	is perfectly feasable.  <<  And do note in passing that hospitals

	Err, the code I listed was of that format --- just a lot more
	more specific than the following.

	SSN consists of xxx-yy-zzzz
	xxx is state of issue.
	yy _can_ correspond to year(s) of issue, and locale with the
		state.  << Usually just a range of years that it
		was issued in.  >>
	zzzz is the sequence number.  Each issued number just goes up
		one more.  Though certain numbers are deliberatly
		skipped.  
	
	There are certain checks that can be done, to figure out if
	a number _could_ have been issued to an individual.

	They currently recycle old numbers, though there are still a 
	number of unused sequences that are available.  <<  Roughly
