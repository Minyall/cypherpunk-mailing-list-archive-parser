Invading Feds shoot big dogs, though I suppose gunshots are a warning.
Little yappy annoying dogs are often a more sensitive early warning
system, and aren't perceived as a threat.

Makes it easier for cops to see that you're not a threat,
or that you are a threat.  If your underwear's not Kevlar,
it's not contributing much to the process, and cops are
probably more embarassed about beating up naked people.

On the other hand, naked with blue woad warpaint is a different game :-)
