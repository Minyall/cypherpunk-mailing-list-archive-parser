ok truthmonger, after someone has stolen your money, do you
report it to the police, or do you just sit around and
curse the evildoer? what is your response when your money
is stolen?

if you do report the thief to the police, what is the equivalent
of doing this with government tax money?

 the basic idea is that "he who does nothing has
no right to complain, but of course that has never stopped
anyone from complaining"
