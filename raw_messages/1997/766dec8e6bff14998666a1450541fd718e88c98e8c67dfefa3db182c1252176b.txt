no doubt everybody on the list recieved a spam about some personalised 
children's books. Having been away or a few weeks, I only just today got 
to replying to that message. I recieved a response indicating that my 
response was undeliverable due to the mailbox being full. I just wanted 
to say that I'm glad I'm not the only one who can't stand that crap. Nice 
work.
