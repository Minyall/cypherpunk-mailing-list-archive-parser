Your inference was correct...on 12/23/97 I received a flyer in the mail
offering the Crypto CD for $89.95 if ordered before the end of the year!

There are some pretty strict rules about mail order advertising of products
that don't exist. I wonder if the folks at ddj are aware of this.
Hopefully, the letter "the editors are preparing to explain the delay" will
appear on the web site soon.
