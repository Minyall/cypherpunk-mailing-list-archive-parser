All,

Sorry about that blank post.  It was qued up to send and I did not
realize it


I am new to this list and cryptogrophy, and have a few questions.
1)what is CMR?  2) how does it relate to PGP?  3) what is GAK?  I
have gathered that it is a back door that will encrypt all messags
to
the goverment (or some other official body) as well as encrypting it
to the recipiant.  Also, I assume that PGP 5.X has added this to
their encryption scheme to allow companies to read employee e-mail.
Does PGP 2.6.2 have this back door into it?  tnx for your help.
