realy rotten things but that is just the nature of a creature with free
will.

Of cause, nether do the goverment, in the beinging.  But ideals fade and
peaple become corrupted.  At some point someone is going to say "To
protect your privacy we have to violate your privacy."

But we are getting to the point where code can do more dammige and be more
effective then any toilet plunger could be.  (Though I dout it will
unblock drains)

Thay shouldn't be, but thay often are.  History is littered with examples
of the heroic revolutionary leader becomeing the next dictor,  often
before the presdential chair has gotten cold.

Please excuse my spelling as I suffer from agraphia see the url in my header. 
Never trust a country with more peaple then sheep. Buy easter bilbies.
