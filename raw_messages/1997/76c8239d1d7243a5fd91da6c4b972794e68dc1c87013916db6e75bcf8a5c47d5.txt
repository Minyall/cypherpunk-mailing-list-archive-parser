 But the bit I'm trying to get at. Doesn't the idea of what those rights
 are change from social group to social group? Furthermore, doesn't having
 a irrefutable set of laws place a fundamental (ist) limit on a 
 democracy that exists under them? Is it possible to have a true
 democracy without the assumption of a 'higher authority'?
 Of course there is the 'go along with it, or go somewhere else'
 arguement, but that's not much of a solution.
