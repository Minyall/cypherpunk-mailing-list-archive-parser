So what you are saying that if I call up Widgits, Inc. and order product
"X" that they advertizes does "Y". They instead send me product "X" that
does "Z" not "Y" then I should have no recource? I should atleast be able
to get my money back as they have not sold me the product that they
claimed to be selling (clear violation of the "contract" between buyer and
seller).

I have no problem with them saying their product does "Y" but if I spend
my hard earned money on it then it best do what they say it does.
