Tim, I'm surprised at you. The issue isn't whether what they were doing is
illegal. The issue isn't whether it would have been justified for you to run
over their asses. The issue is government jack-booted thugs walking up,
grabbing *non-violent*, *helpless* protesters by the heads and engaging in
chemical warfare. 

I don't agree with the stance of the protesters, and I don't agree with
their method of protesting. That does NOT mean that the government is
justified in doing the equivelent of beating the shit out of non-violent
protesters. Was China justified in running over non-violent protesters with
tanks?
