Law & Order has showed me the error of my ways.

After watching tonight's show, I realized that those who 'hide behind
the Constitution' are all murderers.

I was so proud of the judge who made his speech about supporting the
concepts behind the constitution, and then was able to see his error
in not throwing it out the window because of a single dead person.
I cheered when the judge dismissed a juror for quoting the founding
fathers.

God bless what used to be America!
