I suspect that a typical Windows user with a POP account usually has a unix
account and a home directory (although its shell may be /etc/false or some
such); he may be able to ftp to it and create a .forward file pointing
to procmail, who will look at the incoming mail before passing on to his
PPP. I don't really know shit about this, so don't flame me if this
doesn't work. :-)
