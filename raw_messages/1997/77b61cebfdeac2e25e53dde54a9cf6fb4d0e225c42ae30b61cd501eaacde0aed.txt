Wait a second, isn't that what you were just calling for in my case?

To wit: "I suggest zero tolerance of Black Unicorn unless and until
someone reveals his real name."

For the guy who has been screaming his head off about censorship to the

more than anything else you have ever said puts the cap on your 
credibility as far as I'm concerned.
