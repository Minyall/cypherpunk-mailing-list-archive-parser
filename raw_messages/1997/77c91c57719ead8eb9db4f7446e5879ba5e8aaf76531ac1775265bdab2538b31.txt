No, the above was NOT written by me, nor by carl starrs. It was generated
by a perl script, which emulates writing styles of different people.
The way it does it is by keeping track of pairs of words and their most
frequently used subsequent words. It reads articles (or any text really)
written by the target person, builds the style tables, and then geenrates
the "most likely" text.

Carl starrs was a good target for two reasons, one of which is that he
does not use punctuation.
