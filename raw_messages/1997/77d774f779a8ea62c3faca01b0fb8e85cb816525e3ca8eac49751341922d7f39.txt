There is an old Middle East saying: "The enemy of my enemy is my friend"

While such a philosphy can be quite effective taticly it can pose risks
strategicly.

A good example of this was our support of Iraq durring the Iraq-Iran war
even though Iraq had traditionally been a soviet allie. This came back to
haut us durring the gulf War as our previous "friend" became a new enemy
when truly they were always an enemy and the freindship was temporarily
created through a common "enemy". Many other examples of this can be seen
in US foreign relations.
