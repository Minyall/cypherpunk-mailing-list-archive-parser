Not quite. Truth is an absolute defense against slander and libel. If the
gossip is true, which was my hypothetical, what's the cause of action?

No, you should have no right to "recover" what I know about you. This is a
common beginner's misunderstanding. What you seem to be arguing for is
property rights in information. But that is misguided. To grant you such a
right would be to let you muzzle others who say truthful things, violating
their free speech rights.

That is why many "privacy laws" are censorship in disguise.
