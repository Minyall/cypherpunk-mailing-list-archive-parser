"Key Escrow" was "We want your keys".
"Software Key Escrow" was "OK, Clipper was a loser, but we want your keys"
"Public Key Infrastructure" was "Here, have some keys"
"Trusted Third Party" was "Hey, trust us, we want your keys"
"Key Recovery" is "OK, that didn't work, but we still want your keys"
