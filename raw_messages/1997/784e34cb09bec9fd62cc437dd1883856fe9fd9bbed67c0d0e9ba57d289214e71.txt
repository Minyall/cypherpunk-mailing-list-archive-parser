Sorry about the subject; I had misread the license file originally,
thought it said PGP wouldn't take ports from folks in the US; what is
says is that if you're outside the US, you have to assert that you got
no help from PGP employees.

Anyone got a BSDI port working? (I'm hitting errors in lib/pgp/keydb)
