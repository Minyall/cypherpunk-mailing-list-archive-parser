On December 13, 1996, representatives from The National 
Information Infrastructure (NII) Task Force of The President's 
National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee
(NSTAC) held a meeting at Steptoe & Johnson in Washington, D.C. 
to discuss industry interest in developing an industry-run 
Information Systems Security Board (ISSB). 

Stewart Baker of Steptoe & Johnson discussed the antitrust laws 
and their application to the meeting, with particular emphasis on 
the need to avoid discussion of competitive conditions and to show
openness to all interested participants. 

Guy Copeland, a representative from the Task Force, briefly 
discussed the ISSB model and the purposes of the meeting. Will 
Ozier, Chairman of the GSSP Committee, next discussed the efforts 
of the Generally Accepted System Security Principles (GSSP) project. 

Several representatives from the Administration expressed support 
for the concept of the ISSB. These representatives also indicated 
that the Administration would like private industry to take the 
lead in this area and is more than willing to take "a back seat" 
to such an effort. These representatives did request for periodic 
updates on any industry driven initiative in this area.
