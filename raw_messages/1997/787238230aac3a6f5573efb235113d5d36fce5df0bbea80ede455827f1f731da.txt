"Honest"?  Bwa-ha-ha!

This "journalist" (a colleague of the pathological liar Charlie Platt)
probably writes pornographic for Jap X-rated rags.

Ito-san's repuatation is that of a pedophile.  Japs don't export crypto
(that would upset the NSA) but they do export pictures of little Jap girls
being sexually molested.  Is Ito-san one of the major exporters of child
pornography from Japan, or is he one of the male models in those pictures?
