I do not have confidence in Sandy, nor do I have preconceived confidence
in anyone else's abilities to be a good moderator. Moderators, like
governments, are potential dictators, and a lot of confidence makes them
only worse.

Moderation may or may not be a good idea, but it is important that 
readership keeps a close eye on their rulers.
