A tripwire is an element of the classic booby trap. By placing a nearly
invisible line of string or fishing line in the probable path of a victim,
and by putting some type of trap there also, nasty things can be caused
to occur. If this mode of thought is applied to explosives, how would one
use such a tripwire to detonate a bomb. The technique is simple. By wrapping
the tips of a standard clothespin with aluminum foil, and placing something
between them, and connecting wires to each aluminum foil contact, an electric
tripwire can be made, If a piece of wood attached to the tripwire was placed
between the contacts on the clothespin, the clothespin would serve as a
switch. When the tripwire was pulled, the clothespin would snap together,
allowing current to flow between the two pieces of aluminum foil, thereby
completing a circuit, which would have the igniter or squib in it. Current
would flow between the contacts to the igniter or squib, heat the igniter
or squib, causing it it to explode. <BR>

Make sure that the aluminum foil contacts do not touch the spring, since
the spring also conducts electricity.<BR>
