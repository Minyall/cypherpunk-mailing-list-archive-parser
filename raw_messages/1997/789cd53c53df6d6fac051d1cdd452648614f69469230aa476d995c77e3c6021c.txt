A question for those legally-minded list members.

Poorly put:

Does the requirement an individual pay a fee (or the acceptance of a fee) for
remailing services create a liability on the part of the remailer in regard
to the content of the message?

Or, if the service is free does the remailer have less risk than if he
charged for it?
