I get a feeling that we get new ones almost daily.

I heard a story on CNN[1] last night. I was doing 2 other things at the
same time. It went as follows:
* a perp mail-ordered some bio materials that could be used to breed viruses
* Unfortunately, there's no law against it. However the company he bought it
  from calls the feds
* The police searched the perp's house and found guns and "white supremacist"
  literature.  Apparently they got the search warrant solely on his mail order.
* Unfortunately, the gun control laws need to be strengtheed
* The perp hasn't been charged with anything. He claims (much irony in the
  talk head's voice) that he's a patriot, not a terrorist, and is working
  on a survavalist manifesto of some sort. (Apparently the sucker talked
  to a journalist.)
Perhaps someone can find this on the CNN Web site.

Fox News is much superior to CNN.
