Cough.  One wonders why these nuts spend so much of their time worrying
about what they imagine others to be aroused by, and why they embrace the
doctrine of "vicarious long-distance molestation" whenever they think an
otherwise ordinary photograph has been the victim of some random
stranger's impure thoughts. 

Such nonsense is central to the doctrine of radical feminists like Andrea
Dworkin, of the "Playboy is rape" mentality.  I've never had a clue as to
why such individuals aren't laughed out of the auditorium immediately. 

Anyone want to wager whether http://netlynews.com/ is the newest addition
to the other 82k of URLs on Paladino's now-famous "Sewer Site"? :)
