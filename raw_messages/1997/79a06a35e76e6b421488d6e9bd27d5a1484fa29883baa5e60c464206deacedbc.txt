I am adamantly opposed to any of PGP's business features being MUST
features of OpenPGP. If they were, then our freeware and personal privacy
products wouldn't be conforming applications, and we have *no* intention of
putting them in those products. Wouldn't that be an interesting situation?

I am strongly opposed the business features being SHOULD features. If I
were the only one arguing against them being SHOULD features, I'd make my
opposition clear and then shut up.

I am in favor of them being MAY features, along with a big section on
polite use.
