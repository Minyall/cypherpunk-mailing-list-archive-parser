It is kind of similar to the laws involving guns and crime.  If they find a
gun anywhere near the crime scene they tack on bigger and better penalties. 
(For example: they break down the door of someone who has some quantity of
illegal molecules on their property and find a gun in the search.  Odds are
they will try and tack on the "gun used in commission of a crime" penalties.)
 Anything that can become a threat to those in power will become eligible for
such additional penalties at some point.  

"In the future it will be extra jail time for using fire and/or the wheel in
the commission of a crime.  and the people to bring it to you?  The TLAs!"
