Supervision, plain and simple. However, if you honestly believe your 
children are going to be harmed in some lasting way by any images they 
might find there is clearly something wrong with the way you have brought 
them up, you will find most kids are uninterested by porn images anyway, 
violence is a different matter but if kids are brought up properly they 
would understand the difference between speech and act, and have respect 
for others and understanding of non-violence, there is no way to explain 
to congress-critters the difference between speech and act, it is above them.

1. Liquor: Kids should be taught to drink responsibly from an early age, 
then when they are old enough to legally drink they will not just go out 
and drink themselves to death.

2. Guns: Again, I think kids should be taught to shoot safely and 
responsibly, just as I was when I was a kid. Sure, you don`t want your 
child carrying a gun around unsupervised at too young an age, but how many 
11yr olds do you know that have the money to go buy a .38???
