Having had direct experience with a few of said welfare leeches, this is
the course I have taken.  Winchester makes an excellent pump shotgun, the
1300 Defender model, which (last time I checked) lists for $196 at
Wal-Mart.  Mine has a 7-round magazine and an 18" barrel.  (I'm not sure if
the 7-round model is still available--I purchased mine just prior to
passage of Klinton's Krime Bull.)  With a tactical flashlight mounted under
the barrel (with the power switch mounted in the front grip) and a
SideSaddle shell carrier mounted to the reciever, one has the capability to
effectively deal with rude strangers invading one's home.

I will never foment trouble or provoke a fight, but anyone attempting to
kill or injure myself or my family should ensure their health insurance
covers lead poisoning.

When everyone is armed, criminals fear everyone, not just the police.
