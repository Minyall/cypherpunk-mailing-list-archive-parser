 "A Vision of Tomorrow: Using Technology to Empower, Not to Control"

   We also endorse the use of technology to give privacy protection. For
   instance, individuals can use filtering technologies that read rating
   tags and block those that fail to achieve a desired level of privacy.
   PICS technology is being adapted to screen out Web sites that do not
   adhere to a specified level of privacy protection. Another example is
   the "anonymizer," which assigns an anonymous identity to a user and
   allows the user to shield personal information from Web sites that he
   or she visits.
