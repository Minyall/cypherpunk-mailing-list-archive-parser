The six other headers received or forwarded here have the same subject: 
"Something of Interest."

Further, Tim's message is so far the earliest of the batch: 12:18 compared to 
the next at 12:25 which went to a mail list based in Norway. Others followed 
at about 1 minute intervals, the last at 12:33.

BTW, Declan, did you not once write that IRS offices are down the corridor
from yours? If so, would you care to ask the thieves their opinion of the spam,
especially if they are the authors, sneaking into your box and lifting lists
while 
you're sipping and baseballing with the brokers?

Cite me as inquring an CU-FU, if you prefer to keep reportorial distance. Write
up spam story, do, providing that you're up to snuff paying Crispin-bandit 
extortion.
