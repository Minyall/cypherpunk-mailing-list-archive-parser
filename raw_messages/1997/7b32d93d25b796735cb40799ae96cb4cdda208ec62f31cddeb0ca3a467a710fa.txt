If you are familiar with encryption please help me with the following

Firstly I want to know if there are a encryption program currently used 
that are completely succure from hackers.  In other words, information 
encrypted that no person is able to decrypt.  Well if there isn't such a 
program I really think I have one that I have written myself.  It is 
simple text that I have encrypted and so far no one was able to decrypt 
it.  You can go and have a look yourself at 
http://www.lia.net/pvrooyen/encrypt.txt
(CLICK HERE to go 
there now)

If you think this program can be used please reply to this letter and I 
will give you more information.
