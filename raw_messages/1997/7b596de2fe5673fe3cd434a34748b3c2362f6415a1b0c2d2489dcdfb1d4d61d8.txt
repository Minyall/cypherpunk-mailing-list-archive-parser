As a relatively new subscriber I find the single factor most likely 
to get me to leave is the garbage on the list.

And a significant portion of the traffic is discussion about that garbage.

No.  The blatant spam and "Timmy isa" posts are more annoying 
than the large volume, at least in my case.

Moderation may actually cause the list to grow at a faster pace.

While I don't agree with your analysis in the short run, in the long 
run volume on the list will be *the* problem -- just due to the 
growth of the net.  And in the long run, undoubtedly further 
structure will evolve -- there is no meaningful way to deal with say 
10000 messages per day without some way of structuring the flow.
