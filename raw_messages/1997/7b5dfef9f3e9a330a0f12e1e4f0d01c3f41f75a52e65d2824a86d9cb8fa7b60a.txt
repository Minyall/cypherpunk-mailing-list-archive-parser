I have not heard anything about the discount for 2.6.3 users.  There is an
upgrade price (about $25) for Viacrypt users.  None of the discount or
upgrade prices are included on their on-line form. (And sales said they
would have to "have someone call me back" this morning when I tried to
order.)
