Dave,
  I came across a 'cracker' program that claims to be able to
hack the SecureDrive encryption system.
  Off the top of my head, I think it was called ZipCracker, or 
something similar in name to one of the PKZip encryption
cracking programs.  I found it on one of the hacker websites,
and there was a text file regarding SecureDrive which went
into some detail re: both the hardware and software aspects
of the Zip drives and the encryption itself.
