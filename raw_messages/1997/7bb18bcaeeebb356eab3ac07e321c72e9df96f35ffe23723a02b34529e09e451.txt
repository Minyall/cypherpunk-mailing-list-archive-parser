I apologize for intruding, Cynthia, but I have a question about "doing
as s/he sees fit".  For example, what is the list?  Is it the equipment,
is it the software that runs on the equipment, or is it the contents of
the list (my writings, your writings, etc.)?  If I had to rank them, I
would rank the contents as being more important than the equipment or
the software.  That said, how can those contents be considered the
property of the list owner/manager to do with as they see fit?

I do understand that they have the right to manage the list as they see
fit, and to move the messages into whatever buckets seem appropriate,
but your phrasing suggested more to me, and I'm puzzled by it.
