Well, yes, but a scientist can only make a finite number of measurements.
A computer used for crypto can only have a finite number of states.

All this talk about transfinite numbers does not have any effect
on arithemetic truths.

What good is an axiom system which asserts (internally) that there
are uncountably many reals if that same axiom system has a countable
model?
