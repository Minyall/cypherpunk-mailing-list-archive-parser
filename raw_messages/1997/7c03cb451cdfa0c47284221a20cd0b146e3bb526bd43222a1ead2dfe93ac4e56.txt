It may be tacky and undesirable, but public information is just that, public.

(I don't mean some quasi-legalistic distinction between "public" and
"private," as defined by regulators, I mean information publically
accessible.)

If one wants something kept private, use privacy tools.

(And as Cypherpunks know so well, if regulators/legislators attempt to
interfere in such markets, the markets will simply move to other
jurisdictions, or into cyphersace.)
