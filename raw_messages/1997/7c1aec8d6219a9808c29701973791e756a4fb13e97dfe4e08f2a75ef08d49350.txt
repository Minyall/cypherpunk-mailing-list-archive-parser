The way it was done with DAT (Digital Audio Tape), the product similar to
DVD in so many ways, was to restrict the availability of DAT recorders
which could faithfully record the output of other DAT machines. The SCMS
system, or "Serial Copy Management System," has been in all consumer-grade
DAT machines.

Pro-grade DAT machines have no SCMS, or  SCMS-defeat switch. And there are
various SCMS defeaters widely available.
