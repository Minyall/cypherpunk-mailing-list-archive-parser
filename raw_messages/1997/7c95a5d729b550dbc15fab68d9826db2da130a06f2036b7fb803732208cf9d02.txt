 - use a cheap throw-away account on a different ISP to direct abuse
  compaints to, and never use the account to 'send' email.
  (most people can't read headers, and just attack whoever you point
   them toward. an ISP would be hard-pressed to justify cancelling
   an account which never sent out email, for 'abuse'.)
