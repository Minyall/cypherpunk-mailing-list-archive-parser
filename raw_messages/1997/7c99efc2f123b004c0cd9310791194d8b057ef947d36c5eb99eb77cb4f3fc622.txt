In a message dated 97-05-26 19:38:43 EDT, you write:

<< The test file is only 836 bytes long.  Could you please post a file
 consisting of, say, 50.000 space characters encrypted with the same
 key? >>

50,000 with the same key? Sure. A new file will be posted under the same name
as the previously posted one. The same key will be used to encrypt the file
before posting. Contest details will be reposted. By the way, a simple
VSA2048 decryption program will be released soon so that there will not exist
a need to develop one to decrypt the file. Also, the contest expiration date
has been extended to July 1st, 1997. Good luck!

Again, random XOR is *not* the only method used to encrypt data. In fact,
random XOR could be left out. Consider examining VSACMInternal (in
INTUNIT.PAS) and VSACMProcessOperation in LIBUNIT.PAS for additional
information.
