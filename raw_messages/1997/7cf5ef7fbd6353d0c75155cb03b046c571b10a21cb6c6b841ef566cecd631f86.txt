On the list-managers list, I suggested that a mailing list
discussing how to prevent mailing list abuse might be useful.

Based on the strongly positive feedback I received about the idea,
I've gone ahead and created a "list-abuse" mailing list.  I
apologize to members of "list-managers" who have already received
this announcement.

General instructions about joining "List-Abuse" are available at:
http://clio.lyris.net/list-abuse/

Alternatively, you can send email to: join-list-abuse@clio.lyris.net

About LIST-ABUSE: LIST-ABUSE is an Internet discussion group working
to stop abuses of Internet mailing lists. In particular, we aim to
stop mail bombs, spoofed-subscribers, denial of service attacks, and
other forms of "Mailing List Terrorism". Mailing list administrators,
authors of mailing list software, and others interested in mailing
list abuse are welcome to join.
