They want to read your mail.  They would like to read your mind too.

I disagree.  I think they want to read your mail.  I don't believe they are 
scared of "digital bearer bonds" etc., although I do believe that this is the 
most hyped issue on these mailing lists ...

Because the financial aspects are hyped way out of proportion on these 
mailing lists?

Also, you will find that the govt does *not* want to ban financial crypto
- it only wants to ban encryption - so how can you argue that they are 
panicking because of the financial aspect of crypto?  You can't.  They panic 
because they can't read your mail.
