To get the definitive version I asked him what his relationship to DT
is (I got his email address from a sci.crypt posting), and this is
what he said:

: I am a consultant to Deloitte & Touche's information security
: practice.

So now we know.

Nice that he defended freedom to use cryptography anyway,
