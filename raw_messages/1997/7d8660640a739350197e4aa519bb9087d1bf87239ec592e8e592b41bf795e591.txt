Laszlo Vecsey <master@internexus.net> has setup a mailing list for
users and developers of the eternity service.  

On topic will be development, design of improved protocols, also
design of a general distributed file system (DFS or worldFS) which
some are interested to implement based on Ross Anderson's paper `The
Eternity Service', plus issuses surrounding being an eternity
operator.

The mailing list address is "eternity@internexus.net", to subscribe
