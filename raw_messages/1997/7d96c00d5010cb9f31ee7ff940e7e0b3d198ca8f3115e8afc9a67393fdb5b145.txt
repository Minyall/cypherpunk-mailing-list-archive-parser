I see some publishing opportunities:

"How to Tell if Your Child is a "Cypherpunk""

"What to do if your children display an unhealthy interest in chemistry."

"The 10 warning signs an information terrorist is in your community."

And the mother of all titles, "Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt."

Next on Oprah, children who use cryptography to keep secrets from their
parents.

P.S. Will Bell be allowed to receive encrypted messages in jail? (Bell can
report to us firsthand the practical realities of both the "prisoner's
dilemma" and the use of covert channels to communicate with other prisoners
in plain sight.)

P.P.S. Earlier today Duncan opined that prison is a good place for people
who like to read and write. First, it depends on what they let one read.
Second, no Net access. Third, and most importantly, it depends critically
on what kind of prison one is in. If your cellmate is Bubba and he wants
you to be his "wife"...



There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
