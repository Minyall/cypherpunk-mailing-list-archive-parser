This is really silly Tim,

The ability to encrypt using multiple keys has been a feature of PGP since
day one. All the Business Edition is doing is automating the process.
Despite the flawed news reports on this matter (who would have guessed)
their is nothing covert about it. The user is both informed that this is
being done and there is a way for the user to disable it in the client.

This has been discussed before on this list and others, and few have
disagreed, that a company has a legitimate need to be able to access its
encrypted data. If employees want to send love letters or whatnot then
they should not be doing it on company time using company resources.

If a corporation wishes to establish a company policy that all
correspondence be encrypted with the companies master key it is their
right to do so and IMNSHO it would be foolhardy for them to do otherwise. 

Claiming that they are doing the work of Big Brother is a cheap-shot and
uncalled for.
