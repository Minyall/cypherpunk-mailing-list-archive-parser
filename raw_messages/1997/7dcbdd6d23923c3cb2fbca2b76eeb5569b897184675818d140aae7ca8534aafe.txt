It's a start!

According to Raph's list, your remailer has a latency of about 16
hours.  Dialing in should cause a latency of, at most, an hour.  That
is, you could reasonably dial in once an hour, or even every fifteen
minutes.  Is there some other cause for the latency?

Do you have an ecash account?  If you charged 25 cents per message,
you would only need to handle about 17 messages a day to cover your
dedicated line.  The load on the line would be negligible and you
could use it for other things.

Please excuse my reluctance to fund your dedicated line, but probably
the money would be better spent subsidizing hardware for people who
are willing to set up remailers.

Incidentally, if somebody offered you colocation space, would you be
willing to set up your machine there?
