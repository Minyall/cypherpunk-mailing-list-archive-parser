Get a grip.  My world is just has the same ugly grey patina of reality
as yours.  I should have qualified my comment a bit more.  Ranting
about sniper rifles in a public forum is only going to set you up for a 
losing battle. I actually agree with Tim about the justification for extreme
measures, I just don't necessarily think that setting yourself up as a target
for some gung-ho BATF agents is a good way to see justice served.
