One amusing note.  To buy time on this "service," one is presented with a
form which requires one to fill in name, phone number, address, credit
card number, and other personal information.  Hitting "Submit"  sends this
form in cleartext to their web server.

On the bottom of the form is printed... 

"All Live Sex Sales are processed using CyberCash Transaction Encryption" 

While you're counting "Monique"s pussy hairs, the owner of the upstream
router will be doing his Christmas shopping on your Mastercard. :)
