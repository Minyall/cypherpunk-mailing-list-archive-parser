David C. Treibs writes via Declan McCullagh:
>The Bible gives the responsibility of raising children to parents, not
>to the government or any other entity.
>
>Forcing Social Security Numbers on children represents a major violation
>of parents' God-given responsibility.

While I am generally sympathetic with Mr. Treibs, it does not seem
reasonable to ask for a government child subsidy while claiming the
government has no business raising kids.
