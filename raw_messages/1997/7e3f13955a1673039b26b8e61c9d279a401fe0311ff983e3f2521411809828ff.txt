Yes, those on the list a few months ago (around the time the list moved 
from cocksucker John Gilmores toad.com to the distributed list format) 
will remember censorous arab Sameer Parekh for sending abusive mail 
threatening legal action to those who criticised the security of his 
companies "stronghold" firewall, which I among others suspect to contain 
govt. backdoors, uneducated and foolish arabs such as Parekh should stick 
to what they do best: running kebab shops and/or selling cheap fake rolex 
watches to tourists.
