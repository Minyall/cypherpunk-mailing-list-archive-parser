$1,000,000 per suitcase nuke seems way to cheap. Heck, at that price, some individuals on this list might be in the market. What's the yield of these suitcase nukes?

BTW, any idea what the law has to say about private ownership of nukes by US citizens? Assume for a moment that the actual device is kept outside the US.

Just asking rhetorical questions,
