Well this is rather a poor example. The requirment of a census was written
into the costitution and with good reason. Many of the government actions
are based on demographics congressional districting is a prime example.

There is a fight going on in cogress right now as the current
administration wants to be able to gestimate the census rather than doing
an actuall head count so it can manipulate the figures any way it wants
(ie change the figures in key congressional districts so they can re-draw
them to favor their supporters).
