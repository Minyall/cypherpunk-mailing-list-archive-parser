Yes, there are occassional breakdowns in the communications between the
list remailers. The reason that there are several of them is if one goes
down for more than a few minutes the whole lists doesn't go down which would
occur if we were still on a single remailer.

In cases such as this I would suggest checking the archives provided by a
couple of sites (I thought since I don't check the archives).

Things get lost on occassion?
