I personaly think that this is a good thing. :)))

Every bill that *is not* passed by congress is just that much more freedom
that is saved. If all the bills passed by congress over the past 100yrs.
could all be repealed no one would miss them in the least (well no one
except the STATEST). 

SAFE was a bad ideal as any law regulating crypto. I do not need DC's
permision to exercise my 1st Admendment rights any more than I need their
permision to exercise any of my rights.
