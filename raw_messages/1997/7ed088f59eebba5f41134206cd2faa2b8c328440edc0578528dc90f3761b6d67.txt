John is entitled to brag about the Bernstein decision, but getting the 
Department of State to "RWA" all of its pending license applications is nothing 
to brag about.  It cost a lot of companies a lot of money, time, and sales while
they resubmitted the same applications to the Commerce Department.  

I said at the time that State's advice to crypto exporters in those last few 
weeks was "Get your tongue out of my mouth, I'm kissing you good-bye."  

Perhaps the cause of this action was the lawsuit, perhaps it was spite at the 
crypto exporters who lobbied for a change in jurisdiction, but whatever the 
cause, it was not a good thing for anybody who is actually in the crypto 
business.
