Ummm,  Eavesdropping on cellphones is illegal, because it's illegal.
See the Electronic Communication Privacy Act (ECPA).  Since when does
anybody talking on a *radio* have an expectation of privacy?

Listening in on normal cordless phones is also now illegal, as a
result of the Communication Assistance to Law Enforcement Act (Digital
Telephony).

Recall that the early working name for Digital Telephony was "The
Digital Telephony and Privacy Improvement Act of 19XX".  Classic
piece of double speak.  The *privacy improvement* was the
criminalization of radio reception.
