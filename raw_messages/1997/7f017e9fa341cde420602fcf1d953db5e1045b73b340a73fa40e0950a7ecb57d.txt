While it was not Tim's intention to make Jim look like a criminal, the
use of a defendent's full name is often used to connote criminality.

Lee Harvey Oswald, John Wilkes Booth, John Wayne Gacy, Richard Milhous
Nixon, William Jefferson Clinton... there are many examples.

I propose we call Jim by the name he calls himself: Jim Bell.
