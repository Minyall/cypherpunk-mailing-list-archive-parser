To elaborate:

Point is that in every one of their posts that I've gotten they have a 
"send email to this address with subject cancel" only it doesn't do 
shit.   They place something that makes it look like they will not spam 
you if you ask them not to, but they do anyway.

Yeah, they use the "cancel" messages to send you more spam instead of 
shutting off all spam.  This is called false advertising, no?

If you want to take it further in to the land of the creatures of theory, 
who owns your email?  Do you?  If so, by right of ownership can you 
decide who isn't to send you email?  You can certainly achieve this by 
filters.  If the spamming scum says "I will stop if you ask me to" and 
you ask him to stop, but he doesn't, what rights have you got against 
him?  What if he is using your email for commercial purposes without your 
consent? etc.....
