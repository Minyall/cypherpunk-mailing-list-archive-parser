Interesting. In NJ, where I have had the misfortune of living, "being able
to face your accuser" means that if the cop doesn't show you have to
reschedule and keep rescheduling until he _does_ show. For this reason, I
had assumed that the "no cop, no case" clause was simply hopeful urban
legend.

I tend to be cynical, here in NJ, where I have to pass through a police
roadblock every day on my way to work, and a different one every evening.
Literally. Every day. In less than a mile of State Route 73, if that ever
helps anyone.

If nothing else, we live in a "traffic police state".
