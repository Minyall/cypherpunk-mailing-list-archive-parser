>    NEW YORK (AP) Electronic signs telling subway riders to "Watch your
>    step" and "Have a great day" were flashing confusing messages Thursday
>    in what authorities said was the work of computer hackers.
>    
>    The signs at a Manhattan subway station briefly displayed the message,
>    "Volume Fourteen, Number Three," and "The Hacker Quarterly."
>    
>    "The Hacker Quarterly" is a Long Island-based magazine that chronicles
>    the activities of computer hackers. It was not clear what the message
>    was meant to convey.
>    
>    Editor Emmanuel Goldstein said he knew nothing of the incident. "I
>    hope nobody was confused and thought it came from us," said Goldstein,
>    whose magazine offers tips on hacking into computer systems but does
>    not condone destructive behavior.
>    
>    The electronic signs have been invaded before, said Julio Lussardi, a
>    Transit superintendent.
>    
>    "It's more of a nuisance than anything else," Lussardi said.
