Please forgive me for this e-mail, but I felt I just had to let more
people know about this and get in on the ground floor!

The program I am involved in incorporates "Spillover".  Spillover is
probably one of the best ideas ever developed for network marketing.
Here's why:  Anyone I sponsor after you, will probably be placed under
you.  You then earn commissions on these new people as if you had
signed them up!  Why?  The way the program works I am trying to fill
my downline and I can only have so many people on each level.  After a
given level is full, anyone else I sponsor "spills over" to the next
level.  This is where they start getting placed under you.  So you
see, it doesn't matter if you sign them up or I do, in the end the
result is the same.

                 *  will place 2 people under  *
                 *    you automatically!!!     *

I just signed up Monday and I already have 2 members in my downline,
just from SPILLOVER!  I didn't do anything!

The program just started, in fact it has less than 550 members.  This
IS the ground floor!  The company is advertising in several major
print publications next month!  I have been in several MLM's and I can
finally say; "This is the one I've been looking for!"  If you know
what it's like to lose sleep because your so exited, email me NOW!

Don't miss this opportunity, email me for more details. I will give
you my URL (webpage) for more information.

Thanks
Sonya
