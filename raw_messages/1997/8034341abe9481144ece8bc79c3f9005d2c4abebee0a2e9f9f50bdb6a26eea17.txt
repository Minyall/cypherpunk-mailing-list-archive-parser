<sigh> It's really a shame when Socialist/Statest try to use the "free
market" to justify big government.

Your example is *not* how the free market would address the issue. If the
Telco's tried to sell the contents of indivdule's phone calls there would
be an increased demand for encrypted phones. This demand would then be met
by the electroins/communication industry (granted there would be some lag
time between the initial selling of phone contents and the first
crypto-phones getting to market but hey nothings perfect).

Now if we had a truely free market in the Telco Industry the consumer
would have the choice between several telco compaines to deal with. If one
decided to start selling recordings of its customers phone conversations
it's customers would leave in droves to its competition.

This is just simple economics 101. You can't have a free society in a
socialist, federally regulated economy.


More government agencies, rules & regulations are *NEVER* a solution.

It's an intresting side note that the reason why the Cell Phones in this
country do not use strong crypto is because of the intervention of the FCC
and associated Federal LEA's.
