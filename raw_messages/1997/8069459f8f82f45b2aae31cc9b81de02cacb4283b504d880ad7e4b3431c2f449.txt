Alienate some, for sure.  It doesn't really matter, though. 
Cypherpunks and hackers don't have a monopoly on intelligence -- there
are plenty of people who will hack crypto for food. PGP can't make a 
go of it on free software, and they can't live forever on investor 
financing.

Eh?  GAK,  GAKWare, Big Brother Inside, Four Horsemen of the Infoclypse, 
etc, etc,etc

Sloganeering and histrionics are the very lifeblood of this list.  It 
would die in days if it were limited to rational discussion...

And of course, sloganeering and histrionics are just as prevalent in 
the crypto debates in DC.

Nobody denies that your boss has the right to control his equipment
and software as he sees fit, and everybody debating on these lists
agrees that the government does not need access. 

It is also incontrovertable that PGP's CMR implementation is a
response to real demand.

It may be less obvious, but despite what PGP claims, a significant
fraction of this demand is for the ability to SNOOP, and not just data
recovery.  *All* the debate on this list implicitly takes the 
employee's side, not the management's side, and that is a serious 
lack.  The unpleasant fact is that managers NEED TO BE ABLE TO SNOOP.  
It is terrible to work for an employer who will snoop, but it is 
just as terrible to have dishonest employees.  It doesn't take a 
genius to realize that the existence of dishonest employees is a
primary motive for management snooping.

Clearly, there are some organizations for which this is more important
than others -- financial services companies are only the most obvious
example.
