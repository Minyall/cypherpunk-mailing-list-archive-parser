You're actually using more cellular infrastructure resources for the call
if you're the callee, because the carrier has to hunt down your phone
to connect to you, and then tie up the same resources during the call.

On the other hand, you can hang up on spam callers, and many services
give you caller id as part of the cell service, so you can trace
who the spammer is that called you much more easily and harass them
right away, as well as getting a bill for it at the end of the month
which you can also use to harass them.
				Thanks!
