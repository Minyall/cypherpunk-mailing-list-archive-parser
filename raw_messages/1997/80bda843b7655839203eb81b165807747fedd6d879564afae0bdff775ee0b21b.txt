Anyone notice that there is a nuclear suitcase movie being released 
within a couple of weeks of the NSA shill Russian general's book
about the same?
So, does everybody now have it firm in their mind that this is a real
threat that we will need to take firm action on the minute that Freeh
& Company announce the nuclear suitcase crisis?

Mail the last of your civil and human rights to your Congressman today.
Tell him or her to forward them to President Freeh before leaving for
the internment camps.
