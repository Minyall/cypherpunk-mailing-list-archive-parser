I need to find someone, preferably living in the Midwest, Great Lakes or 
Northeast part of the country, who knows the JAVA programming language. 
I am giving a two-day introductory course to the language next month in 
Cleveland. I will teach the first day, leaving someone to pick up the 
second day. You would be paid a fee plus all expenses.

Please reply privately off list.
