This statement is seriously confusing Key Recovery and Key Escrow.  They are 
NOT the same thing.  Everybody knows what Key *Escrow* is and that it sucks.  
Key Recovery is *very* different in that are no databases kept of private keys.
The website you mentioned (http://www.kra.org) contains some very good info on 
how Key Recovery works.  I would like to see the source of Schneier's quote 
also, because I can't believe he could get the two confused.
