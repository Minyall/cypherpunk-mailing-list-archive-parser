Either
a) You don't follow directions very well 
	(since you're still on the list, and since the software
	works just fine for people who can follow directions
	or consider spelling to be unimportant), or
b) The mailing list daemon is broken (happens sometimes, but usually
	that gives you no traffic), or
c) The mail you're sending doesn't have your correct headers on it
	(e.g. looks like it's from res@pc43.unidyne.uni.pt instead of 
	res@unidyne.uni.pt), in which case you may need human help, or
d) Somebody doesn't like you and subscribed you to the list
	because it's well-known to be a high-volume mailing list,
	and they keep subscribing you after you unsubscribe,
	in which case harassing the 1300+ people who _do_ want to
	be on the list is not a good thing to do.

So send mail to majordomo@toad.com, saying "help" and RFTM.
