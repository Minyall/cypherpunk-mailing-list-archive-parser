  Your post gives food for thought...much more so than the one in 
which I proposed my "No, he's just an asshole." theory.
  BTW, the results of my poll regarding this theory were:

"Is Too"  --  4%
"Is Not"  --  3%
"Hey, leave me out of this--'they' may be watching!"  --  9%
"Make Big $$Money$$ Licking Your Own Dick!!!"         -- 74%
"Unscribirbe"  --  10%
