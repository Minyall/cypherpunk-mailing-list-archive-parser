Hi Tim,

I think a distinction needs to be made between a war of aggression and
people defending against that aggression.

For the most part thoses labeled as "terrorist" are the one who are
fighting against an aggressor. Most terrorist don't just wake up one
morning and decide to start blowing things up. They only become active
after a foreign power attacks them and they react in self defence no
different if some one breaks into you house and you shoot them (I am sure
that there are some liberal winnies here who think that selfdefence is
wrong).

If you did not have the Federal government acting as an aggressor towards
its own citizens then you would not see such things happen.

I personnaly think the OK was a poor choice of targets. There are much
more strategic targets in DC and MD. You would think that McVeigh, with
his military background, would have known better.
