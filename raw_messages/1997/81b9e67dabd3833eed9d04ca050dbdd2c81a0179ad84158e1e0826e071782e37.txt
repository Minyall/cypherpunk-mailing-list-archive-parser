Message to prolife alliance, CCd to Cypherpunks list:

I noticed an article in .net a few days ago detailing how the prolife 
alliance, a UK anti-abortion group, had been required to remove images of 
aborted foetuses <sp?> from their web site. 

Clearly this is another incident of jackbooted motherfuckers censoring 
images that happen to contradict their particular brand of thuggery. 

I am sending this message to the prolife alliance to ask them to send a 
.zip or .tar`d file of their pages to me along with the censored images, 
I am also of course CCing this to cypherpunks to see if anyone out there 
not in the UK is also interested in mirroring these pages, if so send me 
email, or send direct to prolife@enterprise.net, who will, hopefully, 
provide us with a copy of these pages.

Note please cypherpunks that if there is any thread I do not wish to 
start it is a pro/anti abortion thread, therefore, I am making no 
judgements whatsoever, merely suggesting action to prevent censorship...
