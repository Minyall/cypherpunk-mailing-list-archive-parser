2-10-97 NYT has Page One lead on high resolution commercial
"spy satellites," and the welter of political, social, economic and 
national security consequences as foreign governments,  
corporations and individuals hire them to invade privacy, secret 
sites and labs.

A nearby story reports on organized crime's shift to new industries,
especially those reliant on high technology: calling cards, stock
offerings and health care.
