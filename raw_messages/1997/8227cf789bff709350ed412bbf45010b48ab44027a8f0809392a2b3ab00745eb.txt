But as Robert knows more directly than I, Georgia also has the "anonymity
is a crime" laws on the books (an article excerpt is below...doing a search
on Georgia and anonynimity will turn up a lot of articles).

One of the articles:

"ACLU Sues Georgia for Restricting Free Speech

"[September 26] -- This week the American Civil Liberties Union, Electronic
Frontiers Georgia, Georgia State Representative Mitchell
Kaye (R-Marietta), and others filed suit against the state of Georgia for
restricting free online speech.

"The Georgia statute makes it illegal for users to assume online anonymous
personas or pseudonyms. The statute also restricts the use of
linking to other sites on the Web. "

So, what will happen if people, entities, remailers, pseudonyms, etc..
submit keys to this EFF-Georgia repository without providing SS number,
passport, mother's maiden name, etc.?

(Will Georgia seek the BlackNet operator's extradition for not complying
with Georgia's law when he submits the BlackNet key? Does the Georgia EFF
plan to enforce the Georgia law?)

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
