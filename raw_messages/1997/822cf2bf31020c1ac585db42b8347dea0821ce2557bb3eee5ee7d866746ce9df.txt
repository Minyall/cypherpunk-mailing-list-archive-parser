Woops.  I'm mixing up my ontological icons.  Obviously I meant to
say "George Orwell".  Probably confused the two because they both
started out being semi-socialists.  HG Wells being a member of
the Rhodes Roundtable thought it would promote social justice.
Later he came to the conclusion that they just wanted to control
the world like any power-mad group that knows whats best for us.

Orwell fought in the Spanish civil war for the socialists and
against the fascists.  

Later, he worked as a propagandist for the British ministry of truth
during WWII -- eventually seeing his folly and writing 1984.
