Why not do it like the Declaration of Independence?  A primary author
puts the basic document together, and other persons with expertise in
other important areas add to it, then it gets circulated on the list
for comments and suggestions.

"Other areas" not normally addressed in these kinds of documents
should include subscribers' awareness that the crypto lists are
a prime target of attention from federal agencies, et al, and
that much of the material posted could be pure disinformation.
