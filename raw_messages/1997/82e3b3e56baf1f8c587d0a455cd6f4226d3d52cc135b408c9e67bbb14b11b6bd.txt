My attorney used to fly planes with nuclear cargo. Another friend of mine
has been visited several times by the FBI. In either case, the FBI claimed
upon receiving an FOIA request that they have no record on either person.
Does anybody here believe that the USAF would let pilots take off with
nukes on board without ever conducting a background investigation (which
are handled by the FBI)? I didn't think so.
