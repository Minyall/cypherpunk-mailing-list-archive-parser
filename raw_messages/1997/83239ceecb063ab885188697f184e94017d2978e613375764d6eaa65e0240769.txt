	Usually known as "Secure Phone Service."   << Which is also the

	Where the phone company has an address to send the bill to, but
	has no idea where the phone is physically located.  

	Most of the secure phones I'm aware of have unlisted numbers.
	But that isn't a requirement.   

	The specific name of this service does change according to who
	is providing the phone service.  My guess is that less than 1%
	of the sales reps at the telco that has installed the most of
	them, has no idea what that service involves --- and will deny 
	that such a service is even offered by them.
