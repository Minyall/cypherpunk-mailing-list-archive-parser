That's ridiculous.  One shopping for an ISP, without
access to the Net, is not in a position to read a
notice in a newsgroup.  It makes sense that censorship
and forgery advocates would also suggest means of hiding
the truth.

Again, if an ISP were to advertise "Newsgroups censored 
through forgery" -- in electronic, print and broadcast
media, or wherever advertisements are placed or material
made available to investors, then that would be "due notice".
