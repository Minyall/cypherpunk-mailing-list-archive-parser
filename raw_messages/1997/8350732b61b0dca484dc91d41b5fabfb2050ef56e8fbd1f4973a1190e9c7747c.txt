Do you do consulting work for a specific audience that would be inclined 
to need to use remailers and encryption more than the average user, or 
are you referring more to just "average" friends?  If it is the second 
case, especially, I think that many of us might benefit from some 
specific scenarios in which you proposed encryption and remailers as 
solutions.

What programs do you usually suggest?  On my Linux box, I use pine 3.95's 
filter hooks to use PGP relatively seamlessly, but the multiuser system 
that most of my peers use email on does not have a version of pine 
capable of supporting filters.  I've looked into Raph's premail, and have 
set it up successfully, but it seems a bit obtuse for a normal user.  
(Plus I *REALLY* don't like the idea of storing my passphrase on the 
multiuser system as well.)

This brings up an interesting point -- should we crypto users try and 
work with the system administrators to get PGP set up systemwide, or 
should we just try to do it on our own, as unobtrusively as possible?  A 
systemwide implimentation of PGP would probably be advantageous, but to 
ask for that certainly risks bringing attention to otherwise unobtrusive 
activities that the system administrators might not like.
