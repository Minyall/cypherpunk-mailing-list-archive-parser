 ... nothing personal, but why is it people keep deluding themselves
with the idea that they can shoot to wound. You cannot know what a
shot will do ... if you shoot someone the odds are pretty high that
you will kill him or seriously injure. You cannot count on
'non-lethally' wounding anyone. Leg shots have a very high incidence
of hitting bone and deflecting up into the torso and really raising
havoc. A shot to the thigh could easily hit the femoral artery and a
total bleedout .... if you are going to shoot assume your are going to
kill, if the guys lives, then you get to sleep a little easier that
night and later. 

   I hear so much talk about killing like its something really easy to
do ... it isn't ... unfortunately it gets easier each time, and the
sleeping gets tougher ... the only consolation to the bad dreams is
that it means you haven't lost your humanity, yet!
