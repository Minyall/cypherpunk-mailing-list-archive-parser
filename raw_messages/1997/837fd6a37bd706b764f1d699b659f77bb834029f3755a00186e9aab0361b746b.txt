Well it is none of their dam business how much money I have, what form it
takes, or what I choose to do with it. If I want to fill my trunk up with
Krugerands and drive cross-country with them why should it be the business
of some LEA thug?? 

Officer: "Why do you have a trunk full of Krugerands??"
Citizen: "None of your dam business!!"

IRS THUG: "Why do you have a trunk full of Krugerands??"
Citizen: "None of your dam business!!"

BTW: Does anyone know if the Platinum American Eagle was issued yet? Last
I heard it was scheduled for release in October.
