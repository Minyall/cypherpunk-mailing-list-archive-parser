Sandy,
 This is not intended as a flame, but I think one of us is
crazy here (and I'm getting weekend passes from the 'home',
so it can't be me).
 I am finding it hard to understand how the same people who
seemed dedicated to silencing Dr. DV K on this list can
then turn around and 'correct' him, or 'add to' his comments,
or 'one-up' him in the insult department.
 It certainly lends fuel to his claim that moderation will
be merely a one-way censorship process, as did the plethora
of comments (from 'purported' adults), as the espoused date
of the beginning of moderation drew near, whereupon various
missives were launched by the 'righteous', taking 'parting
shots' at those whom they assumed would be relegated to
the CypherPunks Flame Camps.

 I have no quarrel with whatever is done in regard to this
list, since it is essentially a private list, but I am
rather mystified at the seemingly self-delusional aspects
of instituting this nebulous moderation process.

Toto
