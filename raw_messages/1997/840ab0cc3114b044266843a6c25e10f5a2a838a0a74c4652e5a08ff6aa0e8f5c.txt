I just had an incorrect thought that I've decided to share with everyone:

The reason Al Gore (and the others) are focusing on helping All the Little
Children, is that this is the only group they can offer assistance to in
the U.S. who would accept it.   

Everyone else is stocking up on guns & ammo, waiting for The Big One.
