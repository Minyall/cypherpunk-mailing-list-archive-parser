There are worse ways of dying than being vaporized. In fact, there are
worse ways of living than dying. No, I do not believe this to currently be
the case. In my book, the US is presently the best place to live. As does
Tim. Still, I do accept anonymous email. Especially if it contains travel
blackout days.

Seriously, I doubt anybody on this list is going to do something violent.
That doesn't mean I think that nobody in the world is willing to nuke DC. I
am told that quite a few Russian nukes are unaccounted for. Just for the
record, I believe that it considerably more likely for New York City to be
nuked than DC.
