*** Battle over third generation wireless standards begins

In a scene reminiscent of Beta vs. VHS and Windows vs. Macintosh, a
technology battle among giant wireless industry manufacturers began
taking shape last week. The story, revealed in a report from
WirelessNOW, shows that makers of wireless gear are maneuvering for
position to set the standards for the next generation of wireless
Internet connectivity, multimedia applications and portable phone
services. What is precipitating this onslaught? Nothing less than the
control of a mega-billion dollar industry's future direction in what
is being called Third Generation Wireless (3GW) systems. (PR Newswire)
