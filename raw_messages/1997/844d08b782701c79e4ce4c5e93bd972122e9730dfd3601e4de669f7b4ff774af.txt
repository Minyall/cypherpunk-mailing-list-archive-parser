The problem isn't in the BSD make files, but rather in the makefiles
of the ports.  True, many FreeBSD ports' patches add -lcrypt blindly
to the makefile, but that could change.

: <bsd.port.mk>, so we could just USE that.

There already is the patches-${OPSYS} that can be used for this
purpose.
