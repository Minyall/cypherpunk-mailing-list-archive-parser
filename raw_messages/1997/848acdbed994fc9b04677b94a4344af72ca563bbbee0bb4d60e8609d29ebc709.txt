Yeah, I posted it.

Over a year ago I started a heated thread on the Telecom Regulation list, "Basis of FCC jurisdiction," which posited that the Commerce Clause basis for FCC authority might not hold for very low power and tens of GHz transmissions.  My argument, in short, was that if a transmission couldn't reasonably be expected to be detectable (using common receiver technology) across state lines then the FCC shouldn't have jurisdition.
