It is an intresting approach to justify current action agains the Swiss
Banks. If you could prove that the Swiss received stolen property what
about the "statute of limitations"? Most US crimes require that they be
prosecuted within x # of years ( I think that theft is 7yrs. ). Considering
that this all happened over 50yrs and AFAIK no capital crimes have been
commited by the swiss banks even if they are "guilty" of receiving stolen
property I can hardly see how they can be held accountable now.
