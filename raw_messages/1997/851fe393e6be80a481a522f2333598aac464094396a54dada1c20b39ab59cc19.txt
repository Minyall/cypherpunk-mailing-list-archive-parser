Sorry I haven't been keeping track of the SET but why would a merchant
need this info in the first place??? If anything one would think that this
would be client driven not server driven (ie the client queries the
merchant for the hash of his cert to see if the client already has a copy
or not). I am not quite sure what they are trying to accomplish by this
unless what you consider a "flaw" is realy a "feature by design"?
