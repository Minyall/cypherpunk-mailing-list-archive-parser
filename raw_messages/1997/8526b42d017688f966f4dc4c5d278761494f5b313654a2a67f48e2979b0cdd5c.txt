The quality of the Cypherpunks list is determined solely by the
amount of signal.  The amount of noise is irrelevant.  

Barring someone continuously mail-bombing the list 24 hours a day
from a T3, it is easy to pick and choose the posts one wishes
to read, and wipe the rest with a single keystroke afterwards. 

I read the list selectively depending upon the amount of free time
I have.  I always try to read serious crypto articles, and all posts
by Tim, Hal, Eric, Duncan, and a few other notables.  If I have 
additional time, I will read other threads of interest, a little
Vulis, and selected Toto, who happens to be a very funny person at
times.  

Now that we have moderation, I can't do this while subscribed to the
main list, and have to live in eternal fear that I am writing for 
an audience of 20 every time I respond to something on the unedited
list.

Foo on that.
