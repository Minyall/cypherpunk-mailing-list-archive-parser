No, there isn't. The port 465 has been revoked. See
<http://www.imc.org/draft-hoffman-smtp-ssl> for the current SMTP encryption
draft. It seems that port 25 will be reused with encryption.

Now, everybody please start implementing this draft and we'll soon have
secure mail. I'm already working on a DOS 8086 version for the HP 200LX.
