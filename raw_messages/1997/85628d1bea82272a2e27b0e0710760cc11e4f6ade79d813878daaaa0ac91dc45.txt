  That plinking sound you hear is the sound of NSA's bloodhounds
stamping the phrase, in reverse, on the bottom of their jackboots.
  "Sovreign Right" has that certain ring to it which suggests 
the rhetoric of Dictators who imagine themselves to be Kings.
   "Lawful Access" has that "Of course, we will only use this
'right' against drug dealers.", kind of feel to it.

  Perhaps the student who popped RSA's test balloon could propose 
the "Universal Right to Casual Access."
