I hope your not violating any patents.  (Hint hint).

Why are you babbling to us now then?

Uh, that doesn't help.  You still have no proof for this claim either.

One expects more from a company asking for investors to the tune of 1.5
million.

Consider ourself corrected.  IDEA and Blowfish have been extensively
hashed through.  Flaws, most small and correctable, were revealed in that
process too.  (I believe one Blowfish implementation had more serious
problems which were exposed by this "ritualistic screening."

It's the only way to make cryptosystems secure.  Deal with it or find
another profession.  (Or simply sell it to people who have no clue about
the product).

I don't expect you will see many messages.
