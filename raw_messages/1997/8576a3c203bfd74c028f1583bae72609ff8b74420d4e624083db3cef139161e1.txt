oh yaah.  you betcha.

it's illegal to ship wine to floridans now, so therefore it is okay 
to execute the responsible officials and blow up innocents.

no doubt there are hundreds of cypherpunks out there nodding
their heads in blithe agreement at this point.

HELLO PEOPLE!  buy a clue from the Discount Clue Store, and 
while you are out, stop by the Jiffy Lube and get your
common human decency refilled.

love,
