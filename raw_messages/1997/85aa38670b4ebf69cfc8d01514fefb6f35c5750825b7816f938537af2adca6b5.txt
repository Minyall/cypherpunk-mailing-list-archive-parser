It's not really a big problem - the law doesn't forbid the EFF to accept
anonymously submitted communications, it only forbids Subjects of the 
State of Georgia to send them.

If you don't provide enough address information along with your key 
for the Cracker Police to find your True Name and hunt you down, 
that's just a shame, now isn't it...  especially if the EFGA doesn't 
file a complaint about it.  Besides, how can they extradite someone they
can't find - send polite diplomatic notes to all the governments
in the world asking them to find some unknown character for them?
"Please extradite the usual suspects!"
