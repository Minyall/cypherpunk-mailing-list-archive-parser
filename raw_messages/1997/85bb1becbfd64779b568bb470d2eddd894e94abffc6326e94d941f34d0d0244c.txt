All this fuss is really not such a big deal, as long as the Patent and
Trademark Office <http://www.uspto.gov> hears about it.  I know nothing
about trademark procedure, but I imagine that a letter (or three) to the
PTO referencing the right application number on it could scotch an
application but quick.  Printing out email and adding a stamp seems almost
sufficient.

Maybe the nice folks at i-planet (I know you're getting this) could just
post their application number and save us the trouble of finding it ourselves?

And I checked:  The fee for a formal _ex parte_ appeal filing is only $100.
 I'm sure the i-planet lawyers will spend far more than that defending one
of those.
