Jodi,
  As you already know, I have been on extended leave from the world
for some time, having gone to visit my Father, to prepare for taking
over the family business.
  I've been catching up on my reading, in preparation for my return
in the near future, and I came across a book, "The Jesus Principle,"
which claimed that the Christian Coalition and the self-proclaimed
Moral Majority were making plans to launch a secret assault on the
electorate, pushing their hidden agendas while covering up the true
source of their Christian propaganda.
  Naturally, I laughed this off as ridiculous, but I seem to be
encountering more and more evidence of this indeed being the case.

  I am particularly perturbed by those who are doing a very, very
bad job of disguising their true intentions, goals, their hidden 
connections and secret agendas.
  In an increasingly InterNet savy world, no one who is paying
attention is going to miss the fact that your webspace is on
The Christian Interactive Network, which goes to great lengths
to make certain that those who visit their web site are made
aware that the CIN "is a 501 C (3) Nonprofit Ministry", and that
"All donations are tax exempt," so that contribitors can shift
the tax burden to non-Christians while using their own tax-exempt
money to support Christian political agendas under the guise of
religion.

  If you will check the Biblical Archives, I think you will find
that Peter never really fooled anyone, either.
  {Speaking of which, do you also plan to censor the parts of the
   Bible which quote my use of the word, "cock?"}

Love,
 ~JC~
