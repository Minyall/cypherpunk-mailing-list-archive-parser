Clinton has a *very* successful career as a politician, and has done 
a great deal for Intel, in that role.  And he is a great family man 
who also gets along well with a host of people.

I was characterizing the people Lucky described:  

  Some on this list will even say that the kids' deaths fortunately
  reduced the negative impact their parents can have on the gene pool. 

If you, Lucky, or Tim hold such sentiments in your heart, then I am
referring to you.  Lucky's statement that people putting their 
children in daycare in a federal building are "criminally stupid" is 
simply contemptible.

Of course, Gore has been called far worse things, many times over. 
Probably on this very list.  You know that, I know that.

No Duncan.  It's because your first thought is to do that math.  It is
one thing to be aware of the many, many failings of human beings and
their governments.  It is another thing to savor rightous anger,
keeping score, and thinking of suitable revenge.  Besides, who the
heck are "the Feds"? What set of human beings are you thinking about?

I do.  Though I wouldn't use that metaphor.

Keeping score again, eh?  Government -5 billion, Duncan 10.

Why on earth would you think that?

"My" side? You probably mean the "government".  If so, you are
deluded.  If not, you are right -- I personally have only a small
armory -- a few automatic weapons, two tactical nukes, some
conventional explosives, and a big pocket knife -- just your average
homeowner arsenal.

I'm not standing in anyone's way, and it wouldn't make any difference
at all if I did, because I am an insignificant zero who comforts
himself with the thought that being a clown is an honorable
profession.  That's reality.  You should take a hit, sometime -- it's
heavy stuff.  But you know who really needs a heavy dose -- it's that 
Bob Hettinga fellow -- his head is shaped strangely like a big brick, 
and he gets it wedged in the strangest places.

> It will happen anyway.

Yep.  And the second coming is just around the corner,  now that 
the comet has arrived with the mother ship.
