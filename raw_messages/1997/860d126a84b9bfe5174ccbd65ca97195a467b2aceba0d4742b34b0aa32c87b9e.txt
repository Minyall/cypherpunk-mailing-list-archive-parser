Depends on what you mean by "damage", and what you mean by "liberty", 
does it not?

Using the quasi-religious meaning for "political liberty" that you
imply, of course it is impossible for for there to be too much of it:
"political liberty" is just another term for "The Good", and there can
never be too much of The Good.

On the other hand, if by "political liberty" you mean "activity
without any politically powered constraint", then, arguably, *every*
action where a bad thing, done by a person, could have been prevented
through the exercise of political power is damage due to political
liberty.  That is, every common murder and robbery, every crime of any
sort, is damage due to political liberty.

If you are free to postulate a perfect state of liberty, I am free to 
postulate a perfect political system.  Neither exists in the real 
world.
