Looks to me like somebody's trying to land a job writing X-Files
scripts.



- "Mulder, are you saying that virus was ... polymorphic?  And that's
what wiped out the system?"

- "We both know a virus like that can take a system down for weeks.
Now I'm just worried about what it'll do next."

- "I didn't think anybody had actually made a successful polymorphic
virus?"
