Plus - A table can be based on a previously agreed upon one-time pad,
  such as the old-school spook classic, first three words, second
  column, page 3, New York Times. 

PlusPlus - On the InformEnergy Highway, this method can be further 
  obscured by use of data on an obscure website, text or source, 
  binary or hex, etc.

The point being, that one can use complex or obscure methodologies
to obtain the one-time pad table of the day, which can be simple 
enough to calculate on-the-fly in one's head.

there Are Some Similar metHOds peopLe can useE
which can even be used by children, such as myself.

Kill Flags - When WE' RElying on FeatUres of suCh Kinds, Everyone
  shoulD be using prearranged kill flags to signal danger.

Keep in mind that I may just be telling you these things because
I am a cop and trying to gain your confidence.

OTOH, how many cops have a:
