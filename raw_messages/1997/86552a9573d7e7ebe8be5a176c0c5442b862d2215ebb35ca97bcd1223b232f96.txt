"Good" disinformation, such as the MJ-12 stuff released by Bill
Cooper, John Lear, Bill Moore, Jaime Shandera et al, has a quality
that is compelling, if weird and hard to swallow.

The Higher Source crapola OTOH, won't pass first-level inspection
with any experienced UFO/conspiracy buff.  Don't waste your time.
Look for another explanation (i.e., find the money trail).
