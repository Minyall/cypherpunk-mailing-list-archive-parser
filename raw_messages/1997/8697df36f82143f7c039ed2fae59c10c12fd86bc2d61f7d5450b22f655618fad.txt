  Sending another 20 or 30 posts, quoting it in full, and telling people
to keep this crap off of the list, should ensure that it will, indeed,
be kept off the list.
  It might also be a good idea to follow up with another 20 or 30 posts
next week, quoting it in full, to ensure that this crap remains off the
list.
  It's amazing that no one has thought of this approach before.
