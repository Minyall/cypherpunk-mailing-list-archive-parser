I do not think that cyberpromo is a good site for remailers, because
a lot of sites ignore everything that comes out of cyberpromo and 
affiliated domains. A user who decides to use a cyberpromo-hosted
remailer will not be sure whether his messages will be delivered to
recipients or not.

It may be slightly better to use cyberpromo for a nym server, though.

How much does it cost to have a domain with Cyberpromo?
