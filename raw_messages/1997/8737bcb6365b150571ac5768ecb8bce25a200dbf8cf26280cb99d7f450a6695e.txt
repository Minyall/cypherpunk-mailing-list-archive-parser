Is there a combo-solution existing, an self-anonymouizing mailing list?

That is, you send the message to the list as normal listname@myhost.com,
it strips the From: headers and other headers, and forwards it to a closed
mailing list (only members can post, disabled 'who', ...).

Please CC to me any remailer-operator only followups.
