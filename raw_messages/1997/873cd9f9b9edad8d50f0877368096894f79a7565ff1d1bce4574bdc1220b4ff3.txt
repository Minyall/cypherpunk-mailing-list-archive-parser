This is utter crap, and I'm sure you know it.  All we're going to do is
provide an OPTIONAL (and I mean really optional, not the way the feds
use it) way for administrators to recover private keys.  This is not
GAK.  I will never work on a product that includes GAK.

Oh, but I guess saying that Netscape is responding to customer
requirements by including support for corporate key recovery wouldn't
make such good press release spam.
