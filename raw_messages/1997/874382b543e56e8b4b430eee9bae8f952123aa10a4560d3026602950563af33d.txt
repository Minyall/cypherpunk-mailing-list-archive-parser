Censorware naturally targets words rather than pictures because it is easier 
to write software that indexes and classifies words than it is to write image 
recognition software.  Language is actually blocked *more* than pictures 
since the programs themselves contain software to block forbidden words even 
on sites that have not been put on the censorware block list.
