I've tried to do that on my Cypherpunks-overview Web page at

	http://world.std.com/~franl/crypto/cypherpunks.html

The Cypherpunks Home Page at

	http://www.csua.berkeley.edu/cypherpunks/Home.html

is out of date regarding the state of the mailing list (and has many
broken links as well).  As I type this, the above host is up but its
Web server is not.
