I_Love_SPAM,

Hi, this is Shane. Just thought I would
drop you a note. I was just writing
very respectfully to see if you would
be open to look at a new and phenomenal
opportunity<weekly pay,no activity requiremnts,
no levels and people above you are able to 
reposition themselves below you.
 Now, if you tell me you are focused and
 committed I will respect that.
However, if you would like to learn 
more please visit my website.

This will give you a quick overview. If this 
looks interesting, leave me your phone number.
