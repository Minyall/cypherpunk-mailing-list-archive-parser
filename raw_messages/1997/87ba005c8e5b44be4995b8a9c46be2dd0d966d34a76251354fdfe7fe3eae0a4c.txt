Using substantial portions of Bill Frantz's "Key Recovery is Bad for US
Security" letter to Sen. Swienstein and with his encouragement, I've had a
piece, "Cryptography ban would cost jobs, freedom," published in this
Sunday's Las Vegas Review-Journal :

This item is in response to Vin Suprynowicz's Sept 12 editorial, posted as
"Column, Sept. 12," to this list, also in the RJ.
