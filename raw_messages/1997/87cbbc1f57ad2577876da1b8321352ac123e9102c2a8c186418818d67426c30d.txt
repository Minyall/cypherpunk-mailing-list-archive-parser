+Does anyone have pointers to information/details about U.S. prison
+inmates being used as slave labour for international corporations?
    
    try:  Linda Thompson <lindat@iquest.net>

    she's been on the kick of prisoners' rights, slave labour, etc.
    for some time.  Linda is a reactionary lawyer out of Indianpolis
    (of all places) --she gets around though on a lot of causes. she's
    not popular with the Feds over any number of issues, WACO for one, 
    where she has took interesting film footage.

    I've duelled with Linda before; very articulate and very 
    opinionated. usually good data, too.
