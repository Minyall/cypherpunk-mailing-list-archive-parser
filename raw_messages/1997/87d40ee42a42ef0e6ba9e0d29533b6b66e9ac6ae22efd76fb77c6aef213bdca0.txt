Reminds me of a certain Frenchman and some trees he wanted planted....

The paraphrased version would go as follows:

Someone: "Hey, I plan to get the RC5 crack software installed and running
on my machine tomorrow."

take several weeks, maybe months, don't you?"

Someone: "In that case, I'll get started tonight."
