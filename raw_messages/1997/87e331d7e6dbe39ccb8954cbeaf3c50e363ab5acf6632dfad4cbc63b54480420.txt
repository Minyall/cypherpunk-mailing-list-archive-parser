This ruling is interesting.
Does the First Amendment jurisprudence generelly require strict scrutiny in 
civil as it does in criminal action?
In other words, does a plaintiff in a civil case have to prove that the 
statement was intended  to incite imminent lawless action 
to recover damages like the goverment in a criminal case?
