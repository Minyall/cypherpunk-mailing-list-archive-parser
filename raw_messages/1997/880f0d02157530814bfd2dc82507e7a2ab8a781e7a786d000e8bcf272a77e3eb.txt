 So, looking at all this, what does it mean???? Are they going to have
an amnesty period when I can run down to my local firehouse and turn
in my PGP5 CDROM without risking going to jail? Will MIT turn over
logs of everyone who ever d/l-ed PGP2 and we have four weeks to turn
over every backup disk we ever made? If they do get this by us, and I
decide to use their silly-assed encryption, do I get a ten year all
expense paid vacation at the Allenwood Hilton if I send my bootlegged
PGP message inside their encryption?
