Sure we do.  I've seen Tim use Bad Language on this list
between the time the CDA was passed and the time it was
booted out.  He's a felon, and he admits it.
He's also committed less specific crimes such as
claiming to own scary weapons, and calling for 
"Death to Tyrants", which is clearly a threat to 
most of Washington and some chunk of Sacramento.
He nearly had his Ontologist's License yanked a year or so ago...
