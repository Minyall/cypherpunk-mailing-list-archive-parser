We may speculate, we may even know the truth. The government however 
won`t allow a small thing like truth to stand in their way.

Yes, he is guilty of murder and I would favour torturing him to death 
slowly, this is not emotional reactionism, merely a desire for justice 
and fair punishment.

As I have said, I personally believe McVeigh was guilty, this does not 
make it so, and no jury in the world should have convicted him on what 
was presented.

A fairly natural reaction, McVeigh will suffer the most if he is 
executed, I would imagine that unless you are a deeply religious person 
the knowledge of your impending death is indeed terrifying. I recall a 
near miss I had in a car a while ago, I thought I was going to hit an 
oncoming car and be killed, only lasted about 10 seconds, if that, yet it 
was the most terrifying experience of my life, going through than for weeks 
or months is indeed a fitting punishment if he is guilty.

> Life sucks.  Death sucks even more.

Indeed, sometimes in very dark moments I do believe being dead might be 
more fun <g>, less to worry over, but the will to self destruction is 
surrender.
