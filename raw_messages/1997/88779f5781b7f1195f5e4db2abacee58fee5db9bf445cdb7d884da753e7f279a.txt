One assumes you are reffering to the wild west again?

Regardless, a point about the wild west:  I have it from a fairly reliable
source that in teh entire time period labeled 'The Wild West', there were about
8 shooting deaths in Dodge City (a particularily 'Wild' town), of which 5 were
shotgun deaths....  Makes you wonder.

I also have a pointer to an excellent, well researched US paper on why gun
control is bad, if anyone wants it, but it's been posted here before I'm pretty
sure.
