in a message apparently-from:  jbugden@smtplink.alis.ca
these words appeared:

>The loss of John's involvement is a real loss.
{snip}

I would expect that "John's involvement" will not be lost just because the
primary mass storage for the data comprising these messages is not on a
disk drive in toad hall.  

>...how John will feel about the cypherpunks list as it moves beyond him.
{snip}

Unless the openness of this list, which was such a cause celebre, is compromised, I do not 
envision any mechanisms being put in place to exclude his contributions, if he 
chooses to make any.

I also expect that the outcome of the in-progress election for ISOC board of 
trustees may have a certain effect on his time-and-energy resource allocation 
algorithm for the next few years.
