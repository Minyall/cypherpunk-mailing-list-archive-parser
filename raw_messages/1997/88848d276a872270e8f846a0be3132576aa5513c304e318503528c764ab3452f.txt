>> cell-phones offer encryption to ensure our privacy?"

A full page ad from the January 14, 1997 New York Times:

  Dear Mr. Speaker:
    If you'd rather not have
  your phone conversation
  overheard and printed word
  for word in the newspaper,
  next time use an Omnipoint
  wireless phone instead of a
  cellular phone.

The ad then explains that cell phone eavesdropping happnes all the
time, and offers Omnipoint, "a new 100% digital wireless phone system
that operates on a technology far superior to cellular. It encrypts
your voice so no one can listen in on your conversations. Or capture
any personal data transmissions."

It's a pretty funny ad.
