Yes, the very, very, intensely bright side.

In actuality, the damage radius of course goes approximately as the cube
root of the megatonnage. The multimegaton warheads of some decades back are
no more, replaced by 1 MT and even 200 KT warheads as the "workhorses" of
MIRV and cruise missile delivery systems. And of course nuclear
demolitions, designed to take out dams, close mountain passes, etc., are of
even less megatonnage.

In Hiroshima and Nagasaki, people survived the blast at a radius of several
hundred meters, if they were not looking at the blast and were not in the
open, or in residences ignited. (The Japanese houses were more easily
ignited than modern American or European houses and apartments, for various
reasons.

These bombs were roughly 20 KT. A suitcase bomb might well be comparable,
or even smaller. And even the "workhorses" I mentioned, at 200 KT, would
have roughly the same survivability at 2 or 3 times the radius, i.e. at
1000 meters or so.

Declan would be very unlikely to be in the lethal zone, unless he happened
to be near one of the obvious targets.

(Which in my opinion would be the White House, the Congress, the Pentagon,
or the densepack burrowcrat warrens. Using the above calculations, it is
quite reasonable that big chunks of these buildings would survive a
suitcase nuke placed a few hundred meters away. The Pentagon might lose a
bite out of it, and thus look like some kind of mil-spec Apple logo.)
