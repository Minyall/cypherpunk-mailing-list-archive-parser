We don't like Usenet because it's full of faggots like Guy Polis.

A useful function for a government would be to round up all the
AIDS-infected faggots like Guy Polis and to put them publicly out
of their misery in fun creative ways, like they do in Iran.

I see great possibilities for live family entertaintment.

Thank God for AIDS!
