That's an extremely bad analogy; we're not paying for the Net to carry
our mail, because we've already paid our ISP for that. We're paying for
remailers to process our mail or for humans to read it. A better analogy
would be for snail-junkmail to include a five dollar bill to encourage
people to open it rather than junk it unopened.

(Of course this really only applies to real digital cash, but that's
what hashcash is a substitute for.)
