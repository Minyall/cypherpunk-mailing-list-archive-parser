I think I saw this claim made before around the time of the "moderation
experiment".

The only ways I can see that this could have happened are either that:

  i)  John Gilmore started editing cypherpunks-unedited at Sandy/C2net's
      request

  ii) cypherpunks-unedited was edited all along by someone (John or Sandy)

i) is sort of feasible, perhaps there are others who were on unedited
and were counting who could confirm this.  Toto I think was.

ii) is hard to believe because the fact that something is edited shows
-- when the editor is sleeping you get lag.

I'm fairly sure I didn't see the C2 legal letter you posted yesterday
before.

Can anyone else can confirm?
