You know, a long time ago (in '93) when L..D.(etweiler) was provoking the
list with his various "Secret Operations" against the "Big Macs" on the
list, you (Tim) remarked that you half expected to hear one day that he had
been shot and arrested (or was it shot and killed) for his bizarre behavior.

Ironically, I wonder if it will not be yourself, who one day is found under
those circumstances.

(Not that your behavior is bizarre, or anything).
