I used to have procmail shove messages from certain folks directly to
/dev/null, but then wondered a few days ago if I were missing
anything, so they ended up going to $MAILDIR/.in.garbage.  After
looking in there today, I'm glad to say that it's back to /dev/null,
with no regrets.

Of course, with the new moderated list, there shouldn't be too much
work for procmail, except for those folks who I personally feel aren't
worth reading...
