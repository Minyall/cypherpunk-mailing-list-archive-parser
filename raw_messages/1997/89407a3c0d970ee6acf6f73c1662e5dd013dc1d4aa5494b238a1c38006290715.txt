  If the repairman has your pubring and secring files, you can now 
consider them in the same light as a 'busted flush'.
  Chances are, he has neither the capability nor the interest in 
popping open your deep, dark secrets. On the other hand, if he 
returns your computer with a 'shit-eating grin', you may be in for
a world-of-hurt.
  My advice would be for you to check your 'paranoia level' and,
if you are a quart low, then read Phil Zimmerman's PGP documentation
once again, and make your decision based on the reality of the
possibilities involved.
