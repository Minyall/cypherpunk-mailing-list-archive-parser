Don't confuse Lust with Eros.

Lust is the desire for gratification at any cost, including one's own life
(in today's era of AIDS and yesterday's era of Syphillus, which is why it
is listed among the deadly sins).  Lust uses the other person for one's
own pleasure, and if the other is not willing doesn't care.

Eros, which is probably rare today, is the intimate and mutual exchange of
pleasure - the "other" is giving and receiving.  This is what has been
considered the noble form of sex, at least before today's revisionism.

But maybe everyone else on this list considers Lust "noble" and I am
merely old fashioned in believing in intimacy and self-giving and
self-control.  Does everyone believe that it is more noble to take what
you want at this moment than to give of yourself?
