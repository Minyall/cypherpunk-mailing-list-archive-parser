	Not.  Phil Zimmerman is an absolute religous fanatic about backdoors!
When ViaCrypt implimented a commercial escrow feature to give companies the
ability to issues keys where they had a key escrow, he used that as a reason
to break their contract.  He had a "no backdoor" clause in the ViaCrypt
agreement for PGP.  After the US goverment tried to investigate Phil into
bankruptcy for several years, I seriously doubt he would do ANYTHING
to assist them except to assist them into a pit somewhere...
