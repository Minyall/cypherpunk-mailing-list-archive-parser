This one I really don't understand.  Cypherpunks lobbied heavily for
the Final Solution to Spamming and flaming, now along comes the perfect
solution to the airport security problem, and nobody's gonna go for it.

Guess those old, out-of-shape guys don't want anybody laughing at them.
Besides, they can put all the clothes in the same plane's baggage
compartment.  And planes have those little blankets and pillows,
so what's the problem?
