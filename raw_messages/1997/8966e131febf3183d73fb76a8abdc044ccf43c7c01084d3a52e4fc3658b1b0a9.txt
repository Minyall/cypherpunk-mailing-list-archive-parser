Receiving the cash is the hard part. This has been discussed extensively.
You can post to alt.drugs and advertise your wares. You can mail the wares
by simply putting them in random mailboxes. You can even receive the
purchase orders, though this is at present more difficult. What you can't
do is get the money securely. You need two way anonymous ecash for that
purpose. And that doesn't exist yet for all practical purposes. Though I
hear this major obstacle to free enterprise is about to be overcome.
