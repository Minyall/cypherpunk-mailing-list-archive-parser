I agree with your assessment of the interdependence of economic freedom
and personal freedom.  But the Nolan chart itself is not flawed - the
political belief systems that it describes are flawed.  That is, any
political belief system that advocates different levels of governmental
control for the two - that belief system is flawed.

The Nolan chart does a much better job of describing them than the
traditional left-right spectrum does.  Nor have I seen a better
descriptive device.

Incidentally, here is my score:

Your Personal Self-Government Score is 100%. 
Your Economic Self-Government Score is 100%.
