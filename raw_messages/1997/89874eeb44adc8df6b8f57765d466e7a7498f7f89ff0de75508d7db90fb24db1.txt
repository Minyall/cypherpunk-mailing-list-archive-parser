  Well--I could care less about their sexual preference but what
I do care about it proper justice/vengence.  When someone pulls
a users plug for anything short of system cracking they need
to be dealt with in such a way offline that the rest of the would
be censors are afraid to go to bed at night.  

   Quite seriously--and I believe we should move that discussion 
to one of the secure lists and perhaps even raise a bit of money 
to make a very striking example of a plug puller--I personally 
despise them in a manner that cannot even be put into words.
