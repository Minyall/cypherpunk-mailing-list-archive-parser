instead of minute quantities of explosives one could use extremely fine wires
suspended a small distance from the substrate to be destroyed.
Feed a short(below 3 ms) high current pulse(figure a 400w/s photoflash supply)
the wavefront from the exploding wire will be in the supersonic region.
this method may be used in lieu of explosives to achieve the effect of
a high order detonation. gee wonder if the
atf will forbid us capacitors and wires now :)

     cheers
