Passphrases are MD5-hashed into 128-bit IDEA keys and used to
encrypt the secret key; there's a "pgpcrack" program out there
that does dictionary-style searches to find if you've got 
wimpy passphrases.  So if your passphrases is "secret", you lose,
but if it's "fjhw;doifvjuc-[09efiu v` 2	4rnhc;ljoipcvjpoiewujfgv;loik"
you're probably pretty safe, unless that's written on the yellow
sticky you left on the side of the PC.

On the other hand, if the "repairman" replaced your pgp executable
with version 2.6.3kgb, which uses your hashed passphrase as the
session key, you're hosed.  Or if he installed a keystroke sniffer,
or added a small radio transmitter to your keyboard, or whatever.
Depends on your threat model.  If you need to be paranoid,
they've already gotten you....
