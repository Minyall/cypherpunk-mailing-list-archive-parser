 I agree.
 The States should have the right to declare the word "freedom" an
obscenity. The federal government should not.
 The States should have the right to legalize rape. The federal
government should not.
 The States should have the right to require the citizens to commit
suicide at the age of 40. The federal government should not.

  I'm glad that I could clear this up for everyone. No need to thank me.
