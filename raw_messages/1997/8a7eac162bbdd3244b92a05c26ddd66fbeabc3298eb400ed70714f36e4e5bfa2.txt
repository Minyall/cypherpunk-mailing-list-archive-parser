>From News of the Weird:

* In July, the Nova Scotia Gaming Control Commission formally
banned the popular charity fundraiser, "cow-patty bingo," in which
a promoter marks a field into squares, takes bets, and then releases
a recently-fed cow to "select" a winning square.  The Commission
believed the game could be rigged by training a cow to use a
particular spot in the field.  The next day, incoming Nova Scotia
Premier Russell MacLellan said the ban could be ignored.  That
same week, the district attorney's office in Santa Clara County 
announced that a similar fundraiser for the imminent Gilroy, Calif.,
garlic festival, based on the famous Clydesdale horses' two-mile
march through town, could not be held because it violated the state
gambling law.
