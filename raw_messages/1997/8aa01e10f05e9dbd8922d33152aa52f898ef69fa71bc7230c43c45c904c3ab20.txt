This is only a practical problem related to PGP's lack of popularity.
The proposed solution will work in the long run, assuming PGP achieves
great popularity.  Thus, education of the public concerning PGP and remailers
will help make this solution more effective.

Of course, interim short term solutions should be sought as well.

Information explaining blocking could be sent with each piece of mail from
a remailer.  Alternatively, to conserve bandwidth, a pointer to a web-page
could be attached.

A web page could be dedicated to propagating multiple block requests, in
the manner of those extant sites which propogate new web-page information 
to search engines.  This could also be made easy, intuitive, and mostly 
transparent to the end user.
