In common enviroments smartcards are used for the example above. Those
smartcards can be only obtained by TTPs, which generate the key pair and
press the secret part on the card. In several countries these TTP are
required to store these private keys for gouvernmental access.

Shure, it's constitutional. You will need a court order to read a special
message with the revealed secret key.

It does not harm, that policy may able to read all previous messages, if
they are stored, because this can't happen. The police is forbitten to do so.
