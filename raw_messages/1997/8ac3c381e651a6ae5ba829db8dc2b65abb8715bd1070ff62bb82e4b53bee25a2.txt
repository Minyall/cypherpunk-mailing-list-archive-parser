While this is certainly true for remailers at the present, it is not true
for businesses in general.  Most of the stores I deal with locally will
accept cash, checks or credit cards.  The interface (and accounting) for
these is quite different.  (E.g there is no online check for cash, like
there is for credit cards, and sometimes checks.)
