Jonathan Littman's book on Kevin Poulsen, "The Watchman : The Twisted
Life and Crimes of Serial Hacker Kevin Poulsen" is coming out this month, 
so I checked into Amazon (http://www.amazon.com) to see if it had been 
released yet.  It has an interesting blurb for the book:

Synopsis:
Drawing on exclusive interviews with serial killer Kevin Poulsen, who's
                                            ^^^^^^
currently serving time in federal prison, journalist Jonathan Littman
takes readers along on the wildest, most colorful crime spree in the
annals of cyberspace...

Yikes!  Seems this book will have more revelations than I had previously
