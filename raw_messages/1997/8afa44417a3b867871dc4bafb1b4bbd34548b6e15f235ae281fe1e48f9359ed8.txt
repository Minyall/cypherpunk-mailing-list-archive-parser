Greetings!

DESCHALL Version 0.214 is now available in the US and Canada.
DESCHALL is a client-server based approach to cracking the RSA
DES Challenge.

Information about DESCHALL is available at the following Web site:

     http://www.frii.com/~rcv/deschall.htm

As indicated in the above Web page, Michael Paul Johnson has
graciously agreed to distribute DESCHALL from his export-controlled
North American Crypto Site.  [Thanks, MPJ!]

At the present time, the server is running at about 2% of capacity.
The server can handle a *whole lot* more clients.

Clients are available for Linux, FreeBSD, OS/2, Windows 95/NT,
and Sparc.  [Offers for guest accounts to compile other clients
gladly accepted!]

Pentium 120MHz clients can test about 600,000 keys per second.

Good luck!
