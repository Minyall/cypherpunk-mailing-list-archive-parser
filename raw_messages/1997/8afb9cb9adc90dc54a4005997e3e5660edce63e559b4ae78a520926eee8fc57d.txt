  I have subscribed to Igor's cypherpunks@algebra.com.
  Jim Choate and Lance Cottrel (?) are participating with Igor and
others in maintaining continuity of the list, to my understanding.
  They all seem to be moving toward maintaining a distributed list
which will ensure both continuity and integrity. I would suggest 
joining one or the other list and then, once the 'dust' has 
settled, taking steps to verify that whatever list you are 
subscribed to is operating in such a way as to ensure that there
are no shenanigans going on in the background.
  I, for one, am content to give the new list distributors the 
benefit of the doubt if there are anomalies in the new system,
given the haste in which they must initiate a new distributed
mailing list system.
  On the other hand, they may all be godless communists, seeking
to twist our fragile minds to do their bidding. (Much like myself)
