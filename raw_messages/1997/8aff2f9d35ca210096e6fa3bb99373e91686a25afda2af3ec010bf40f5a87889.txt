There may be a problem whish is that the bettors like yourself may be
held liable for any damages to Platt and his property. The lawyers on
this list can have more to say on that.

If there is presently no law covering that (likely there are) it is not
hard to come up with one, I believe.

Without anonymity it will not work very well. After all, if you announce
that you pay a prize to have someone murdered, your potential victim
will be able to murder you even earlier. Anonymity is crucial here.

They may withhold the tax at the time of payment. It does not matter
anyways since it is a payment from the government. If they do not collect
taxes from payments to stukachi, they can simply reduce the payment amounts
proportionally.

Notorious stukach Colin James III knows better anyways. Ask him.
