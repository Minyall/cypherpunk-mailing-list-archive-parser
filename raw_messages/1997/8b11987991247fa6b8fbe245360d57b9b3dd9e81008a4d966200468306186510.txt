     ELIZABETHTOWN, Pennsylvania (AP) -- Armed FBI trainees in
     bulletproof vests and camouflage surrounded a group of teen-agers,
     handcuffed them and forced them to the ground before realizing they
     had the wrong people.
     
     The trainees were taking part in a training exercise at a town
     square Wednesday night in which they were apparently supposed to
     nab others taking part in the drill.
     
     Instead, up to 30 FBI trainees jumped out of a caravan of vehicles
     and descended on the innocent teen-agers, bound their wrists with
     plastic ties and ordered them to lie face-down on the sidewalk.
     
     After about 30 minutes, the agents set the teens free.
     
     The FBI would not comment on the specifics of the drill, but an FBI
     official apologized Friday and two agents visited the home of one
     of the youths Thursday night to express their regrets.
