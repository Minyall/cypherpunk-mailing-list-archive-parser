Actualy it was a man, his wife, and two children. The two kids were playing
with it when it went off. My memory tells me that the women and two kids
were killed. Don't remember if she was a teacher or not. There was an

Actualy most of them were released from the Japanese mainland at specific

ballast sand in the balloons (mechanicly complicated) to track their source.
All the sites were bombed and the baloons ceased.
