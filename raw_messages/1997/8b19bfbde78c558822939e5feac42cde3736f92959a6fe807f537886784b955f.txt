Can anyone point me to some good documentation on elliptic curves as 
applies to cryptography? I'm interested in finding some good 
documentation from which I would be able to learn how to use elliptic 
curves in creating a public/private key system. I have mainly been 
studying symmetric systems and would like to move on to asymmetric 
systems. Any help would be appreciated.
