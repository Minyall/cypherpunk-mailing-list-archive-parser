Michael,

You need to realize that Cypherpunks transitionally has been about the *elimination* of all governments. Cypherpunks' goal is called crypto-anarchy for a reason. In fact, for Cypherpunks cryptography is simply an exceptionally effective tool to achieve anarchy. The governments share the belief that wide spread use of crypto will possibly lead to anarchy, which is why they attempt to limit its use. The rest is smoke and mirrors and statements by people that fail to understand that the whole crypto issue is about anarchy and not about math.

Anarchy can not be achieved by negotiations or cooperation with any branch of government. Neither can crypto-anarchy be achieved by nuking DC.

I certainly can understand the reasons that would lead a person to start
thinking that "something is better than nothing" or "the bastards need to receive the punishment they so richly deserve". Neither view will help to further crypto-anarchy in any meaningful way.

Have fun,
