   So, if I put root@127.0.0.1 in the "From:" field of my news reader's
   configuration, all of my posts will give this as my e-mail address. 

More likely to be delivered is root@[127.0.0.1] or
root@localhost.nceye.net or similar.  The thing to the right has to be
a name or a numeric address *in brackets*.  Yes, this doesn't seem to
make terribly much sense.  Another approach if you can do it is to get
an alias that looks like a message-ID.  All my outgoing usenet posts
lately have said
From: Bryan Reece <23je8s$ksd@taz.nceye.net> 
at the top, and no spam has come to that address.
