I've been using 4.5 since it was in Beta and I paid the $29.95 to upgrade to 
it when they started charging (they have you cut and paste your public key 
into the form to prove you are upgrading from a free version of PGP).

I downloaded 5.0 a day or two ago and have been using it.  It is possible to 
use both on the same machine although you have to watch your key location.

I Use Windows 95.  

Installation of PGP for Personal Privacy 5.0 went OK.  Unless you have the 
latest Beta of Eudora (3.0.2 B4) it installs the files necessary to upgrade 
your version of Eudora.  Unfortunately, 3.0.2 B4 expires in June so you'll  
have to continue upgrading.   My only problem was that when I had the program 
move and rename my key rings, I forgot which key file I was pointing to and 
made my secret ring my public ring for a few minutes until I reinstalled.  The 


program puts its menu into the "tray".  Its menu is shorter than the PGP Mail 
4.5 menu because the key handling is done from the PGPkeys program.  It 
displays a graphic key list and you can point and click and drag and drop to 
perform most key management tasks.

The new features are 1) automatic lookup of keys from the keyserver of your 
choice (defaults to PGP Incs keyserver).  2) automatic signing (or even 
encryption) of outgoing mail.  You click <Queue> in Eudora and it prompts you 
for your passphrase.  3) Use of ElGamal (DSS/Diffie-Hellman) instead of RSA 
for your key if you like.  4) Use of PGP/Mime for outgoing messages if you 
like.  5) it will cache you private key in memory for a user configurable 
length of time (default is 120 seconds) so that you can easily encrypt 
multiple messages.

It has worked fine so far.  Digital signing and encryption seem faster than 
with 4.5.
