It should support pretty much anything.  Just treat eternity documents
like standard web documents...  Anything you can do in a web document
you can do in a web document stored in eternity.  (Except, eternity
doesn't host your cgi's for you :-)

If you want a .zip file, well link to it like this:

	pgp50i.zip 

if you want to reference it in an eternity document.  Submit the .zip
file the same way you would a .html file or .gif file.

(Eternity supports relative, site relative and absolute URLs).

You could also use the url for the zip file directly:

	http://pgp.eternity/pgp50i.zip

Or use lynx to download it:

	lynx -dump http://www.replay.com/aba/cgi-bin/eternity.cgi?url=http://pgp.eternity/pgp50i.zip > pgp50i.zip

Or whatever.

However pgp50i isn't censored outside the US, so why not just download
it from Stale's site in Norway?

(You could view the ITAR/EAR restrictions as censorship of those
wishing to publish pgp inside the US... but the simple solution is
jurisdiction shopping... anywhere but the US, Iraq, etc).
