That's a good feature.  Other than raw e-cash, Alice could be sending out
messages like "Here's a random token: return this token to redeem your
cash". Also instead of general-purpose cash, Alice could be sending out
soft tokens only usable at her site: mention Alice's 900 number, receive
an e-mail with a secret code that allows you to FTP a single x-rated
picture from Alice's Web site.
