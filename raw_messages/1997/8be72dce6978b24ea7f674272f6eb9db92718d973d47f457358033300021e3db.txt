Arrrgh!  No!  If you read the early references, it's clearly a stream cypher, 
and used as such.  The same bitstream is generated at both ends.
Pretending it's a True Random One-Time Pad would be snake oil, 
but that's your mistake, not Nobuku's or Gao's.
It's true that keys cannot be reused, but that's the same for RC4.

And one more non-truly-random way of doing it just puts more snake oil on
the shelf.
If there are any bytes that are correlated and not independent, it's Bad Pad.

Crypto mathematics is always interesting, if written well,
and if it's the first time you've seen something rather than Yet Another
LCM PRNG.
