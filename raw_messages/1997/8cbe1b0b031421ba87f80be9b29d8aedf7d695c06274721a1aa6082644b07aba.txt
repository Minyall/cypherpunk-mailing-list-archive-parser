	Crap. The kind of crime that guns stop isn't the kind solved with 
"better social conditions". Rape has nothing to do with how much money _either_
person makes. Muder rarely does. If you can't see this, then you have your
head firmly up your governments ass.

	Stop and take a hard look at who kills who with guns and why.
