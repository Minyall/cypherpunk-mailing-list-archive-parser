The story about Stronghold security flaws reminds me of The Right Reverend
Colin James III (puke). CJ3 also started his kook career when he was 
accused of being stupid and not knowing what he was talking about in
his announcement about performance of BSAM, his "invention". He immediately
reacted to the accusers and promised to sue them, their employers, their
providers, the Inspector General, and more.

He really went after his enemies, trying to get them fired, etc. As a
result of his long struggles, most enlightened minds on USENET realized
that he was an excellent candidate for Kook of the Month award. A nomination
followed.

When he was elected Kook of the Month last January with a
record-breaking vote, he threatened to sue anyone who mentions his new
Kook status. That only added fuel to the fire, as more and more posters
"dared" to expose him as a lying forger and kook.
