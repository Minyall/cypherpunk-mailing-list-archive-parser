  Yes, this is apparently how it happened. The robber tortured him for
the PIN, used the card to get $800 from a machine and then returned to
stab and shoot him. Apparently the murderer is one of his students (he
was a teacher in NY I believe). This happened after Levin asked the
class to write their biographies and revealed who his father was.

  I don't think there is any strategy in being robbed, only survuval.
Levin commited a grave mistake. Revealing his background to his class
was a very stupid move.
