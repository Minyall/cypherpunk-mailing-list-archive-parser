Lets not be throwing nationalistic stones here as your country has plenty
of dirty laundry too.

Here we have what is know as "property rights". The owner of property is
the one who determines how it will be used. It is really quite simple and
quite basic. Now I know that some of our socialist friends here and abroad
think that through the power of the STATE they have a right to tell others
how to live there lives this bankrupt philosophy has been rejected by most
on this list.
