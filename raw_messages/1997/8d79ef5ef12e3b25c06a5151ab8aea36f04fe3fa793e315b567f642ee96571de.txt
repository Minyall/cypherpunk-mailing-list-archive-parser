Why should the state be in the business of hauling away trash anyway?

I can sort of see why the state might insist that you don't pile your
trash where it smells and bothers the neighbors, and let the people find
their own ways of disposing of their garbage - presumably hiring one of
several competing private garbage hauling companies, any one of whom will
perform better service for less money than the state.

And if a homeowner decides to switch garbage collectors because he doesn't
like what his present garbage collector says in print (or on Usenet), that
should be pretty painless for him and not a 1st amendment issue.

Lock and load (or load and lock if you happen to carry an AK-47)
Did you know that AK stands for Avtomat Kalashnikova?
