Just a reference to your more than usually histrionic posts of recent 
days.  Some quotes:

"May they all be vaporized."

"Chiles and his co-conspirators should be shot for high crimes against the
Constitution. After Clinton, Freeh, Kerrey, and the other traitors."

"Every day that passes, I'm more convinced that McVeigh did the right thing.
Some innocents died, but, hey, war is hell. Broken eggs and all that."

"Many of us believe crypto anarchy will win out, and governments will be
undermined in various ways (including forcibly, using the new degrees of
freedom to deploy destructive technologies...hence my "avoid soft targets"
line)."

I'm sure someone who was more alert than I am could find many similar 
examples. 

I would expect a "cypherpunk riot" to be a little more aimed at 
cyberspace than real-world suburban neighborhoods.  Wouldn't you?
