 ... oh, I well know the answer to the question ... just waxing a
little bit rhetorical ... I would seriously like to be there to look
into they eyes of the yahoos who so bithely espouse dropping the
hammer on a person right after they have watched the life drain from
someones eyes the for very first time and see just how well they feel
and how cocky and cavalier they still are. I wouldn't wish that burden
on anyone. You just can have no idea unless you have been there. We
send men off to war and then get all upset when so many come back with
there brains on crooked ... the sheeple have no idea what they have
done to these men (and now women) !!!
