I just react to issues I think are important, or which seem
interesting to me, same as anyone else.  I happen to think this CMR
issue is important.

If you disagree, and think the CMR danger is over-rated, well speak up
please!

If you think I am a big mouth speak up too (as you have:-)

Well there is always a `d' key, or one of your nifty O/S2 spam
filters.

Also I would be interested in your personal views as a PGP compatible
mail script implementor on how easy CDR is to implement
(http://www.dcs.ex.ac.uk/~aba/cdr/) with your setup.  Some people are
objecting to the difficulty of implementing it.  I think it is fairly
easy.
