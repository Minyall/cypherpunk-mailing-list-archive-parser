The idea behind escrow in a company is to let each employee have their own 
key (and secret key/pass-phrase) so that they can digitally sign e-mails, and 
send encrypted e-mail, but with the escrow to let other people access this 
mail.  This is not any more surveilance than already exists in a corporate 
environment, and I believe it's main purpose is *not* inside the corporation, 
but for secure communications with people in other companies, typically 
partners, suppliers, clients, etc.

I can't see a problem with it in this situation.

Oh, and one of the bills in Congress seemed to prohibit the US Government 
from using escrow in this way in government agencies.  I can't see a 
justification for this.  [Other than normal FOI reasons.]  Think military 
communicating with weapons contractors if you need an excuse for this kind of 
encryption in the first place.
