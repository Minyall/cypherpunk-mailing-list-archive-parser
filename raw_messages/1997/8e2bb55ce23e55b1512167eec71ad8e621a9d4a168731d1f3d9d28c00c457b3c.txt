	Are FAT file lists stored as files?

	On a Unix box, /. refers to the file containing directory
entries, the list of files in the directory.  If there is an analogous
file on a dos box, you can explore.  (Does the bug work on Unix?  I've
heard it only works if java or livescript are turned on, so it hasn't
worried me enough to investigate.)
