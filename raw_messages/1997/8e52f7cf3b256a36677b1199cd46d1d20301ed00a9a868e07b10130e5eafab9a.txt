He was also the main spokeman behind the "TWA800 Was Blown Up By Terrorists,
So Turn In All Your Civil Liberties" campaign.  Now that it's been
fairly conclusively demonstrated that it was a mechanical failure,
it's nice to see him getting the boot.  Hope they make him show
ID before letting him out the revolving door.
