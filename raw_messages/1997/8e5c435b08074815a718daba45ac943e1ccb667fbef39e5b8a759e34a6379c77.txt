Correcting is not an insult.  His statement was incorrect or
incomplete.  I corrected it.  His comment was on topic, though
in error.  My correction was on topic.  He was not "silenced" in
any way.  Toto's proposition, therefore, does not make sense to me.

Contrary to several peoples erroneous assumptions, there will be
no flaming--of anyone--on the moderated list.  When moderation is
under weigh, I will do nothing to restrain flaming on the flame
and unedited lists.  Toto's prejudice (in the literal sense of the
word, i.e., "to pre-judge") is showing.
