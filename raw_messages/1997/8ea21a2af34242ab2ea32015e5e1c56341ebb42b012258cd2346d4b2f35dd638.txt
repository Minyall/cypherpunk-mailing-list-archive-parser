Actually remailers were invented by a lass called Stephi whose hobbies
appeared to include being tied up for fun. The original remailer
operating out of wizvax was a script that allowed anonymous posts
into alt.sex.bondage. Then it was expanded to support a couple of 
other newsgroups such as alt.abuse. When Stephi ran out of cash to
keep wizvax running (I have a suspicion it was something expensive
power wise) Julf took over the code and the scripts.

I'll accept that the ranting faction do some good work but I've 
not seen anything usefull out of either Bell or Vulis unless that
is you are an FBI agent looking to get a promotion from Freeh.
