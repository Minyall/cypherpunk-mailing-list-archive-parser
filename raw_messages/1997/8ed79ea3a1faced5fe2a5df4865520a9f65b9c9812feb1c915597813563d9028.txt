	But it could - it's simple firewall technology.  There's no MX
record for sten.tivoli.com, but any incoming email to me is
intercepted by proxy.tivoli.com, as is all other incoming traffic to
the internal tivoli.com network on port 25.  Since 'incoming' is only
a matter of definition, it would be trivial for an ISP to set up a
firewall that passed all other ports through transparently, but
redirected connections with a destination of port 25 to their own SMTP
server.

	I don't want them to, and I _certainly_ don't want the
government goons requiring ISPs to do this, but don't sit back and
relax with the notion that 'it can't be done'.
