 Antibiotics are for fighting bacterial infections.

 Antibiotics have no effect on viruses at all.

 However you are accurate in that the abuse of antibiotics for
things like colds (a virus, no effect) has led us to a very
dangerous situation. (antibiotic resistant bacteria)

I suggest the book "The Coming Plague"  who's authors name escapes
me at the moment, if you, or anyone else is interested.
