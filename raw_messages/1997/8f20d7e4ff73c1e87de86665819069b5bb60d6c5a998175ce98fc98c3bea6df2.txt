The rationale involves a lot more than just the _government_ doing this. If
patents are to make any sense at all, then there cannot be a continuing
series of "disclosures" of private diaries, private letters, lab notebooks,
and other items unavailable for public examination at the time the patent
was granted.

(I'm not defending patents. I believe they've outlived their usefullness.
And technology has made them easy to evade. Etc. Another topic.)

"Submarine" patents are especially odious. (Where applicants keep amending
their claims to cover new developments, all in secret. This was how the
_alleged_ "inventor of the microprocessor" was able to amend his
application for almost 20 years before the Patent Office in their ignorance
granted him a patent!)

The forgery issue (e.g., people backdating reports or modifying old papers)
is of course solvable with digital time-stamping services, though the
"brilliant penny scam" remains a concern.

(BPS--register or time-stamp N variants of some idea, and then only reveal
the particular variant one wishes, showing one to have invented something,
or predicted the future, etc. When it costs little or nothing to
register/stamp some instance, the BPS must always be a concern.)
