Lucky, did you actually read anything I wrote, or is this merely another
knee-jerk response?

If you can explain the following, then I'll accept that my fears are merely
fantasies:

1. How PGP can prevent CMR being converted into GMR; their system builds
   all the code required to support mandatory encryption to FBI and NSA
   keys into every copy of PGP.
2. Why PGP prefer this option to almost identical systems which do not
   allow GMR. They don't even seem to be interested in discussing
   alternatives.

These are the important questions we should be asking and noone on the
pro-PGP side seems interested in answering them. Why?

Frankly, this issue seems to be the most important since Clipper, and I'm
amazed that so many cypherpunks are so dazzled by PGP's name that they
refuse to sit and think these issues through. 

    Mark
