Sure, these are all possible protocol failures. (Likewise, one could use
the number but not destroy the bill and instead pass it on, thus producing
collisions.)

Assuming the bill is not a forgery...not terribly hard to confirm,
especially if given the time likely to plan for execution of the
protocol--and assuming one follows the protocol....

(Note: costs of forgery are real. Fibers in the paper, the paper itself,
etc. I doubt it would be economical for a forger to enter the dollar bill
market. Maybe specifically to spoof the protocol, but that is guarded
against in the expected ways, e.g., by picking from a large pool of bills
at, say, a flea market or other business, by choosing a well-worn bill,
etc. Neither information-theoretically nor cryptographically secure, to be
sure, but "agorically secure," to coin a phrase.)

Don't know.

But certainly a dollar bill burned up as part of this protocol is unknown
to them, and would of course never be reprinted (print runs are obviously
done in large batches, with auto-indexing of numbers across sheets, so
"one-offs" would never be done anyway).
