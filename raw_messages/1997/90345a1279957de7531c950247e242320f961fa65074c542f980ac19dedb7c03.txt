The axe of censorship strikes again, this time against a gay-positive
teen site.  Moral alarmists screeched that depictions of kids
embracing each other and kissing were "sexually suggestive."
 
Can't have that, can we?
 
The Seattle Times crows over the site's disappearance and praises
efforts to prevent sex education from crossing over into "sex
promotion."
 
Woo Hoo!

Sounds like a mirroring opportunity. :)
