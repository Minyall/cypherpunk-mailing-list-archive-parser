  True. Perhaps I should have said "freely available, but it might
cost you more than you expect."

  The average joe is quickly becoming aware of the issue of data
security (and therefore being exposed to the 'concept' of 
encryption as something that will impact his life). Of course,
this is coming about as a result of commercial pressures to make
him feel safe about handing over his Visa number, etc.
  To me, this indicates that this is the opportune time to inject
a deeper level of understanding into the issue of crypto, at a
time when the average joe has his attention directed toward the
crypto arena.
