Thanks to Adam Back and Ross Anderson the full Zergo 
Report on encryption use by the NHSnet is online at:

   http://www.dcs.ex.ac.uk/~aba/ukcrypto/zergo.html  (139K)

There may be action by HMG to prohibit publication in the
UK (and maybe elsewhere) so we've mirrored it at:

   http://jya.com/zergo-aba.htm

Other mirrors encouraged.
