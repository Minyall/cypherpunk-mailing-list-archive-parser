  Perhaps a variation on the 'Parker Plan' might work.

The Date: Mid 1980's
The Situation: Sitting in the hills of Humboldt County, Ca. guarding the
  'patch'. Relaxing on the half-moon commode when there comes the sound
  of CAMP (Campaign Against Marihuana Production) vehicles and
helicopters
  coming over the hill.
The Solution: Put on shades and baseball cap, tuck .45 in belt, join the
  'crew' as they march toward the shack, kick the door in, grab the TV
  and a chainsaw, go outside and throw them into one of the vehicles,
  wave to the 'guys', saying, "You guys get the pot, and I'll meet you
  back in town."
