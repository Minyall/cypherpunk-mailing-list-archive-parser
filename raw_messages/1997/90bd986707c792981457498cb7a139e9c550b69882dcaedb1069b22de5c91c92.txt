You aren't being oppressed the other party doesn't want to interact
with you, unless that party is government providing base services to all
(e.g. police/courts/border protection).

You *are* being oppressed if mutually consensual behavior is interfered
with by
others including the State.

You *are* being oppressed if you are coerced into a relationship you don't
want.

An employer-employee relationship is like a marriage or any other arrangement
between adults -mutually consensual.  Colin, do you consider
yourself oppressed when someone choses not to date you?  What about
a rejection by someone who takes out a public advertisement in the paper?

Freedom is only tested when it hurts.
