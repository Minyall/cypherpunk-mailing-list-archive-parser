An OLE extension to visual basic, providing elliptic curve
cryptographic operations and true random numbers.

This was written for my own purposes. I wrote it because 
visual basic is the by far the fastest way of creating a 
certain kind of program with a reasonably acceptable user 
interface. However I believe it will be generally useful 
to anyone who wishes to create a cryptographic program that
manages a database, or who merely wants to get a cryptographic 
program with an attractive user interface up quickly.
