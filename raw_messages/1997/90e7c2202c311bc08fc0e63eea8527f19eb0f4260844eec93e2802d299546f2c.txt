Here's one.  Ian Goldberg and I wrote a Dr. Dobb's Journal article on
Netscape's insecure random number generation.  It contained a few short
snippets of code that described how Netsape's PRNG seeding process
worked.  I believe that they may fall under the category of 'cryptographic
source code'.  And...guess what... DDJ in fact published the article
online at

Here's a citation:

Ian Goldberg and David Wagner.  "Randomness and the Netscape Browser".
Dr. Dobb's Journal, January 1996.
