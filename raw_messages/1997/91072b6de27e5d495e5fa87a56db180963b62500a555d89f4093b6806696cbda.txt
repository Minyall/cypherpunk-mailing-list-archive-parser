Well, no, not really.  See, the way PGP handles keys (at least the RSA
keys) makes it very difficult to remove an id once it's hit a keyserver.

Oh yeah, a signature also encompasses the key-id that you sign when you
sign the key.  So the signatures would fail if the key-id they referred to
was drastically changed...
