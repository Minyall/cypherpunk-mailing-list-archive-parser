The method for accessing my strong crypto library ftp site has
changed to one that I hope is easier for those of you who are in
the USA or Canada.  Simply point your browser to
http://www.sni.net/~mpj/usa/warning.htm and follow the
instructions. This should work even with text-based browsers,
like lynx, and should be easier to navigate for AOL customers.

You may be amused that the President of the United States has
determined that cryptographic software export controls are
necessary for U. S. "National Security" even though the same
software is available "or appears to be available" from outside
of the USA. For a partial list of cryptographic software sites
outside of North America, see
http://www.sni.net/~mpj/freecryp.htm
