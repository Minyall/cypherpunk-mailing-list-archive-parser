I've not been long enough on this list for what ? Don't know about you,
but imvho violence is not a right solution. I will never be long enough on
this list to change my mind on that.

I must admit that it has helped quite a lot, those bombs. Expecially for
the building sector.

How much must you hate someone to wish him/her dead ? Have you ever been
'contronted' with dead, Paul ? Someone of your friends, relatives, ... who
died, perhaps ? How can you wish some other human being the same ? 
What if the IRA would blow up the queen ? I guess Charles is the next to
step on then ? What a progress !!

Havalook at Kongo: Mobutu has gone. Much better now ! After several
thousands were killed, the new president gives his first orders: "women
should not wear tight shirts anymore (I thought they were supposed to take
them off, but...) nor should they act in a sensual way.

Right, violence is at least A solution. But for what ?
BTW, I'd be very interested if you would care telling something more about
Northern Ireland. That's where you live I guess ? Are you "Catholic" or
"Protestant" ?
