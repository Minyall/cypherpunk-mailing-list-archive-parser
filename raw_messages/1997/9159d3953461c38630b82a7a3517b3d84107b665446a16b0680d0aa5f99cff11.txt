It dawns on me the the use of "Center", and "Democracy", in the same breath
is either redundant or an oxymoron (depending upon your politics :-)) and,
when used to in reference to "Technology", they *really* don't make sense,
in much the same way that "<ethnic>/<gender> physics" is nonsense.

Write software, not laws.

Cheers,
