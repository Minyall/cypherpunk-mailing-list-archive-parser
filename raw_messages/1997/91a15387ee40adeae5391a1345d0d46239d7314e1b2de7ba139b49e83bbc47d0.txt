I just heard on the news that Bill Clinton has been selling the right
to be buried in Arlington National Cemetery (and possibly other
military cemeteries) to campaign contributors.  The story originally
broke in the latest edition of Insight magazine yesterday.  I think
our Maximum Leader has stooped to a new level of sleaze, and deserves
the revulsion of veterans everywhere.
