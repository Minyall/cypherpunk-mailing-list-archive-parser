The Oakland federal building is anything but a soft target. It is a
relatively new builing that was designed from the gound up with blast
control in mind. Tapered twin towers, glass roofs build to release
excess internal pressure, ample free space around the towers, five story
buffer buildings containg only non-essential human shield services
(public post office, childcare center) along the critical sides. Excellent
design.
