This could be the result of a phase-shift brought on by tachyon emissions
generated during the 3-day holiday weekend, creating a distortion in the
space-time continuum.  It likely requires an inspection of the casing for
the dilithium crystals, with potentially a re-engineering of the temporal
warp drive to adjust for wavelet radiations.
