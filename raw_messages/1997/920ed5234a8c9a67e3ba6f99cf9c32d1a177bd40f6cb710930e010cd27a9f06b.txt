Is anyone coordinating (formally or informally) which chunks of the
keyspace has been searched for the DES challenge?  Yes, I know all the
arguments about potential fraud and verification, but it would be nice to
have a Web site that informally listed what had been scanned so far
(verified or not).

Did I perhaps miss something and this is already out there?  URLs
appreciated if so.  If it doesn't exist, I'd be willing to host a site and
play coordinator...
