Linear Shift Feedback Registers. If you haven`t heard of this common type 
of RNG you don`t seem to have much cryptographic experience.

AOL is not a crypto company, what dozen others? Anyone serious, eg. RSA, 
Netscape, any other serious crypto company.

Corporate Message Recovery, Linear Shift Feedback Register (I used the 
wrong acronym, I should have said LSFR, my appologies).

I flame you because I get tired of seeing snake-oil peddlers who won`t 
listen. If you come to a list with a serious proposal, present your 
scheme and say "here it is, do your best" people will take you seriously, 
you will be flamed if you constantly persist in saying your product is 
unbreakable. The crypto community is highly receptive to beginners but 
not to snake-oil merchants.
