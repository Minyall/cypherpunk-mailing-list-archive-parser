This is an excellent question, Hal.  I've been thinking about it 
since I saw a similar post of yours earlier today.

In the case where the problem of nymity is that one actor can later
prove the fact of the transaction, and this is a cost, I can see 
how the option of anonymity could make a cheaper transaction 
possible.  However, I think that this is _not_ the case that Robert
Hettinga is interested in.  I think the case that Bob is talking 
about is when the cost is the possibility of incurring legal 
liability from the transaction.


So it is true that _if_ the transactions were unconditionally 
anonymous, _then_ you would not have the costs of legal liability,
but it does not follow that anonymity is the _only_ way to avoid 
the cost.


Frankly, I think the best way to avoid that cost in the forseeable
future is the time-tested method of saying "I make no warranties, 
etc. etc. and incur no contractual obligation blah blah and so 
forth.", as part of your deal.


I think this can be accomplished done without using any 
cryptographic technique more complicated than simple 
authentication.
