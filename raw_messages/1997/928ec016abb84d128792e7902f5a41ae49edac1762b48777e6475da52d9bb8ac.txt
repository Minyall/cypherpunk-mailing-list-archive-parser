No it is not!

S/MIME specs require support for weak RC2/40 encryption. This is not
secure!!! Add to this the fact that to date no S/MIME vendor has ever
released their crypto source code. I for one would not trust Net$cape or
Micro$oft to secure an outhouse let alone my communications. They have
shown their incompentence in this area time and time again.

Weak Crypto = No Security
No Source   = No Security
