Hi,

It has been asserted by at least one member that the 1st Amendment protects
libelous or other defamatory speech. 

This is hokem. The 1st most certainly does not protect lies in any form. It
protects opinion, this is distinctly different then stating a untruth about
some party or distribution of material with the attributation to them
without their permission.

No civilized society can exist that permits lies and other defamations of
character and expect to survive for any length of time. Simply for no other
reason than contracts and other such instruments would not be worth the
paper they were printed on. Let alone any laws or other issuances from the
government itself.


				ARTICLE I. 
 
	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, 
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of 
speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, 
and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. 
 
 
Where in there do you see a right to lie, cheat, or steal? If it did, it
would be a lie because it would not protect the very freedom it says it is.
