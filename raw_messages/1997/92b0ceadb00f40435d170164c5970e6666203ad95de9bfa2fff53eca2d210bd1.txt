It's always sad to see another sometimes-reasonable (though sometimes
foaming) writer go down the Detweiler-Vulis route, e.g., by making his
arguments hinge on calling me "Timmy" (what _is_ it with this nickname that
makes it so damned attractive to Vulis, Vlad, and Attila?).

Actually, the war you apparently fought in was of course a total waste.
This is too well known to repeat here.

Making rhetorical arguments hinge on the notion that you fought in some
god-forsaken war in the middle of nowhere is absurd. You were just cannon
fodder, a pawn in the geopolitical chess game, a means of enhancing certain
political careers...though you ultimately let them down, as LBJ chose to
bow out, and Nixon resigned. You were playing your role, Attila!

As for my "elitism," I've never presented myself in any other fashion. I've
discussed this issue many times. Get used to it, or ignore it, or just keep
foaming at the mouth and ranting about how I need to take "yellow pills" to
avoid being an ally of "Bubba."
