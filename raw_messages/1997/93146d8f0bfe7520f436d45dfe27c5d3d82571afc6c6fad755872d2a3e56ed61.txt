Two questions:

One, do the crypto-queers Gilmore and Inman suck each other's cocks?

Two, why did the above-quoted message appear on "moderated" cypherpunks?
(That's a rhetorical question: clearly Gilmore's moderation encourages
personal attacks on Gilmore's "enemies" like myself and Dr.Grubor, while
responses to these attacks are suppressed.)
