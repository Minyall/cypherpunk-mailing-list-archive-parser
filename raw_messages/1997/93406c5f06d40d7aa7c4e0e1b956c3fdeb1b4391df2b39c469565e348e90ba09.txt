I won't be censoring anyone.  I will, however, be sorting posts 
into the three lists.  As I work my way into moderation mode, I
don't expect to sort math or other off-topic posts into the flam
(flames & spam) list.  In retrospect, the previous "creeps" 
comment should probably have gotten the post sorted to the flam
list.  Oh well, I'll get up to speed pretty soon, I hope.
