  i haven't touched unix or linux in a long time, but i submit that
your ordinary GS-4 secretary can deal with microsoft word a lot more
efficiently than s/he can deal with vi/emacs/latex.  i assume there are
better tools available on *ix platforms these days, which actually
destroys my argument:

  do you really want the government to be more efficient?  :-)


peace,
