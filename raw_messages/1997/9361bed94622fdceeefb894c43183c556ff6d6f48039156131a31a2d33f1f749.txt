The original posting was right on target for the cypherpunks list.

Levien ... Raph Levien.  

The list of operating status of current remailers
is at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~raph/remailer-list.html .
The Mixmaster remailer list is at
http://www.obscura.com/~loki/remailer/mixmaster-faq.html.
Some more good places to look are the cypherpunks archives at
http://infinity.nus.sg/cypherpunks/	(raw mailing list traffic ...)
and http://www.oberlin.edu/~brchkind/cyphernomicon/
 ( Tim May's Cyphernomicon (a bit old, so there's been more remailer
work done since then, but it's very good about a lot of subjects.)

There are probably some other good remailer archives.

Also, as with many things, AltaVista can tell you lots about remailers.
Not in any particular order, but lots :-)

I haven't updated my pages on www.idiom.com/~wcs/remailer in a year or so,
but it was a good rant for the times; I ran a remailer for a while before
it got SPAMMED to death.
