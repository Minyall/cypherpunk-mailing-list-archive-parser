I don't need the lecture. I've made the argument better than
you have and I've made it longer than you have. I don't recall
you protesting the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (1984),
working on the RTM case (a CFAA prosecution in 1988). You
weren't involved in the FOIA case for 2600.

Great plan. I'll watch TV and let Congress pass a bill
requiring mandatory identification for Internet users.
Really clever.

This is getting tiring. Who do you think first opposed the proposed
amendment to Pro-CODE creating the review board?  You are behind
the curve, but you act like you're way out in front.

I'm probably in a much better position to criticize the failure
of Tim May et al to stand up for crypto freedom than the other
way around.

And the existence proof of this proposition is . . .

Good high school humor for a good high school philosophy.

I am underwhelmed.
