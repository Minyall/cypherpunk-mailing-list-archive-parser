If you subscribe to cypherpunks-unedited@toad.com you will get almost
immediate receipt of toad.com posts much of the day. Algebra.com is
generally only a short time lag behind, although this varies (and you
get duplicates of the toad.com posts).
The advantage of toad.com is that it gives you feedback as to the
time-lag of the distributed lists. The advantages of the distributed
lists is that you can change among them if one is temporarily having
problems.
