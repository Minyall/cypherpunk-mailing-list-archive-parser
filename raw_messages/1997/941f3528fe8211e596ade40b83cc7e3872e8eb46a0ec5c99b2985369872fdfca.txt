  I just uploaded "Snuffle '97" to replay.com. The new version includes
source code for PGP 5.0, a JPEG of Hillary Clinton in the nude, and the
predicted date of death for the lawyer who files the government appeal
in the Bernstein case.
  Saddam Hussein liked "Snuffle '97" so much, he bought the company!
