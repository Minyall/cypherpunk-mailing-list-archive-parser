This program has been in effect in San Francisco, People's Republik Of
Kalifornia, for over a year now.

BTW, in the vicinity of the I-80/I-680 interchange there are an array of
things suspended over the freeway that look like the sensors from metal
detectors, except they are about the size and shape of fluorescent light
fixtures.  They are opaque white plastic, suspended horizontally, with the
long axis crossing the lanu over which it is hung.  There is a cable
entering them at the top, and are suspended over all lanes of traffic
(except the fast lane) in both directions, as well as the on/off-ramps to
I-680.  Directly underneath them are sensor loops similar to what you might
find by traffic lights downtown.  The poles from from which they are hung
have 18-24 inch dish antennas, which point to the CHP truck scales which
are about 1 mile down the road from each sensor array.  Does anyone have
any idea what the devil these things are?  I have been trying to find
someone who knows for several weeks now, but nobody seems to know.

What part of "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be

When everyone is armed, criminals fear everyone, not just the police.
