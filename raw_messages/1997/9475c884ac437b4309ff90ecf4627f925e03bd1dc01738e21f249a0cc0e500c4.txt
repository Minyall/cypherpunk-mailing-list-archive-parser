Okay, I have a list of files which I couldn't get off the 
North American Crypto Archive site before
it closed, and couldn't find anywhere else; see 
http://www.columbia.edu/~ariel/news/mpj-missing.html
Get out all your old floppies and see if you or your friends 
or even your enemies downloaded any of these.
I've listed the original file names and the byte counts; I'd like to
get the original files all in place before worring about
newer/different versions of them.
