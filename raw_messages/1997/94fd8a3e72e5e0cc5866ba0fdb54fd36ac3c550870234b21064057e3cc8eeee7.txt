Over at the Netly News Network, we've decided it's time to update our
Censorware Search Engine. For those of you who haven't checked it
recently, it's a one-of-a-kind web site that lets you see if you've been
blocked by filtering software:

We're planning to update this with newer decrypted lists from some of the
vendors like SurfWatch, CyberPatrol, and so on. If you have a list and
you'd like it to be included, please send it along.
