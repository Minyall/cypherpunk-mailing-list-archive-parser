When Clipper was a new proposal, a reporter stated that Clipper-equipped 
telephones were going to be exportable...to anywhere except 
terrorist-supporting countries like Libya and Iraq.  My first reaction was, 
if those chips had their keys escrowed within reach of the US government, 
WHAT DID IT MATTER that the phones get exported to Libya?!?  In fact, they'd 
presumably want to airdrop them there, right?
