Nah - somebody needs to stay and corrupt the UN :-)

Besides, it's obvious that Bureaucrats are a different race,
superior to their subjects, and that the proposed UN document
is merely hate speech indicating their right to control
the inferior beings who don't have the decency to comply
with the needs of public order and public morals.
Putting the document on a European web site obviously violates
the laws it requires its fellow Burons to impose on their Peons,
but here in America we're still free to publish such tripe...
				Thanks!
