I never claimed it is "covert." (Nor is "Key Recovery" covert, if the
various laws are implemented. Does this make mandatory Key Recovery
acceptable?)

Nor, so far as I have read, can employees disable the "Policy" features.

I repeated this point _twice_.

That employers want to read mail is not surprising, or illegal. But PGP
loses its claims to protect personal privacy if it builds in these
capabilities. This is what Phil said, too.

(Ironic coming from a frequent issuer of cheap shots.)


It is the work of Big Brother, as Garfinkel, Zimmermann, and I agree, when
it becomes a default that additional recipients are automatically copied on
encrypted mail. It may be useful to companies, but it's still dangerous.
