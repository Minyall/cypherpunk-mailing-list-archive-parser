Your Windows password is not used to actually any data. The Windows
login just lets you access your keys. This way even if you change your
Windows password it will not affect yout CAPI installation. As long as
the OS identifies you it lets you access your keys.

Yes! you are right. Security without a good policy is an open door.

This can be configured by the administrator of the domain.
