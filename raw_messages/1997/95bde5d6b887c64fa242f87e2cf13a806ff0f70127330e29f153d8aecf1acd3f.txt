The concept of "Free-Market-Crypto-Anarchy" doesn't jibe with the
"Lynch-Mob Democracy" mentality exhibited by Gates.  One of the
fundamental principles of anarchy is a willingness to let others hash
out their own problems, i.e. I will ignore him unless his actions
impact or affect me personally/financially.

It is not as if the Gates were going to be affected by the
"suspects"...they had to go out of their way to interfere with someone
else's pursuit of happiness.  That is clearly unacceptable.  The last
thing we need is a deputized citizenry...talk about a police state.
(I guess that would be the ultimate form of the "Policeman Inside")
