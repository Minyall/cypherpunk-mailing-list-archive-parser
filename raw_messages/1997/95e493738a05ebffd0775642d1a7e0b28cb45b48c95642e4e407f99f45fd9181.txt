That's a very accurate analysis, and that's precisely what's been happening
in NYC, where a lot of pay phones are owned by small businesses now. They
also want to either block the 800 numbers, or charge for calling them
from their pay phone.

Of course they'd feel differently if there was some way to pay for receiving
calls there... :-)

it has little to do with the war on (some) drugs.
