It is about that girth, although I only have the first 5 volumes.  They
should have hand-huffman-coded the source :).

Not quite.  If you read closely, the EAR says something about reserving
judgment on OCR publications.  You didn't use a specific OCR font, but you
did put all kinds of other OCR helps in, which should by itself cloud the
issue.  It would be nice if it was resolved.

Or if PGP came out with the "PGP crypto source quarterly", now that I have
munge and unmunge :).

You would normally bury a lot of ECC within the bar codes, so that unless
the dog would eat the page, it would be able to reconstruct the whole, or
even take the "munge" images and barcode those lines.
