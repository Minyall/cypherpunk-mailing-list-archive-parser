I believe remailers are strongly protected by the Electronic Communcations
Privacy Act, which explicitly says that reconveyors or intermediary parties
may not examine or inspect e-mail.  Anyone expecting that a remailer is
looking at mail flowing through his system for evidence of libel,
espionage, obscenity, threats, etc., must be unaware that the ECPA formally
forbids this, except under limited circumstances (e.g., a business may look
at mail of employees, and prior arrangements/releases can be made. Neither
of these situations require, let alone approve, inspection of mail in
transit).

This line of reasoning has not been used in any defense, perhaps because
there have been no prosecutions of remailers. Whether the courts, including
The Court, will conclude that the ECPA is protection, is of course unknown
to me.

And I mentioned this specifically.
