Hmmm...  There are lots of crypto papers on the net.  Pick a US
cryptographer, his home page will be bristling with papers
(postscript, html whatever).

If you're talking about publishing code to go with your paper, well
publish the URL in your paper, and put the code at the URL.  There
seems to be a reasonable selection of code at the cypherpunks ftp site
@ berekely judging from the Italian mirror of it.

Some of _your_ code is on that site...
