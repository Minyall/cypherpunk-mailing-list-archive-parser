As a parent, that's _your_ problem.  If you really believe that the
Internet is the great source of unfettered "pornography" that your
child will encounter before he/she/it "are at a maturity level where
they can deal with it", I have some swampland to sell you in Alaska.

Take your kid out of school now.  Make sure he/she/it has no contact
with other children or the outside world.

Unless they're infants, your kids are dealing with it NOW.

Stop kidding yourself.  

Honestly, Phillip, I don't envy your position, but I think you need to
rethink your perspective.   Start by assuming that your kids will be
exposed to adult issues _long_ before they've reached what you
consider the appropriate maturity level.

I think that you're on the wrong list.
