I don't buy this. You are, of course, welcome to join Patrick Oonk in
funding lawyers for those unable (or unwilling) to pay. Demanding that I
pay for your charitable desires is, of course, theft.

As to your stipulation that this is for "political" cases, I of course
agree that there are too many laws. So? The fix is not to add fuel to the
engine of the beast by subsidizing a large infrastructure of "public
defenders" (really just taxpayer-funded "apprenticeships" for lawyers to
eventually enter private practice).

Why should those who managed to save money, for example, subsidize those
who did not? Jim Bell, for example (but not to pick on him...but he's the
current example), is almost as old as I am. And yet he made choices in his
career which left him indigent, or unable to pay for a legal defense. So
why should I and other taxpayers, including those working for $7 an hour at
Taco Bell, subsidize his lawyer-in-training?

Not that Bell's lawyer did any good....

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
