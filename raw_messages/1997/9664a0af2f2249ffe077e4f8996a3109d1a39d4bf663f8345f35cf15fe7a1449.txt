  A remailer has one purpose: To spam. Just like any other tool,
a remailer, if it is available *_*will*_* be used at some point.

  Making sure there are lots of remailers around only serves to make
a lot of people very spammed. This is a **_**Bad Thing**_**.

  That's right. Since Hitler instituted gun control in Europe, the
decent
human beings in Europe gas people en masse.

  In Europe, where ovens are a tradition, and part of the European way,
many people would not think twice before gassing someone. The result of
this is that the number of people getting killed by ovens is enourmous,
be they little Jews, old Jews, or Jew lovers.

  Not many Europeans complained when the American gun-loving people came
to visit and a lot of Nazis got shot.
  Wake up and smell the burning Jews, dude.
