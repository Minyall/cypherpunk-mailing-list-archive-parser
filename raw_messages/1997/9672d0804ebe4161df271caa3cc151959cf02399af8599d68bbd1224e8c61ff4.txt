CBC has put together a short (7 mins or so) news piece on the
Kashpureff/Alternic situation - it's available via RealVideo (which seems
to run reasonably over my 28.8 modem at home) at
<http://www.tv.cbc.ca/undercurrents/tv/week09/fugitive.ram>.

They've also made an image of his US arrest warrant and the criminal
complaint filed in the US district court (ED NY, 97-1343M) available at
<http://www.tv.cbc.ca/undercurrents/stories/internic/warrant.html>.
