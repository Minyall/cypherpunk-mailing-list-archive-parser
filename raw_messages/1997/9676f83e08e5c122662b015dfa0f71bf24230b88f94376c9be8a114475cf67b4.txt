Some of the people killed, busted, sued, or harassed by the government for 
constitutionally protected speech in the last 50 years:
(in no particular order)

Wilhelm Reich (Died in Federal Prison)
Jake Baker
Christopher Lowe (Financial Newsletters) (LOWE v. SEC, 472 U.S. 181 (1985))
Paul Robert Cohen ("Fuck the Draft" button) (COHEN v. CALIFORNIA, 403 U.S. 15 
(1971))
Al Holmquist (Ordered silenced by Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission) 
(MADISON SCH. DIST. v. WISCONSIN EMP. REL. COMM'N, 429 U.S. 167 (1976))
Junius Irving Scales (Smith Act Commie)(SCALES v. UNITED STATES, 367 U.S. 203 
(1961)) 

There are thousands more.  Making constitutionally protected statements can 
get you loads of trouble.

Additionally, we don't actually know whether or not Tim has committed any 
criminal acts.  We just know he's not dumb enough to mention any such to 
others.
