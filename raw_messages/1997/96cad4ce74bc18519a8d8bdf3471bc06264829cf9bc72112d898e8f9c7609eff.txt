Just wait a few hours more, I would expect it`s just a backlog and 
you will be properly unsuscribed soon. If you want to subscribe try 
filtering your mail to remove things you don`t want to read, this can 
cut the list down to a more manageable 20 or 30 messages a day 
although I read nearly all of the 100 or so messages a day passing 
through here.

Absolutely, you will find all of the long term suscribers on this 
list are immortal.
