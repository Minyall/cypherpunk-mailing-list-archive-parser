If you will check the archives (God, I've been waiting for a chance to
say that!), you will find that several weeks ago (years ago, in 'dog
weeks') I posted some rambling nonsense which pointed out recent court
rulings in regard to a Berkeley (?) judge upholding the right of local
freelance (?) stations to operate outside of the unconstitutional iron
hand of the FCC, and pointed out the potential importance of the judge's
ruling in regard to future legal issues surrounding the InterNet.

I also pointed out that the government would undoubtedly call and raise
this judicial ruling by launching a variety of attacks on other small,
local broadcasters in an attempt to provide a wide legal base of
precedent for deeming them 'pirate' broadcasters, thus negating the
effect of a single, unbought judge who accidentally came across some
literature describing the Constitution and realized that everything
her political Puppet Masters told her was wrong.

  I have recently opened a Psychic Hotline at 1-800-Tru-Mong, which
costs $.02/min, and I am getting filthy rich predicting the future.
  I channel Tim May in order to predict future events, and channel
Robert Hettinga, Kent Crispin and Phillip Hallam-Baker to predict
future government disinformation campaigns.
  I channel Sigmund Freud and Carl Lewis in order to keep one step
ahead of the guys with the butterfly-net.
