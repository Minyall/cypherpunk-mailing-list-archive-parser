I went out with a nabor last Friday night to get a beer at a local townie
bar. They had a small dance floor with the typical bad music. When the
deejay put on the Village People's "YMCA" he turned down the volume during
the "Y - M - C - A" chorus and led the redneck crowd through his own
version: "Fry Tim McVeigh," which they sang.
