    Bill Stewart <stewarts@ix.netcom.com> was purported to have 
    expostulated to perpetuate an opinion:

#Multiple small points of failure mean that it's less likely
#that the official who wants to rip off information has access
#to the set of information he wants to rip off.  You could argue
#that there would be more officials with access, but probably not, since a big
#pile of information is something that attracts officials far faster than
#little boring piles.

    TRUER WORDS WERE NEVER SPOKEN!
