Anytime a statement like this is made, one can count on the text being
posted. The act of posting such a warning, seen as a dare to many, or as a
suddenly very attractive target, ensures that it will be posted.

Either by someone just wanting to be the one to provoke an action, or by
the imp of the perverse, or by some TLA spook seeing in his posting the
solution to the problem of crypto knowledge proliferation.

(Not to mention being posted by someone who thinks it more important that
the knowledge get spread widely than that the publisher collect incremental
revenues.)

Similarities with such warnings to children--or to the infamous "Don't
think about the color blue for the next minute"--are left for you to ponder.
