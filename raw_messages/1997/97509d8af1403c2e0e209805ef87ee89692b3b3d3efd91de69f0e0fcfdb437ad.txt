Just to clarify my position and respond to an earlier post by
Tim about drug dealers...

I support the use of crypto by everyone. I also agree with Tim
that historically black markets have spurred the growth of
all kinds of technologies, markets and products.

My point was that I'm not pushing for crypto "just for" the
drug dealers in Asia. This would be a stupid political position
for me and they probably don't need my help anyway.
