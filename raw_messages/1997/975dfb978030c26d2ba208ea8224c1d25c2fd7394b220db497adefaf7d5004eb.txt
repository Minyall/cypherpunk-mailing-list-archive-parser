  The above only makes sense in the case of the U.S. government
intercepting the communications of overseas criminals and in
gathering foreign intelligence.
  If encryption is indeed "munitions," then we are effectively

a corresponding scaling back from "the enemy," who is proceeding
forward in the crypto arms race at a full pace.
