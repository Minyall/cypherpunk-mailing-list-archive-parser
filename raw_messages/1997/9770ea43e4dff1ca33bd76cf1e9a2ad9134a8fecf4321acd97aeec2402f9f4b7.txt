   This is a question which I am unclear on about PGP Inc's design goals
   in using the CMR method.
   
     Is the CMR field to allow the company to recover from the user
     forgetting his password?  (recover his mail folder full of encrypted
     email).
   
   or
   
     Is the CMR field to allow the company to read the email in transit
   
   This seems like a fairly important distinction.

It's not for surveillance. It's for recovering from disaster. I think it
would be a good thing to send a PGP message over an encrypted link (TLS or
other).
