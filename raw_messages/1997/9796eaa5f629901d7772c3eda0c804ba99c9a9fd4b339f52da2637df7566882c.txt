Anybody heard of syncrypt?  www.syncrypt.com

It is like pgp but has lots of cool features.  File wiping, group
encryption, automatic encryption of files put in certain directories.

Get this, hiding encrypted files in pictures!  Automatically.  It pulls
them back out again too.

Plus it has an interesting "20 questions" method for backing up your
passphrase.  If you forget your passphrase you have to answer 25 of 27
questions like "who was your favorite teacher" to get it back.

Bruce Schneier is working with them, so they should have good crypto.
It has blowfish, des and triple des, and idea.  The keys are el gamal.

Problem is the freeware is crippled to 10 encryptions (unlimited
decryptions).  $50 for full functions.

Is this the new pgp?  No gak or even cak in sight.
