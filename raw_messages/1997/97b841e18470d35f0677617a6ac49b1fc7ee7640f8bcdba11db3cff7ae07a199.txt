There's a good reason this viewpoint is unpopular: it includes the tacit
assumption that strong crypto is harder to do than weak crypto.  In fact
that's not the case.  It's as fast and easy to do RC4/128 as to do
RC4/40 -- the only extra resource is keying material, which is cheap.

The <only> reason to use weak cryptography is political.

I'll also challenge your "If you know that your cryptography is weak"
meme:
most people have no idea what cryptography is, and at best can look at
the
little key to see if they're on a secure page.  Explaining to them that
they're
not really secure is normally possible in a one-to-one tutorial, but most

people just want to get their work done, and if the program says they're
now
in secure mode, they'll feel free to send their SSN/SIN/NID and their HIV

status.  They <don't> know their cryptography is weak, even if you tell
them.

Bad idea!  Bad!
