>    The Third Great Awakening (Second Turning, 1886-1908), began with the
>    Haymarket Riot and the student missionary movement, rose with agrarian
>    protest and labor violence, and climaxed in Bryan's revivalist
>    candidacy (in 1896).  Gilded Age realism came under harsh attack from
>    trust-blasting muckrakers, Billy Sunday evangelicals, "new woman"
>    feminists, and chautauqua dreamers.  After radicalizing and splitting
>    the Progressive movement, the passion cooled when William Howard Taft
>    succeeded Teddy Roosevelt in the White House.
