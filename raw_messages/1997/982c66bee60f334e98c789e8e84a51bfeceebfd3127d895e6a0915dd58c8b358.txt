Mark Grimes: "Why do 39,440 people a month look up "Yahoo" on 
  Yahoo!? Maybe too many ate lead paint as children." 

A recent compilation of the 200 most popular keywords submitted to the 
Yahoo! Search engine offers some insights about the types of individuals 
that prowl the Web.

"Baywatch" babe Pam Anderson racked up 172,760 inquiries in a recent 
month to place 12th--two places behind "weather," 10 places ahead of 
"Microsoft," and 92 slots before "Bob Dole." 

  Janet Reno could fine Pamela an inch a day until she ranks equally
with Bob Dole, as a sex symbol. (3,000,000 places ahead of Reno.)

Good News:
"Metallica" (59) finished just ahead of "real estate" and "stock 
quotes"; at No. 82 "anal sex" was just before "cars" and "USA Today."

Bad News:
"Days of Our Lives" (91) came up more frequently than "marijuana" 
(93) and "Beatles" (111)."

Huh?:
The top 50: sex, chat, Playboy, Netscape software,
nude, porno, games, porn, weather, Penthouse,
Pamela Anderson, pornography, pussy, Persian Kitty,
maps, Halloween, music, adult, chat rooms, erotica,
Microsoft, jokes, shareware, magazines, pictures,
employment, jobs, erotic, gay, Jenny McCarthy,
Netscape, bondage, lingerie, hardcore, Cindy
Crawford, Hustler, ESPN, supermodels, Disney, Star
Wars, girls, movies, Star Trek, mIRC, genealogy,
screen savers, Japan, soccer, and tits. 

  I suppose that a more cynical mind than mine might make much of
the fact that the comma between 'Microsoft' and 'jokes' may well
be a 'typo'.
  As to why both mentions of Netscape's name are followed by a
plethora of requests for information on various forms of sexual
perversion, I would like to point out that I am not the *only*
person who uses Netscape and Yahoo, so it obviously could not
be *totally* due to my search habits.
