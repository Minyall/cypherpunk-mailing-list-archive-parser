Juriaan,
  I applaud your interest in crypto, but I think you should keep in mind
that there are people around the world sitting in cement bunkers with
their hand on a key that can launch nuclear mayhem on perfect strangers,
for reasons that will remain unknown to those who set these dark forces
in motion.
  This is the end-result of commentary on the political/social
implications
of a technology being ignored.

Toto
