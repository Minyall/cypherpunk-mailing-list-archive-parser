Please add mixer@htp.org, the first public remailer in
Japan, was setup by a member of cypherpunks-j.

# it is not me.

 >$remailer{'cyber'} = '<alias@alias.cyberpass.net> alpha pgp';
 >$remailer{"mix"} = "<mixmaster@remail.obscura.com> cpunk mix pgp hash latent cut ek ksub reord ?";
[..]

mixer@htp.org is probably:

  $remailer{"mixer"} = "<mixer@htp.org> cpunk mix pgp";

Please add this record to your check list.

====

Note that a lot of members at cypherpunks-j are now
leaning how to use remailer(s) and they (and I) want to
need some info about it.  So, in the next time, please
send your report (everytime) to cypherpunks-j's list,
cypherpunks-j@htp.org.

Thanks,
