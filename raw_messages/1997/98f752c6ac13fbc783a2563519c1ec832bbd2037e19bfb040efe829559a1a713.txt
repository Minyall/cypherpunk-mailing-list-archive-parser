No choice at all. My local 7/11 just installed a Verifone Tranz 330 for
the sole purpose of checking the magstripes on the ID's of prospective
alcohol buyers. See, the issue isn't if you are old enough to drink. The
issue is do you have a government license to do so?

Of course the new system will be hacked by enterprising juveniles. Which
will only increase the calls for transponders to be implanted at birth.
