  (Hey! I just 'spammed' myself!)
 then majordomos seem to sometimes have trouble properly unsubscribing
 you.
 I believe that, in theory, they are supposed to be able to do so, as
 long
 as your actual mailing address stays the same, but I have found this
 not always to be the case.
 
   And if you have changed email accounts since subscribing, then only
 the Kenny Houston Psychic Majordomo can properly unsubscribe you.
