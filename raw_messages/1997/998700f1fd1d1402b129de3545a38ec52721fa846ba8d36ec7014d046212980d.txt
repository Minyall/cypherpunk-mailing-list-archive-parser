   'security through obscurity' has/will never work. All it takes is one 
good reverse engineer and presto, the secret is out and 'unlocked' 
controller will be available above or under ground! The process could be 
slowed down by keeping the price of DVD writers high, but we saw how long 
that worked for both DAT and CD-R. Hell CD-Rs are now available for less 
than CD readers were three years ago.
