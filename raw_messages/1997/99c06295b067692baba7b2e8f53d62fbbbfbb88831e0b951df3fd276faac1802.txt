This is an interesting point on which very little serious debate is
taking place:

    Is it EVER okay for spooks to break into a church's computer to
    find out if they are secret terrorists?

I'm not sure the answer is clearly one way or another, and I am
willing to bet that the tone of the answers will mostly be emotional
appeals to some idealistic standard or pessimistic nightmares.

A meta question is whether the answer to a question like this one
above can be answer strictly through a "for all practical purposes it
would never affect me so it does not matter" answer.
