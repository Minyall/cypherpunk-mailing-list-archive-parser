The consistent libertarian/anarchist view of this would be that the
privacy or non-privacy of records is completely determined by contract
between the person supplying the information and the agency collecting
it.  For example, a medical license would be granted by agencies that 
granted such licenses.  If you wanted a license from a particular agency 
you would deal with them.  The value of the license is determined by 
the reputation of the agency, not whether or not they give out 
doctors home addresses.

An amusing example of a conspiracy theory.  You are pretty good at 
these, you know.  :-)
