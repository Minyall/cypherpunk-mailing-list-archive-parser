There are patches that protect against this. The DOS attack that you mention
has been beaten to death in BugTraq and other places. It worked great until
all major OSes were patched. (of course some backwards sites still run
unpatched OSes)

It is very hard to protect against my attack, because it can only be done
at the application level. xinetd _may_ be helpful, though, if the service
being attacked is started from [x]inetd.

Yes, BUT most typically a new connection creates only a new file 
descriptor on the host, and a whole new process on the target host.
