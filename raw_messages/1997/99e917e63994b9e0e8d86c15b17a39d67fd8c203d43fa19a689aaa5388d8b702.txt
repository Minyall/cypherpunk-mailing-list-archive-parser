Or, set up your own webcam "to watch your coffee pot twice a minute" or
something. Merge the crypto stream through the gifs after tweaking the
brightness and contrast to avoid 0 and 255 (a light fixture with a pattern
of 254/255 values gets suspicious, and is not from thermal noise - a
"problem" with monochrome quickcams for night photography).

Then do something like

  lynx -source webcam.x.y/images/coffee.gif | destegodecrypt >>reconstruct

every 30 seconds (with some kind of dropout correction).  [lynx is a
textmode browser that works well for these types of things].

Or even an AVI for both video and sound stego.
