Actually it is possible for the government to get more than one shot at
a defendant through the doctrine of dual sovereignty (state and
federal).  That is how they got the police officers involved in the
Rodney King incident.  When the state court (California) jury let them
off, the feds prosecuted them for civil rights violations in federal
court.

There you have it.
