The wonderful thing about the U.S. Customs computer system is that
one only has to compromise a single computer to access everything
on their system. God bless McAfee, who made it all possible by making
certain that all of the Customs computers were vulnerable to a single
point of entry.
I can hardly wait for their Key Escrow products to come out.
