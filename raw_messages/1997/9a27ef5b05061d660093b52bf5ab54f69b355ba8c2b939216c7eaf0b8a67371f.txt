Want to add a bit of mass civil disobedience to the Crypto movement?

Get alt.binaries.crypto created as a usenet news group.

Why has this not happened already?  This will make an even bigger mockery of the ITARs, the EARs, and the other silly regs throughout the world.

[BTW, for those of you who oppose "Careerpunks", consider this...  How can you throw your crypto-sabots if you cannot get close to the machinary of industry?]
