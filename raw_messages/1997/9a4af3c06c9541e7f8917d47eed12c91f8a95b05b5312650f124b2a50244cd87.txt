Really?  Looks like they (whoever and their tentacles) hit it right on
in the predictions regarding Gilmore and the list, re: censorship.

Assuming the text below came from Gilmore as is alleged, he is collab-
orating with the most offensive and ignorant of all cypherpunks, the
veritable king of asininity, Sandy Sandfort.

Both of these clowns should climb out of their drunk tanks (or whatever
they're called these days) and get some fresh air.  Paranoia like these
guys are displaying is most unbecoming of a so-called civilised person.
