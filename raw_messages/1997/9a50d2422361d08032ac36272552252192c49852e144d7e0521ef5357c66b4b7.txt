Dale, don't be such an ass.  If "everyone understood that the 
uncensored (sic) list was untouchable" then why have you and
others continued to challenge that proposition.  You have put
forward the classic heads-I-win-tails-you-lose logical fallacy.
If I say nothing to support the proposition you whine about a
"hidden agenda."  If I reaffirm my commitment to the plan, you
spout pop psychological nonsense of the "the lady doth protest
too much variety."  Which is it, Dale?  You are so transparent.
