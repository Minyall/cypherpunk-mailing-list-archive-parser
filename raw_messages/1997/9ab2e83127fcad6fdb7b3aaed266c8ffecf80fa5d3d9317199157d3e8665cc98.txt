So a possible consequence of someone from Iraq being obnoxious on a
mailing list, to someone in the know, could be several PGP-encrypted
mails dumped in their inbox... A little extreme, for us gentles, but the

Of course, spamming every Iraqui email address you could find with encoded
mail could cause a _lot_ of trouble.
