That is a simplistic and ineffective way to implement an e-postage fix. A
better way would be to try a deposit, or a third-party rating system for
post quality, or a list of domains that are likely to be free from
spammers, or so on. These have been discussed here before. I even wrote
about them a year ago in Internet World.
