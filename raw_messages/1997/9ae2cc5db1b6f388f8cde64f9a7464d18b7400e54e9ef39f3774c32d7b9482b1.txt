Which reminds me of...
Netscape can export 40-bit versions of Communicator, and according to one 
of their own employees (search back in the archives if you don't believe 
me) the only difference between the 40-bit version and the 128-bit 
version is a license file. Now license files aren't covered in export 
regulations, are they? So it's legal to export the 40-bit version of 
Communicator (which contains disabled 128-bit crypto) and it's legal to 
export the license file. Sounds like it's either not true or the 
government is stupider than I thought or the government is tired of 
trying to enforce such futile laws.
