Minor UI nit:  it would be much much better if it said 


"You are about to send a 'referrer header' telling the next web 
site about the web page you are currently looking at.  Should 
<netscape> send this 'referrer header'?  
[Yes/No/Always Send Referrer Headers/Never Send Referrer Headers]"
