Each year, the U.S. federal government steals and spends more money (and more 
actual value) than any government has ever stolen and blown before in the 
history of mankind.   It has been the record holder for more than 50 years 
and each year it breaks its own record.

I am aware that this is because the U.S. is the world's largest economy but 
that fact does not diminish the scale of the theft.
