A partial answer on why feedback is better than codebook mode: 
consider a video signal, with large amounts of uniform background.  Encrypted
with a codebook mode cipher, silhouettes will be visible since the uniform
background
will map to the same cipher value.  NB: the "uniformity" must span a block,
e.g., 64 bits for BF.

The tradeoff is 1. slightly increased latency & complexity 2. an error in
your output stream mangles
more data than in ECB mode.

Feeding a stream of zeros into a feedback-mode cipher produces a
pseudo-random output stream...in a good cipher.
