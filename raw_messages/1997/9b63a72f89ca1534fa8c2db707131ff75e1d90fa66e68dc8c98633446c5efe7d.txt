When I was with Uncle Sam overseas, I bunked with guys from Brooklyn,
Queens, and areas like that.  They didn't seem to be influenced as much
by the Bible-thumpers etc. as people from Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, and
so on.  Of course, that was the 1960's.  Things have changed a lot, and
the U.S. is much more cosmopolitan now.

Nonetheless, it's interesting how much of the FUD from conservative
Christianity (to name an example I'm familiar with) still has a strong
presence in people's minds...  What I could tell about 666 in my own
case, I can hardly believe myself.
