I am getting tired now, but here is a proposed solution. You suspect
Prof. Sandfort in an intention to edit "unedited" list. You do not trust
administrators of toad.com. 

I hope though that there are people whom you somewhat trust.

If you trust me, or someone else, like Prof. Dave Hayes, here's what
we can do: I establish a sendmail alias cypherpunks@algebra.com that
expands to, say, your address and also cypherpunks@toad.com.

You can encourage all people, whom you expect to be censored on the
unedited list, to post through cypherpunks@algebra.com. I can even set 
up a little program that would digitally sign receipts of all messages
coming to cypherpunks@algebra.com. You and anyone else can receive such 
receipts.

It means that you, Dale Thorn, in cooperation with other readers but
WITHOUT cooperation from toad.com, will be able to see which articles
sent through algebra.com finally made it to the unedited list. Not all
posters will use such service, but you can expect the "censored" people
to do so.

If you indeed notice an impropriety, the digitally signed receipts
will be your proof that articles were submitted. As long as the
other readers trust me (or Dave Hayes, or whoever volunteers), you 
will have a strong case even without relying on freudian slips.
