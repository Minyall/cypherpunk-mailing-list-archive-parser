These are all the same payment mechanisms. I run a business and the actual
accounting for cash, credit cards, etc. doesn't make my books a lot of
difference except in what column I put the numbers. My bank certainly
doesn't care where that money came from once deposited in my account from
somebody elses account.

I believe you are caught up in details of the system and not in differences
between systems.
