Perhaps he has no business having a personal key on a company machine. 
He's a fool if he does, anyway -- if the company wanted to snoop his
key they just go in after hours, install a keyboard sniffer, and grab
his passphrase...the bottom line is, Ray, that if it is on a corporate
machine, the corporation has access, whether the employee thinks so or
not.
