I really can't get excited about US domestic policy. That is not where the
crypto is needed. 

Eve so if you hypothesise the extent of surveillance such that mixmaster
remaillers are needed the constitution was thrown out long ago.

Now this happened under Hoover and the FBI still have their headquarters
named after him.

I'm having great difficulty making sense of the finely calibrated level of
paranoia which makes mixmaster both effective and necessary.

On the other hand it strikes me that if we could work out a better version
of Julf's pi.net remailer there would be a considerable benefit to the net.
