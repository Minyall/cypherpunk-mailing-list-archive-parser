Can anybody suggest any good books on old cryto techniques ?? I'm finally 
learning to program, along with the stuff i've got to learn as part of 
the class i thought i would make a start on learning to code 
crypotgraphic algorithms. I was after some old ones that are simple to 
code in software. Unfortuently the one in the back of the Schnier book 
are a little to complex for my limited programming knowledge so far. 

So can anybody help or will i just be ignored like i have been at other 
times ?
