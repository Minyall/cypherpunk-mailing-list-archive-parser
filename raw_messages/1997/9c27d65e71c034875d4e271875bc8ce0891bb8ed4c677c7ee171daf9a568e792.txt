Telephone switches generate (receive) a digit that is known as Call Type.
Simplistically, Call Types may be 1+ for regular calls, 800 for 800 calls,
Conference, and 0+ for operator/payphone call.

One of the switch features may be some kind of call type blocking,
or passing the call type to the termination side, such as the pager
company computer.
