Spin-doctor bullshit. Technology is *created* by people. When the day comes
where we don't understand it we will quit making progress at the rate we
are. It *is* true that if you spend your days watching Opra and your nites
watching some cop-show then you will have no clue as to what is going on.
To understand technology *requires* activity and participation, something
that people are becoming less and less inclined to do when they can go flip
on their PlayStation or play Quake 2 and claim to be on the bleeding edge...

Posers, lamers, and wanna-be's.
