Depends on the user interfaces of the anonymizing proxies - 
a system that lets you request what you want in the URL
may let you do more than a system that insists you type stuff in blanks,
but on the other hand,
http://anon.foo.com/proxy/anon.bar.com/proxy/anon.zork.com/proxy/thoughtcrim
e.com/
lets the everything in the chain see that you're really trying to reach
thoughtcrime.com, while a succession of SSL-encrypted forms popping up that
you fill in the blanks on may be harder to automate, but more secure.
