Some of them said I should be imprisoned for posting erotic images of
children. And some of them wanted me to send them the proper decryption key.

And some even claimed, after I revealed that the supposed GIF images were
not real, that I was nevertheless guilty of "making a market in child
porn." As we've been discussing lately, a classic case of "thoughtcrime."

really, really carefully, with a magnifyng glass....yeah, "researchers."
Just like "se7en."
