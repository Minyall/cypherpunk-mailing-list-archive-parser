When the leftists try to avoid being called 'leftists', you know it's 
all over but the mopping up. 

But, nonetheless, let me try:
"A leftist is someone who advocates increasing government control 
over private actions, especially in the name of such mummeries as 
'equality' and 'fairness'. Contrast to a rightist, who advocates 
increasing government control over private action in the name of 
'decency' and 'values'."
