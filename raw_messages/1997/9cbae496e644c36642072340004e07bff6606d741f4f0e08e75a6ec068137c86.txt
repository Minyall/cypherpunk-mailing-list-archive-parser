Yes... in CO you can take them to court, and if the cop doesn't show up, you
get off free.  I dunno about VA (just moved here 2 months ago).

In CO, you're supposed to be able to ask the cop if you can see the radar
gun that clocked you, and if it's been cleared or the cop won't show it to
you, you cannot be ticketed.  By law, the cop *must* have a visual estimate
of your speed, and a clocked speed on a gun of some kind (a friend of mine is
a Sheriff in southern CO), but they apparently don't tell that to anyone.
