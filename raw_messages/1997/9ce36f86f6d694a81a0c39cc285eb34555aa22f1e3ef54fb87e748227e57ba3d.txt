As I said earlier, Richelson's comprehensive study of foreign intelligence
agencies describes it as Chobetsu, as does Hersh. Perhaps there is an issue
of transliteration here?

I found one of my Web page bookmarks, http://www.onestep.com/milnet/iagency.htm

and it lists various SIGINT agencies. As these may be of interest to
others, I will include the full list below, including the description of
Chobetsu:
