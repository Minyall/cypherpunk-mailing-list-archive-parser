Copyright law is not only useless on the net but inefficient; one need only
compare the performance of free, copylefted software versus proprietary,
closed software to see which is better. But now it is possible to apply the
same principle of copyleft to _all_ non-software information, too --
including text, images and music. I have done this myself with novels and
albums of music, and have posted full instructions on how to apply this to
non-software information at <http://dsl.org/copyleft/>.
