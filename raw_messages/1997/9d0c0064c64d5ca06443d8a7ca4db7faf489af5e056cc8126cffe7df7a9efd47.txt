That's because it doesn't.  And there is a difference between "political 
rights" and liberty.  I care about the latter and not the former.  Plenty of 
tyrannical democracies.  I judge governments by how much they leave me alone 
not by their form.

Certainly today's economic and technological freedom gives individuals vast 
money and vast power.  This increases their ability to tell their governments 
to go fuck themselves.  Whether they will choose to exercise this power, they 
certainly have it.

No they criticize it because they don't like to *pay* for it.  They believe 
in lower taxes and smaller governments.
