While I couldn't make it this time, I'd be interested in showing up for the
next Bay area meeting if somebody could provide transportation to/from the
airport/train-station/bus-station.  A place to crash for a night would be a
big plus.

Anyone volunteering to help will get "Jim Bell" autographs.  Might be worth
something some day...   ("Get them while I can still give them"!)
