Nope.  I have several friends who are from Singapore, and that is 
simply not the way they see it.  They like their country, and they 
are proud of it.  They know it isn't perfect, but they think it is 
pretty damn good.  From their perspective your statement simply 
reflects the narrowness of your point of view.

This also represents a terribly narrow view of the world.  Freedom is 
psychological state as much as it is a social or an economic one.

Nonsense.  The ultimate expression of freedom is skinny dipping in a 
mountain lake.

Actually, it's dogma, not pedagogy.  The notion of "freedom" to a
libertarian is like the notion of "faith" to a Christian -- a
self-reinforcing mental trap, a span of circular thinking that is just
a little too large for them to notice and say "Haven't I been here
before?" Like moths they flit around the bright emotional icons that
blind them, define their world, and trap their thoughts in endless
repetition. 

For all the brave words about reason and logic, and all the endless
discussion about it, libertarians don't ever actually sit down and
think "what does the word 'freedom' mean, anyway?".  Instead, their
thinking goes down to a point where they can repeat some mantra like
"Freedom to make purchasing decisions is *the* major component of
freedom in any advanced society", and they never realize the exact
circularity involved.  It might as well be "Freedom to worship the
Lord is *the* major component of freedom in any advanced society." Or
"Being a slave to purchasing decisions is *the* major component of
slavery in any advanced society."

Thinking in platitudes is not thinking.
