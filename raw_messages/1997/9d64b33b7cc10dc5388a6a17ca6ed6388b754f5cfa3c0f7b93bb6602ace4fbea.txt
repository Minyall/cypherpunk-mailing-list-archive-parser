the crass, ignorant, and materialistic mistake the Tao for the Dow.
when the Dow melts down, those that believe in it will be as shattered
as those clinging to a false religion. they will be like the 
priests of a fallen hypocrisy. this is the way of the
Tao, to arrive at truth by swimming through falsity. for
the master it need not be so. but masters are rare. if they
were not rare, it would not be the Tao.
