I took a look and everything I have seen can do stego, and some
encryption, but it is one file in one file.

I was not clear because the loop device can mount a filesystem, and
encrypt and/or stego an entire directory tree in one file transparently,
so I can mount my stego-crypto image on /home/me and do everything as I
normally would on an unencrypted partition.

I can do the same with CFS, but it doesn't do stego, and I don't know if
it is available for many platforms outside unix.
