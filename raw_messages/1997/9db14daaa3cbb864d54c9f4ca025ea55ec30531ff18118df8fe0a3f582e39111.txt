No, "the people" is the people of the united states as a whole.  The
federalist papers deals with this somewhere, where they explain that of
course the voting had to be organized state by state, because that tracked
the reality of how everything was organized, but nonetheless it was
intended to be a national pleblecite to produce a national government.

No. see above.
