According to americal common law, as I understand it, no one can get
a valid title to the property from someone who did not have such title.

E.g., if you steal Vulis's car and then sell it to me, I will not have
the title to the car and will have to return it back to Vulis (and may
be able to try to recover my loss from you). The same will be true if
you lend the stolen car to me -- he can get it back if he proves that it
is his.

I find that reasoning to be quite good.

Lending stolen money (or stolen golden teeth) to banks is no different
than lending stolen cars.

American law does not have to apply to Switzerland, but I find that 
particular part of it to be just. The issue, of course, is coming up
with the proof.

I will appreciate if someone could correct me.
