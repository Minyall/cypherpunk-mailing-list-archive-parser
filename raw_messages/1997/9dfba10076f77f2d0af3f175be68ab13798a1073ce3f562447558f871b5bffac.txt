I have written truly large numbers of posts explicating my philosophy. You
may not agree with my point of view, but characterizing me--as I assume you
were in your response to this thread about "Tim's heart"--as merely
reciting mantras to others is false.

It is you, B., who have generally been inactive on the list for quite some
time, only occasionally dropping in to snipe. Referring to us as
"emotionally stunted men",,,now there's a solid argument for whatever it is
your position is.

You mean like "emotionally stunted men"?

Or do you mean like the characterization of list members as "socio-economic
cult" members?

You sound like you're ranting to me. Lecturing others on their anger while
writing "take a fucking BREAK man" and foaming about sacred jihads and
emotionally stunted men....

Physician, heal thyself.
