It might be fun to send some remailed messges to addesses within the
Israeli embassy (Alta Vista should turn up some valid e-mail addresses),
using various keywords like "Mega" (the code name of the highly-placed
Israeli spy), the Christopher report, Arafat, Dimona, Operation Jericho,
South Africa, and various nuclear-related terms.). A suggested sort of
message:

"Urgent that Mega exercise Option A and leave Goyland. Encode latest nuke
secrets in stego image of Golda Meier at clothing optional beach."

--Tim May, who supports "Mega's Law," which requires that the National
Security Agency notify the neighbors about any spies resettled to their
neighborhoods
