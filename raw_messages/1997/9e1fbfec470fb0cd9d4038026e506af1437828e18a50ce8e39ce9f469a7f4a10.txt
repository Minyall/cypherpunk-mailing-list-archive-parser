This comes the same day as a Wired News story
about detritus.net, an online gallery which
plans to host works of "appropriated," copyright-
infringing art. Better not take any digital
handouts at the gallery, or you're opt to join
them in the paddy wagons, too.

The assertion of "Intellectual property" = the control of human Mind.

Lock and load.

Yep.

Welcome to the reality that an increasing number of reasonable citizens
face: do something normal, reasonable, even constitutionally protected,
and face years in prison and huge fines.
