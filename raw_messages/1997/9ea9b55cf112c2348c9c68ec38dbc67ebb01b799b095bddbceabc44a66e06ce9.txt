For OS/2 there is a very nice RAM Disk program called SVDisk. It allows
you to "lock" a portion or all of your Ramdisk to be non-swapable. Also
has multiple disk support, HPFS & FAT support, and various floppy format
support for VFloppies.

The initial VDisks must be set-up in the config.sys via the VDisk.sys
driver. After bootup the user is free to mount & unmount disks, format
disks, and lock and unlock portions of the VDisks.

I usally run a 8Mb HPFS VDisk Locked for a temp directory.
