* In June, the Court of Appeal in London, England, turned down
Thomas Moringiello's challenge to his fraud conviction and 18-
month prison sentence.  Although Moringiello was able to prove
that Judge Richard Hamilton had slept through portions of the
testimony at trial the year before, the higher court said Moringiello
was not harmed because Hamilton still was able to give a summary
of the case for the jury's deliberation.
