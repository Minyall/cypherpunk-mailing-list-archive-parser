Actually, we just moved e$ a week or so from e$@thumper.vmeng.com, to
e$@vmeng.com, that's all.

We're still fixing the reply-to field in e$pam to reflect this.

e$pam is a one way list which only I can post to (it don't say e$pam until
I say it says e$pam, Bwahahahahah!), but e$@vmeng.com, which is the
watering hole and reply-to list for e$pam, is an open list, which doesn't
restrict mail from anyone.

Otherwise we couldn't get anonymous messages, right?
