By jove, I think I've "got" it -  there *is* something deeper going on here:

Tim is really an undercover 'narc' -  through his provocative remarks he's
actually encouraging all the violent terrorists on the list to come out of
their lurking holes and reveal themselves.  Then he's going to turn them
all in for a cash reward, which he'll use to buy more high-tech stock.

Yeah, that's it!
