The local news just had a story on the Jim Bell case.

They are now claiming that the search warrent (how the news people got a copy 
is a big question) included Sarin nerve gas and Anthrax (not the band).

The news story was a pretty interesting hatchet job.  Included a number of 
horsemen and prominently mentioned encryption.  They claimed that the reason 
for the raid on East's home was because he sent Bell encrypted messages 
containing various evil and unauthorized thoughts.

Why am I not surprised...
