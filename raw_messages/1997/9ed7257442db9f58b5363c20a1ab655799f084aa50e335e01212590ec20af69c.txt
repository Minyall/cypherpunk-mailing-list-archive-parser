There we disagree. I believe the scale of crimes commited by governments 
as a whole varies from government to government, and from one time to 
another. However, the natural "evolutionary" process of government always 
results in a pervasive state which controls more than it should. This is 
why, although I support the ideals and sentiments behind minarchism, I do 
not believe it is possible, without systems such as AP, or simply 
anonymous assasination contracts, to support minarchist government and 
keep it stable and static. (maybe, even though Jim Bell intended AP to 
support and maintain anarchy it might lead to more stable minarchist 
government by providing a means of removing those who go too far in their 
search for power?).

Even then though, I cannot see how a stable minarchist state can be 
created which we can be assured will remain static in it`s powers, and 
the very notion of a state which has certain powers at its disposal, even 
if it does not use them, does not leave me with a good feeling.
