Greetings and Salutations,

Does anyone know of where I can get some sort of window to "catch"
all of the system mess. while xdm is running?  There are a lot of
collisions that happen, and they mess up the screen with error mess.
The people who use these computers assume the this is broke.

Any ideas?

Thanks,
Daniel Colpi
