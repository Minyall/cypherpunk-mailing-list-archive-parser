It seems that the RC5 cracking effort had no idea about the loads their web
server would be subjected to once thousands of DES crackers moved over to
cracking RC5. Their NT based webserver (bad idea...) collapsed. While it
recovers, you can still get the client software from
ftp://ftp.distributed.net/rc5/
