This is the new family-friendly filtered search engine put out by the
folks at Altavista: http://family.netshepherd.com/

Try the query "fucking porn" and see what you get... exactly what I want
my kids to see when they are looking for "fucking porn": fucking porn.

I guess we can't expect them to filter just anything with the word
fucking in it, it might be an educational site or something.
