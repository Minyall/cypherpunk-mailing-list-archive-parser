There's no confusion. You propose even more censorship than there is now.

Ray "Arsenic" Arachelian of ASALA/Earthweb is a lying piece of shit, like
the rest of the "cypher punks".

You can complain about Ray Arachelian's libel, spam, forgery, and other
net-abuse to the owners of Earthweb, LLC - the Web designer employing Ray
as an associate network administrator - Jack Hidary <jack@earthweb.com>,
Murray Hidary <murray@earthweb.com>, and Nova Spivack <nova@earthweb.com>.
