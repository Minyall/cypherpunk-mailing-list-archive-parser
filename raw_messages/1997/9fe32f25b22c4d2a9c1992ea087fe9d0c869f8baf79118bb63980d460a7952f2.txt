I have the source code for RC5 encryption algorithm, but it is in C, 
well it is still cool since it is "portable" but I am actually looking 
for a PowerPC assembly code for the same, or at least for the Key 
Expansion, Encryption and Decryption routines.

I am not a PowerPC coder at all, I barely know 8086 assembly. Somebody 
have it already written?

The "formula" for RC5 is pretty interesting and looks like is made to 
be implemented in Assembler.

Cia0,
