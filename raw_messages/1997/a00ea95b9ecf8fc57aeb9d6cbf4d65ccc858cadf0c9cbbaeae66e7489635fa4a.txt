     Sung to the tune of  "Santa Claus is Coming to Town"

          You better watch out,
          You better not cry,
          You better not pout,
          I'm telling you why,
          Santa Claus is tapping,
          Your phone.

          He's buggin your room,
          He's reading your mail,
          He's keeping a file
          And runnin a tail
          Santa Claus is tapping
          Your phone

          He hears you in the bedroom
          Surveils you out of doors
          And if that doesn't get the goods
          Then he'll use provocateurs.

          So you mustn't assume
          That you are secure
          On Christmas Eve
          He'll kick in your door
          Santa Claus is tapping
          Your phone...
