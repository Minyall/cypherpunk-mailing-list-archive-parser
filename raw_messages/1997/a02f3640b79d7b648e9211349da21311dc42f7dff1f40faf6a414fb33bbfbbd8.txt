of course the credit card issuers do this not out of the goodness of their
heart but because they're required to by the US gubmint. It's not at all
clear if they have to eat the fraudulent charges if the card holder hasn't
been following the issuer's instructions.

Actually, if you call up your credit card issuer and ask, hypothetically,
what would happen if you transmitted your credit card info over the Internet,
and someone got hold of them, and charged lots of money. Don't assume
that they have to eat it.
