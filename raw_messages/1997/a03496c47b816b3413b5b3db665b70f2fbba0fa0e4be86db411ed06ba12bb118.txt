There is no confusion here. KRAP supports GAK plain and simple. They want
the government to be able to get into everyone's nickers and are actively
working on making this possible (of course with the promise of nice
government contracts and easing of export restrictions).

Key Recovery= Key Escrow = GAK it's all the same thing. Unauthorized 3rd
parties gaining access to your data without your consent and more than
likely without you knowledge.

I think that most on this list would agree that this is a BadThing(TM).
