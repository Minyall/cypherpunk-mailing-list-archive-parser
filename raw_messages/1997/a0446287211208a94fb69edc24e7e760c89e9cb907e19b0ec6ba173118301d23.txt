    thanx, Dimitri, I could not have replied more eloquently myself.

        and, I never had complainers after burnt earth actions. Kent
    is obviously jealous and angry he was not along for the ride 30+
    years ago.

    actually, I did abhor the policy sufficiently to resign a 
    commission w/o benefits and to suffer their standard means of
    discredit.

    I guess Kent is still wet behind the ears, no use wasting the time
    to clue him in on Hr. Doktor Professor....
