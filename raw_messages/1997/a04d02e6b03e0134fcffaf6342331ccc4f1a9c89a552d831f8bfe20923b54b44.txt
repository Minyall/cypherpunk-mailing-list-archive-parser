Mmmm... What is the collateral? Intangible assets like distribution roghts?

Also, this guy's web site is totally fucked up -- the lines in 
http://members.aol.com/dataetrsch/public/udcmv20b.txt are
very long and browsers are not supposed to wrap them.

I am also wondering, I am listed as visitor 189 on his web site. Under
most optimistic assumptions, if *every* visitor bought his product, he would
have made $40*188 = $7520.

A good money, no doubt, but to issue $1,250,000 worth of *zero-coupon* 
bonds?
