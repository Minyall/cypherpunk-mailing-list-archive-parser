I find this hard to believe.  I guess it takes all kinds to make a world.  In 
the current employment market for people with crypto skills, few are going to 
get fired for their political views and no one of these types would find it 
hard to get another job if fired.

Even those without crypto skills (myself for example) would find it trivial to 
find work.

I make no secret of my political views when talking to people I work with.  
Most of them are quite conventional people including government employees.  
Maybe my personal manner is less threatening. 

If my boss told me to tone down my views (something that's never happened), 
I'd argue with him.  After short arguments, people usually leave me alone.  My 
mouth intimidates them.  (My mouth not my breath.)
