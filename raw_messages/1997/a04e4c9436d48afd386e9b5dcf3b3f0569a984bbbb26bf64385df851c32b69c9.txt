Funny thing was, first time I used PGP I was typing in a passphrase
and apparently PGP was doing something to the keyboard processor
on my laptop, because all of a sudden I thought I'd gotten bat's
ears - I could hear interesting new noises every time I pressed a
key, which I hadn't heard before (at least at an audible volume).

It occurred to me that typing in a PGP passphrase would be a
particularly bad time to increase the emissions....
