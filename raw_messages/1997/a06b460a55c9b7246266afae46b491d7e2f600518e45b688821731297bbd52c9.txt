This reminds me how I used to be consulting for a publisher, and came
across an MS (which never got published) written by some Mongol about
the history of Mongol conquests. It had a passage to the effect that,
"X-khan should have put down this rebellion and killed a million
people, like his predecessors would have. But he was soft, and this
caused the empire to collapse."
