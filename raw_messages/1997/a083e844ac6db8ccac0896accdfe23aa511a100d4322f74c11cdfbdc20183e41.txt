That vile salamander Gingrich, squeaker of the
House, is slobbering about a drug-free America
by the year 2001. What a dreary prospect! Of
course this does not include alcohol and tobacco,
of which the consumption will soar. How can a
drug-free state be achieved? Simple. An operation
can remove the drug receptors from the brain.
Those who refuse the operation will be deprived
of all rights.
