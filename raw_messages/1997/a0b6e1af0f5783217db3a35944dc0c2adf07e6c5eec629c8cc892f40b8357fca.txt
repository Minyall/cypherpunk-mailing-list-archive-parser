Now this is _really_ reading too much into things. As with several of your
"in the paragraphs Tim chose to elide" sorts of comments, you are imputing
motives that aren't there.

I mentioned Republicans and Democrats--and not Black Panthers,
Libertarians, Maoists, and Galambosians, for example--becuase these two
factions account for 99% of those in D.C., reporters included.

As to why I "elide" paragraphs, I do it as I always do it, to save space
and to adhere to the "never quote more than a half page of text" rule of
thumb.

(Something I wish more writers would do. When I see a screenful of quoted
material, I'll usually at least scroll down to the next page: if more stuff
is quoted, I'm often likely to just hit the "D" key.)

I never set out to elide material so as to misrepresent people. Granted,
there are some who think their point is automatically subtracted from if
every golden word is not quoted, but, like I said, I try to begin my
response to a post before a screenfull has been quoted, with the quoted
material only serving as a reminder to the reader of what the other person
had already said.
