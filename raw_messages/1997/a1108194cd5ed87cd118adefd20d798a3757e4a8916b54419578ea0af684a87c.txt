Just a few off the top of my head... 

An "Assassination Politics" home page, containing the story of Jim Bell,
all publicly available documents on the case, and links to all the
currently operating AP-Bots.

The alleged NSA Manual.

Favorite Cypherpunks Cryptographic Links, including helpful offshore
source code archives, and a pointer to the Cyphernomicon.

Seekret Skriptures ('Nuff Said)
