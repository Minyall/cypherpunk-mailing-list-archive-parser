Imagine how many tragedies could have been prevented if we had a
telescreen in every home and office.  Not just bombings, but murders,
spousal abuse, child abuse, drug use, uninformed political

years.  Until now this has been a manageable problem without mass
surveillance.  What happened?  Did the price of fertilizer drop?
