Very interesting.  That hasen't hit my area, as far as I know.

In addition, paging from a pay phpne (at least, where I'm located)
is of no use unless you're using a telephone number to alert the
owner of the pager to your location (which makes it easier to find
my friends, granted), since pay phones have been re-hardwired to
reject incoming calls.

Best wishes and fresh-roasted peanut taste,
