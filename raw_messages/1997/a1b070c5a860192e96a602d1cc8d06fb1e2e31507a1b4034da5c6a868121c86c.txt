The simple reason that a copy cannot be sent is that we have no such
copy. The Dutch police have asked us to remove these pages, because
they where being used to sell and distribute marihuana, hashish and
XTC. These drugs had been distributed to countries like France,
England and Japan. Through Interpol these countries had requested the
dutch police to take action against these pages. If Xs4all would not
have removed the pages we'd have been target of a criminal
investigation.
