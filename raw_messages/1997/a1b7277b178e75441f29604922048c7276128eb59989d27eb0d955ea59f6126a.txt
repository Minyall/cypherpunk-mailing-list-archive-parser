I was suspicious about this also, the CMR design makes much more sense
if this is the user requirement.  Binding cryptography also would make
sense for this requirement.

But the last time I expressed this suspicion on this list Jon Callas
clearly stated that this was not the case:

: Nope, that's not what we're arguing for. 

So it would appear that your suspicious are unfounded...

Okay!  Some one who is able to say the unpleasant words.  (I think
Lucky may have been hinting at this also).

If this is the case, I reckon it's still better to just escrow their
comms keys locally.  Put them all in the company safe, whatever.  To
go with this kind of a company with this kind of policy, I would
presume that sending or receiving super-encrypted messages would would
be a sackable offense.

However, there is an alternate reason for the CMR design, which you
don't include above (tho' you did I think discuss this earlier):

That PGP Inc thought CMR would be easier to implement within their
plugin API, and dual function crypto (file encryption, and email
encryption), and to cope with things like encrypt-to-self on Cc: to
self to keep copies.

Even with snoopware such as you describe, and companies with such
attitudes, there are other similarly easy ways to get data out: user
walks out of building with floppies.  In fact from memory I think this
was one you suggested: "frisbee DAT tape out of window to sweetheart"
or words to that effect.

Maybe.  If PGP Inc want to go this far, and design software with these
features, I reckon local key escrow is better.  However that is not
what they are saying.
