Hi there,


Are there any french cypherpunks or french
speaking canadian cypherpunks on this list ?

I have to discuss privacy on the net in french.
To read some articles on this subject would be very helpfull
to learn to use the right type of jargon: the dutch-french dictionary 
does not handle jargon of any type. 

Btw: did anybody scan their photo's of the HIP '97 (in this case
near the cypherpunkerstent-site) yet?
I couldn't find any.


Merci,

best regards,




Judith
