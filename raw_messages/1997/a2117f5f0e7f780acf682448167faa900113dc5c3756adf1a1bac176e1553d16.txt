The mathematics of sampling is well known, and is not the main source of
"lies." The law of large numbers, tendency to the mean, etc., are the usual
terms.

It's perfectly plausible, and common, to use samples of a few thousand to
get parameters (one of the few times this word gets used correctly) of a
population of millions, or even billions.

Bigger sources of lies are, of course, how questions are phrased.
