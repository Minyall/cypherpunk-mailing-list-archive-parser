I walked _through_ the housing projects in San Francisco at ~3:30 am on a
Sunday morning. Not only did I make it out alive, I made it out with a
couple of ice cold beers the enterprising homeboys hanging out at the
other side felt compelled to give me, since I turned down what they
originally offered me as a token of their friendship.
