Hi,
ever thougt about a "Teergrube" ?

It's a Patch for sendmail (and smail AFAIR).
It works as follows:
sendmail Messages normally look like this

250 nostromo.ino.de Hello fenkt@localhost [127.0.0.1], pleased to meet you

(Numbercode <Space> Human readable Text)

A Minus Sign instead of the <Space> means, that sendmail waits for the 
current receive to finish.
If such messages appear, say every minute, the Connection stays open for
several hours, without a Timeout from the remote host.

A Teergrube controls a therefor prepared MTA to produce such 
messages; depending on an predefined list of IP Numbers.
It doesn't block all mail from the site; it just makes Bulk (maximal
Amount in shortest possible Time) mail very difficult. A single User
from that site can still send mail to your site, the only thing is
the increased amount of time for delivery.
This is opposite to blocking sites (sendmail 8.8.5 *Scheckrules ); which
is just a self-defense, but not a Solution against UBE.

If you want to try it:
ftp://nutsy.han.de/pub/sendmail/

regards
Thorsten
