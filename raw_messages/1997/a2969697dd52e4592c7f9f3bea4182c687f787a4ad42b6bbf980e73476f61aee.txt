I do not have a B.A. in journalism and never attended an American high

Of course, I may be lying pathologically, and am probably drunk.

I rather like this. May I use this as my .sig line, or would you claim 
that it is protected by copyright? If so, could I purchase a license to 
use it as my .sig line? Just tell me where to send the check.
