Another recommendation is to subscribe.

Dr. Dobbs regularly publishes articles on encryption.  (There are a couple
of articles in this months issue, including an interview with Ron Rivest,
an article on the SSH protocol, and an article on the "block cipher square
algorythm".)  One of the few programming magazines I make sure to subscribe
to...

BTW, does anyone know of the strengths and weeknesses of the Square
algorythm published in the October Dr. Dobbs?
