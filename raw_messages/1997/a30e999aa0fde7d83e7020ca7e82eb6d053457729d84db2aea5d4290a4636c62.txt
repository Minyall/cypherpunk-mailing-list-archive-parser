All this assumes that Sandfort and Gilmore are real, sincere, and
somewhat honest people.  Which of course is not at all the case.

There is an agenda here, it has a hidden money trail, and the dis-
information put out as to the "real" purpose of the moderation should
be ignored, at least by intelligent people.

"Cypherpunks" who assume Sandfort is doing this out of the goodness
of his heart, or that Gilmore is providing a truly "free" service,
should get themselves some better drugs.

The very first test of credibility they failed was when they *renamed*
the original list and co-opted the original name for the edited list.
Don't trust 'em.
