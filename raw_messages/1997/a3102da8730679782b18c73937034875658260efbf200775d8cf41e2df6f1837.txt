I just learned that Brock Meeks and I won the top award for "Best Online
Feature" from the Computer Press Association during its 12th annual awards
ceremony in New York City. Our winning article was the investigative story
"Keys to the Kingdom" that exposed the hidden agendas of so-called blocking
software programs. It ran in CyberWire Dispatch last July.

The judges said we had:

 "produced an investigative piece on a serious and important
 subject--a rare feat in any media.  'Keys to the Kingdom' revealed
 that parental control software--which ostensibly filters out
 pornographic Internet sites--actually restricts access to all
 types of material both innocuous and important.  Thus, software
 users unwittingly restrict their rights of free speech and access
 to information.  This story, colorfully written and packed with
 details, raised this important issue to the online community and
 resulted in high profile follow-ups with mainstream media such as
 the Washington Post, New York Times and the Wall St. Journal."
