    John Young <jya@pipeline.com> purported to expostulate:

+To be sure, there are disclosures of red-faced liaisons, the sort
+recorded in hallowed halls and red-flocked boudoirs, that the  TLAs
+(mirroring the KGB) may be threatening Congress with,  in the
+eye-opening publications of Kalliste. See:

+   http://www.aci.net/kalliste/


    yes, to be sure the Harvard grad school educated Dr. Grabbe will
    have an opinion, delivered in a cloak, over a beer, at some rowdy
    bar in Sparks NV.  I fear he has delusions of Hunter S.

    hwoever, no one ever said his material lacked entertainment value;
    and all comedy is but the presentation of truth in a loosely 
    encrypted form.

+Blinking, recording, error-archiving, machines scare the shit  out of
+the the fork-tongue power-aphrodisiacal nymphomaniacs,  not to say
+that the rest of us would act so differently given a  seat in inner
+circles of jerks getting lapdanced on a magic  carpet -- who wants
+that in the National Archives of Perfidy?

    amen

    it is their blind fear that information will not only enlighten the     
    ignornant masses, but it will make them free, empowering them to     
    depose the bloated and mutated forms of power which wander the halls
    of the usurped republic's once hallowed chambers.
