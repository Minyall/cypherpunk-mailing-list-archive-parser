This isn't the first such conference. I went to a "Virtual Diplomacy" conf
a few months ago sponsored by a USG-affiliated (or funded) entity, at same
the Connecticut Ave hotel where the Presidential Inaugural Ball was held. 

In attendence were many ambassadors, generals, and assorted Foggy Bottom
bureaucrats. (Aside from the campaign trail, I've never before seen so
many security men in one place before.) And the topics were the same...
