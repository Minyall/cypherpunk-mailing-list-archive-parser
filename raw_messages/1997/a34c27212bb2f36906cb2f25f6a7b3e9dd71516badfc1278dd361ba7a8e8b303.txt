One knows one has come up with a potent weapon against one's enemies when
they begin to panic visibly like this.

The smell of fear is in the air.

The question is, will the ultimate internet trump card of a distractor
(Reference Godwin's law) divert the issue and save poor Mr. Thorn from a
policy which is certainly going to be a devastating impact on his public
exposure from here on out?

It does amuse me that George Bush and William Bennett are thrown out
for fear mongering purposes before Godwin's law is invoked.  One would
think Mr. Thorn had mistaken the list for a liberal stronghold.  Then
again, no one ever accused Mr. Dale "Snake Oil" Thorn of being afflicted
with a strong writer's sense of audience).
