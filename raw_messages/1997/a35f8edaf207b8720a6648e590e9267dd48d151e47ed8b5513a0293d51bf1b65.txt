I don't dispute you -- in the slightest -- that a brute force attack 
against a 2000-bit RSA key is functionally impossible today.  However, I 
don't think that a brute force attack is the most likely for a functional 
law enforcement (or national security) crypto lab.  Unless you think that 
today's algorithms and conventional random number generators are perfect
