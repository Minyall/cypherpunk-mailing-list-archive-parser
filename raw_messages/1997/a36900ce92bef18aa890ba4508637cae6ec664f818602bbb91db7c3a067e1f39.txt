I meant no insult to ferrets. I like ferrets. (Yes, I know, you know
ferrets, ferrets are friends of yours, and I'm no ferret. :-)) In fact, I
used ferrets on purpose, because I like them, and mere was a direct
reference to relative size and nothing else.

Could you admit, that in a showdown between a ferret and a lion, the ferret
would be best served using his brain rather than his claws?

I knew you could...
