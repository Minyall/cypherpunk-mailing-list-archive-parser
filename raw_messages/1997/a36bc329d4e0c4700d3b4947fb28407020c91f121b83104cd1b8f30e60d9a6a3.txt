Really? I avoid associating with those who mow my laws. Ha ha.

Seriously, I've never lived in Sweden or Singapore -- if I do, I'll get back
to the list on which I prefer -- but I'm troubled by the tendency of
Libertarians to err on the side of big business fetishism rather than civil
liberties. Both are part of the Doctrine, of course*, but I often hear them
argue that wild-west capitalism inevitably leads to political freedom -- so,
not to worry -- but rarely that political freedom invariably leads to
laissez-faire capitalism (so, not to worry). 

You might say that the latter is NOT TRUE. Well, right-o, but neither is the
former. Economic progress under a fascist regime leads inevitably to
political freedom? You guys actually make this argument.

*Yes, Libertarians criticize corporate welfare, but just because it corrupts
the notion that a person's entire worth can be summarized in a stock
portfolio.
