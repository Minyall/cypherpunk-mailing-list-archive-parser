This is interesting.

It seems that this set up provides a potential test case similar to
Phil Karn's one with the source code disks for Applied Cryptography,
only much smaller, and much more silly looking, which I think would be
a boon because the US government would have more difficulty defending
the ban on export of something which would take 30 seconds to type in.

The response to Phil's request to export the disks detailed that there
was significant value added in the text having been OCRed/typed in and
neatly arranged in files on a floppy.

The .sig is also a few seconds to scan with a bar code reader.  Bar
codes are also interesting in this context, they are machine readable,
and the 2D bar codes allow reasonable information density on a sheet
of A4.  Vince has a 2D barcode gif of the .sig on his Arms Trafficker
page.

If the perl rsa .sig were to be given permission to be exported in
electronic form, over the years since the original RSA sig I have
accumulated a collection of programs some donated by others, and a
couple more myself.  There is a good selection: IDEA, OTP, RC4, RC5,
DES, Diffie-Hellman.  Someone did an RSA keygen a while back.  These
vary in size and usefullness.  It would be relatively easy to create
something sufficiently functional and yet dangerous in a reasonably
few lines.  Full PGP compatible encrypt, signature check, and decrypt
looks doable in under 2000 chars or so, easily 1 A4 page of text, or
2D barcode.

That would be cool if accurate :-)
