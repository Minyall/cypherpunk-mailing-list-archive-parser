It's not "a lot" of sites - most of them are just making stupid noises.
Also, if a site does try to decide what its users are allowed to read,
it's too bad for the users - let them move to another site.

It might be a good site for an anon.penet.fi-like server (yes, I keep
promising to do something...)

I believe it's something like $25/month, not including $100 to InterNIC.
