* Reports surfaced in July from San Francisco social-service
organizations that poor kids who participated in a summer lunch
program were being served moldy green bologna in sandwiches (for
many of the kids, their main meal of the day).  According to Dr.
Johnson Ojo, the Health Department's principal inspector, what he
saw while investigating the complaints was "not that bad," and
anyway, moldy bologna will not cause food poisoning.
