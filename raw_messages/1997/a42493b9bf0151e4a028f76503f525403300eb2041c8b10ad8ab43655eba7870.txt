+Time to study and ponder the 1st Amend -- which, by the way, Matt Blaze
+did at the NYC crypto forum last night to challenge Charney and
+Denning. Matt pulled out a copy and cited it, which may be a good
+indication of what he knows that we don't about what's coming.

    not only the gawd-awful truth, but the gawd-awful _fear_.

    Bubba's hypocrasy at U. Conn will shortly be proved in spades
    as the first amendment falls "...in the interest of national 
    security...."

    or the evidence of NWMBs (New World Mega Business) with the 
    impending transfer of the US Patent office into a private 
    enterprise for the more expedient rape, pillage, and burn of 
    development by NWMBs.

    Government in the sunshine is a hoax --our so called government, a 
    government of greed and power, can not afford our sunshine.
