I've gotten several confirmations on this, and no negatives, so....

What I remember is that Hart and Schweiker were on one of the intel
committees in the early 1970's, working more-or-less side by side with
Frank Church et al, uncovering the real dirty laundry of the CIA and
its infiltration of nearly every college and important business and
media in the USA.  Hart's minor spillage to the press must have pissed
someone off, so they got the famous picture with Rice in all the papers,
and Hart's presidential bid went right down the toilet.

Now this same girl is on the righteous team, like Chuckie Colson?
Yeah, I believe it.  My you-know-what is starting to pucker up.
