A robin hood style hack would be preferable -- rescue Mrs Allen
without killing any Feds, not that they might not deserve it, but it
makes for better PR.

How about the model airplane to get a spread spectrum radio to Mrs
Allen, followed by a suprise tank attack, or APC if the Feds have no
hardware with them to touch a tank, drive right into her front room.


The Gandi style walk in, in numbers walk off with Mrs Allen :-)  What are
they going to do, shoot 1000 unarmed citizens?

This kind of tactic works quite well for tyrants who have become too 
civilised.
