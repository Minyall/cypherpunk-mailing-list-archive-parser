Now wait a minute.  You mean the National Security Agency?
If so, then Inman is probably not a faggot.  The military runs
that and they do not take faggots.  NSA is where I got my Top
Secret Crypto clearance from back in 1967.  Back then, all "crypto"
involved was the changing of about 28 wires each day in the old KL-7.

I remember the G2 government investigator asking me if I had ever had
any homosexual relationships.  Homosexuals are taboo as far as
clearances are concerned, because they are considered to be "at risk"
characters from the get-go.

If these guys are faggots, they must not be working for the U.S. Govt.
Federal policy does not grant Top Secret or above clearances to
homosexuals, I do believe.  At least the military doesn't.

But the question here is, are they really faggots?

Let's see how they answer that.  And remember, under our new protocol,
if you do not answer and say you are heterosexual, you are a -default-
faggot.  I want to hear what Peter Berger says.
