There you go, assuming DOS is the centre of the universe again.
I haven't seen this, but there's a pretty good chance that reformatting
the hard disk as a Linux partition and installing LILO would clean
that nuisance right up.  (If it didn't, you could probably just
use your favorite disk editor to find the Computrace code and zero
it out.)

OC this is all above the means of the average laptop thief, but the
dedicated ones probably have a staff techie.
