Which is of course where the protocol will fail. Any such system must be
resistant to operator compromise. A clean solution for a distributed data
haven resistant to machine/operators compromise would be to use a design
similar to the Anonymous Mailbox Servers I gave a talk on at HIP'97. 

Unfortunately, our project leader is very busy with his daytime job and it 
probably will be a while before we will see some demo sites up and running.

But it will happen :-)
