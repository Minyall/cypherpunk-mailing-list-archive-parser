Reading all the discussions about Jim Bell, I became interested in
the carbon fibers that Jim allegedly planned to use to disrupt the
work of compiters.

I would appreciate if anyone explained me how these fibers work, how
small and thin they are, and so on. I am also curious when and how this
use of these fibers was invented.

Thank you.
