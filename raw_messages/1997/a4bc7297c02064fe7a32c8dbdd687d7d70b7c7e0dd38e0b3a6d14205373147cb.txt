Yes, this is one of the problems. Earlier this year pedophile Chris Lewis
from Northern Telecom forged a bunch of spam e-mail to look like it came
from dm.com (my domain).  I got about 500 obnoxious e-mails, which I
semi-automatically responded to, and had a rather unpleasant conversation
with the assholes at my upstrea (PSI): "If you prove that this e-mail didn't
originate at your site, you will not be held responsible".
