It may or may not have been coincidence, but this happened
just before the Senate Confirmation hearings for
Anthony Lake as CIA director....

Lake was a big honcho in the recent Yankee takeover of Haiti;
Haiti is also in the news because one of their ex-generals,
who was part of the coup government that the US government supported
and trained in "anti-drug" activities, was busted for smuggling
several tons of cocaine and heroin into the US through Haiti.
