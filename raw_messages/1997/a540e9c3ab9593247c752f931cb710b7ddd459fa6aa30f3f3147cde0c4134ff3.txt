Well this code (an implementation of RSA) appeared in UK Computer
Shopper (largest readership computer mag in UK) by Charlie Stross:


print pack"C*",split/\D+/,`echo "16iII*o\U@{$/=$z;[(pop,pop,unpack"H*",<>
)]}\EsMsKsN0[lN*1lK[d2%Sa2/d0<X+d*lMLa^*lN%0]dsXx++lMlN/dsM0<J]dsJxp"|dc`


(actually it was some earlier version of the code)

Other media appearances include:

- A picture of the shirt in Nova magazine (a French publication)
- Shirt on Nulle Part Ailleurs (French cabal TV talk show)
- Shirt Japanese edition of Wired 
- Shirt in US version of Wired
- Richard White's tattoo of the program in UK Wired
- Shirt in BBC Open Univ program (educational program on encryption)
- Picture of label with program on New York Times

All of those apart from the last would probably be readable from the
source code, or from the bar code.  [Do KISS do image enhancement
also?  :-)]
