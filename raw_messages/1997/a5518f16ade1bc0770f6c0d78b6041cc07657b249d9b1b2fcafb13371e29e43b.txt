sure, but PGP has a certain name recognition that appears to extend
beyond the computing business community; ask your average cs
student what PGP is and they'll have heard of it *and* its
reputation. Ask them about Entrust and see if you get the same 
result. (I could do that here with my managers as a demo. :-)
Now figure out what your representatives in Congress know: even
less.

So, PGP gets cited by Congress as an example, and the other
corporations building in GAK or who have signed on to get that good
export license for DES don't.
