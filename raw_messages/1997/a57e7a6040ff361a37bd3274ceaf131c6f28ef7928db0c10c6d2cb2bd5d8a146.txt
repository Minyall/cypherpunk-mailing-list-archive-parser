I agree, Toto makes some of the best posts to the list, they are often 
just humurous one-liners but he also makes a lot of excellent 
observations and is very good at predicting the way things will go, as 
far as I`m concerned his posts are up there in quality with those of TCM, 
Adam Back, Dr.V, Bill Stwart, William Geiger and the other regular good 
posters.

Not his style (as far as I know it), but I agree there is no evidence to the 
contrary.
