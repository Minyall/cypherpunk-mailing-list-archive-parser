Great - cypherpunks are grouchy enough when they're not hung over :-)
(Actually, caffeine appears to be the drug of choice for many of us,
plus miscellaneous amino acids and other strange entropy-fighters...
but it was hard to pass up a straight line.)

Pipenet would be the right choice, if we had one, or DC-nets.
I don't know if the Onion Router stuff is still web-only or if it's
also supporting telnet applications.  Alternatively, someone could
build an IRC laundry without much difficulty, but you'd have to trust
the administrators.  

IPSEC provides privacy for communications,
but doesn't protect the connection information very well,
though IPSEC between firewalls is at least a partial mix.
Once IPSEC is widely deployed, it may be interesting to 
piggyback a pipenet-like system on top of it, basically a
bogus-traffic generator that's keeps packet levels fairly constant.
				Thanks!
