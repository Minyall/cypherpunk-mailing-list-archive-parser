TIS's press releases, and the article in the paper, imply that
TIS has been approved for 128 bit (uncrackable, except by prior
arrangement) cryptography...not just 56 bit.  They say, and they
should know, that you can export 56 bits now with just a "plan"
of key escrow, and that you can export more if you have a system...
which, what do you know, they have!
