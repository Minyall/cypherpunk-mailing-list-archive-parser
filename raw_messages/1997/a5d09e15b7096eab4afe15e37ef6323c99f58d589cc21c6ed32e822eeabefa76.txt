A couple of "me too"s:
Low volume spam via remailers increases the strength of the remailer
net. Yay!
Not allowing non-subscribers to post is not a problem is the mailing
list is linked to the usenet version. The people who read/post to
cypherpunks via a newsgroup interface now can just use the real
newsgroup. Also, people who don't get alt.* and don't want to use
dejanews can sub to the list version.
