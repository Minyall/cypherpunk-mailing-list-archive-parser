This would be interesting.

I think in principal this makes good sense. I am subscribed to toad and
cyberpass under 3 or 4 names and I find toad is by far the quickest in
turn around time to me. One thing of interest is that I was an early
subscriber to cyberpass as apache@quux.. and I get that mail fairly
promptly but under this nicks sub to cyberpass (much lower down on the
list of subscribers) the latency is usually in hours (4-8) with 
discussions sometimes over before I read them, whereas my sub to toad is
much prompter. I haven't done any statitics on this but I have been
watching as the posts come in and procmail tosses them into various
mailboxes.
