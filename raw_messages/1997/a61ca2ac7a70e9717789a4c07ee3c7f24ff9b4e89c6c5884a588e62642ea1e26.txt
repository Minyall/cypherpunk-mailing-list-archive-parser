On another mailing-list, there has been a lengthy discussion going
on about encrypting the list-traffic or not.
Although I personally agree, that encrypting a public mailing list
is kind of useless I would like to know from a technical
perspective if PGPdomo supports _both_ PGP and plain-text
simultaneously on the same mailing list (if no public key
available, send plain-text, otherwise encrypt).
Also, considering the time it takes to encrypt/sign a message for
each individual user (assuming they use pgp), isn't that too much
overhead for the list-server, when we deal with a few hundred
people and maybe traffic like on cypherpunks?

Any experiences from PGP-Domo users/admins would be greatly
appreciated.

Ciao
