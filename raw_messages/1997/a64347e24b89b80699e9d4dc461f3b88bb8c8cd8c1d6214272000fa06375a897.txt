Bullshit. I won't work with racist Japanese or racist Americans.
I've seen many business deals fall apart because of a few stupid
racist remarks.

And not all Japanese are racist pigs. And before you flank me,
I take back my previous remark where I insinuated that Americans
were racist. Not all Americans are racists. Just the stupid ones are.
