The law covers not only copies, but derivative works apparently.
Derivative works can violate the exclusive rights of the copyright holder.
If for instance I install software on a regular basis, but don't like the
slow MS installation routine, I can reverse engineer the process and
provide a derivative work that installs better.  

I have infact done this before and used the process to personally install
software on over 1,500 machines.  My thought has always been if the owner
of the machine had a license for the original software, my derivative work
that is preconfigured would be no harm in installing.  I've never bothered
to break the shrinkwrap each time I install software.  Under this law such
a thing would be considered a criminal act.  

A policeman observing me doing this copying of derivative works (whether or
not I had a license to make such a derivative work) could arrest me on sight.
