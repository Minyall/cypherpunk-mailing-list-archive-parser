    OPEN CHALLENGE TO YOU

over the last 30 years I have seen hundreds of new "unbreakable"
encryption programs; all of them have the same claims, the same
challenges, and the same secrecy.   but, with several notable
exceptions, each has contained a fatal flaw.  and I have seen
even my own "perfect" algorithms fall apart when I awake...

therefore, if you want any serious encryption experts to endorse
your product as having a factor of "unbreakability" by forcing the
level of brute force necessary to do so, provide the algorithm
and the associated source code to a few of us who enjoy breaking
algorithms as much as we enjoy trying to create them.

I dont have time, any more than my colleagues will have time, to 
waste on foolishness represented by your amateur challenge.

until you are willing to submit to an open review by your peers, 
your supposed encryption product is YAP. 

secondly, until your methodology is reviewed, we will consider 
the product a schill to Louis Freeh and other GAK and trap door
mandated system advocates.

if you wish to be considered a serious contender to replace RSA,
it's time to put your cards on the table; we see your nickel and
call.  in the matter of public encryption, there is no secrecy,
or there is no use.

your move.

    attila out...
