In that case, it is completely inaccurate to call PGP5.5 an existence 
proof.  In any case, the Blaze et al paper explicitely acknowledges 
that there is a "business case" for corporate level key recovery, and 
clearly distinguishes the LEA infrastructure model from more limited 
cases.

They could wave around TIS's products (designed by noted cypherpunk
Carl Ellison, I believe), or NorTel's Entrust, just as well.  Hell, in
a few months they may be able to wave around Adam Backs CDR product,
which also facilitates GAK -- access to communications is worse than
access to data, by some measure, but the LEA's will certainly be
grateful to Adam for his legitimization of Key Escrow...
