Hi,

blanc has put forth an interesting assertion relating to nationalism and the
Internet. If he is correct then we will have a one world government (ie
technocracy) whether we like it or not.

I agree with this assertion, which is why I hold that it is a waste of
bandwidth trying to 'control' the Internet or access thereof by citizens of
such countries as Singapore. Let them cut themselves off, it does us all a
service, and themselves a dis-service. If the citizens have as much
dissatisfaction as some members claim they will take care of it themselves.
When they get hungry for ideas, materials, and food they will change.

You can take a horse to water, you can't make him drink. You can drown him
however. Then you are walking, not riding.
