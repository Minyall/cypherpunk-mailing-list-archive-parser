Does the First Amendment prevent the Congress from passing
a law that would make it illegal for anyone who is outside the United 
States to
set up a web site in the U. S. in violation of a local speechcode?
For example, a German nazi organization could establish a WWW site in 
California out of reach
of German law.
Would it be constitutional to make a law barring  foreign citizens from 
violating the speech
codes of their home countries using a U. S. ISP?
