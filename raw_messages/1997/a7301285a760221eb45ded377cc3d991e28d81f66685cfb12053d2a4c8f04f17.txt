How "anonymous" (to what degree) are email messages
sent through the various remailers (Mixmaster,
EFGA, ml.org, etc)?

Have there been any studies done as to the degree
of anonymity obtained from using these remailers?
(I haven't been able to find any.)

And does anyone know of any studies being done
in determining whether or not content-based
analysis - diction and language - is a reliable
way to determine identity?

It seems that if Dick has a certain vocabulary,
uses a certain sentence structure, etc., and
regularly posts using a nym, that this form and
content could be traced to Dick, so the likelihood
of the post coming from him and not Jane would
be that much increased.
