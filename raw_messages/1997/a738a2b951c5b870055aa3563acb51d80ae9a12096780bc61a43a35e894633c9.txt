Dr. Dimitri Vulis writes:

: The IRS is accusing Vancouver resident James Dalton Bell, 38, of
: conspiring to overthrow the U.S. government. He appeared Monday afternoon
: in U.S. Distict Court in Tacoma and was accused in an 18-page affidavit. 

Since when was the IRS charged with enforcing the sedition laws?

Will the CIA now be collecting our taxes?

I still haven't heard any behavior on Bell's part described which would
constitute a crime under any applicable statue.
