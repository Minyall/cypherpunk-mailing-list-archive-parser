I like the little comment made in the first of MIB.  And I paraphrase.
Individuals are intelligent, people are stupid.

That is the defining element of mass hysteria.  The invidiual, if left alone
would probably settle down, maybe even realize that he or she was wrong.
The group with its anonymity in numbers, snowballs the emotions beyond the
control of one person.  I unfortunately chose bad examples.  Better ones
would be the LA Riots and the famous broadcast of War of the Worlds.
