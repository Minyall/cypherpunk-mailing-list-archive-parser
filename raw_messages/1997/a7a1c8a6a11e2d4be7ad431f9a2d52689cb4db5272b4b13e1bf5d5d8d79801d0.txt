Last Sunday on The Learning Channel there was a somewhat silly program
on information
warfare.  One thing which caught my attention however, was a claim by
Win Schwartau
(of inforwar fame) that NSA had placed narrow band transmitters in
printers which
wound up in air defense sites in Iraq.  Subsequently the transmissions
were used
for targeting durring the gulf war.  Has anyone heard of a separate
source for this?
