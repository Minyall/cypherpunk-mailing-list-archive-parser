I will be useing PGP to sign NoCeMs and I wish to maximise the number of
peaple will be able to use my posts.  For this I would have to use the old
size key untill PGP5.0 gets a signifigent market share.

Never trust a country with more peaple then sheep. Buy easter bilbies.
Save the ABC Is $0.08 per day too much to pay?   ex-net.scum and proud
I'm sorry but I just don't consider 'because its yucky' a convincing argument
