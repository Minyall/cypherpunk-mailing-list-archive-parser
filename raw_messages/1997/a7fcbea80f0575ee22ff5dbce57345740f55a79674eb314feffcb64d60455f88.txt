Yes, PGP 5.0i does support the RSALIB. Even though you can generate 
RSALIB based keys, why do so when there is a newer and better algorythm 
supplied with the 5.0? Albiet it is nice to have the support as not 
everyone has converted over, I still prefer the newer one. 4096 bit keys 
are going to be rather hard to break in this lifetime. :-)
