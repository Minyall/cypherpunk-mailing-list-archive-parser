Cypherpunks is not dead, although it will take the newly created
online communities to pick up steam. Cypherpunks mailing list simply
expanded and took another form.

Again, thanks to John Gilmore for running this list for years. His
job required a lot of dedication and effort and I am thankful to him
for what he did for it. cypherpunks@toad.com enhanced my understanding
of reality immensely.
