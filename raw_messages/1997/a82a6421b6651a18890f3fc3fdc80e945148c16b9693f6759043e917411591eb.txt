I thought I'd pass on this quote:

"Four more jeeks run up to join them.  Y.T. counts two more revolvers and a
pump shotgun.  Any more of these guys and they'll be able to form a
government."

  - Snow Crash p84, Neal Stephenson

I have always thought that what the newspapers call "anarchy" is not the
absence of government, but rather the presence of too many competing
governments.

I prefer nonviolent solutions myself.
