Bad example, Timmy.  I used to hang out with the standards people and
yes, a lot of government purchases (both US and non-US) are mandated
to comply with ANSI and ISO standards, which is why vendors push so hard
to have their implementation declared the standard. Yes, U.S.Gov't does
buy certified ANSI C, Fortran, etc compilers, not to mention ADA.
