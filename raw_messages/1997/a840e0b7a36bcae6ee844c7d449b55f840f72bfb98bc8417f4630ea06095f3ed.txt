I'm not a subscriber to the CypherPunks list, but I have been monitoring
the emissions from John's computer screen, and I would just like to say 
that I agree with him, wholeheartedly. I often tell my superiors that 
there are much better ways to be spending taxpayer money.

I am not alone in my agreement with most of what is being said in this
thread.
The spook supplying heroin to Adam Back's lover agrees with most of this
thread, as does the spook peeking through Eric's window (although she
disagrees with the suggestion to "let Eric's unit survive unmolested").
The one exception is the grandson of Patton who is doing surveillance
on Monty. His method is quite simply to beat Monty to the phone.
