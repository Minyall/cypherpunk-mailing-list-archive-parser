Tsk, Tsk, A cyppherpunk not knowing who Wiliam F. Friedman was?  Author of many
texts on cryptography, ... was a master at cryptanalysis during the two World
Wars and could be called the father of American cryptography.

around 1917, became the head of the Department of Ciphers. During this time
America became engaged in World War I. Intercepted messages were given to
Friedman and he was successful in breaking each and every one of them. 

Probably wrote analysis of early US military crypto systems that the
reference was drawn from.
