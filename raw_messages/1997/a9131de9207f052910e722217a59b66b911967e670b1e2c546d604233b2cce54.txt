Nope, I didn't. Nowhere is the Constitution does it say that citizens have
a right to welfare money. The State is free to make virtually anything not
expressly prohibited by the Constitution a condition for providing welfare.
Including that the recipient takes positive steps to forestall the breeding
of further welfare recipients. Even making castration a precondition for
receiving welfare would be constitiutional. [I do not advocate such a step].
