In early April we posted a message which referred to
William H. Payne's paper "Public Key Cryptography is
Easy to Break."

Mr. Payne has provided the 1990 5-page draft paper 
along with other documents, which we've added to the file
at:

   http://jya.com/snlhit.htm

The paper is part of several attachments supporting
Mr. Payne's charge against Sandia National Laboratory. 
Other documents in the file help explain why the paper 
is sensitive to SNL and perhaps to NSA.
