Well, even if the establishment weren't as screwed as it is, you'd still have a
few purely sadistic people (or people maligned by someone other than Uncle Sam
and his relatives) attacking the infrastructure...enough of them that the
infrastructures (that's one damn cool word) would still need good cryptographic
protection.

Screwballs with nukes they may be, but their job is still to defend the U.S.; 
you'd think you could at least trust them to keep the power/water/phone lines
from being a target for an attack.
