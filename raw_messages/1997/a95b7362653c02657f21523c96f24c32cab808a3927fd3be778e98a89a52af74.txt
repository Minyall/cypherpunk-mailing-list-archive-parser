An interesting aside.  A reliable source tells me that the thing that
pushed XtatiX.com over the edge was a threat by US Customs to seize all
their equipment for

"Investigation of an International Child Pornography Ring" 

Note this is merely an "investigation,"  not even an allegation that a
crime has actually occurred.  Apparently, they seize all your assets, then
investigate, and keep them regardless of the outcome.

XtatiX, consisting of two not particularly wealthy guys and a Linux box,
had no alternative but to remove from their system free speech the Feds
didn't like, in order to remain in business.
