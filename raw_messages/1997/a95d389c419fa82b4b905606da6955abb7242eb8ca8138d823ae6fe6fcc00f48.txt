The show is Politically Incorrect, on ABC at 1:00am.  This show aired on
March 21st (which is the night of the 20th):

Here's what Bill Mahar said (it doesn't parse well):

"Are there any users of cellular phones here? Because people are concerned
(2-3 people finally clap) I knew it was a sophisticated group. Um, no.
People are concerned about the privacy you know. Newt Gingrich, what
happened to him. So a couple of months ago they set out to make these
things a lot better so that you couldn't break in. Well. Put in a new code.
Yesterday, a team of computer experts announced that they had already
cracked the electronic code. And sadly, none of them knew how, still, to
unhook a bra."

All right, so it's not a GOOD joke.  But still....
