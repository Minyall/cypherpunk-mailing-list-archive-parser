  I am tired of the constant, snide implications on the CypherPunks
list that the government might be holding something back from the
American citizens.
  Just because the announcement of startling new breakthroughs in
such things as 'cold fusion' and the like quickly turn into 'cold
silence' and denials is no reason to think that those in power
are using the latest developments in technology to increase their
hold on society, instead of using it for the benefit of all of
mankind (and the 'broads', too).

  Some asshole on the list (it might have been me, before my 90 days
in solitary confinement in a cell next to Jim Bell) even went so
far as to suggest that if the secret government laboratories were
releasing details of a new radar that could track movements of
people through stone walls, etc., that they might have even more
startling technology at their fingertips.
  What a crock! To suggest that people who are willing to sacrifice
their own integrity and moral values in order to assassinate others
for our benefit would then turn around and subject their own 
citizens to the same self-serving, arbitrary atrocities is nothing
more than the ranting of anarchistic lunatics.
[LUNATICS! DON'T _USE_ THAT WORD! I DON'T _LIKE_ THAT WORD! IT MAKES
 ME WANT TO.....AAARRRGGGHHHHH!]

  Thank you, I'm feeling much better, now...
