First, I invite ayone who cares to to take IE off a Mac and run it on a
PC.  Same name does not mean same product.

Second, MS is moving (and well along the way) to IE as the directory
display portion of the OS.  In my book that makes it part of the OS.

Third, I have not heard of exclusive contracts, just complete package
contracts. 

Fourth, What exactly do you mean by "run independently" of the OS?  Is
IE now available so I don't have to load the slime Win 95?

Fifth, When it comes to contracts, one should only sign what one is
willing to live with.  If the poor computer companies don't want to
supply IE then let them run over to Cupertino and license Mac OS
instead.
