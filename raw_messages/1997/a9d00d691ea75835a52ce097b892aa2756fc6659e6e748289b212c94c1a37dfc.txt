This Graham-John character may just be one of the best autobots

content than on-the-scene responses by Sirhan Sirhan or John Hinckley.
Obviously not hand-typed by a human.

Platt sounds like the ideal candidate to start another disinformation
periodical.  Any guesses as to who his backers will be?

P.S. Thanx for the L.L. interviews.  I hope to build these into
another good text database.
