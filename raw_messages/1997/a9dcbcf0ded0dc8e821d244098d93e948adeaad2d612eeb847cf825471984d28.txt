A colleague of mine down the hall at Money magazine just stopped by and
asked for help on a Net-gambling story. I think she's interested in the
offshore issues -- but this being Money, I think they're looking for
horror stores as well. (Junior running up a $20,000 tab on Daddy's credit
card. You know the drill.) I already gave her my copy of the July Wired
with Charles Platt's article on FC97, told her about Sen. Kyl's bill, and
gave her the URL to MSNBC's special report.

If anyone wants to give her a call, email me for her phone number.

PS: Thanks to everyone who responded about the digital cash story for
Money earlier this summer. I printed out all the responses I got and
forwarded them along, but the story got killed...
