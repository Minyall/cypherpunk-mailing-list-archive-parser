And of course, Tim May, and John Gillmore.

"Economics" was a poor choice of word on my part, and you make a good
point.  However, IMO all three examples you give are clearly more 
motivated by power and gamesmanship than they are by economics.  The 
Kennedys, especially, long ago switched to politics.

In general, past a certain level of wealth people remain in the game 
because they enjoy playing it, not because they need the money.  
Prior to that level they seek money because they believe they need 
it.  Some people find it hard to make that transition, and continue 
to believe they need money long after all objective reasons have 
disappeared.
