    aw, come on, Kent --you remind me of the faggots dancing around
    Harvard Square in 1960 when TOCSIN was in its heyday before it
    became SANE.   

    jocks used to go down there on Saturday mornings to bait them
    into attacking so the Irish cops could bust them.  some peaceniks
    managed to be rather violent with their placards.

    If you have not figured it out --government is the *enabler*
    to corrupt absolute power.

    I just love idealistic peaceniks, the better ones taste just like 
    chicken.
