While hackers were getting busy, the crypto honchos were
getting dissed in D.C. Apparently, a group of bigwigs,
including Louis Freeh of the FBI, William Crowell of NSA,
Peter Neumann of SRI, and Ray Ozzie of Lotus, flew all the
way out to the nation's capital for a Senate Judiciary
Committee hearing on cryptography, only to be informed 20
minutes before the meeting that it had been canceled.
Grumbling ensued as the various participants stormed back
to Dulles airport. The meeting may pick up after the July 4
recess.
