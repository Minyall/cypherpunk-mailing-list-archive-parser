                             PRETTY LOOSE PRIVACY
[...]
   Published: April 2, 1996
   BY SIMSON L. GARFINKEL
[...]
   Viacrypt, an Arizona company that sells the popular program Pretty
   Good Privacy, or PGP, last month announced a new version tailored for
   businesses. The new program allows companies to ''decrypt'' -- and
   then read -- information sent to or received by employees without
   their knowledge or consent.
[...]
   An employee's right to privacy is nebulous at best. The Electronic
   Communications Privacy Act of 1986 specifically allows companies to
   monitor the electronic mail of their own employees.
   
   That has not stopped Zimmermann from complaining loudly about the PGP
   name being used in a product that allows someone other than the author
   or the intended recipient access to information. Viacrypt owns the
   licensing rights to sell the commercial versions of PGP.
   
   ''PGP does not stand for back doors,'' said Zimmermann. ''I don't mind
   if they sell a program that has a back door in it, but they shouldn't
   call it PGP.''
[...]
   ''If your employer can read your mail anytime he wants, without your
   permission, that goes against the spirit of the PGP trademark,'' said
   Zimmermann.
