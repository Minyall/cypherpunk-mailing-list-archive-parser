I don't know which airlines you fly, but the ones I am familiar with ask
these questions at the baggage counter (checked luggage) and gate (carry-on
items).  Since you are supposed to be at the airport one hour before
departure, in most instances if you get to the counter or gate less than 10
minutes before take-off your reservations lapse (by Fed rules) and  are no
longer requred to board you. If they are forced to search you luggage they
will, legally, allow the plane to depart w/o you.
