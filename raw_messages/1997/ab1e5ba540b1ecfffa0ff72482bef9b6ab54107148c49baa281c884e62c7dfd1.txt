Yes.  Declan is correct.

For anyone else who is confused, I'm not a beltway person, and I have no 
association with EFF.  I'm not a policy analyst.  I'm a software developer.  I 
work for a living and pay my own way.  

I do have opinions.  Beliefs in privacy, free speech, and core belief that 
technology and the internet is good.  I pursue this as a hobby to the best of 
my ability.  I take advice from others, and try to get them to help educate me 
in matters I do not understand.  Once I act on my opinions and beliefs, I tend 
to win.
