Subject: any off-line client for DES crack?

I'd like to train a couple of off-the-net computers to crack 
DES.  Unfortunately there appears to be no off-line client 
which uses files, so I can sneakernet a big batch of "try this
keyspace" requests, leave it running for a few weeks, and then
sneakernet the results back.


Yeah, I could hack it myself, but I thought I'd recommend the 
idea to the people who are actually coordinating the searches.


(Of course the user should be able to tell if the client has 
scored the key.  Some users may well decide not to bother 
sneakernetting "not found" results back to the Net, but will 
check to see if their client won.)


(In case you are worried, I am good net.citizen who trims 
Newsgroups: lines, is careful not to take the name of Kibo in 
vain, and who never trolls for newbies by posting "follow-up to 
this article to get free nude picture of Sandra Bullock!".  So
_I_, therefore, would faithfully sneakernet my "key not found"
results back to the Net.)
