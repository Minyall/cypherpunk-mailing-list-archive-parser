It is time to spread some new propaganda,
especially in America.

One of you with some money should get bumper
stickers made up. Make them look nice, with
a nice clean font and very simple, say dark
lettering on a white background, noble looking.

Have them say this:


    I am an anarchist.
    I do not believe in government.


Simple. Gets the point across.
