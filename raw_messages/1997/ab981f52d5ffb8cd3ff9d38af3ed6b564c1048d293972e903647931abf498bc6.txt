Oh, I agree. I *definitely* think we need to give something to law
enforcement...

THE TOP TEN THINGS WE NEED TO GIVE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT
By Lizard

10)A clue
9)A good kick in the pants.
8)A copy of the US Constitution, and I don't mean the aircraft carrier.
7)Footage of Mussolini hanging upside down with his intestines draped over
this face, as a reminder of the fact that sooner or later, even the most
downtrodden people will say 'enough is enough'.
6)A picture of Aldrich Ames labelled "Would you give YOUR keys to this man?"
5)A pile of "This T-shirt is a munition" T-Shirts.
4)Another clue. (Take two! They're small!)
3)A copy of '1984', along with a note reading "This was a warning, not a
blueprint."
2)An English-Navajo dictionary.

And, lastly...
1)A boot to the head. (Nah-nah)
