You're an LEA, getting plump feeding off the fat of the land. You are
confiscating vehicles, homes, money, businesses, every time you find
someone in possession of a joint.
The citizens are getting a little edgy about this, when someone murders
an 11 year old boy, creating a big stink in the community.

The chief suspects are the Ramseys, but the local cops hand you a
quick and easy fix, so that you can get back to your more profitable
pursuits.
What do you do?

Not that I'm cynical, but I've seen this shit go down too many times,
from the inside, so I don't necessarily suck on every spoon stuck in
front of my face by the mainstream media.
