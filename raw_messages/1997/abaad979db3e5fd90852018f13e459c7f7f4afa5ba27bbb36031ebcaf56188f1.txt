 .. among other things, I teach school. Mostly one on one tutoring and 
occasional Calculus or Physics fill-in ... (nice when you already have a 
pension to be able to work leisurely and play with your computer!) I am 
in the process of rereading "Fahrenheit 451" - the recent printing  of 
this in paperback features a Marquis that says somethig like "Now, more 
relevant than ever" - as much as I hate having someone else tell me what 
to think ... they certainly seem to be right. It has been over twenty 
years since I read it and now ... it surely seems to be right on the path 
mentioned above and then some ... William Lederer also had it right years 
ago when he penned "A Nation of Sheep"
