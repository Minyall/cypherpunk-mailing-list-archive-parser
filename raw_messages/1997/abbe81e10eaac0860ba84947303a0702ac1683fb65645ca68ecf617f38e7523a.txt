Hey, it beats the stomping of jackboots and shouts of 'Sig Heil!'

Of course, you have an unimpeachable claim, although 'Geiger the III' is a
rather odd last name for an American Indian.

Lets see.  Are you aware of how Texas, California, and New Mexico came to
be part of the US?  Probably doesn't matter - those dang furriners had no
right to the lands they lived on anyway, once the U.S. decided it wanted them.

I don't find it at all surprising that people who live in a 'shithole' want
to leave.  It is easy for you to suggest that they overthrow their
government - after all, you won't be the one facing a Mexican prison.  

This is going way off topic at this point, and I am at fault for starting
it.  I was just distressed at how rapidly this list seems to be turning
towards hate and bigotry.  Lets take it to email.
