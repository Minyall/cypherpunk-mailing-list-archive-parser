Often we have a source of entropy whose output we use as the input to
a secure hash function.

Does it matter if the hashing function is secure?  I don't think so.
All that really matters is that the function hashes evenly so that any
input string is about as likely as any other input string to result in
a particular hash.  Even if the hash function is weak and collisions
can be found, if it is even the same level of entropy is still
available.

Have I got this right?
