Does anyone know where I can get a PGP Signature on the Net.  I usually
just read the mailing lists posts BTW I think this is my first Post on
this list.  I'm a begginer to 
Cryptography and when I heard about it sounded like a cool subject and it
is!!!!!  I f somebody could please e-mail me some more info on crypto and
PGP Signatures.  I would really appreciate it.
