It seems to me that that whole "survey" was a classic example of "push"
polling.

That is, a poll where leading and inflamitory questions area asked about a
political opponent so that the respondent is incited to vote against that
opponent.

Maybe there should be a cypherpunk counter-poll.

Any ideas for questions?

Cheers,
Bob
