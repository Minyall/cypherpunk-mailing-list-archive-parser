I can give one minor example from memory...

The recipe for Nitrogen Tri-Iodide has four steps to it.  The first two
make the proper chemical.  The second two are drying agents that will make
the stuff blow up in your face.

The book has a number of other risky recipes.  It also contains the
infamous (false) "Banana Peel" rumor about how smoking banana peels can get
you high. A recipe for LSD that is pretty poor.  A bunch of other bogus
drug stuff... 

There are much better sources for info on explosives.  The government
publications do a pretty good job.  (I have seen a few on "how to make
explosives from common items" and the like.  Training for military
personnel trapped behind enemy lines and traing local governments for
uprisings and the like...  The CIA even did a comic book for distribution
in South America.
