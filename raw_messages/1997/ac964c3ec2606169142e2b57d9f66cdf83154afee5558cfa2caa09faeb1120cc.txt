Will you give this up aleady? What, exactly, are you trying to accomplish?

This briefing was NOT about the "white compromise", it was about the
Cox-Wyden "Internet Freedom and Family Empowerment Act" in July of 1995.
As you may recall, the Cox-Wyden bill, which passed the house 420-4,
prohibited the gvt from imposing content regulations on the Net.  CDT did
indeed strongly support the Cox-Wyden bill.

The "White Compromise" was brought together and offered at the 11th hour of
the conference committee negotiations in December of 1995.  There was never
a press conference about it. And, for the record, CDT's policy post about
the White bill can be found at http://www.cdt.org/publications/pp311204.html

Unfortunately, so is forwarding completely false and misleading information
Declan.  This is just so foolish.
