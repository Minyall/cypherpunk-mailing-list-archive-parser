Why not go one step further and get the strong crypto supporters in the
Senate to tack on an ammendment to the McCain-Kerrey-bill forcing the FBI
and our most secret security agencies to use the very same

organizations themselves) for all their encrypted data storage and
communications traffic and requiring regular GOA compliance reviews.
