Call me crazy, but is there any way to set up an anonymous moderator
scheme? The messages hit toad.com, and are forwarded via the remailer
network to someone. The actual moderator can change from time to time. 
Only posts that aren't "preapproved" are actually forwarded to the
moderator. The moderator approves the postings by signing them with a PGP
key. It's then sent back through the network to another address at
toad.com, and passed on to the list members. 

Or does this just put toad.com in hot water?
