How about if it is an employee of yours, using your computer
equipment, that sent the message, in explict contradition to your
companies stated policy? How about if it is your 5 year old child who
just sent a 5 megabyte spam to 500 groups? What if the message is
forged in such a way that it looks exactly as if it came from you?
What if the sender asks you to cancel it because they don't know how?

Absolutist thinking is *almost* always wrong :-)
