A news report today that 22 new members have joined
the Key Recovery Alliance, now 61 total. A meeting
in Toronto on April 24-25 reviewed committee
reports on key recovery prospects for "facilitating
the wordlwide use of strong cryptography."

And, two Federal Reserve economists claim that
smart cards and E-cash have a ways to go to
compete with well-tested and trusted paper bucks.
No, they smirk, these views do not protect the FRB's
central bank hegemony.
