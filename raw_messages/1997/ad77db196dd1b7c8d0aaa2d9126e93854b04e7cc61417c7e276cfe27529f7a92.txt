This is my favorite example of the Kafka-esque absurdity of
export controls

>From England, I can export strong crypto electronically with no 
problem. The same crypto, printed as source code, is restricted.

>From the US, I can export printed strong crypto with no problem.
The same crypto, in electronic form, is export restricted.
