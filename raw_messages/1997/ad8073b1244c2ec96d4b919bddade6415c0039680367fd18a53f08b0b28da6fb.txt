Next you'll be telling us that PGP doesn't really use Skipjack.  ;-)

_Of course_ it isn't Clipper.  But, it's like Clipper in the most
important way: it is surveillance friendly.

The use of Clipper was not compelled.  We hated it because if it were
used to any degree at all, its use would become mandatory.

PGP Inc.'s Big Brother line of products play the same role Clipper
did, only they are wrapped up in PGP Inc.'s "Good Guy" image.  PGP
Inc. may succeed where William Clinton and The Spooks failed.

Were we to behave consistently, we would treat the company with the
same level of trust and respect the present administration receives.
