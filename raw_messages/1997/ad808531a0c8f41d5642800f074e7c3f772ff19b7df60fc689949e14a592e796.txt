A credit card passes for proof of age?  I had a credit card as soon as I
was old enough to drive (it made my father's job of family accounting
easier when all of the gas payments showed up on the credit card bill)
at age 16.

A larger problem I see with credit cards being used as a form of ID is
that it may become comon practice to ask for name and credit card number
at the enterance to every contravercial site.  If so, people will begin
to abuse the system, as it is a very simple matter to start logging all
names, credit card numbers, and expiration dates of people who enter
your site, and then make charges to their credit cards.
