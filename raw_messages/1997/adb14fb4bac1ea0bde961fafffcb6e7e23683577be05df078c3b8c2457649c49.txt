Can we "can" the "SPAM" discussion?  (ouch)

As one who has beaten this subject to death on this list in the past, I 
can attest that there is little new ground to cover, few minds to be 
changed, and no relevence to crypto.
 
Perhaps we can start a " SPAM" mailing list. I wonder if the Hormel folks
have a sense of humor? ;) (Is it Hormel? Can Dimitri get in touch with 
his buddy Spamford and get the real story?)

(Disclaimer)
OTOH, I support your right to freely express your opinions in this forum 
and wouldn't dream of censoring you.
