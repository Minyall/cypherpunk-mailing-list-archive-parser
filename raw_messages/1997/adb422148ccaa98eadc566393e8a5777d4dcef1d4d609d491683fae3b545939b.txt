Well on my .22 I slide bullets down the loading tube and manualy cycle the
bolt. On the M1 carbine I simply insert the clip and cycle the bolt. On a
HK-33 or G3 you do the same sort of thing. Those are the ones I know how to
work because I have used them.

In general the safety locks the trigger and firing-pin mechanism not the
loading or chambering mechanism. I don't know of a safety on a rifle that
blocks the bolt. But I ain't a gun nut (IAAGN).

Revolvers are self-explanatory. Automatics generaly block the trigger and
firing-pin mechanism, again not the bolt. Just grab that damn thing above
the barrel and pull toward yourself with a loaded clip. When it releases
should be loaded and on safety. Certainly works that way on the 1911 that I
use on occassion where the hammer action is blocked (hint - don't drop it
when cocked and safetied). I don't think I have ever shot an automatic that
didn't work that way (all 3 or 4 of them). Again, IAAGN.
