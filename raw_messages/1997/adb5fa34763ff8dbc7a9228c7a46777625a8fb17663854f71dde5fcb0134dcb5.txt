There are some third party programs that make using PGP with Agent easy.  I
use PGPeep(  http://kakadu.rz.uni-passau.de/~w4hoff01/pgpeep/ ).  With it,
all I have to do to decrypt a message or verify a signature is hit
CTRL+ALT+Enter.  It's not as good as having true integration, but at least
I don't have to copy to the clipboard each time.
