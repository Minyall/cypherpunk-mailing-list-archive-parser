He didn't say it was a better thing to do.  He said he was coming to understand McVeigh's actions.

It is important that everyone from the uninvolved on up to the ruling classes understand that we are reaching a point where laws won't "work" anymore because power is devolving down the heirarching to the fundamental organizational unit -- the individual.  If two guys with $2K to spend can take out a building or someone else with ten minutes to spend and a Net connection can render export controls ineffective then power relationships have changed.

The faster our "rulers" and their "ruled" understand this, the lower the total body count.  They simply don't have the power any more.  It's gone.

Tim is helping (in his way) to convince others of the facts of the matter.  Dramatic statements carry the message better.

The more people who are convinced that politics is dead, the faster the corpse will decay and the smoother the transition.
