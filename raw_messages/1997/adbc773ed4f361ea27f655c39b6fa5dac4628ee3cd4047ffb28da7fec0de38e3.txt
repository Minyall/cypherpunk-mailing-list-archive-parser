In a NYT report today on a "mysterious" blast in the
Australian outback in 1993, there's mention of "seismic
weapons" and research on them by Nicholas Tesla
in the 1930s.

Would any of our weapons connoisseurs have more
info on what these are and how they were supposed to
work? Electrical, chemical, nuclear?

That Aussie blast has still not been identified except
that it was something in the nuclear weapon, earthquake or 
meteorite range. The Arum sect, which owned 500,000
acres in the viciniity, was a suspect for a while but later 
cleared, although it was looking into seismic weapons.
