I've consulted for lots of weird people, from Baha'i to Serbs to Black
Panthers, but I'd be reluctant to knowingly work for any Japs because Japs are
onboxious and dishonest and I don't like them. I used to work with a guy who
did a lot of work for AUM, who I think did a good job, but should have gassed
many more Japs. I'm further convinced that Japs are shit by their postings to
this list. It's such a pity the Jap cowards capitulated before Truman had a
chance to drop a few dozen more nukes on them! We also shoud have used poison
gas on them, just like they used it on Chinese civilians. We also should have
executed all of their POWs, just like they tortured to death most of European
POWs. The Japs got off way too easy for their crimes in WW2. Why wasn't your
silly little Emperor Hirohito (spit) hanged with the other war criminals? Now
the Japs are hoarding up all the available plutonium, obviously preparing to
nuke China and other neighbors (and possibly U.S.) in a likely future war.

By the way, someone I know in real life claims that they've seen the "Silicon
Valley don't hire list" and I really am on it. :-)
