Thanks to John Gilmore we offer a 44-page package of
PGP's court filings in response to RSA's suit:

   http://jyx.com/rsavpgp2.htm

Exhibits of early letters among Cylink, RSA, and PGP preceding 
the suit are of interest, one of which has been provided before
by Greg Broiles at parrhesia.com.

We've also put on JYX the AOL-axed RSA v. PGP docs, linked
to this latest: the RSA suit and the Lemcom License.

A bit more from JG will be ready in a few days.
