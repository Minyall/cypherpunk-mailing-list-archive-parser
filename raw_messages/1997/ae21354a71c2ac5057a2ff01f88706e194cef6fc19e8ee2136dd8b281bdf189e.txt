Attila's not anonymous - he's a regular poster, and has been
for long enough to build up some reputation around his penname.

Mostly.  But you're presumably advocating government by humans.
And while government is an abstraction of the activities of a 
lot of individual humans, governments do tend to accumulate
and abuse power, and tend to reach a point where they're more
interested in maintaining and increasing that power than in
any legitimate activities like protecting life, liberty, and property.
Consider the drug war, the military-industrial complex,
the fraction of your income that's paying for government,
and compare that with 200 years ago...

Also power _attracts_ the corrupt, and the corruptible.
As Henry the K said, it's the ultimate aphrodisiac.
