I fear such draconian measures are inevitable as long as the "lobbying"
group CAUCE is around.  They actively discourage the adoption of technical
solutions; favoring legislation.  And since CAUCE was formed by "Net
people", it will be seen (and spun in the press) as though we actually
welcome such legislation.

How does PGP do it with their policy enforcer?

I don't see why.  Just have the proxy work both ways.  Isn't it possible
for the proxy to keep track of which message came from which address and
relay server requests back to the right user?  (I'm not familiary with how
sendmail works, so I'm probably missing something)

How many of the popular email pacakges have support for plug-ins?
Netscape Communicator is the only package (that neophytes will use) I know
of that doesn't support email plugins.  Perhaps in this case a small proxy
could be installed on the user's machine.  The only thing it would have to
do is generate hashcash for outgoing messages.

What's the difference between this and simply keeping track of how many
messages each user sends in a 24 hour period and blocking people who are
obviously spamming?
