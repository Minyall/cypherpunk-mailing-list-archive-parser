Maybe what John was saying is that you're being co-opted. Brought into the
inner circles, shown the secrets, wined and dined (and whined)...maybe
you'll even be invited to Fort Meade for a screening of the "If you only
knew what we knew" video.

When you have dinner with judges, cops, senators, narcs, and other such
insiders, and much of it is "deep background" (or whatever such briefings
are called), and you have to promise to only spin the story in certain
ways...well, the result is pretty obviously that you're just an outlet for
the agitprop machine.

I'm not saying you've sold out yet; I don't really know you, so I wouldn't
know how vulnerable you are. But you're sure showing all the signs of
becoming just another Washington Insider.

One way they buy people--very reminiscent of the methods used to recruit
spies--is to feed reporters with information they can't get anywhere else,
and swear them to secrecy. This ties them up in complicated webs of trust,
mistrust, and deceit, and makes the reporters more dependent on them for
future stories.
