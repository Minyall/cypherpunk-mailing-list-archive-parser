Yeah, and the way it works is that some 3rd party buys a trunk from the
local RBOC and then sets up their PBX and then re-sells the lines. Here's
your test for them. Buy a line and have them list it in the RBOC directory
under 'anonymous'.

Not the same thing as going directly to the RBOC and having them list your
number under 'anonymous'. THAT is the litmus test for true anonymous
phone service *and* to make it equivalent to an anonymous remailer with
address persistance.
