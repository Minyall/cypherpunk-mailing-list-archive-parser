  Since Dr. Crispin, like old Doc Hettinga, is making claims of being
able to recognize the subtle nuances of the psychological states of
other list members (patient May, in particular), I wonder if Kent is
equally adept at spotting the subtle psychological inferences in a
previous post.

  I agree with Tim (whether he said yet it, or not) that the 'feared'
is quickly becoming the 'undeniable.' The speed and volume of the 
'openly blatant' lies and increasingly recognizable 'hidden agendas'
is reaching a point where I am tempted to show my Crayola Conspiracy
Charts (TM) to the normal folks down at the bar and see if they
finally start nodding their heads, instead of laughing riotously.
  It's damn near like a good horror movie, where the nice people are
all still laughing and drinking champagne, but the darkly disturbing
cello sounds in the background are being emmitted with increasing
frequency, like the growing birth pains of the bewildered lady
who is about to give birth to the CypherPunk From Hell.

    it's a girl. <sorry--couldn't resist>)
