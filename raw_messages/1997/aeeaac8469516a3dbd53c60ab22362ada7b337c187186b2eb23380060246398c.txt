It should be point out that ECB is also subject to some spoofing attacks.
Blocks from one message encoded with a particular key can be substituted
for blocks in a different message encoded with the same key.  In a banking
system, this attack might allow the attacker to change the transaction
amounts.

With any mode, encypherment is not a substitute for a message
authentication code.
