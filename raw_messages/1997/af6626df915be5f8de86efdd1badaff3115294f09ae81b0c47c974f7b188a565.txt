I'm all for the year... get more people
using crypto everyday...
We 'gotta make it popular and the 'thing to do'...
We need a Captain Marvel Secret Decoder Ring...
"Hey Kids, send a secret message to your buddies..."

At this point... after what's happened so far..
I'm in favor of a Clinton veto...
NO crypto laws at all...
