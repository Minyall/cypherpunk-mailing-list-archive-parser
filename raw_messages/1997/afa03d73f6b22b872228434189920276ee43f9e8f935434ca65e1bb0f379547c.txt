I'm no expert in these areas, but doesn't this consitute "providing hooks"
for strong crypto? The EARs say that a "hook" for inserting crypto modules
once a product is exported are essentially as bad as providing the crypto
before the product is exported.

Also, my understanding is that U.S. companies cannot send experts or
programmers to non-U.S. sites with the intention of thereby violating U.S.
export laws. (I once asked Jim Bidzos why he did not simply move his key
developers beyond the borders, and this is the answer he gave, repeated by
others at later times on the CP and other lists. So far as I know, this has
never been tested in court. Such a test would be comparable to Bernstein,
Junger, Karns, etc. in significance.)
