Paul Strassmann served on the "Information Warefare - Defense"
Task Force sponsored by the Defense Science Board. He has a
Web site at:

The IW-D report recounts most of the well-known info-war memes
to buttress its plea for more info-warfighting funds, and says that
business needs DoD protection.

It de-emphasizes the encryption debate, claiming that crypto is not 
an important part of the problem or the solution. Remailers are not 
mentioned.

Short and long versions of IW-D:

SAIC was generously represented on the Task Force: Strassmann,
Bellcore's head, a couple more. As well as others committed to "raising
the bar" against attack on Info-Maginot:
