 I am not sure, but it seems to me that there is some sort of currency 
control laws that say that you cannot have 10K or mor ein oyur possession 
unless you show there is a good reason, like on your way to the bank, 
being abusiness heading for the bank atthe end of the day etc, and of 
course banks report deposits of 10K or more. I know of two different 
people who were not 'in business' who did perfectly legal transactions 
that left them with 32K and 47K in cash each instead of big checks and 
who simply deposited it. One recieved a phone call and the other a visit 
by IRS asking 'what, why, where' etc within two weeks of depositing money.
