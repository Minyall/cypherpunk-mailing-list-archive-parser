Yes; so make the failure page from your http server say: connect to
https://www.cypherpunks.to.

More elegant, but a bit more difficult, would be to do the right
thing.

That is: 

1. connection on https port & coming from *.altavista.com allow.
2. connection on https port & coming from somewhere else insist on SSL

(Would this work?  Wander if their spider will talk to https port with
http?)

Kewl.  Anyone know where those patches to convert for netscape 40 bit
crippleware to 128 bit crypto are?

Save download time -- a version 4 browser is quite large to download.
