They're not widely available yet; I don't know if any of the (US)
phone companies offer it as more than trials.  One limitation is that
the technology works over copper wire, so it has to be offered at
your local telco wire center.  Of course, your local telco has to 
have something useful to do with the bits once the user sends
them to the telco, and has to have some useful bits to send the user.
This means they've got to haggle about standards for 5 more years
(or just do the right thing and deploy IP, with some respectable
bandwidth to the outside world) (or deploy ATM to get a layer 2
connection to something outside.)

Don't know if the telcos have a clue about pricing, either.
It's obviously got to be more than cost, but they'll probably 
thrash around a lot the way they did with IP....
