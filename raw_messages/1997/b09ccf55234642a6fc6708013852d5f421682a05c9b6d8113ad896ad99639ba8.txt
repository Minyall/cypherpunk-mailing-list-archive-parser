  BC's can also plant secret keys on your machine, along with messages
forged using those keys.
  It is a good idea to keep badly forged messages on your machine, as 
well as badly forged keys. There are many ways to manipulate files and
emails so that discrepancies exist. e.g. - messages with a time-stamp
later than the file date; replies with an earlier time-stamp than the
original message; changing fingerprint on the same key.
