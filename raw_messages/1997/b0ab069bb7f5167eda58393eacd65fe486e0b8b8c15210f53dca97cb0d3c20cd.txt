CDT may not necessarily be pursuing the interests of its corporate
sponsors.

Legislation in congress, any legislation, the worse the better, 
will promote corporate donations to CDT.  This does not meen that
the corps want legislation.

Indeed, this is a chronic problem with such mundane non civil
liberties lobbies as the milk lobby.

Big business sends their lobbyists to Washington, where they are
corrupted by contact with politicians.
