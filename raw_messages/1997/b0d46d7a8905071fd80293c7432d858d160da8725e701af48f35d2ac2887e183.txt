  And Germany was Hitler and the Nazi Party's own country.
  Do you really want Clinton and GingWretch having a say in how we run
our
web? (I don't).
  It may be 'their' country ('their' being the government), but it is 
'their' world ('their' being the people). There was a reason that the 
Western powers didn't return East Germans who broke the laws of their
country by climbing over the wall and running for freedom.
  Making information available does not 'force' a view on anyone.

  No. The internet was conceived so that the DOD could monitor the
communications
of physicists and researchers who thought it was awfully nice of the
government
to provide this wonderful method of sharing data and information.
