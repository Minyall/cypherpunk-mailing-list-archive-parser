Dank U, Zooko!
We are indeed on the horns of a dilemma.
As long as the vendors can get away with crapware
(with respect to security, reliability, robustness, etc.),
there is no incentive to do better.  In info-peace, most
folks don't care.  In info-war, the bad guys (on all sides)
are delighted that the systems are flaky, and the good guys
lose.  However, the governmental incentives that exist seem
to opt for dumbing down -- despite the realization that 
governments cannot get x-worthy systems to satisfy their own
needs.  Short-sighted parado[x|c]trinarianism abounds.
