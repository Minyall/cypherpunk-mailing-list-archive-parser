I finally got a copy of MagicMoney (from ftp://utopia.hacktic.nl).
It is just the code (compiling without error), but there is no README or
documentation at all.Can someone give me a hint,what to do with this
package? Is there a documentation somesite?
BTW utopia is the site,you can get all the export restricted stuff outside
the US.
