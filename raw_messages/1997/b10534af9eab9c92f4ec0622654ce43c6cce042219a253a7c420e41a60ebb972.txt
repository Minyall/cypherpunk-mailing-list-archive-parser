An article in "Intelectual Property" magazine on hacking around the crypto
export ban at http://www.ipmag.com/crypto.html .  Get it while it is still
there.

Goes into great length about the EAR and those Hamletionians pouring
poison into it.  (Sorry...  Started channeling John Young there for a
moment...)
