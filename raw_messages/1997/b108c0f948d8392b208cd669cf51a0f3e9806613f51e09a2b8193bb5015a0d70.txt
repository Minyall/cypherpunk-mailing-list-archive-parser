+You assume that someone gives a damn whether you "respect" them or
+not.

    Lizard is a bigger fool than he shows --anyone who writes on the basis of 
    "respect" fails to understand the principles of controversial opinions and 
    the advancement of knowledge away from either politically or "socially" 
    correct thinking.  rudeness can occasionally be an art form in and of 
    itself --for instance, in dealing with a pompous asshole who never gets 
    off his/her procelain potty throne.
