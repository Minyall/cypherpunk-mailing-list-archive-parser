I'm not a reporter, but it seems to me that a major first step in writing
such a story would be to find out who own the account from which the mail
was (allegedly) sent.

Namely, who is "irsnwpr@net.insp.irs.gov" and what does he or she think of
the "DEATH TO TYRANTS" subject header, sent to me (and maybe others). And
what was the reason this was sent to folks who are neither lawyers nor
reporters nor anyone else who typically receives Treasury Department press
releases?

 The headers in the first of the messages I received were:

I forwarded the header block a few days ago, and can furnish anyone with a
complete copy. Except for the "DEATH TO TYRANTS" subject, and some details
of the dates (as noted by John Young), it's the basic "Something of
Interest" message, which I also got a copy of.

In case there's interest in that, too, here's the header block for that one:

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
