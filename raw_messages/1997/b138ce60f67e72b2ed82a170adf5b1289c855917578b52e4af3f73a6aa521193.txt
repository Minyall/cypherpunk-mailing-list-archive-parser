Is the strength, or lack thereof, of conventional PGP encryption
proportional
to the length of the conventional password?

For example, when I encrypt conventionally, does it make any difference
internally (disregarding the ability to guess the password) if I choose
to
use the pass phrase heyyou, or
[Harris$Pizza*Axis/LilburnKfreakmaisUoui@(.
Not so much the randomness of my password as the length?

 Do more characters give the encryption process more to work with?

Thanks.

Alec
