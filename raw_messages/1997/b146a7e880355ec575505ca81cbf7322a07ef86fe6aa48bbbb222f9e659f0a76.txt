Could I humbly request that people don't post the new (SHA?) PGP
signatures to the list for the time being as it's a pain in the ass for
those of us outside the US who don't yet have the ability to read them.
PGP 2.6.x error handling doesn't know what to do with them and it breaks
our mail-processing code.
