More of Tim "chop chop" May's racism.  This is the man that you claim to
have respect for.  You must be turning your head away in embarrassment
from this offensive behavior.  But he's not embarrassed about it, so why
should you be?  Look plainly at the kind of man you are dealing with,
and ask whether he deserves your respect.
