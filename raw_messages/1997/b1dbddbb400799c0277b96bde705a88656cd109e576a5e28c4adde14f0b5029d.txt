This is an ill thought out and emotional response. A flag, just as any 
other object, it someones private property. If I choose to but 1000000 US 
flags and burn them on my property, or on property I have permission to 
use for this purpose, it is no business of the state or anyone else.
Realise first and foremost that all law is based on property.
