Indeed. Yet in a democracy, any two other members are assumed to know
better than me, and any 51% to know better than the other 49%.

Democracy is merely the scoundrel's last attempt to maintain the divine
right of kings by coverting it into the divine right of the elected.

Indeed, thereby proving that democracy *doesn't* work.

Midnight raids, anti-drug laws, all the examples you just gave of the
evils of democracy, etc, etc.

Someone (Churchill?) once said that democracy is the best form of
goverment. Amusingly he considered this a defence of democracy, not
a damning indictment of the entire concept of government.

Medical licensing, drivers licenses, pilots licenses, export restrictions,
gun licenses (in various democracies), concealed weapons permits... do I
have to go on? This doesn't seem to bear any resemblance to the reality
of democracy.

Again, this is a clear example of the failure of democracy. A big
difference between democracy and anarcho-capitalism[1] is that in
an anarcho-capitalist society the cops will be too busy making money
to launch such raids on their customers, and most customers will be
too self-interested to pay cops to raid their neighbors.

>There is a reason behind the madness of "Congress shall make no law...".

Indeed; such a shame they put all those other words into the 
Constitution. That phrase sounds like a pretty good conception
of government to me.
