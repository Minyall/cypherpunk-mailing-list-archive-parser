IIRC the peaple who decide weather these criticisms are false or not (the
judges) are quite biased towards the goverment.  If my memouries of a
recent news story are correct, a recent judment against the goverment
was a great shock to every one.

I have also have heard that the sueing by the goverment is aimmed at
driving thouse who critiscise it into bankrupsy and thus unable to hold
office.
