Oh geez...

Have you heard about NEW ISRAEL yet? It is a 510 page book
that addresses one of the primordial obstacles to human life
and happiness on our planet Earth, the accursed Middle
Eastern conundrum between the Jews and the Palestinians-
Arabs-Islamics.  The predicate of NEW  ISRAEL calls for the
creation of a coexistent, with Israel, New Israel in the
southern two thirds of the Baja Peninsula, south of
California, in North America, with immense benefits
for all of those effected. Faced with an impossible dilemma,
another choice must be made available. The book explains that
new option and all the history, difficulties, and
transgressions, that makes the creation of New Israel
absolutely necessary.  For more information, including an
18 page detailed outline of NEW ISRAEL, and the full 41 page
Preface to NEW ISRAEL - which provides rich details about the
reasoning and rationale foundation of NEW ISRAEL, visit the
NEW ISRAEL website at :
