Sean,

No, it works the other way. The verification center gets $1000, creates
1000 $1 coins, signs them and encrypts each with the given recipients' 
public keys.

The spammers gets these signed and encrypted coins, may superencrypt
them and sends them to the recipients.

As long as the trusted party is honest, there is no way to cheat.
