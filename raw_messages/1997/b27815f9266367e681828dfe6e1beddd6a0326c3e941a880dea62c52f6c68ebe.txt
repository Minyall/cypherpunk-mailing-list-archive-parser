Nice, but I can see one problem here.
If I (as a censor) will want to block your communication to prohibited sites, I
can block the access to the proxy computers. You will just move the blocking
strategy one level up with your plug-in. The censor will block the web servers
AND proxy servers. Because the list of proxy servers must be available somehow
to users, it is very simple to write some kind of script running on the gateway
which is blocking the acccess. The script will download the list of proxy
servers, update the gateway tables and the gateway will be blocking acccess to
all sites on the proxy list.
