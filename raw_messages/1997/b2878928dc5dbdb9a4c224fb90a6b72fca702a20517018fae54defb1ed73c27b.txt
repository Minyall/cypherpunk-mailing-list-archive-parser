This is from a story on Top Level Domain Names.  Seems like it could apply 
to anything:
 
"In Washington DC, officials from the White House, federal agencies and
Congress say regulations may be necessary to promote a free-market   
system. A White House inter-agency taskforce was due to meet last
week, after CWI's press deadline, to discuss the matter."
