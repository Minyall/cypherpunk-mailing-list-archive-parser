Given that:
1. It is legal to export books with printed source code.
2. It is legal for foreigners to type it in.
3. It is legal for foreigners to post what they typed.
4. It is legal to pay foreigners to type things into a computer.

It seems to me that it would be legal for the author of a book with
source code to pay foreigners to type in the code and post it.  The
cost of doing so is small compared to the cost of writing and
publishing the book.

I assume that this is illegal, but which laws does it violate?
