Well I export software on a daily basis that "provides crypto hooks". I
also provide advice and consultations to those overseas on crypto &
security related issues. Matter of fact I have someone right now working
on a Russian translation for my software (I wonder if they are still on
the verbotten list along with Cuba & Iran) an a Chinese translation has
already been completed.

I also have a clause in software license that allows anyone to use my
software for free if they live in a totalitarian country where crypto is
baned (like France perhaps USA soon).

The government can only take away our rights if we let them do it. I for
one will not be a party to Washington's criminal conspiracy to subvert the
Constitution of the United States of America.
