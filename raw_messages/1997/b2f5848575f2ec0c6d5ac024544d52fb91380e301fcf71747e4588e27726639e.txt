More importantly perhaps, the Tenth Amendment directs, that is to say 
it is not left up to chance, who shall possess those unassigned powers:


"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, 
nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states 
respectively, or to the people.

In many cases these reserved powers have been assumed by the federal 
government or abrogated by the people.
