Circa 1974, I was sitting in my law school lounge watching "The Charge of the 
Light Brigade" starring Errol Flynn on TV.  There was a group of other 
students there.  Then came the line from the film: "Men, we're going to show 
these Turks that you can't murder innocent women and children and live to 
boast about it (a British garrison had been attacked, which led to the 
Charge).  I immediately piped up, "That's funny, George McGovern did!"

McGovern, George -- Bomber pilot in WWII, "peace" candidate for President of 
the United States in 1972.  

Lots of baby killers out there in the strangest places.

As to the Children of OKC, people who turn the care of their children over to 
government employees or contractors do not place too high a value on those 
children.
