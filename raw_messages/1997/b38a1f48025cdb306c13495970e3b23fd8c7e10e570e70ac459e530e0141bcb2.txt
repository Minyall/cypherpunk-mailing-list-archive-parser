Dear Mr. Young,

    We received your facsimile letter regarding The Wassenaar Arrangement.
As you have been informed, CISTEC is going to issue a document describing
the Wassenaar Arrangement in middle of March 1997.  But actually, this issue 
does not include "ML" area and all parts are translated into Japanese.

    Basically, this Japanese version is targetted to member industries of 
CISTEC.

    Please let us know still you would like to get it.

By the way, how did you get the information of CISTEC's publication?
Please let us know your company or institution and the purpose of this 
document from Japan, if you don't have any problems.

Thank you 

From:  A. Nakagawa(CISTEC)

a source for a full copy.
