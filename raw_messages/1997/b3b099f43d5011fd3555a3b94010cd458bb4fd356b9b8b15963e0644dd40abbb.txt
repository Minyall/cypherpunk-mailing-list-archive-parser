I wonder if Mr. Solomon of NY will rethink his decision to not bring 
up SAFE without Oxley to the entire House after the unprecedented 
coaltion of companies and individual groups that came together to 
make sure that mandatory key recovery stays a "1984" like dream.   I 
find it incomprehensible that one man, would block the introduction 
of this bill, after it being proved that this is what his 
constituents want....
