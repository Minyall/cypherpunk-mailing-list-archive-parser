As an outside odserver I see your 'patriotism' as more a combernation of
ethonocentrisum and natonisum.  I can't see how the unquestioning beleaf
in the inhernt suppority of your nation (and this is what I have see from
meany 'merkins) can be in any way healthy.

I value objectivty and free thort over patriotisum.

I put little value on national solidarity,  I would prefur to have my own
idears reather then accept the unity of interests.

I would prefer the truth over belief.

I value my fellow citisons the same why I value all other peaple, by the
way thay act.

Because thay are poor and beleave that in Amirica everybody is rich.  Few
come because of amiricans beleafs, or there great record of power.  Boat
peaple reguly land on our shoars and I dout that we are a powerfull nation
in you view.

Please excuse my spelling as I suffer from agraphia see the url in my header. 
Never trust a country with more peaple then sheep.  Buy easter bilbies.
Save the ABC Is $0.08 per day too much to pay?  ex-net.scum and prouud     
I'm sorry but I just don't consider 'because its yukky' a convinceing argument
