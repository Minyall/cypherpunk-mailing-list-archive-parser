1. When a message is cross-posted using the "newsgroups:" line only one 
copy is sent to the news-spool and is seen in all the relevent newsgroups.

2. Bandwidth requirements are no justification for censorship, unless you 
own the equipment you are removing the messages from, even then it is 
reprehensible.
