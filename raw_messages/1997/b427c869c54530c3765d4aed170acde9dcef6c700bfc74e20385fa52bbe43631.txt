Igor and D.V. have been discussing the viability of
cyberpromo as a host site for remailers; Igor points out
that many recipients will auto-trash anything from there.
On the other hand, it's a good entry point for a middleman remailer
or a nym remailer, as long as you can trash anything from there
without also trashing your remailer's mail :-)
In particular, your remailer was going to remove direct references
to cyberpromo anyway.

However, the prices have changed since I brought up the idea
a month ago.  At the time, they had auto-responders with POP mail -
- - $50/2yrs POP+autoresponder, or $39 one-time for a mail forwarder.
Now, however, they offer autoresponders for 3/$99 for three years,
with no mention of POP mail or forwarding - I don't know if they've
dropped the service (in favor of web hosting at $25/month),
or if it's still there and just not advertised.  (Of course,
there's still the moral dilemma that even $99 is $99 in Spamford's pocket :-)
