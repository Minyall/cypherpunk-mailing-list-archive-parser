Perhaps some enemy of the "real" Graham-John is running a 'bot that
forges drivel in his name in an effort to have him globally killfiled?

There were more articles on sci.cryonics alleging that Charles Platt
finally got arrested this time. The cocksucker John Gilmore too got
arrested last August. Perhaps the shock of spending a night in jail
will cause Charles Platt to enter a detox program.

There are connections between Platt and panix.com and SEA and EFF and C2Net.

]All I can tell you is I used to fool around with one of these things, as a

]potentiometer (variable resistor) that can take a reasonable amount of
]current--1 watt, say. Use a volt/amp/ohm meter to calibrate the
]potentiometer--i.e. mark where the knob points for 1000 ohms, 5000 ohms,
]etc. Now attach one wire from your generator to one side of the
]potentiometer, link the other side of your potentiometer with your
]volt/amp/ohm meter, switch the meter to measure CURRENT (amps), and attach
]the other side of the meter to the other wire of your generator. In other
]words, the generator, potentiometer, and meter form a closed daisy chain.
]Crank the handle at different potentiometer settings and see what readings
