I don`t know about the USA but in the UK many large stores now have a 
system where when you make a transaction for shopping, you can ask for 
"cashback", so all you need is a signature to get cash from the card, 
however, I think the maximum amount per transaction is fairly low 
(something like $150) but there is nothing to stop someone going to a lot 
of different stores and repeating the process.
