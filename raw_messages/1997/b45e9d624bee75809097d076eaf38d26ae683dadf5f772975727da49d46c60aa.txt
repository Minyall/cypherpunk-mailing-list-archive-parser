Your desired functionality seems to be describing the operation of a nym
server, which you are not using.  With a nym server, your email address
would be something like cantsin@anon.efga.org, rather than
anon@anon.efga.org.  You do not get this capability when you use the
Georgia Cracker remailer, you would have to use the Redneck Remailer
instead.  There are currently hundreds of ordinary looking email addresses
on our nym server.  While Monty Cantsin may be a pseudonym you post under,
it is not a "nym" in remailer network terms.  Once you get a nym you can
also receive replies anonymously.
