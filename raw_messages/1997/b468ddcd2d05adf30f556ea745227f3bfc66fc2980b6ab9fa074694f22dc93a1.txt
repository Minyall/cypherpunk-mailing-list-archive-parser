No news here about Jim Bell's scheduled sentencing today.

Oddly, there have been no entries in the publically accessible 
electronic version of the court docket since October 24, 
including nothing about the November 21 delay in sentencing 
which we confirmed from another reporting service in Tacoma.

Someone's going to check with the court clerk on Monday.

Anyone in the NW see anything in the papers?
