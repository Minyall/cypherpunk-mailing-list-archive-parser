I am not a native English speaker, and am curious about something.  Mr.
GB does not put a comma after "Vulis", although I think that a standard
English practice is to do so. That makes his messages look kinda cute. I
wonder whether there is any hidden meaning in omitting commas in this
case.

thanks
