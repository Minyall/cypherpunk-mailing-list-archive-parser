This works well enough.

The more thorny problem to solve is that posed by Robert Costner: what
do you do about nyms.  You (the sender) can't include postage for nym
reply blocks because you don't know (and mustn't know) the remailer
chain pointed to by the reply block.

I think it's simplest to have the user explicitly allow the mailing
list.

You could possibly auto detect the pattern of a user subscribing to a
mailing list at the mail filter level also.
