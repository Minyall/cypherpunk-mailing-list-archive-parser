    intercepting the pager signals (effectively in the clear) is
    one thing: breach of personal security for POTUS.

    however, the real issue would be interferring (or even false
    messages) on a single channel system (not even spread spectrum)

    THIS is precisely why the government fears encrytion! They simply do 
    not understand it; they do NOT want to understand it, and like all 
    other problems of government, they want to make it illegal and sweep 
    it under the carpet which will make it go away!  yeah, right....

    the secondary issue is organized government, elected or not, has
    its own agenda: to stay in power.  any empowerment of the mass
    is a threat to their supremacy.  or, as I like to think of it,
    government obsession with itself is like a self eating watermelon.
