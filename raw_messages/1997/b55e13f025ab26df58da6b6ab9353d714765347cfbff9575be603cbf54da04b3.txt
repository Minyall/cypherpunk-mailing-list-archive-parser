Webmaster,
  I would like to know if all of the material on your website is as
suspect as that which concerns John Gilmore.
  The current jackboot censorship of what he has now declared to be
his own private cypherpunks list has marked him as a laughable
hypocrite.
  Is the EFF a joke, as well?

Toto
