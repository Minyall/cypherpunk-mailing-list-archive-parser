Hi,

I have been looking at how to impliment picketing on the web. To date I have
been unable to come up with a way to force a connection to one machine to go
through a third machine in order to express some view about the original
target.

This idea came to me while watching some folks picket a local grocer over
something I couldn't make out (the signs were poorly done). It occured to me
that since one could argue that the links between sites are public avenues a
site could 'picket' another site. The question became at this point, how?

So far I have been unable to figure a way out. Any ideas you might care to
share with us all?
