Obviously, you will not be able to effectively collect from non-posters,
since anyone would be able to resell subscriptions. 

Also, anyone can create a usenet newsgroups like alt.cypherpunks,
or cypherpunks.general, which would be free.

Lots of competing cypherpunks mailing lists would spring up.

You would make some money out of it (like maybe $700 or so), but would
waste so much time that it would not be worth the trouble.
