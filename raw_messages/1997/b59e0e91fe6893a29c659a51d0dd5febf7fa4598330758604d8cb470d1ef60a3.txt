Well i was a amused and i'm a Christian. Pity the $%&#wits in the 
Christian right in America give real Christians such a bad name. Unlike 
truthmonger seems to think not all Christians are goosesteping fascists 
who like to bugger little kids for fun and profit. Sadly i guess as long 
as the fascists claim to be Christians, and try to get everybody to 
confrom to thier beliefs this sort of post will be in some ways accurate.
