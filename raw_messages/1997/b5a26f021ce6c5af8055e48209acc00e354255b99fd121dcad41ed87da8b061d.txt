The good news is that the computers at the 'Home for the Criminally
Insane' are back in the hands of the 'Children of a Lesser Lunatic.'

The bad news is that these kids are the Cypherpunks of the future.

Tip of the Day: If you are going to attempt to hide your subversive
  email activities from your elders by deleting messages from the
  'Inbox,' then don't forget to empty the 'Trash' folder.

Anyone in favor of corporal punishment (as opposed to loss of 
'Simpsons' privileges) send email to ualdv8@sk.sympatico.ca.
{Not you, Attila. You have a vested interest.}

Love,
 Bianca
