This is old(ish) news. This was the Cynthia Dwork paper, but 
unfortunately the keysizes for the predictably secure version of the 
cryptosystem are unmanageably large, in the smaller key system there is a 
probablility of a bit decrypting wrongly (either a 0 as a 1 or the other 
way round, I can`t remember)...

I would recommend getting a copy of the paper to anyone interested, it is 
really interesting stuff even if it is only theory.
