This entire thread makes me want to suggest a set of guidelines for people
who are going to try and submit untested crypto software to the list so we
don't have to do this every 2 weeks.

In any event this is a good start.

I dont believe this is quite what you mean.
I think you are confusing two kinds of cyphers (public and otherwise) with
each other and attributing for the difference in key measurements
(actually caused by the different keyspace for prime number based
public key systems) by using bytes and bits.

This does not bode well for your crypto expertise, if in fact this is what
you are doing.

I dont really think anyone uses bytes to refer to key size, except perhaps
in Prime Number challenges (RSA-129).

How is this obvious?

I'm not sure DES 128 exists.

No.

A simple entropy test does not a cypher make.  I'd also like to know what
patterns were tested for as certainly I know of no test which can prove
that a given set of data does not have "*any* repeating patterns."
Entropy is subjective.  Perhaps it encodes stuff in Estonian.  There may
not be recognizeable patterns in english, but there certainly will be
patterns.  Perhaps its output exactly mimics the radiowave noise from
Alpha Centauri between 10pm and 10:00.0056pm January 1.  You can't show me
it doesn't, and if you could I could just invent a new pattern to get you
to test.  (How many angels....)

Can't prove a negative (there are no patterns in here).

Your cypher has obviously undergone a lot of work.  This too does not a
cypher make.  Nor does your hype.  That usually a cypher unmakes, in fact.

My suggestion:  Full disclosure on your cypher coupled with a reduction in
the sales and marketing rhetoric that we are getting from you.  (You might
try a non AOL address too, adds a bit more respectability).
