Check out the regulations quoted.
A wide variety of people, such as all (or certain types of) students
qualify as 'permanent residents' under some regulations (but not
under others). 
The 'qualifying' portions of various regulations often change on
a whim. e.g. - qualification for dual citizenship of US born 
children who immigrate with their parents to another country before
they reach the age of consent.

The bottom line is that if you get an opinion from some legal source
or another (preferably in writing), it is rarely worthwhile for some
gubmint dweeb to seriously fuck with you, unless they 'want' to fuck
you for some other reason and need an excuse.
  (The Law of Karma applies, nonetheless.)

In short, cover your ass and don't use my name when crossing borders.
