Actually with some "creative" accounting one can make use of the net to
cirumvent large amount of corporate & personal income tax. :)

It is quite possible to set up virtual corporations who's complete
bussines is done over the wire. While some setions of industry can benifit

revenue stream migrating offshore to various taxhavens beyoned the reach
of the little piggies in DC. :)
