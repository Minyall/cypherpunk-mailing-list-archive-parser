What it is, under current law, is a violation of Export Administration
Regulations, unless you somehow get a license before you send the
reply.  Of course, if you send the reply in hard copy you would be all
right under the EAR, though it would seem to be a violation to
distribute the reply in the United States, if the proposed legislation
were to be enacted.
