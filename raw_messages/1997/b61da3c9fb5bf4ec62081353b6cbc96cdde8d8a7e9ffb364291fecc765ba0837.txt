You think moving from OS/2 to Win95 is a change for the better? Must be 
good shit, Did you bring enough for everyone?

But, to be quite honest (and people who know me will know just how much I 
hate to give any form of praise to Micro$oft), Win95 isn`t really that 
bad just for web browsing and mail, but I use linux anyway because I like 
procmail and it is convenient to have the OS running when I want it 
instead of having to reboot.
