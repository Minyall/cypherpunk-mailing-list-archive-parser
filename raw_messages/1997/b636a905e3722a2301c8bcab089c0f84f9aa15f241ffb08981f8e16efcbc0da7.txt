Coming soon to a newstand near you...

I hear the article will include pictures of cypherpunks and FC97 attendees
like Ian Goldberg (FC97 workshop leader), Adam Shostack (FC97 workshop
instructor), Sameer Parekh, and Steve Schear.

Not to mention actual financial cryptographers like David Chaum and Ron
Rivest. :-).


Cheers,
Bob Hettinga

I just got called by a fact checker from Forbes.

She said that the article on financial cryptography that Josh McHugh is
doing is one of two being considered for the cover of the next issue.

Having some fun now, as Mr. Martin used to say...

Cheers,
