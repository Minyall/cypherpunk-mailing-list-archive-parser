Anybody with half a brain, a copy of perl, and the PGP 5.0 source from
http://www.pgpi.com/ could write a similar filter in a matter of hours.

I am going to install PGP's SMTP filter on my box. To make it impossible to
accidentally send unencrypted mail to certain people. :-)

Correct. But this isn't going to stop people from complaining.

PGP 5.5 is considerably better than PGP 5.0. The LDAP support alone is
reason to upgrade. The UI is improved and if you don't want to use message
recovery, just don't turn it on.

  PGP encrypted mail preferred.
  DES is dead! Please join in breaking RC5-56.
