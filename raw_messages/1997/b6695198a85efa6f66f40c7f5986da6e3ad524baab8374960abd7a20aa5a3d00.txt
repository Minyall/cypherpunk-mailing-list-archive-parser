Are there any numbers available about different countries that have web
banking services, how many banks there are in each country, how many
people are using the services, and may be a URL of the bank. If you know
this kind of data, please mail it to me, when I put together the list I
will make a summary of it.

Like in Estonia 3 banks of 11 have Internet banking services available, at
least the same amount will follow soon, and about 1% of country's
population is using Internet banking services.
