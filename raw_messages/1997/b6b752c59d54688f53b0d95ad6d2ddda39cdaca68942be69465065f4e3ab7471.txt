Sigh.  A company called I-Planet is trying to trademark the term 
"Cypherspace", even though we've been using it for a couple of years
in the cypherpunk community.  They're doing an IPSEC Virtual Private Network,
with friendly HTML administration; http://www.i-planet.com/P2cypherpb.html .
Looks like interesting stuff, and I wish them luck except in TMing the name :-)

I looked on AltaVista and HotBot, and the earliest reference I found
was from a 1994 article by Tim May.  I'd be interested in finding any earlier refs.
There's also a line of comic books using the name, and a Java Applet
from 1996, plus references from I-Planet in late 96 and 97.
Anybody know if the term's been used in print in the dead-tree press?

	a Java Application on a machine I don't seem to be able to reach right now.
