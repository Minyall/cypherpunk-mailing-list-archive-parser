Probably because they sold the $50 and $100 at a discount ($48 and $94).

Margins are slim in the competitive areas, so getting a 6% discount (on
something you can charge to a cashback card) probably ate into their
profits.  I didn't ask why, but I bought a few $100 since there is a
Shell station at the corner :).

$100 of gas for $94 - I'll take it while I can.
