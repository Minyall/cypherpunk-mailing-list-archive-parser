        Perhaps but there is something particularly obnoxious to the rule
of law when scum like McVay being able to say to the effect, 'I know I am
stealing from you. Sue me.' 

        It is most clearly a mockery of the law to find his pack of
drooling toadies such as McC using the theft as a juvenile taunt, that some
may set themselves above the law solely upon the grounds of the cost of
civil action. 

        That is something simply not done in civilized society.
