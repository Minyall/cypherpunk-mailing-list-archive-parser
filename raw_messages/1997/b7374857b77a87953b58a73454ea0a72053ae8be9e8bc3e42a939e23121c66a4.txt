Actually, this is not true if you don't mind temp work.  Computer 
professionals can easily get temp assignments in Switzerland and become 
permanent temps.  With luck they can get B permits and then C permits 
(permanent residency) after a year.

The taxes (and everything else) vary by Canton.  Some Cantons (Zug for 
example) have taxes low enough to qualify them as low-tax countries.  Stay 
out of Zurich though.

A lovely Osteria in Ticino (the Italian Canton).  Polenta cooking in a pot 
over the fire in the fireplace.  Walls covered with the heads of dead animals 
and literally dozens of long guns of all vintages including a few semi-
(full?)autos.  Ten minutes outside of one of Switzerland's major cities.

Nice people.
