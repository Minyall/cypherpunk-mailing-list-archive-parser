This is basic linear algebra:

V a vector space -- the set of all (s1,s2,s3,...,sn), where si is an
element of the set of reals.  A set of vectors {v1,v2,...,vm} in V is
linearly independent if there is no set of scalars {c1,c2,...,cm} with
at least one non-zero element such that sum(ci*vi) == 0.  A set of
vectors S spans a vector space V iff every element of V can be expressed
as a linear combination of the elements of S.   Finally, a basis for 
V is a linearly independent set of vectors in V that spans V.  A 
space is finite dimensioned if it has a finite set for a basis.  The 
standard basis (or natural basis) for a vector space of dimension n 
is th set of vectors
