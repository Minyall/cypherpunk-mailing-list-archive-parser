I am developing a product that would use GOST for encrypting data 
streams. This is mostly beacuse its design and simplicity hold
considerable aesthetic value, atleast for me. 

Most of the related text I have read indicates
that some SBOX sets can be cryptographically weak, and
its a good idea to use SBOX data as key data instead. 

Pointers?

It was a conventional enough question and Muller gave the 
conventional answer, "Still spinning."
