Having skimmed the "Hit Man" book, I can tell you it conveyed no unique
information about how to shoot someone between the eyes and unplug a
respirator.

If this Paladin case is not overturned, it will mean the "death through
lawsuits" of nearly all publishers of even slightly controversial material.
Loompanics will go, Delta Press will go, etc. "Unintended Consequences"
will be withdrawn by the publisher and the author will be sued. "The Turner
Diaries" will become a contraband item.

And why not sue other publishers and bookstores? Maybe a book on abortions
helped a woman perform an illegal abortion. Maybe a book about fighting for
liberty provided "abstract advocacy speech so explicit in its palpable
entreaties to violent crime" (and so it is unprotected, according to the
courts).

But in many ways, this is good news. The war is coming faster than I thought.

The judge in this case has committed a capital crime.
