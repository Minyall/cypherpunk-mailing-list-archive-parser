Thanks for posting the article - it's an interesting product to
play with.

However, "end run" isn't the right metaphor -
it's a different ball field, it's Canadian Football now,
and the Yankees don't have the home field advantage any more
and can't keep making up silly rules like having to hand the ball
to the FBI Halfback to check for Commies under it before passing it.

It's true there are some silly Canadian rules, like the
Canadian Content bit, but PGP could satisfy that by 
replacing the Keygen.avi movie with someone singing "Oh, Canada"... :-)
