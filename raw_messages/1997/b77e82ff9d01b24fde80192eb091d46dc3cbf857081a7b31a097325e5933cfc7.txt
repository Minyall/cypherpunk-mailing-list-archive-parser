The problem with making an undelayed, unedited version of the list available
is that it would increase the burden on toad.com.  I suppose someone could run
a mail exploder that would receive the raw version and mail it out to all
subscribers.  I don't see the increased lag as much of a problem.  If an
automatic moderation program is used, the lag should be insignificant for most
posts.

This would not only increase the load on toad.com, but would also make it more
difficult for people who want to receive the moderated version and monitor the
moderators decisions.  Mail filtering can be done simply on many mail programs,
but checking a list of moderation decisions against the mailing list traffic
would be just too complicated.  NoCeM is a nice idea, but most people on this
list probably do not have the platform needed to run the software.

This would cause the same amount of load as having the three separate mailing
lists.  In fact, it would be even worse if cypherpunks-raw was treated as a
completely separate mailing list instead of being aliased to the spam and
moderated lists.
