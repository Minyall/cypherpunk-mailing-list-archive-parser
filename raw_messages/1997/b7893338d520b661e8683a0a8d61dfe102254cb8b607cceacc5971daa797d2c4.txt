I believe that every "EASY $$$ MONEY" posting ought to be forwarded
to the webmaster at the site from which it originated.
  Those who are harboring these generous souls should also be afforded
the opportunity to rake in the cash. I can hardly see how anybody 
could possibly resent being reminded of the wonderful opportuninties
they are making it possible for us to learn of.
