    I'm still a bit nervous about what the reaction will be though
    - won't the US government (and anyone else pushing DES) be able
    to say "It took 10,000 Pentiums several weeks, noone would
    bother doing that, so it's safe"...

this seems a good moment to remind ourselves
that we will never know as much about another
cipher as we know about DES.

ipso facto, i'd like to simply use the efficiency
of price discovery by auction and see what I can
buy the DES-key-of-your-choice for.  my bet: there
are a lot of interesting DES keys available for
less than $10K
