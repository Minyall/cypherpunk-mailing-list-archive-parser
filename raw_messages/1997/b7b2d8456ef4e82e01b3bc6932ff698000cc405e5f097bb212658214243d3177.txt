	I keep having bad flashbacks to Digital Telephony, and
pre-CDA. Virtually all the lobbying groups would run around saying
things like "we support this bill, but oppose this provision". Or
convoluted stuff like "We oppose all these bills, but of the measures
being considered, we support this one".
	The pattern is really bothering me.
