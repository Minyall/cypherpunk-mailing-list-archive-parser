Exactly.

They mean it isn't something the federal government has any interest or say
in constitutionaly. It does not imply that those powers are granted at the
behest of the feds but rather clearly fall outside of their jurisdiction.
Nor does it support the concept of a heirarchy with the feds at the top,
then the states, and finaly the people.
