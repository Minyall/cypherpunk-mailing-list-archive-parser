Well, the irritating part is that I think he's pushing the wrong
envelope.  Why anyone would expect any particular degree of 
"freedom" to use a service run for free by a private individual
is beyond me.

I appreciate the service, but I don't take it for granted and I
certainly don't take it as an inalienable right.
