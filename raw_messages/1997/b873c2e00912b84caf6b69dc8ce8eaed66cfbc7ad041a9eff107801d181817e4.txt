  SaskTel also offers this type of access, at around the same price.
  As long as they had a monopoly on the citizens of the province,
they gouged people in the boondocks $ 6.00/hr for basic access to
the InterNet.
  Now that they have competition, and need to have competitive rates to
stay in business, they are acting like they are the consumer's best
friend, instead of rip-off shitheads.
