Nit:
    - it is hypothesized that the reason that the US has a "binary",
two-"party" system is because of it's "winner-take-all" electoral system.
Proportional representation yields a multiplicity of "parties" up to some
multiple of the "party acceptance" threshold, as a percentage of the
electorate...
