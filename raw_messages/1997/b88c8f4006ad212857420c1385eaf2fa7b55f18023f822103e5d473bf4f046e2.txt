Sounds like an easy way to get rid of business competitors, enemies, etc.
Just send them an encrypted message. If paranoid, use a remailer.

As soon as some of those Islamic fundamentalists get on the Net, look out!

By the way, when PGP Snoopware becomes more widespread, and companies start
bouncing e-mail messages not properly encrypted to the Security
Department's CMR key, I plan to start lobbing encrypted messages to random
employees, marked "URGENT."

Be interesting to then send them followups, "But didn't you get the message
I marked "URGENT" for you? Well, it's too late now...."

Monkeywrenching Snoopware is going to be _fun_.
