Dorothy Denning springs immediately to mind ;-)...

Seriously though, how does one stereotype a cryptographer in order to 
easily represent him/her in graphics? Drug dealers are easy: Shadowy 
character all in black carring guns and scaring small children, 
terrorists also, camoflague wearing rifle carriers, but cryptographers?

Maybe someone wearing a random noise camoflague suit and carrying heavy 
assult weapons such as a 3.5" plastic disk with a copy of PGP on it...
