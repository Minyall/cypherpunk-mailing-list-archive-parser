Dale is talking about the two messages from me that appeared on
the unedited list but did not appear on either censored or "flames"
list because Sandy chose not to forward them to either list.

Both messages dealt were criticial of Sandy's employer, C2, and
exposed their main product, Stronghold, as a fraud.

Other messages may have "fallen between the cracks" in the past,
but this was a controlled experiment.
