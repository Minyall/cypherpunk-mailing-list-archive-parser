Attacking electronics with conductive fibers is an old idea. (Not to sound
like a grumpy old man, but I recall discussions of this at the conferences
in Albuqueurque and Seattle I attended for Intel in the late 70s.)

I understand that carbon fibers were dropped on Iraqi systems during the
Gulf War.

If the government narcs in Portland are damning Bell for playing around
with the work done on this area, even including obtaining carbon fibers,
this'll be thrown out (I predict).

If the "cyber-journalists" who write puff pieces on how great SAFE is are
out there, they ought to be giving this front page coverage.

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
