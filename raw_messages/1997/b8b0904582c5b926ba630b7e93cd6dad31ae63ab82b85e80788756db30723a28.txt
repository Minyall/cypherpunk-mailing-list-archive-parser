For one thing, many newsreaders list messages by From:  and Subject:
line.  By putting in a distinctive From: line, your posts will be
identifiable without readers having to download and read each message
body.

By pasting in a From: header, an anonymous poster can thus make his
posts recognizeable.  Pasting in a Reply-To doesn't accomplish the
same thing.  In essence, pasting enables one to adopt a
non-replyable pseudonym.  Why burden the 'nym servers if the poster
doesn't want e-mail replies to his posts?

The alternative suggestion of posting from a replyable 'nym address
does not really address the issue.  If one wants to post with a
From: address of "santaclaus@northpole.gov", why should a remailer
make that any more difficult than doing it from a non-anonymous ISP?
(If "jolly ol' St. Nick" is worried about his e-mail address being
forged, he can always request source blocking.)
