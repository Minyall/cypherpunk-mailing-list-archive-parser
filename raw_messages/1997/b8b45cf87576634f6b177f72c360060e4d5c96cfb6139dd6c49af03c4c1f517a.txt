Then I take it you have almost the exact same worries about contributing 
to churches as you have about "contributing" to government.

Reminds me of a short exchange I had with a co-worker a couple of years 
ago.  He had bought a lottery ticket (which I don't do), and it went like 
this:

I:  What are your chances of winning?
he:  What are *yours*?
I:  Not much different than yours!
