Given that the U.S. already has a huge system for redistributing wealth,
and a very high crime rate, what is your evidence for your claim?

Agraphia or not, this is one of the lamest posts I've seen in years. Wealth
is to be taken from those who have worked for it or put their capitcal at
risk and given ("redistributed") to those who have done neither, just
because we're afraid they'll steal it from us or "turn to crime" if we
don't pay them off?

What's wrong with chopping the hands off of thieves and executing muderers?
A lot of cultures have very little forcible redistribution of wealth, and
little crime.

The United States has a lot of redistribution of wealth and a lot of crime.
