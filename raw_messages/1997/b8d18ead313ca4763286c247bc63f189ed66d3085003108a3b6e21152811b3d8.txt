* In August in Leesburg, Fla., a 28-year-old woman, in the midst of
a domestic quarrel with her husband, 29, ordered the couple's two
kids, ages 6 and 8, to shoot their father with their BB guns.  The
kids complied, resulting in five chest wounds, one arm wound, and
one cheek wound.  The woman is a dispatcher for the Leesburg
Police Department.
