It's an MS-DOS limit.  The filesystem only can store a file 2^31 bytes
long, because the it stores the file size as a 32 bit signed integer.
What's interesting is that his stated limit is 258 bytes less than the
maximum file size, and his stated maximum key size is 256 bytes.  Makes
a guy wonder just what's in that 258 byte header.
