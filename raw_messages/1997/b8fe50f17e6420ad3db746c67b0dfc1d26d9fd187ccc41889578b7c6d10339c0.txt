Hey Dave,

Here's a thought for the next version's features:

A self-export option.  Click on a button to randomly and anonymously
automatically ftp the full package with source to ftp sites outside the
usa.  :)

You should of course put in the nice warning screns about breaking the law
and such, and then "Click here to be an international arms trafficker."
(Much like Vince Cate's page. :)

(Though after the first two or three uploads, I'd guess the non-usa ftp
sites would consider it spamming. :)
