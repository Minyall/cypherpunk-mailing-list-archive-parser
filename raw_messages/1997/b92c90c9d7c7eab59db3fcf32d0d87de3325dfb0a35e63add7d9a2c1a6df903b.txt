To Thorn and Cuckoo (great juxtaposition):

Your exhortation and rhetoric are deft, but I'm not ready to take 
sides just yet. In fact, I can't figure what the sides are, if any, in this
anti-herd of caterwauling anarchic cats.

Instead, I'm relishing and laughing at the spitting and farting contest, 
and hoping this gameboying will prepare for the genuinely tough 
battles in high stakes info-wargames. 

There, wipe and sniff that exhort and rhet.
