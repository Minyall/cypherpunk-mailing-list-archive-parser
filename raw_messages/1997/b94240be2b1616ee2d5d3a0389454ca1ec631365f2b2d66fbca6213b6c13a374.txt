Yes I do believe that 1 bullet produced the 7 wounds to Kennedy's back &
neck and Connally's back, ribs, wrist & thigh then lands on the floor of
the car without a scratch. Yep, uh-hu uh-hu. 

I'm sure you will have no problem switching to the government's new
GAK-2000 crypto algorithm. They wouldn't lie or do anything wrong, would
they? Those back doors are only for nasty drug dealers & terrorist they
would never look at what you were doing, honest. :)

The Clintons *know* who killed him or had him killed and why.

Why are they here? Looking for signs of intelligent life.

Why haven't they stayed? Never found any.

Shame, shame, shame for using the same tactics that the government uses
when countering someone that disagrees with them. Make them out to be some
type of wacko rather than address the issue at hand: Is or was the
government trying to secretly purchase or gain control of RSA, Inc.
