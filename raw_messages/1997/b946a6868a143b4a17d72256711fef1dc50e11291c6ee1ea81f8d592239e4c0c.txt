Hi, John - thanks for supporting and putting up with us all these years.
How do you feel about continuing support for the cypherpunks-related
lists that are also on toad.com, coderpunks and cypherpunks-announce?

I'd guess that if we move the cypherpunks list to another machine,
rather than mutating it into alt.cypherpunks, the -announce list
should probably also move once the new list is working.
