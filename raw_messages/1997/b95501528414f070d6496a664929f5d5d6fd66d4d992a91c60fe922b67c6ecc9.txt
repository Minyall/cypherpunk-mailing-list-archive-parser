    Correct me if I am wrong, but isn't(wasn't) there an implied threat of 
moderation on the cryptography@c2.net list? Mr. M started it with the intent
of getting away from much of the cruft (ADD, & etc.) that had accumlated 
here, and he was quite open about moderating it if he thought it needed it.
