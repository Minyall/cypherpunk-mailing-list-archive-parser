 Have you ever priced earth moving equipment ... the price on them is 
easily 150-300% of what it should be, say comparing it to 'consumer' 
items, like cars and small pickups and extrapolating up for the backhoe 
or whatever ... everyone I talk to in the contracting business says the 
same thing,  "... its an item you are going to use to make money and they 
are taking a cut of your profits up front"
