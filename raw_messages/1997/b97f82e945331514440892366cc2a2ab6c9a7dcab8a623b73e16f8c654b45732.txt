This is exactly what I was addressing: remailers only have to get themselves
certified as remailers and then prove their certification to the destination
server, not do the whole hashcash shtick for every message. (For example, they
could publish their public key's hash signed by some anti-spam organization,
then sign the hash of the server's challenge to prove that they are a real
remailer, not an advanced spammer imitating one)

Nope. The original sender provides hashcash to get into the remailer net, and
the receiver, after seeing the remailer's certificate, trusts that the original
sender spent some CPU time to send the message. The remailer doesn't have to
while away nearly as much of *its* CPU time, and spammers still couldn't send
many messages since they still have to waste their CPU cycles to do so.
