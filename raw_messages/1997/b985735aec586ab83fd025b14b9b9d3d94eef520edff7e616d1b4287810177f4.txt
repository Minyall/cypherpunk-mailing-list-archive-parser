One should always look at the Mike Milken example of an alternate
currency.  This has not been reported from this point of view in, say,
the NY Times that I know of, but some "underground" publications have
done so.

The Wall Street Cabal (as they say) was genuinely frightened that since
Milken was so successful with high-yield bonds, they deliberately created
the term Junk Bonds and flooded the markets with appropriate propaganda,
and thereby killed off their competition.  How they turned it into a
criminal offense is truly an art.
