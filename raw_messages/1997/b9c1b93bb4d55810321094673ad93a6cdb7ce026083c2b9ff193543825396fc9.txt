Very poetic, forgive me if I fail to see the point.

Now this to me is an ideal example of the sort of twisting of other 
peoples points that is typical of Kents dialogue.

Lucky actually said that the parents were stupid putting their children 
in that daycare centre. They were, the parents have no-one to blame but 
themselves for the fact that their children were unnecessarily placed at 
risk. however, this neither makes the parents guilty of any crime nor 
does it absolve McVeigh, or whoever did it, from blame.

Lucky was right, the removal of those children from the gene pool was 
probably advantageous, that does not make it right, simply a judgement 
after the fact.
