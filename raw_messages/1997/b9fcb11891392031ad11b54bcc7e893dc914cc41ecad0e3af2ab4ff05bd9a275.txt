Poltitical desent has long been a crime here. Just ask anyone involved in
the Anti-abortion movement, member of a militia, drug legalization
movement, medical use of marajunia movement, member of any other
"politically incorrect" movement.

The federal government needs a serious wake-up call. Unfortunatly the
sheeple can't seem to find the number. :(
