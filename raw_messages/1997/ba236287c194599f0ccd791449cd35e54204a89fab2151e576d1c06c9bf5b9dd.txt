a)Snarf a gig or two of dirty pictures off of Usenet. (About 2 days 
of feed)
b)PGP them all.
c)Set up a 'free' porn site protected solely by AdultCheck, etc, 
which only costs $5.00/year to join. Or just host the site in Denmark 
and forget the 'protection'.
d)Make it REAL easy for ten million horny geeks to download and 
install PGP, so that they can look at the pictures. There's a PGP for 
Windows, right? With a double-click to install and a key-generation 
wizard. (PGP/Eudora, which is what I'm using, is entirely brain-dead 
to install.)
