Hi,

Just a quick head-up....

The ISDN is going up and down today, there are several SWBT trucks in the
neighborhood. My suspicion is that they are working on the trunk line throw
from the N. Lamar station to the one on Duval behind the church. If this is
the problem then it should go stable (or go dead because of another
documentation error like last time) sometime this afternoon.

Sorry for any inconvenience.
