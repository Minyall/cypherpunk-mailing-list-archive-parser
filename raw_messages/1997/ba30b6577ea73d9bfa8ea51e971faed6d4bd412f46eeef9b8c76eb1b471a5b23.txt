	The 2 problems I have are (1) Citizen implies that one is a member 
of a political division such as a state at some level. If you want to live
in a free world you have to give up citizenship as a requirement for anything. 
and (2) Education, of ANYONE, properly carried out will generate more of 
value FOR society than not educating, and one could with very little intellect
see how NOT educating people costs society.

	As to wether the state should provide financial support for schools,
well that is another matter.
