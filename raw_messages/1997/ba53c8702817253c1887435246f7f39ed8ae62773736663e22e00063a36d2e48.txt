Boring but it works: There are plenty of fax-to-PC programs out
there.  Anyone can save *lots* of trees by viewing faxes on the
screen before printing the useful page(s).  Yes, I know, this means
human intervention, but so does crumpling up the ***BUY NOW***
garbage, tossing it at the recycle bin, missing, cursing, etc.

Here in Canada, the CRTC (Canadian Radio & Telecomms Commission) put
out rules limiting the time of day, etc. for phone spam (voice or
fax).  Does anyone out there have the specifics of the CRTC regs?
