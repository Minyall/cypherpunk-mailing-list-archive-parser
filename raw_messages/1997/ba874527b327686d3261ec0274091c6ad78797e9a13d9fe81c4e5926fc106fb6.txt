Perhaps so, but that says nothing about the federal gov't 
enforcing the First Amendment to the US Constitution against
the states, irrespective of the provisions of their constitutions
or other laws.  It is a difficult thing to get from "Congress 
shall make no law" to "No gov't anywhere in this country 
shall make any law," but we've managed to do it, probably to
our credit on the whole.
