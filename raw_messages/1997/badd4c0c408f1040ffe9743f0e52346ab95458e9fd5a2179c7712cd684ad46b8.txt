I'm not sure that it's not there; I'd have to read it three or four more times
to be sure, but I got the impression it was hidden in the fine print.  
The interesting phrase, in the description of "Classic" Certs, is
	"Generation and storage of an asymmetric key pair 
	can be accomplished via software." 
and for "Gold" Certs,
	"Generation and storage of asymmetric key pairs must be performed 
	and protected in hardware."
which sounds like it's implying that the CA will generate the 
asymmetric key pairs rather than the user.  I'm sure the interesting
details are hidden in the parts that weren't in the CBD announcement,
which is normally just an abstract of a procurement.
