According to the dubious logic of that episode, no doubt they would say
they were innocent because they had not _met_ me on any occasions. If,
however, the prosecution could produce a witness saying she had seen me in
the company of the writer, director, producer, etc., then their bacon would
be cooked. By the logic of their episode, of course.

It used to be called "free speech."

Nowadays, admitting that one has guns is fed baiting. Admitting that one
will defend one's self is fed baiting. Admtting that one has read certain
books is fed baiting. And using unbreakable crypto is fed baiting.

Ah, what has the world come to?
