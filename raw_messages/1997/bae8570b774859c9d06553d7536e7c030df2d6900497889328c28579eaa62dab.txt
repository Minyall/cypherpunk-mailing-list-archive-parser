Depends on your perspective. I can see a valid case for a penalty for say 
armed robbery that entails a lifetime, or 5/10/X year ban on ownership 
of guns. Other violent armed crime like this could also incur such a 
penalty as part of the sentence and I would consider this reasonable, 
however, banning ownership of guns for any felony is definitely not at 
all reasonable.

Speech cannot harm someone, if someone has commited a violent crime and 
are likely to do so again, banning ownership of firearms sounds 
reasonable to me, of course this is not going to be an effective ban, but 
that is beside the point.

Indeed, I can see no justification whatsoever for banning participation 
in the democratic process as an ongoing penalty for commision of crime 
after the main sentence is completed.
