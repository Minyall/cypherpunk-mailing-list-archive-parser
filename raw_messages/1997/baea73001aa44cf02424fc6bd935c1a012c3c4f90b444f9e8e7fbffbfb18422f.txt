True enough.  In addition, look at the business press in the last few days for stories on other "Monopolies" of the past.  IBM is suing someone for dissing their stock value.  AT&T can't figure out how to pick a new CEO or figure out what to do with their business once they get one.  ITT arranged a friendly sale of its hotels to avoid a Hilton hostile takeower.  Harold Geneen's "Conglomerate" (remember that word?) now consists of a company whose sole business is the publication of foreign telephone directories.  

Remember when economic experts said that AT&T, IBM, ITT, GM, etc. were too big and powerful to ever be defeated.  That Capitalism was over.
