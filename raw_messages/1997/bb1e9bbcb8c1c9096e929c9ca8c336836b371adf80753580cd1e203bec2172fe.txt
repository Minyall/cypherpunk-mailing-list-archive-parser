This "We all know we must affix postage to our snailmail. " is misleading,
as there is no "must affix postage" ontologically wired into mail delivery.
Or package delivery. Indeed, package deliverers charge what the market will
bear, and prices move around as competitors jockey for market share.

If a private network decides to charge for packet delivery, then the price
will be what the price is, determined by a variety of factors. Ditto for
remailers.

The solution is not at the "international standards" level.

"Far gone" is probably correct. Foregone is not.

I doubt that puff pieces in "Wired" will do much. And all those cover
stories showing Jaron Lanier and his dreadlocks jacking into virtual
reality did exactly what for VR, besides selling some magazines?
