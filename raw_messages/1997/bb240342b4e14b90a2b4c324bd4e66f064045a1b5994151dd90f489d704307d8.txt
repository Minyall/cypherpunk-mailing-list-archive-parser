Hello, my name is Guy W. Rochefort, President of Dino Jump International.
I found your address through YAHOO. Dino Jump International are specialists 
in manufacturing and distribution of Interactive Inflatables worldwide. My
lines have been featured in Walt Disney productions, NFL shows, and NBA
events. Our product lines include moonwalkers, bouncehouses, and castles. 

I am interested in mutual links on our respective webpages beneficial to
both our businesses. Additionally, I am interested in opening dialog on
mutual beneficial business dealings as far as wholesale/retail efforts for 
manufactured products from my factory and/or resale distribution at 
competitive pricing.  Please come visit my site at http://www.dinojump.com 
or email sales1@dinojump.com or call me at 1-800-570-3466 or 619-754-5186.

If this email is intrusive I apologize and you will not hear further from
me. Thank you again and I am looking forward to doing business with you.

Guy
