I really knew what specific actions caused people to have such a NASTY
opinion of C2net.  I have seen mistakes on their part, but nothing to warrent
the kind and amount of venom I have seen from people.  Maybe I missed
something somewhere...  (Or is this one of those "people who disagree with me
are <fill in insult here>"?)

I only go to Radio Shack as a LAST resort.  Every electronic part I have
bought from them has failed.  (Usually before instalation.)  About the only
thing I have ever bought from them that was worth what I paid for it was a
printer cable.

There seem to be more and more companies that ask nosey questions at the cash
register.  Toys R Us has been asking for a home phone number every time I
shop there.  (And every time I give them a random number.  They just ask for
a home phone munber.  I never say it is *MY* home phone number.)

I suggest memorizing the address and phone number of some local establishment
or business.  (In Vullis's case, the local methadone clinic might be in
order...)  Government buildings, stadiums, massage parlors and the like are
also useful.  When these people start finding out that the data is bogus,
maybe they will stop relying on it so much.  (Learning to lie to sales people
with a straight face it a useful skill.  Something I learned being a
programmer I guess...)

And if you think that is bad, you should hear what I tell the pollsters in
the mall... ]:>
