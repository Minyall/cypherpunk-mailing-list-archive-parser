The actual data is encrypted with IDEA, but the identical IDEA key is 
encrypted with each recipient's RSA key.  To avoid this attack,
PGP uses random padding after the IDEA key (which makes the message
encrypted with RSA different for each recipient, avoiding the trap.
Since IDEA keys are 128 bits long, and RSA moduli are typically 384-2047,
there's plenty of room for random noise in the format.)
