  Keep in mind that you should first remove all works of Shakespeare
from your possession, since possession of them could lead to the
filing of conspiracy charges against you.
  It might also draw the cypherpunks into the web of conspiracy from
the point of view of the broad, unconstitutional laws covering this
area, since Shakespeare was a cypher-punster. (I hope no one on the
list has been exporting the works of Shakespeare without an export
license.)
