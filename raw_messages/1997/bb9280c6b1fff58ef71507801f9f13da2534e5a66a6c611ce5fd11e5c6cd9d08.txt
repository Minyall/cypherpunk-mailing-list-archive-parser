I concur with Ian Goldberg's careful analysis (thanks, Ian!) that
*freeware* data security software that does not use cryptography is indeed
not covered under the new regs.

Commercial data security software of any kind, regardless if it uses crypto
or not, is however prohibited from being distributed via the Internet or
being exported by any other means. Note that such software was explicitly
exempt from export regulations under the old ITAR. Now it is explicitly
included in the EAR.

I fail to see a rationale behind this change. But then, I fail to see the
rationale behind the entire ITAR/EAR scheme.

As always, IANAL,
