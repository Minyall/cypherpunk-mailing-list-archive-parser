Well, I thought about it, while the list was on vacation.   
You're right, Duncan.  Where should we start?

Truthfully, I don't think you've stockpiled any explosives to use for such
an act, and even if you had, I don't believe you would use them.   You'd
have to pay someone else to do the deed, and even so you'd probably start
reflecting on all those other people's itty bitty children who would have
to lose their lives in that total destruction, and chicken out.
