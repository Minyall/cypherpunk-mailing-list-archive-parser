This is false, of course.  Many companies with the slightest clue use 
single DES.  Also, someone pointed out that the combined efforts 
probably had independently done 50% of the keyspace.

This is false, too.  Doublespeak at it's finest.

It is a *GREAT* achievement on several fronts, crypto included. 
Another front that was equally important, IMO was as a demonstration
of what loosely coordinated distributed computing can do. 

Of course, it was also a PR stunt, and it is working on that front, 
as well.
