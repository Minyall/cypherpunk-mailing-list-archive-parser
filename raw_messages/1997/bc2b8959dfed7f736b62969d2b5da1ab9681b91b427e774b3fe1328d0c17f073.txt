pgp5.5 doesn't cope with this very well -- it requires all of the
stored emails to be decrypted by the holder of the recovery key and
re-encrypted to the users new key.  Same thing for tape archives,
write once CD archives, etc., etc.

Password memory lapses are likely to be the major problem.

It would suggest that smart cards might be a valuable ergonomics
investment.  I understand dumb card readers are dirt cheap (~$10 in
volume) and can be plugged inline into keyboard cables.  Reckon you
could swallow the cost in the product price even ($159 or whatever the
business edition is).

Reasonable analogy of what's going on wrt strictly company use
addresses, and with companies which may allow private use addresses.
