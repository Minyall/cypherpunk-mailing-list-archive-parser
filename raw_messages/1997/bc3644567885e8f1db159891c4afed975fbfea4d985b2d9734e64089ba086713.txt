I know of two:

   Lee McLoughlin's "mirror", written in Perl, is a highly configurable
   FTP mirror.  Features include recursive subdirectory fetching,
   regular expression include/exclude filter, on the fly compression.
   Get it from ftp://src.doc.ic.ac.uk/.

   GNU "wget", written in C, can do FTP and HTTP mirroring.  Features
   include recursive subdirectory fetching (for FTP), recursive link
   following (for HTTP/HTML), limited include/exclude filter, converting
   embedded references in HTML documents from absolute to relative URLs.
   Get it from ftp://ftp.gnu.ai.mit.edu/.
