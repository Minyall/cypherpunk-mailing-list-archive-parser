Public anonymity and having an unlisted phone number are not even the same
thing. An unlisted phone number is to reduce public exposure, anonymity is
to enhance public exposure and secure plausible deniability. To have an
analogous situation you would need to use a *listed* phone number registered
to anonymous in such a way that ANI displayed the number but any directory
search resulted in anonymous w/ no address or other tracing info even for
the phone company. To the best of my knowledge no phone company anywhere
will allow a customer to purchase service without identifying themselves to
the phone company. Please let me know if there is such a beast somewhere.

Generaly people wear clothes because it is convenient and required by social
mores and legal statute.
