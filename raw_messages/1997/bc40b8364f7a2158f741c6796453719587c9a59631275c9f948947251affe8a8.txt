+All messages with "Sender: owner-cypherpunks-unedited@toad.com" are
+received from the flames list.  The difference between the unedited and
+moderated lists is that the moderated list changes the message ID,
+appending toad.com, and deletes all received headers before
+"majordom@localhost.*by toad.com".  None of the messages are being
+doubled; this is just the result of buggy software

    if you receive both the unedited and the censored plus flames, each 
    message should be doubled --unedited sends all messages, but fails 
    to always mark them in sender -basically, you need to key on the 
    fact the Message-ID is NOT ....@toad.com for the unedited file

    no, I dont have a problem with that, it is just stupid on toad's 
    part (John?) to not correctly identify the pass through messages 
    with 'Sender: owner-cypherpunks-unedited@toad.com'  --a few are, 
    but the vast majority are still shipped out as 'Sender: 
    owner-cypherpunks@toad.com' (and the 'Received' chain as I pointed 
    out in my original post). to me that is piss poor list management.

    unfortunately, I can not use procmail at this point on my mail 
    reader platform, but the internal filters are multilevel and do 
    allow enough flexibility. I use procmail extensively on my host for 
    autobots, spam filtering, objectional posters filtering, etc. 

    I think you  probably have an error in your procmail script as to 
    sending 'unedited' to flames. the theory stated is:
    
        mainline (censored) + flames == unedited

    but I will not test it since I prefer to read/respond off line with 
    MR/2 than Pine online. I will request Nick Knight for the 
    construction of his folders (except he has no lock mechanism) and I 
    might write a PPP POP3 mail recovery program, pass it through 
    procmail which passes it to a function to write it to MR/2's 
    folders.

        however you slice it, censorship on a freedom of speech list     
    just does not make it and we make fools of ourselves if we think 
    otherwise.
