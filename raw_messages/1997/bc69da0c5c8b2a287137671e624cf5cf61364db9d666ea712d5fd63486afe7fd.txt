  Currently the only documentation for the Linux IPSEC is the INSTALL
file.  There is no FAQ.
  If someone from a free country (not the one controled by the USG
gang) is interested in writing some doc or a FAQ that would be great!
  I am working on getting 3DES working (it's in the ipsec-0.4 code
base, but no doc on how to configure it!) now and could use more
documentation my self.
