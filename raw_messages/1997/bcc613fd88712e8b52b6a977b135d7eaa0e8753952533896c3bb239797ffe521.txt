I *highly* doubt that they are doing anything other than adding an extra
recipiant when encrypting. The code for doing so is already there and
achives the objectives desired by their customers. Really no reason to do
anything else from a programming or business prospective.

I have not had a chance to obtain a copy of 5.5 and check it out so I
don't know what info is being presented to the user. I don't run Win95/NT
or MAC so it is unlikly that I will spend the $$$ for a copy. Perhaps
someone running one of these inferior OS's could obtain a copy and
investegate this aspect futher. :)

Looking at the encrypted messages should revial wether or not extra keys
are being added or not.
