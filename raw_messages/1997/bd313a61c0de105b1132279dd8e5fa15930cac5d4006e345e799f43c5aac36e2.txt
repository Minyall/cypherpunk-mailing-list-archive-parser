Might I suggest using RSA in perl:

print pack"C*",split/\D+/,`echo "16iII*o\U@{$/=$z;[(pop,pop,unpack"H*",<>
)]}\EsMsKsN0[lN*1lK[d2%Sa2/d0<X+d*lMLa^*lN%0]dsXx++lMlN/dsM0<J]dsJxp"|dc`

which is now officially non-exportable (as reported by Peter Junger;
he asked for serveral code examples and this one was one of the
non-exportable ones).  Short enough to make them look silly, short
enough that most people don't have qualms about quoting, or using as a
.sig.  And they've committed themselves in writing to Peter Junger
that you're not allowed to export it.

Naturally I'm no use ... but y'all could have some fun.
