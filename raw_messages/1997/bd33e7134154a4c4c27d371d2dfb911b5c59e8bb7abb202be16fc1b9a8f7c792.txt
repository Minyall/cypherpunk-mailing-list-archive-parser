And surely the only reason anyone would want to encrypt anything was if 
they had something to hide.

I regularly walk very close to shop fronts in the towns near me so I stay 
out of the field of vision of the CCTV cameras, arrest me now, I must be 
dangerous....

Define law, and define social norms and why they should be adhered to. On

uninterested in your perspective.
