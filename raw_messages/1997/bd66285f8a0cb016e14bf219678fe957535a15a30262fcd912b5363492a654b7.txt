Heya. We've got an interesting debate going in Brain Tennis on the
implications of Ecash - Robert Hettinga of the Digital Commerce Society and
Kawika Daguio of the American Bankers Association. Bob thinks ecash (and
specifically digital bearer certificates) will lead to the extinction of
government and other financial institutions, while Kawika contends a need
for trust will always be prevalent and ecash will therefore only strengthen
existing financial structures.

The debate continues through next week - take a look at:
