Isn't this great!  I was listening to Leftie Radio the other day,
and they were talking about how Janet Reno wasn't appointing
an independent prosecutor to bust Clinton, and how Louis Freeh
was pushing for it.  (No, not Rush, Pacifica's Democracy Now...)
Maybe this'll push Clinton into dumping Louis.  
Maybe it'll push Congress into dumping Janet.

There are some downsides; it could help Freeh look like a 
more honest guy than he is, or help him get rehired when the
Republicans take over in 2000, and he could pull off some
wiretap busting Clinton, but mostly he just looks disloyal,
which should annoy the Republicans.
				Thanks!
