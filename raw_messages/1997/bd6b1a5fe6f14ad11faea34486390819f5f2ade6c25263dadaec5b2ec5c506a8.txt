I was, for some reason, browsing ISO two letter country codes today and
came upon such oddities as

EM	Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (Trademarks and Designs)
(OHIM)

So I decided we needed some new ones, since it wasn't just for countries
anymore.

CB	Cyberspace
CP	Cypherspace

Cyberspace, the domain of electronic communication.  Cypherspace, the
domain of encrypted and untraceable electronic communication.

Do you think we can get ISO to approve it?

Better yet, do you think we could get some of those oval stickers like you
see on European cars?  I'm sure Ian will want some little ones for his Pilot.

And now all we need is an ISO 639 natural language identifier for
ciphertext.  How about "xx"?
