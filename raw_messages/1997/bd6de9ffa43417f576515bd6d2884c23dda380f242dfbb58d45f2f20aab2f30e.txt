UK cellphone companies used to charge a rate to both the caller and the 
recieving party for cellphone calls (if I recall correctly the only 
companies operating then were cellnet and vodaphone, now there are two 
other PCS networks, orange and mercury one2one), are any US companies 
operating the same schemes as the new ones being offered over here (that 
is, one buys a cellphone then pays no line rental, just call charges up 
front, the advantages are obvious for those who make very few calls as 
there is no $40 per month line rental charge, but the calls are expensive 
(around $1 per minute)).
