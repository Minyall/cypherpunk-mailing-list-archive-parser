If you thought Microsoft and Bill Gates were bad for the
evolution of our precious technology, you'll _love_ the
new "Guvsoft", lead by everyone's favorite businesswoman
Janet Reno.


The race to see who can play "Little Mister Gates" best
and earn a cut of the action is accelerating.  Pundits
are already taking bets on Scott "Now Selling Licenses 
For 100% Pure Anything-Non-Microsoft" McNealy, Steve
"Competition Is Great As Long It Doesn't Actually Affect Us"
Jobs, and Janet "I've Already Demonstrated My Grasp Of Tactics
And Tact" Reno.



I mean, _sure_ Microsoft is an oppressive monopoly, but then 
what the hell is the USG?
