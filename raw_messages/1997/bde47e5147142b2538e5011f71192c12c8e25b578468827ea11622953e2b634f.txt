I am not sure why discussion should lower your reputation capital,
unless open discussion is frowned upon by those who you wish to
influence.  Perhaps you fear that you will be dismissed as a
cypherpunk, a hardliner, whilst you are trying to appear less radical.

I am pleased that you are discussing with us crypto politics in
Japan... we have few contributors from Japan in the past.  The lower
protection for political speech in your country I always suspected was
the problem.  Dissidents who speak out against the government line in
Japan I suspect are taking bigger risks than in the US, UK, and
Europe.

I would've thought that the NSA's world policeman attempts would be
resented by Japanese secret service types.  I get the impression there
are tensions between EU, UK and US secret services.

Well be careful of doing deals with the devil.  Several crypto
lobbying groups in the US some suspect did more harm than good.  These
groups lost their no compromise stance, and ended up helping to draft
laws to ban crypto because they thought they could make the laws
mildly less obnoxious by doing so.  It may even have been the case
that they had a net negative impact on freedom of crypto.  Making
deals with politicians is a dangerous game to play.  They are
opinionless power brokers, and will just use you as a bargaining chip.

Don't know how things work in Japan, but I hear from people who've had
spooky attentions that the best protection against spooks is harsh
bright lights: they hate publicity.
