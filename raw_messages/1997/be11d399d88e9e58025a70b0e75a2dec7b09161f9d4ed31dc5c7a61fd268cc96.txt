  And I heard about the Jews killing Jesus, using the Torah
as their authority.
  Many of these Jews work out in the open, under authority of the
Torah, due to the structure of their religion and many Jewish
Rabbi's.

  Perhaps we need to pass some legislation to ensure that 
Jesus will be safe from Jews when he comes back.
  Hitler was misunderstood. He was merely protecting the citizens
from Jews. The fact that Hitler's methods were so successful suggests
that these methods can be effectively used agains drug dealers and
pornographers.
  Anyone disguising their activities by using encryption probably
have Jews, drug dealers and pornographers hidden in their basement.
