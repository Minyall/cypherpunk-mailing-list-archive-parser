Of course, but Commerce may keep harassing people who attempt
crypto export.

One thing that occurred to me was that if Commerce prosecutes
everyone but Bernstein, then Mr. Bernstein could become a
_very_ wealthy man.

Think about it.  How hard would it be to include the Snuffle 
algorithm in PGP, etc.  How much for a Bernstein crypto license?

Talk about muddying the waters.  Mr Bernstein keeps upgrading
his algorithm until it becomes a major portion of most crypto
packages.  This decision looks like the first major chink in
the armor.  Depending on how long it takes to free up the rest
of the algorithms (if ever) Bernstein could recoup his legal
investment many times over.  Better yet if its public domain
then everybody could include it _now_.  An interesting type
of virus.
