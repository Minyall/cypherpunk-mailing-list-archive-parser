I enjoyed "The Monkey Wrench Gang" immensely, but I'm not convinced Abbey
captured the popular sentiment very well. Blowing up the dam they planned
to hit would have doubtless produced the same maudlin images we see of OKC
victims.  Dead babies washed up in the debris along the Colorado River and
all. CNN would love it.

To cement my politically incorrect images, I think it clear that most of
these so-called "traumatized" teams are made more traumatized by all the
mental health care professionals and Marin County social workers _telling
them_ they should be traumatized! "Grief counseling" is a big business.

Surely what they saw at OKC, person for person, was not substantially
different from what they saw prying squashed bodies out of the freeway
collapse in Oakland? Or of what rescue workers have seen in refinery
explosions, mine collapses, dam busts (there goes that monkey wrench gang
again), floods, fires, and countless war experiences.

But it makes for a nice piece on CNN to interview the traumatized rescue
worker and ask him much longer his "grief disability" insurance will last.

I don't mean to "hurt their feelings" (as if any of them are reading the
Cypherpunks list!!!) but enough is enough. They shouldn't be in rescue work
if a building collapse is going to freak them out so much.
