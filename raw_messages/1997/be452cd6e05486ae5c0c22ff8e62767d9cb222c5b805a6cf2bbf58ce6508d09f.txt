Although there is still talks much about key escrow/mgmt/recovery, the
policy on KMI recoverable products appears to be framed in terms of
plaintext recovery.  E.g., at a BXA crypto reg seminar, the handout used
the following def'n:

"Products which allow government officials to obtain, under proper legal
authority and without the cooperation or knowledge of the user, the
plaintext of the encrypted data and communications."
