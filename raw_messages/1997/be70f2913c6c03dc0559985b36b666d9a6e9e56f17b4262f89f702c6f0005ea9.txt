But it is what you *SHOULD* do.  If you have evidence, then present it.  If
not, then you are just blowing smoke and FUD.

C2Net should have demanded proof instead of getting defensive.  That
worries me, not because of "hidden backdoors", but because it shows lack of
confidence in their own products. But lack of confidence has nothing to do
with actual strength of the product.

Well, I am *NOT* an employee of C2Net.

Put up or shut up.

If you have evidence, then show it.

This "stronghold is weak" rant sounds much like the Creationists on
talk.origins.  They make pronouncements and then expect others to disprove
them.  The real world does not work like that. (I guess they do not teach
the scientific method at any school you have ever attended. Or maybe you
just skipped class...)

I personally think the reason you do not show it is because you do not HAVE
any evidence.  

You have lied about people to justify your petty little hatreds before.
(Accusing people you do not know of child mollestation is an old favorite
of yours.)  This one seems to fall into that category as well.

If you do have evidence and refuse to post it, then you are just helping
C2Net.
