Read the following text from the introduction to the new December 30,
1996 regulations:

	A printed book or other printed material setting forth encryption
	source code is not itself subject to the EAR (see
	Sec. 734.3(b)(2)). However, notwithstanding Sec. 734.3(b)(2),
	encryption source code in electronic form or media (e.g., computer
	diskette or CD ROM) remains subject to the EAR (see
	Sec. 734.3(b)(3)). The administration continues to review whether and
	to what extent scannable encryption source or object code in printed
	form should be subject to the EAR and reserves the option to impose
	export controls on such software for national security and foreign
	policy reasons.

This seems clear enough. If it's printed on paper, it's kosher for
export. But if we're really overt about it, we may goad the government
into attempting to control printed source code as well. That could
prove most interesting.
