We've prepared a hyperlinked version of the Export
Administration Regulations (EAR) to assist analysis, 
evaluation and commentary on interim rules for 
encryption export:

   http://jya.com/eartoc.htm

It's sobering to study the EAR and see the lethal 
weapons to which encryption is wed -- the most 
mass-murderous of high-technology calmly described 
as commercial warfare for the commonweal.

Ponder the Commerce Control list to see the mayhem
elite minds concoct.
