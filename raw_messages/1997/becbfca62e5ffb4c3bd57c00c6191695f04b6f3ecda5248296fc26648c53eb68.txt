I basically agree with Microsoft.  It works as specified, and everyone
should know that handling sensitive form posts via GET is a bad idea.

That said, there is certainly some merit to the argument that HTTP's
"Referer:" is a privacy violation.  Therefore, we've added a preference
to Communicator that allows you to turn it off.  Because of the late
date there will be no UI, but if you are concerned about it, you can go
into your prefs.js file (preferences.js on unix) and turn it off by
adding the line:

user_pref("network.sendRefererHeader", false);

This will be available starting in beta 4.
