Has anyone been able to reach www.offshore.com.ai for the last 
several weeks.  I've been trying to follow up with some email to 
Vince about getting my fellow FC '97 attendees' email addresses, but to
no avail.

If anyone on the list was at the conference, or has such a list I 
would appreciate it.

BTW: hi to lucky green, eric blossom, vince and everyone that made FC 
97 a wild adventure.
