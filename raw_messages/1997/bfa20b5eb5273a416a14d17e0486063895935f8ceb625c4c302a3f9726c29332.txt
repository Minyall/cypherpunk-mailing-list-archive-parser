There already exist a number of procedures for the Feds to extract
information from companies.  They serve a warrant requesting the
key/information, etc.  The company hands the information over.
Happens all the time.

You could do GAK with conventional encryption too, with a bit of work.
Perhaps they just elected to remove that option rather than do that
bit of work.  Conventional encryption doesn't get used that much for
email, though it does see a bit of use with certain parts of type-I
remailer reply blocks.
