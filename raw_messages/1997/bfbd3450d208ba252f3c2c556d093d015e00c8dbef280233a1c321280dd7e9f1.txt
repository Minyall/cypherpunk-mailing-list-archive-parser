    Tim May <tcmay@got.net> purported to expostulate:

    [snip antecedent] 

+Let's not forget that cops are often the bad guys.

    [read Tim's excellent analysis and list in original]

    the thin blue line: just whose side are the police on?

    "the police are the lowest element of our society"
        (either Cato or Marcellus at the time of Julius Caesar)

    the cop is often a thug with a clean enough record to join the force
    and continue his trade.

    if you want to break heads, join the police; if you want to
    destroy buildings, join the fire department.

    these [wo]men may be public servants, but as Tim points out, just
    who is the master. In the US, "We the people" should be the masters,     
    but are we?  obviously not.

    read my DejaVu - Cypherpunks as Philosopher Kings. yes, it is     
    inflammatory, but the cards are on the table. we're being set
    up to have less rights that are available under the UN declaration
    which has the same right of assembly and protest --as long as it is
    not against the security of the state.

    if guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns. obvious, 
    particularly in America; but think of another implication:

        if the government of the US no longer truly represents
        "We the people," is not the government an outlaw government?

            "if guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns" takes
            on a whole new meaning...

    and, remember, we are not fighting a war with guns; we are fighting a 
    war for the control of communication and information and that is one
    of the primary functions of cypherpunks: to ensure the freedom of 
    speech, including [specifically] encrypted speech.
