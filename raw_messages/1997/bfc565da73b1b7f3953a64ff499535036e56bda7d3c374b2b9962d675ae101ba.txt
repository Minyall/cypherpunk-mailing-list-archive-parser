That's why we call it a test.  I have no software.  Everything
I'm doing is manual.  Whatever John has done is probably jerry
rigged just for the test.  

If list members opt for moderation, more effort will be put into
the moderation infrastructure.  The idea right now is to see how
well a first aproximation of moderation works.  If it seems like
a step in the right direction, great.  If everyone thinks it
sucks, well that's great too.
