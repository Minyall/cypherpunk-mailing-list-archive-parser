At 1:15 AM -0800 4/8/97, Wei Dai gave some arguments pro and con privacy:
>Privacy as Restriction on Signaling

Or peoples expectation about the range of private behavior will change to
be more in line with the reality.  Those whose behavior is 5 standard
deviations away from the norm will be screwed.

Such laws will support monopoly use of personal information, and as such be
very unlikely to contribute to the good of society.

At CFP '97, David Brin gave a lunch talk where he argued against privacy
and in favor of accountability.  The example he used was the cop and the
driver, both with the secure recording TV cameras on their shoulders.  Of
course the crypto-anarchist view is you can use any information you can
get, and I can use strong privacy technologies to keep you from getting it.
