Hi again:

Upon rereading comments in favor of no moderation, it occured to me that a
possible solution that will make most people  happy:

How about, we have
cypherpunks-raw: unmoderated 110% SPAM
cypherpunks: moderated by Sandy and other moderator.

Then, if the moderator approve pool for cypherpunks is crosslinked to
cypherpunks-raw (two way link), we have the best of both worlds. People
who want to experiment with filtering software can do that, and people who
want the SPAM and off subject garbage to go away can do that.

Bernie
