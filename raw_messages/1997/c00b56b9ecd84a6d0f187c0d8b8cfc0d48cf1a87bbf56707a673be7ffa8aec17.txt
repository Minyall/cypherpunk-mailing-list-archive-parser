The Kingdom of Tonga has discovered a new stream of revenue. The lucrative
domain name system. Say you want to get a domain name involving the words
"Microsoft" or "Kodak". Or any other trademarked name. Internic won't help
you. What to do?

Never fear. The Kingdom of Tonga allows you to register any domain name.
Trademarked or not. Their fully automated domain registration system,
operating out of their San Francisco consulate, can be reached at
http://www.tonic.to

You can pay the registration fees online using their 128 bit SSL server.

Need more than a domain name? Such as one of those hard to come by
geostationary satellite orbits handed out by the ITU? TongaSat is leasing
theirs! http://www.netstorage.com/kami/tongasat/index.html

I just love free enterprise,
