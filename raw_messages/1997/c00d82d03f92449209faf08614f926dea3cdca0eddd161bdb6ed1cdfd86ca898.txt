WEIRDNUZ.491 (News of the Weird, July 4, 1997)
by Chuck Shepherd

* Lewis Ecker II, a diagnosed sexual sadist, was turned down in his
release bid from St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington, D. C., in
December even though he has made considerable improvement
during his stay, even winning elective office in D. C. in 1990 (and
being re-elected twice since) as an Advisory Neighborhood
Commissioner.  However, according to hospital officials, Ecker
hurt his chances of release by secretly composing 21 sexual-sadist
narratives (discovered in a search of the office he had been given
the privilege of using) that featured himself as the protagonist who
humiliated and injured female victims.
