...and pets are lost or turn up missing every year!
Protect your loved ones today! 

Think about all the things you do to protect your loved ones. Isn't there
one more thing you should do? 

Child and Pet ID Kits have been around for years, but most of them haven't
changed with the years. Traditional ID Kits allow you to compile valuable
information about your child or pet that you can use in the event your child or
pet is missing. We are responding to the rapid changes in technology. We know
that any ID Kit just isn't good enough. 

Our ID Kit is quite different! You supply us with up to three photos and pertinent
information about your child or pet and we create a SAFETYDISK. In PC or MAC
format, SAFETYDISK is a 3 1/2" disk that contains photos and valuable
information that could help law enforcement agencies in the search for a missing
child or pet. 

What makes our kit so unique is that each SAFETYDISK is actually
pre-formatted for the World Wide Web. SAFETYDISK can be put on any
Internet server within seconds and displayed to millions and millions of people
who might spot your child or pet!
