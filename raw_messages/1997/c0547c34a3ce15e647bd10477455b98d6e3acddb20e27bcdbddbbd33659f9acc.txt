For win32, just get deskr or brydDES. (For North Americans, a deskr beta
is available via http://www.csn.net/~mpj/crypto.htm; BrydDES is available
internationally at http://inet.uni-c.dk/~svolaf/des.htm). For the record,
Peter Trei is still unsure if my export controlled site is totally
EAR-compliant, so don't blame him if you don't think it is. I, however,
believe that it is fully compliant, knowing full well the ease of
bypassing it. Please don't -- it only eggs the feds into making the law
worse. Get BrydDES if you are outside of North America. It is faster,
anyway, so far, although Peter is gaining speed as he tweaks his code.
