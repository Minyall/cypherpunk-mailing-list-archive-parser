Section 506(a) of title 17, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:
Any person who infringes a copyright willfully ....

I know this has been discussed before, but I am unclear as to what are the
differences between "willfully" and other concepts, such as "knowingly."  I
wish one of the lawyer types on here could clarify this some more.  If
willful means that you know what you are doing, then it might narrow the
law some.  You would have to know the work was copyrighted, and you would
have to know that the copying is not allowed by law.

I'm confused by the law as it seems to make some actions criminal that I
cannot conceive were meant to be criminal.  Since I know that by surfing
the web and being on mail lists, and using usenet, I will exchange copies
of copyrighted works I am confused by this new law's affirmation that I am
participating in "financial gain" by reading web pages and the like.  Since
I am confused, perhaps my actions are not willful?

Just what is the meaning of "Willful" in this context?
