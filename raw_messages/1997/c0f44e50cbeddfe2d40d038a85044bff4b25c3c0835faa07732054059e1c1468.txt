[Right now I'm over at the Digital/Altavista summit to discuss rating
systems in search engines so I missed the vote. (Barry Steinhardt from the
ACLU just finished speaking. Sen. Judd Gregg, a CDA fan, spoke this
morning.) This bill limits local and state governments' ability to tax the
Net. --Declan]
