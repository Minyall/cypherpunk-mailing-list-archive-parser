  Other than the above, a very informative post.

  Perhaps all encryption programs ought to be named Enigma-1,
Enigma-2, etc.
  When the Allies gained the capability to break the Enigma code,
there was no front-page announcement. I checked the news headlines
today, and there was no front-page announcement of a "radical
algorithmic breakthrough." I take this to be proof positive that
the ever-present "they" have indeed made a breakthrough, and that
I need to use the strongest tools currently available for secure 
communications.

  Like the ZipLock ads where they put the angry bees in the ZipLock
and in the Generic Brand plastic bags, I am always tempted by the
statement that "512/1024/etc." is "good enough," to ask the person
making the statement to write a letter threatening the life of
"You Know Who," encrypt it and send it to me for forwarding to
the Whitewaterhouse. ("And don't forget to use the '-c' option.")

  Would you rather have the angry F-Bee-I agents in the 4096 bit
encrypted CryptLock bag or the 1024 bit GenericLock bag?
