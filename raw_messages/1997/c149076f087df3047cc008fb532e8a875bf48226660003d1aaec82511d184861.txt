As of tonight, the alias.net domain seems to have been restored by the
Internic.  While negative lookups on the domain name may still be
cached for 24 hours or so, nym.alias.net should soon be fully
accessible within a day if it is not already.

This down time has been fairly disastrous, but I suppose there is a
brighter side--chances are the all nym.alias.net addresses have been
cleared from spam databases, so as the remailer comes back on line,
people should see less unsolicited mail than they used to.
