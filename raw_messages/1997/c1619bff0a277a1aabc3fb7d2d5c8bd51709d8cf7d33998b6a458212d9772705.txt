Dear Cpunks,

I forgot to mention that during the design phase of my robomod I have
received a number of thoughtful and helpful advices from Dr. Dimitri
Vulis KOTM, mostly regarding authentication protocols, as well as some
other programming matters.

For example, a suggestion to add an option requiring all preapproved 
posters to sign their articles was originally made by him.
