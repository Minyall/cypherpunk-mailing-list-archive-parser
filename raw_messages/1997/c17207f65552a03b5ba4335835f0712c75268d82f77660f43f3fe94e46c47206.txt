Elected officials? FBI and NSA lifers are about as far as possible from 
accountable elected officials. (And the whole point to elected officials is
that they can be influenced by the constituents)

I was told by a House staffer (a relative) that within the FBI many of
the agents resent Freeh, they feel he is giving away the store (!!!) because
of some policies he supposedly has taken to prevent another JE Hoover (though
I can hardly imagine what). Anyhow this staffer said, he would really worry
about such gung-ho agents having access to private communications.
