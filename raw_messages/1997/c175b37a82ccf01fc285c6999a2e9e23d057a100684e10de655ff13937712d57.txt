Anonymous, worried that answering himself might lead to being
  incarcerated against his will for a mental evaluation, replies:

Tim C. May is a living archive of these issues and technologies, but
it is a bad idea to show up on his doorstep, unannounced.

However, it is sometimes possible to sneak into a website to be
found at http://jya.com/ and get out alive with as much information
as you are capable of stuffing into your CyberPockets during your
sojourn into the bowels of Cryptocracy.
If you enjoy browsing leisurely through odd piles of obscure posts
on all of the above, and more, the Infinity website CPUNX archive
can be found at http://infinigy.nus.sg/cypherpunks 
 (Of particular classical value are the many [ADMINISTRAVIUM]
  posts which contain valuable graphical representations of
  some of the more arcane CPUNX traditions.)
