Of cause this is true,  but he is one of the beggest and thus gets the
most attention.  If we can stop him we cut down alot of email spam and we
can move on the smaller one.  Its like optimising code,  you find where
its taken most of its time and you optimise that.

Hopefully,  the spammers are just as effective censors as the goverment
is IMHO.

I'm haveing trubble parsing this message,  do you mean that you are not

I think this is a diffrent class of posting.  Thouse peaple who post MMF
do it from ignorence and stupidity, while this dosn't make what thay have
done any less harmfull, it means that it has to be fixxed in a diffrent
way to normal UCE.
