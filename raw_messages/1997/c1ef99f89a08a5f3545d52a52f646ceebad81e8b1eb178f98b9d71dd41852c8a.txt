Remember though that past performance does not guarantee future results.

I see no reason why the stockmarket should (or should not) continue
to give the spectacular gains that it gave in the past.

While having more options generally increases people's well being, we
have to expect a substantial amount of people whose investments will be
lost in various perturbations that lie ahead.

We may expect to the government to be under strong pressure to feed these
old folks.

What bothers me most is what would happen if the market went bust again
as badly as it did in 1929-1934. I believe that it is by far not 
impossible. Then we'd get stuck in a market downturn, with millions of
retured people with few means to support themselves, and the government 
unable to collect enough money to feed them (which is unconstitutional
anyway).

[I understand that the optimal allocation of assets in retirement funds
should become more and more conservative with age, as people are less
and less able to tolerate risk and recoup losses with more earnings, but
I am sure that many investors will not pay enough attention to that.]

Now, that does not mean that SS should not be privatized (it should),
but the picture is not as rosy and not as certain as that stupid Java
applet suggests.
