No I would not.  I do not believe in moderated groups, except for comp
and sci gays can say anything that they want.

remove the gays from power, so they have more time to suck cock and
do whatever else that they do best, which does not include
usenet.admin.

Freedom of Speech means that we eliminate moderated newsgroups
and homosexual cliques being in power around here.

Faggots are mostly PINK!

Dobbs is a straight dude, and so was KIBO.
