Speaking of which...

I found it quite interesting to note Tim's reaction when Igor poked
fun of him.  You may recall that Igor baited the trap by innocently
asking about the "technical" nature of Tim's "defense system", then
gently drawing it a little tighter with some droll comments about 
fighting off the assault forces when you were sleeping in the nude.  
By the time Tim realized he had been suckered a rollicking funny 
thread developed, and at least some of the humor was clearly at Tim's 
expense. 

Shortly thereafter Tim started laying down heavy angry shit -- recall
the post about the bleached bones of the demonstrators being left to
starve, handcuffed to the LLNL fences?...and the angry character of his
posts has continued to the present.

This is part of Tim's personal appeal, I guess -- it's obvious that
beneath all the bluster is a very fragile ego that is easily wounded.  
There are other signs, as well -- you mention them:  the dark 
hints about great and fearsome things to come, the recurring oblique 
comparisons between himself and the "founding fathers", the "I dare 
you" runs against the limits of legal safety.

Tim, like many, rationalizes his simmering anger by blaming it all on
the "bastids in the gubmit".  But it doesn't take much insight to see 
that there is something a little deeper going on, something a little 
sad.
