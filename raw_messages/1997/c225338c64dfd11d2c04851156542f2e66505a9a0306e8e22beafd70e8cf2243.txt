With PGP 2.0 ... 4.0 secret keyring files, there's another attack.
(I don't know if PGP 5.0 files have this problem or not.)
You can't get the secret key itself from the password file without cracking 
the IDEA password (or algorithm), but the user-name is in cleartext.

If you've got pseudonyms as well as your real name, they show;
you've got all the usual risks of traffic analysis, outing, etc.	
and your secret identity is toast.  For most people, it's not a big risk,
but if you really _do_ need to keep your pseudonym untraceable,
this lets it leak out of your encrypted hard disk, which would be Bad.
