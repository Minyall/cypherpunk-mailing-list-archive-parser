Well I really have to laugh my ass off over the Y2K thingy. :)

I get calls on a weekly basis to do Cobol work on the Y2K which of cource
I turn down (anyone who has waited this late to fix the problem is beyond
hope).

Anyone, and I do mean anyone, who has not already resolved any Y2K issues
by now get exactly what they deserve and it would be best for all
concerned if on Jan 1, 2000 they just disappeared (some people are just
too stupid to survive).
