To follow up to my own post briefly, I said:

: Clearly you could have an email submission channel where you just
: email the article to a server, but that gets away from the idea of
: pointing the finger at USENET.

If the machine hosting the eternity server also has a mail2news
gateway (eg replay has mail2news@replay.com), then modify the
mail2news program to forward a copy to eternity@replay.com for
newsgroups that the eternity server is interested in.

That way it's still a USENET post.  Just you're stacking the odds
against the cancel forger :-) The cancel forger can't get there before
you unless he can read your mind (or your email), but it wouldn't
matter if he could, because eternity would see the document anyway.

http://www.replay.com/aba/eternity/ is reading it's news from
nntp:news.xs4all.nl, but I don't know what their cancel settings are
for their news spool.
