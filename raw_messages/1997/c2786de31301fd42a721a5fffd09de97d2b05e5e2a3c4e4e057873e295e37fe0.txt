At this year's CFP one evening we were playing the game of
"You want to cause maximum disruption to the US infrastructure,
and you've got 100 small explosive devices.  Where do you put them?"
Much creativity was displayed and substantial amounts of testosterone reveled in,
and the overall conclusion was that we'd be in deep trouble if
anybody even vaguely competent wanted to monkeywrench the system.

After that, we played the Russell-Brand-like game of 
"Destruction is easy.  What would you do if you wanted to create
the most joy in the world instead."  That was harder :-)
				Thanks!
