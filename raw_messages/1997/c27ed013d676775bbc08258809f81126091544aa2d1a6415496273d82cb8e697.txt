Canada is expected to remain relatively intact until 2000 :-)

Some computers may become upset on April Fools, 1999,
when the Northwest Territories splits into Nunavut and Bob*,
either because they can't accommodate the extra slack,
or because they think a large fraction of the inhabitants moved,
or because they use numbers or a small set of abbreviations
to indicate provinces and weren't designed for that to change...

[* Some residents prefer to retain the old name of Northwest Territories,
but they'll eventually lose....]
				Thanks!
