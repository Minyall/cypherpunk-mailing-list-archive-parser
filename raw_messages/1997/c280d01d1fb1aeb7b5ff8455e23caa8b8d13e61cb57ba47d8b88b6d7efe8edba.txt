Let's see.  The only specific acts that are alleged are that Bell obtained
names and addresses of IRS employees, that he twice conducted a high
school type prank involving mercaptan, and that he used invented SS
numbers to avoid paying taxes.  SS numbers being those things the
government swore up and down would never be used to identify citizens, and
which are now required on all banking documents. 

Aside from these alleged events, everything else in the document is either
hysterical hyperbole, or innuendo concerning Bell's feelings about the
government, his interest in guerrilla warfare technology, or what
chemistry experiments he may or may not have performed. 

I hardly think the government is in any danger of being "overthrown" by
Mr. Bell.  It is patently absurd to suggest that a military and political
superpower which can project force to any part of the planet almost
instantly with virtually no fear of consequences is going to crumble at
the hands of one individual armed with a stinky chemical and an attitude. 

Any prosecution of Bell is just an attempt to frighten other sheeple
holding similar sentiments into silence.
