Hi Guys (F/M),

I am seeing messages about the Dr.Dobbs Crypto CD-ROM not being received
by persons inside the US, but right  now I wonder if this information is
or will  be available,  in this  form, outside of  the US?  personally I
would love to have this info available on CD-ROM, enabling me to take it
with me wherever  I go (stuck with  a laptop or notebook)...  And yes, I
would of course have no problem with  paying for it, or donating the US$
price to a good course.

Ciao,
Unicorn.
