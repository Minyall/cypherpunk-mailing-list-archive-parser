    It is my contention that, in the present circumstances, bombs
    are not effective devices for ending the corrupt tyrannical
    government which rules us.  They are much more likely to make
    enemies for "our cause" than they are to physically stop the
    government.  Does the phrase, "Bomb throwing anarchist" give you
    the feeling of hero, or of villain?  Most people will answer
    villain, and killing people is not likely to change their minds.

Anyone head of Non-Violent Action (NVA) ?
Seems to me writing and disseminating Code is a pretty effective form 
of NVA

"Nonlinear models differ form linear ones in a number of ways.  
Rather than trying to figure out all the chains of causality, 
the modeler looks for nodes where feedback loops join and tries 
to capture as many of the important loops as possible in the 
system's "picture."  Rather than shaping the model to make a 
forecast about future events or to exercise some central 
control, the nonlinear modeller is content to perturb 
the model, trying out different variations in order to 
learn about the system's critical points and its homeostasis 
(resitance to change).  The modeler is not seeking to 
control the complex system by quantifying it and mastering 
its causality; she wants to increase her "intuitions" 
about how the system works so she can interact with 
it more harmoniously."
