Bill Sought to Ban Military Firearm Imports

   WASHINGTON (Reuter) - A bill to ban imports of surplus military
   firearms back into the United States was introduced Thursday in the
   House and the Senate.
   
   Guns such as the M-1 carbine were given or sold by the United States
   to some 20 nations over the last 50 years. Sponsors of the bill said
   many of the 2 1/2 million weapons were now being imported to the
   United States and used by criminals.
   
   "These wartime weapons are the kinds of guns that criminals can easily
   convert into illegal, fully automatic weapons," Sen. Frank Lautenberg,
   a New Jersey Democrat, said at a news conference.
   
   Lautenberg said many of the weapons were coming from Iran, once a U.S.
   ally but now estranged from Washington.
   
   "The Ayatollah (Khomeini) must be laughing in his grave," Lautenberg
   said, referring to Iran's late revolutionary leader.
   
   Lautenberg was joined in introducing the bill by Sen. Barbara Boxer of
   California and Reps. Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island and Carolym
   Maloney of New York, all Democrats.
   
   They said it would allow collectors to buy imports of rifles from the
   Second World War or earlier.
   
   "The Anti-Gun Invasion act will slam the door on weapons, once
   intended to help our allies, from coming back into our country and
   getting into the hands of criminals," Kennedy said.
