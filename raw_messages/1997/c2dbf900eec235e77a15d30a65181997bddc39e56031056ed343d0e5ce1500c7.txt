ObTheSolutionToBadSpeechIsMoreSpeech:
Please provide evidence for your wild claims. You have no reputation
capital, the makers of Stronghold have quite a bit, in my mind.
(Except maybe in their moderation policies :-) I do not belive your
claims for a minute. Again, please provide a description of the
exploit or source code that compiles into a binary identical to that
in the Stronghold distribution as evidence of your claims. Alternatly,
crawl back in to your hole and die.
