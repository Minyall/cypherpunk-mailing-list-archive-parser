Damn, that's annyoing. I don't have a PGP key, and never sign my messages. Note
that my real message trailer has a line of dashes before it. I'm putting
something confirming that the other message was a forgery (and confirming that
I don't have a PGP key) on my web page -- http://hiwaay.net/~rfarmer (even the
forger agrees that's my page). 

I'll also (possibly) create a key and post the real fingerprint/ID on my page
if this becomes a problem. (Actually, probably not...can only run 2.6.2)

Note that the keyserver probably has this as my key...I'll use a different name
for my real key.
