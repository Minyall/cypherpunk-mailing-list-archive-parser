 The header information, on all of the lists, has been changed in order
to make it more difficult for list members to keep track of what is 
going on behind the Electromagnetic Curtain.
 A simple example is the fact that, originally, a quick glance at the 
header was sufficient to recognize which messages were sorted to the
flames list and were sent out by toad.com from this list. This has
since been changed to make the process of censorship more obtuse.

  Your complaint about it being difficult to 'untangle' certain 
message threads seems to stem from the fact that you have chosen
to receive only a cypher-world-view that has been censored before
you receive it.
  The purpose behind censorship on the list is for the censoring
party to be able to spoon-feed you only what they deem fit for 
you to read. Given the haphazard methods with which the censorship
is being instituted, it is not in the best interest of the censors
to make it easy for the list members to track the course of the
various postings.
