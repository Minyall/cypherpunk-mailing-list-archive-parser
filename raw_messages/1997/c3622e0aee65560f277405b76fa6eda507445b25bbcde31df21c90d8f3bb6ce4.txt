  So you approve of my therapeutic self-abuse during email exchanges?
Looks like internet communication *does* help people to put aside
their differences and reach a common ground.

  It's OK, I won't tell anyone you killed Jesus.

  Only from your pictures on the 'Amateur Action' web site.

  I am happy that you are able to find joy and increased self-esteem 
in imputing specific motives and emotives to the mad ramblings of an
obviously raving fucking lunatic, such as myself.
  Like yourself, I have very little idea of just what it was you were 
really trying to express in _your_ rambling semi-coherent missive,
and, the truth be known, I was just trying to make small talk while
trying to work up the courage to ask you if you were wearing any
panties, but I chickened out when I remembered what a savage beating
Cynthia Brown (a girl cypherpunk) gave me when I asked her.

  Thanks for replying to my email. It's the first one I ever got.
Everyone else just ignores me. Go figure...
