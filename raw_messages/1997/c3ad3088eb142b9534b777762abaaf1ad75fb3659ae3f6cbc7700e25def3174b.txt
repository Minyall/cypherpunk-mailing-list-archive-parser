Here is the contents of a letter I sent to the San Jose Mercury News.  Any
bets on whether it gets published?

It is not surprising that FBI Director Louis Freeh wants to be able to read
every private communication in the country.  After all, he is director of
the government agency that rose to its current prominence because
Director-for-life J. Edgar Hoover used illegal wiretaps to blackmail
prominent politicians.
