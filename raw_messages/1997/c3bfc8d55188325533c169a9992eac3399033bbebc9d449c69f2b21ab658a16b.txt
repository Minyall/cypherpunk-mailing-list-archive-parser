While this does prevent making things up out of whole cloth, it does
not address the possibility that the hash has been broken by the
agency, nor the possibility that documents will be selectively
released by the agency to hurt certain parties.

None of this addresses the real flaw, which is the inability to value
your patent if theres a chance that a party will remove the secrecy in
whihc they invented it, and thus nullify your patent.

The whole prior art argument is that you could reasonably have heard
about this other thing, or that the patent office could have found it,
and thus your patent should not have been granted.

If the patent office had examiners with clearence who checked patents
agianst various government claims and denied the patent on the ground
that there exists prior, classified art, that would be vaugely fine;
it would be a predictable risk as the patent is pending.
