% of labor pool working for S&P500 companies = 14 %
% of labor pool working for government = 14.5%

S&P500 increase in productivity is running about 3.9%/year
Government 0.5% per year.

The 0.5% is probably attributed to the ever increasing number of citizen
units that end up in a prison working for 55 cents an hour, 1,000,000 plus
units and counting.

Do they offer licence plate stamping courses in jc?
