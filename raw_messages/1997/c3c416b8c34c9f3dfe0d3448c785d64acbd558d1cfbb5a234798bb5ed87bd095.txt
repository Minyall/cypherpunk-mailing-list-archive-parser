Heh.  This article is way behind the times.  (Either that, or the reporter
has been listening too closely to Sun marketing hype.)

ISAKMP/Oakley has been endorsed as the mandatory-to-support key management
standard for ipsec.  Proposals to make SKIP mandatory were explicitly rejected.

The bitter debate is over, and ISAKMP/Oakley won.
