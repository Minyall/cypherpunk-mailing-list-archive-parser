Yes but the NSA really wanted the Skipjack for DOD messsages. They (probably)
monitor all of those anyway. But Matt did alot of work on his project but did
he show how to brak Skipjack and does this totally trash the Fortezza
 program? I being niaive would not belive that the NSA would let the process
continue if it was unsecure, of cousre if they can read all the messages and
are sure that others can not. Maybe it is secure except for NSA. But does
that mean it is not a good algorithm? DES stood around for a long time, in
the public sense.  But no one knos if there is a trapdoor. Of course I may be
all wrong her but it is a thouhht
