For the record, I was never arrested and so far haven't been charged with
anything.  They're mightily pissed, however, and who knows what'll happen in
the future.  However, the local news was pretty embarrassing to them, and
they've unintentionally alerted the media that there is actually a story to
be covered, although it wasn't the one they wanted!

The local newspaper is putting the essay on their website, or so I hear, so
the public is going to be able to bypass all of the government hype and get
to the real issue.
