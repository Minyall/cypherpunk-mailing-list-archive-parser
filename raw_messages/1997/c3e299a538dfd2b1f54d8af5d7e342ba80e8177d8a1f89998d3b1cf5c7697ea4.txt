I feel your pain, William ;-)

I suggest we take this discussion towards a more constructive approach.

Lets just start a country in cypherspace.  I'll come up with a nice
serialized certificate of citizenship available in PDF format, suitable
for framing.  With your PDF cert comes a client-side certificate and
membership.  All this for only $1. 

Whats that I hear you say?

"I'd buy that for a dollar!"

And that's not all!

All you have to do is volunteer to spam the correct legislators
with pro-crypto lobbying.  Enlist to defend cypherspace.

Remember, enlistment guarantees citizenship!

(ahem...now back to your regularly scheduled silliness)
