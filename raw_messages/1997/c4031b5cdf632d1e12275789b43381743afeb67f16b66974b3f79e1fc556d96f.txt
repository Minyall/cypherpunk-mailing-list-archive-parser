If you mean as prosecutable offense, I don't think you fully understand the
laws of the United States. Much as we like to criticize the U.S., and bad
laws, and whatnot, there is no such thing as "prima facie evidence of
subversive activity," at least not since the House Unamerican Activities
Committee and Joe McCarthy.

If you mean that intelligence agencies are compiling data bases, perhaps
this is so. All the more reason to push for vastly more remailers, PipeNet,
etc.

Raph Levien posts his report regularly to the list, plus he has a Web site.
The remailer operator's list discusses issues, too.

As for how many people "I have" using remailers, just 7, and one of those
is about to be let go.

Your other points assume certain political conditions which probably no
cryptographic system can deal with. Our goal is to prevent such political
conditions from happening in the U.S.  Europe, despite its "privacy
commissioners," may already be a lost cause.

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
