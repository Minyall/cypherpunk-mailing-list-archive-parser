That's okay, so did we. :-).

Peter's call mostly just forced the issue and made me get off the dime to
make something we'd been talking about. I suppose if anyone else had called
me the same thing would have happened.

Life imitates art imitating life, I guess.

In hindsight, I think having a beer at Doyle's is a much better way to do
this, anyway.


Cheers,
