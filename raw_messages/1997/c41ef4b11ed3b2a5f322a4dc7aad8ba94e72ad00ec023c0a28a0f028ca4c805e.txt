I think the problem is that a large number of the people who run porn
sites are neither technically sophisticated nor well funded. I suspect
that many do not know how to write a program and can't afford hiring
someone to do it for them.

Its a business where there are low barriers to entry and there are a 
very large number of competitors. One way of discouraging new entrants
is to claim that there are major technical problems...
