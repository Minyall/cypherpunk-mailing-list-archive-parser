In order to clear up some confusion in regard to recent posts to
the cypherpunks and coderpunks lists, I would like to remind PGP
users that the only way to truly check the authenticity of any
message is by verifying the PGP signature of a message with the
copy on the PGP Key Server.

Now that we have Key Server technolgy fully developed, all of
the paranoid warnings in the original PGP documentation no longer
apply, as long as a person takes the time to compare message
signatures to the original keys held on the PGP Key Server.

Since PRZ sometimes spells his first name with _one_ 'l' and
sometimes with _two_, it can be confusing. Likewise, his
occasional spelling of his last name with _one_ 'n' and then
with _two_ on other occassions.
I vary the spelling of my own name--between 'Marc' and 'Mark',
and occasionally, 'Marck'--but as long as you can verify my
middle digital signature, you can be assured it is me sending
the message.

Please distribute this message as widely as possible, so that
PGP users realize that adhering to the principles espoused in
the original PGP documentation only makes us all look like a
bunch of paranoid lunatics.

Marck
