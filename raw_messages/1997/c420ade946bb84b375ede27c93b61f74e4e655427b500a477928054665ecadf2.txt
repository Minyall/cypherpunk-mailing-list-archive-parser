I have received several private emails inquiring into what possible crypto
relevance the recent exchange over libel/slander and the law. It is clear
that even in democratic countries like Canada (not know as a freedom of
speech protectorate) slander/libel is covered under criminal codes. While
it is true that currently these statutes are not heavily used, if at all,
this will change as businesses and special interest groups move even further
onto electronic networks. Consider the zealous use of the law by the CoS.
Ask Julf if the ramifications are not 'real world'.

Not one to ever let a mention of Canada go unchallenged - even when it is a
simple fact or a compliment - I thought I should jump into the discussion.
 
Like the CoS, many companies have threatened libel actions as a means to silence
people. The McLibel Two in Britian quickly come to mind.
 
However, also like the Cos, many companies are finding that the net effect of
these libel suites are not in their favour even when they win.

A little clever marketing could go a long way to promoting privacy issues in the
public consciousness. Perhaps an NSA Friends and Family calling plan?
