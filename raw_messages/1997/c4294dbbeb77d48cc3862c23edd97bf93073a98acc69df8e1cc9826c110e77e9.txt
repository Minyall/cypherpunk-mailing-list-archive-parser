There is no doubt that the speech emsrunding holocaust denial is hate speech.
Ernst Zundel, one with whom I am very familiar portrays Jews as terrorists, criminals and states
that the Jews themselves are to blame for the holocaust.
No doubt that holocaust denial is hate speech.
At the issue of freedom of speech is also the
hypocrasy of most of those who claim to be victims of Orwellian thought crime laws.
Ernst Zundel is in fact in support of censorship of Jewish films such
as Holocaust and Schindler's List.

I don't think Mr. Zundel or Aryan for this matter should be punished
for their lies, but they should  neither gain any credibility in the free speech movement.
