Anyone have the same suspicions as me as to who is marketing VME, I`ll 
guess trh same guy (his name escapes me for now) who spent a few weeks on 
the list earlier this year touting his unbreakable encryption scheme 
based on LCSRs.

Have they actually confirmed they are analyzing it, or have you just sent 
them the information.

I`ll make you an offer, sue me for alleging fraud, I say you are a 
fraudulent cocksucker, and the email address on this is genuine, and I 
will, if you wish, allege fraud in a PGP signed mail. 

Ps. Are you fucking the guy who wrote the CMR code for PGP up the ass, or 
does your crypto experience not stretch even that far.
