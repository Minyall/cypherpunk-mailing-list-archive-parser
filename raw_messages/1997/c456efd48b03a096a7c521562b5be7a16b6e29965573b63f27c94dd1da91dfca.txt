Since when does it take 48 hours for a FedEx delivery to Europe?

(Not to mention a direct transmissio, except there the chances of detection
are actually greater.)


(Hey, maybe someone could _print out_ the crypto code in the CD-ROM, then
export the print out, then recruit a team in Europe to pretend to OCR it,
and so on. Then they could announce that the text had been "converted from
text back to bits" and all the legal mumbo jumbo will be copacetic. The OCR
charade is a pretty good legal defense.)
