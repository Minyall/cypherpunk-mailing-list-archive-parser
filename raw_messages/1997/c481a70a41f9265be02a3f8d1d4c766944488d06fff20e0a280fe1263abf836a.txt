I'd keep those.  Never know what they might be worth to a computer junk
collector or museum 50 years from now.

You got it.  Compression won't happen.  But you can compress the data
before you encrypt it.  i.e.  use PKZIP or whatever to zip up your data to
a nice big zip file, encrypt the zip file with PGP or whatever, and backup
just the zip file.  (I'd do all this on an encrypted volume and set the
temp variable also to the encrypted volume so you won't have data
fragments leaking all over your drive in plain text for the spooks to
snarf up later.)

All the DAT drives I've seen are SCSI.  There are internal ones out there.
I'd stay away from the weird ones like HP or Sony, and get some generic
one.  Get a DDS2 drive if you can.

Run them through a degauser several times then auction them off or
whatever.
