So I just got back home after a pleasant dinner with Marc and a bunch of
other privacy- and crypto-folks on Capitol Hill. That is, it was pleasant
until Marc started yelling about libertarians being "Pod People," or at
least possessing similar critical thinking skills. :) 

Ahem.

I'd like to say I held my own, but I fear I was outnumbered. Besides, Marc
organized the dinner, and "Pod People" is a good line, and even I had to
agree that Steve Forbes is a space alien.

To the best of my knowledge, EF-Georgia does not speak for the EFF. I
don't know if the EFF would support such a law as Robert describes.
Perhaps Stanton can help out here.

Rather than focus on private collection of SSNs, I'd rather cut them off
at the source. The government shouldn't be issuing them in the first
place.
