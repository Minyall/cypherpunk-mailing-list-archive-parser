Well, when I mailed Stale about it a week or two ago he said he already
had over seventy volunteers. The problem may just be latency; my hundred
pages took about twelve hours of mind-numbing work to correct (mostly
spent getting the right number and combination of spaces and tabs in
strings), so while I was able to do it in two days I could certainly
understand some people taking a week or more to finish theirs. Plus, of
course, the inevitable delays from sending the pages out by snail-mail.
