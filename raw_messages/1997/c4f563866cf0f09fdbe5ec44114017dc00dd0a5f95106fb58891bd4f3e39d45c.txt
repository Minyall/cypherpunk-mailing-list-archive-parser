It's unclear how lucifer could do this without limiting legit traffic
and destroying the usefulness of the remailer.  Filtering by mail
addresses is immoral for such a remailer, as is examination of the
source text.

Better to address this server side, in the list itself, but that
requires moderators and a lot of time and effort.  The result is often
worth it.  Even better than that is to simply ignore the loser.
