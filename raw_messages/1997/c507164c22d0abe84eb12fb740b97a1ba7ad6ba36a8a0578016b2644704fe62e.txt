I'm not sure that it's quite what you're suggesting, but I was thinking that
this idea could be extended to an arbitrary hierachy; for example, company
key, department key, individual escrowed key, individual-only key. The sender
could then choose which of these keys to encrypt to based on the sensitivity
of the message. Again, this couldn't be extended to GAK because if the FBI
were to put themselves at the top of the hierachy we wouldn't be able to read
any mail which was encrypted to their key!
