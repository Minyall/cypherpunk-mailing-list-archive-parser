This stifling of free speech, by both state and corporate interests, is a
trend spreadingl like wildfire in the Western world.

Libel, slander, defamation, damage, incitement, sedition, and obscenity
cases are squelching free speech. Publishers are held liable for the words
of others, and even distributors are held liable.

Even here on Cypherpunks we see toadies like Bob Hettinga fretting that our
words are going too far, that we must learn to police ourselves or the
police will be forced to do so.

(Hey, if the Paladin case withstands Supreme Court scrutiny and his upheld,
look for the Cypherpunks list node distributors to face criminal charges.)
