Just out of a curiousity, why is it that no remailers accept ecash?
(This is not a jibe at remailer operators or authors of remailer
software.  I am really curious if this is a "didn't get to it yet"
sort of thing, or if there's something hard about it.)

The brutally simple way to do this would be to generate an ecash
certificate, made out to cash, and tack it at the beginning of a
message which is then encrypted for the remailer.  The modifications
to the remailer software seem (to me) to be slight since you just call
the Digicash application and ask it to try depositing the payment.
If it works, the message is handled.

Since everybody is in the habit of not paying, you could just give
priority to paying customers.  People who don't want to pay get their
mail delayed by four hours.  Some people may pay to expedite some
messages but not others.

There are probably better ways to do it, but that would get it up and
running.

What aspects of this problem am I missing?
