Yes this is the case, Sun owns 10% of Elvis+ (a Russian company). Besides
that there is Russia Communications Research, Inc. (a California
corporation), which seems to be the sales part of Elvis+. Anyway the
question was about if an US company can invest in a crypto company, and
the answer was yes. Percentages are not so important. And sorry for saying
"Sun bought Elvis+".
