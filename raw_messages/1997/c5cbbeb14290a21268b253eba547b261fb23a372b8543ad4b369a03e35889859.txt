The longer I follow the crypto "debate" the more I begin to
understand what must have been the real intent behind the
2nd amendment of the constitution.

If the White House can get crypto code defined in the true
legal sense (that is backed up by case law) as a munition,
do US citizens then have a constitutional right to "bear" it?

Just curious,
