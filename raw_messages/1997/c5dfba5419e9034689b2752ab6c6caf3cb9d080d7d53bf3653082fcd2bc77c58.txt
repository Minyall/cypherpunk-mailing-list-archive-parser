C'mon, folks.

Any entity which has the unmitigated presumption to have "center" and "net"
in its name demonstrates nothing less than total ignorance of
microcomputers and Moore's law, much less the internet it hopes to be the
"center" of -- no matter how small a piece of the net it hopes to be the
"center" of...

Sheesh. GAK, indeed...

Reality is not optional. Trying to find the "center" of any piece of the
net is equivalent to the cosmological "problem" of finding the "center" of
the universe.

It represents the utter fallacy of hierarchy in a geodesic age.

Cheers,
