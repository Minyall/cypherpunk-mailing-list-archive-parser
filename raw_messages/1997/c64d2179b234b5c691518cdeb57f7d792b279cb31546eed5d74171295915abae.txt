What funny about the sniffers is that they can undoubtedly be fooled by almost any compounds (e.g., ammonium nitrate) having the hydrogen-nitrogen bond signature common to most all explosives.  Tricksters will undoubtedly have fun dusting the lobbies of airports with such chemicals an watching the resulting fun and confusion.
