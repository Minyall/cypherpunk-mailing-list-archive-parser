TimeStep Corp. Monday introduced PERMIT Enterprise, the first secure
virtual private network (VPN) solution capable of large-scale
business communications over the Internet. By integrating
best-of-breed technologies from market leaders, PERMIT Enterprise
allows service carriers, such as ISPs and telcos, and other large
distributed organizations to create multiple secure virtual private
networks.  Supporting the Internet Protocol Security (IPSEC) standard
allows PERMIT Enterprise to operate within any network. (PR Newswire)
