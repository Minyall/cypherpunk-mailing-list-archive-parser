Thats about the most humorous thing I've read all week.  Typical 
socialist mindset "we had to control it to set it free".  Sort of 
like "we had to destroy the village to save it."

This must be the same Orwellian mindset that gave birth to the Waco
"Hostage Rescue Team" concept.

Sometimes it is said that man cannot be trusted with the government
of himself.  Can he, then, be trusted with the government of others?
Or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him?  Let
history answer this question.  -Thomas Jefferson, 1st Inaugural Addr
