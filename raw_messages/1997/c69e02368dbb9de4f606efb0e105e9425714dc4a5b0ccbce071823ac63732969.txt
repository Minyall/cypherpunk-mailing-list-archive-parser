        Computer Advocacy @ New York University and NYU's Academic
Computing Facility (ACF) present a seminar on Pretty Good Privacy as a  
part of Computer Awareness Week on Thursday, March 27 at 12:00 pm (noon).
Ilya Slavin of the Computer Advocacy and Tim O'Connor of the ACF will
discuss the reasons for using encryption tools, give a brief background of
the algorithms behind the face of PGP and analyze their strengths, and
demonstrate ways to incorporate PGP into popular tools such as Pine and
Tin.

        A key signing session will follow.
  
        If you are new to PGP or just want your key signed by a few more  
people and happen to be in New York City at the time, please come!  All
are invited.  Refreshments will be served.
