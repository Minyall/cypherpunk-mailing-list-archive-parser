"How would you feel about the government requiring that when you buy a
lock, you have to give a key to the IRS, and that they ought to be allowed
to sneak into your house at will, without you even being notified you've
been charged with a crime?"
"That's absurd!"
"Well, that's what they're trying to do now."
"I'll write my Congressman or woman right now!"
