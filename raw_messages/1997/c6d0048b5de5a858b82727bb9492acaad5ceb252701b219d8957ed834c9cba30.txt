But that's cool!  Y shouldn't be able to cancel the forgery ... he
didn't write it.  That's the definition of censorship, removing some
one else's content.

I mean this seriously.  People should stop misplacing any value on

The quicker people realise this the better.

It is in cypherpunks interests to see as many forgeries as possible.
Because then the natural solution is for people to use digital
signatures.  More people using crypto, the harder it is to outlaw.

(Dimitri: perhaps you need to code some easy to use high quality
forgery software to go with your cancel bot).

(David = David Formosa?)

What's the point of this?  To provide a way to stop unsophisticated
forgeries without needing NoCeM support in the client? 

I guess it would work well enough, but it's really a bit centralised.
The operator of the retraction server might be over trusted by a lot
of people.  If the operator turns out to be untrustworthy, or
whatever, you're out of luck.

Also break into his machine and steal his secret key and you could
have a _lot_ of fun.  And it's only one machine, what if his security
isn't up to much.

Think decentralised.  That's the whole advantage NoCeM, it's
decentralised approach to providing a third party USENET news article
rating system.
