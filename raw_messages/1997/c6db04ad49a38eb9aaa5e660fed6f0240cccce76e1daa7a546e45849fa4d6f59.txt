Your asshole employer, C2Net, must be on the verge of bankrupcy if they
can't afford to get this shit for you and you have to beg on mailing lists.
Don't you just haye Internet panhanders: "I'm a poor student, please send
me a few dollars..." "I work for c2net, please send me a magnetic stripe
reader..." How pathetic.

When are you having a "going out of business" sale?
