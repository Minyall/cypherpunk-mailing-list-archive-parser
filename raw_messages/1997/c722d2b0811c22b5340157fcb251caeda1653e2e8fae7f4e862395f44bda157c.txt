Dimitry,

While I despise the current thieving murders in power (ALL 3 Branches),
they look like ametures when compared to the criminals in power during the
FDR dictatorship.

FDR did much more damage to the Constitution than most realize: price
controls, TVA, rations, socialist policies to "fix" the depression,
Japanese and Italian internment camps, imprisonment of political
opponents, suppresion of the press, ... etc.

As far as a murder FDR is responsible for more American deaths than any
other President with the exception of the butcher Lincoln (all such
statist should die that way) not to mention the 1,000's of Jews he let die
because he didn't want any "filthy kikes" immigrating to the US. Oh let's
not forget the men and women at Perl Harbor and in the other Pacific
Islands that were offered up as sacrificial lambs so he could turn the
sheeple in favor of a war they otherwise would not have supported.

FDR was a statist pig no better than the other statist pigs that waged war
against the people of the world in the 30's and 40's.
