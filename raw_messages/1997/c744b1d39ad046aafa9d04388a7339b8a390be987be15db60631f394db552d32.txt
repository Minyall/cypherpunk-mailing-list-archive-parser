You would have had to've been up late last night/early this morning, to
understand.   Jim & Brian & Landon were sitting around comparing notes on
AKs & things, and someone trolled the list, and TCM volunteered a bit, and
so it went.

I was lurking, bemused.  Such details to go over; every little thing is
measured & labeled, typed and dated.  "I can take it apart in 11 seconds
and put it back together in 21".   

Hmmm.
