Potassium nitrate is a natural byproduct of the decay of organic material.
It is highly soluable in warm water, but at low temperatures (<10C) will
quickly precipitate out and be displaced in solution by other salts, such
as sodium chloride.  Extract by evaporation of water from chilled solution.
Mix seven parts potassium nitrate with three parts carbon (coal).  Compact
and ignite to produce explosion.

This has been known for centuries.  The Chinese used this mainly for
pyrotechnic displays and entertainment, however the Europeans have found
more political applications of the technology.
