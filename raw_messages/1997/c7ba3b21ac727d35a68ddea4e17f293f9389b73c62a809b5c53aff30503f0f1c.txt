Now this is a pretty bold assertion.  One with which I completely disagree.
As I peruse my Eudora folder this evening, I can easily pick out messages
that date back nearly 6 years.  Looking thru IETF working group archives
(which are *all* email) it is possible to find messages dating back 10
years and more.

Moreover, it is not unheard of during legal discovery for email to be made
subject to search (Our lawyers are constantly tut-tuting about all the
email that is saved).  So to say it is not used for long-term storage is
simply incorrect.

Since your argument pretty much is based on this claim, Adam, I have a hard
time accepting any of it.
