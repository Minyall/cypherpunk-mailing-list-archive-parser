	I'd just appreciate it if someone would explain to me just why
I'm being completely censored from the cypherpunks list.  I accept
that I have no right to be carried by toad.com, but I'd appreciate the
courtesy of at least a response to my request for an explanation.
Absolutely none of my recent postings are even going to
cypherpunks-unedited, I've received no response to my mail to
gnu@toad.com asking why, and I've received absolutely no bounces
indicating that there are delivery problems.  Given that my subscribe
requests for cypherpunks-unedited and cypherpunks-flames succeeded, I
think I can discount delivery problems, so I have to wonder - how many
other people are being completely blocked from any of the cypherpunks
lists hosted on toad.com?
