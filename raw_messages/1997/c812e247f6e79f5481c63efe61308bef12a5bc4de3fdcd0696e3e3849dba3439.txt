No, I classified it as "spam" and sent it to the list set aside 
for that, cypherpunks-flames.  Several such spams--from members 
of both sexes--have been treated the same way, so girls were net
especially picked on.  In any event, no one was "picked on" by
that decision.  The people in question self-selected themselves
by posting spam.

Why "spam"?  Because of the childish inclusion of pages of 
no-longer-relevant previous comments.  Whether intentional or
merely negligent, the net effect is to spam the list.
