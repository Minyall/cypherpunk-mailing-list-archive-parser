I downloaded a copy of the 'Declaration of Independence' off of the 
FBI web site and it began with,
"We, the elitist, undemocratic privacy terrorists..."

The CypherPunks list always quotes it as, 
"We, the people..."

Someone's pulling my leg, aren't they?
Well, it's not funny, so cut it out!
