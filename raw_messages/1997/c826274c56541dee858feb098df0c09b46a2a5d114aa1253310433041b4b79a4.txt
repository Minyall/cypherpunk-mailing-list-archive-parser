The New Yorker of May 12 has a long profile by Ken
Auletta on Myhrvold, "The Microsoft Provocateur":

"For a decade, Nathan Myhrvold, Bill Gate's corporate 
gadfly, has been writing copious, bombastic, brilliant,
and confidential memos for his boss. To read them
is to understand a lot about Microsoft -- and the future."
