Yup, that's him. 

IIRC, he exploited Bind's failure to check input in certain cases: 
He set his DNS server to be the delegating authority for .com, 
say; then sent a recursive query to his victim's DNS server to get 
the victim to query _his_ server; his server mixed the bogus info 
into its response to the query, thus poisoning the victim's DNS.

Crackerpunks read code.
