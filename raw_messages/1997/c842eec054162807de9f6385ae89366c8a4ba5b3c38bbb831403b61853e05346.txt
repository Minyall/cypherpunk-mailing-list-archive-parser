this entirely depends on the specific protocol followed by the 
corporation and the employee. its not unethical for the corporation
to have access to the employee's _work_ key and data encrypted
with the key if they mutually decide it that way. The employee 
can always use a different crypto system for his personal data. 
and its not unethical for a firm to sell a key-escrow product. 
enforcing the use of key escrow is.
