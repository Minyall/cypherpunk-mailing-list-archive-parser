When Gilmore made his pronouncement that "the subscribers have spoken",
only a minority of the "real" subscribers were on the -unedited list.

Since the above figures don't include Sandfort's entry, the jump to
62 as of yesterday (despite the discontinuance) easily represents
the majority of the active (real) subscribers.  Another blood stain
on Gilmore's shroud, as it were.
