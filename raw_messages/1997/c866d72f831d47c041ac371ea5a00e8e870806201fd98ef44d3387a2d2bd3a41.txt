One memorable "censorship" incident occurred when the lying cocksucker
John Gilmore (spit) forcibly unsubscribed me from this list because he
didn't like the contents of my submissions - or did you forget already?
Look up Declan's disgraceful writeup on Netly News archives.

At that time most valuable contributors to this list (such as myself)
resolved not to contribute crypto-relevant content to a censored forum.

Not sure about "all", but someone whose name sounds like AIDS, and who
advocates censorship, most likely is one.

The way Sandfart has gone down on Gilmore or the way Gilmore has gone
down on Inman? Or the way "copyright violations" (formerly known as
"news spam") will not be sent to a censored forum?

You're not worth a witty comment, 'punk.
