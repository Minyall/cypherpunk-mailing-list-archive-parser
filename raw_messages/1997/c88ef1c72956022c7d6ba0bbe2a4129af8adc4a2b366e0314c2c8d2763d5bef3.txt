 Hi folks,

Did you saw an onine version of the study by D. Denning & William E. Baugh, Jr., "ENCRYPTION AND EVOLVING TECHNOLOGIES AS TOOLS OF ORGANIZED CRIME AND TERRORISM". 

I've got the paper version, but am seeking an online one. 

Excerpt here:

If there is no digital version, I can scan it for the community.

PLEASE ANSWER ME PRIVATLY - am not a cypherpunk sub'
