  And the predicted date of the death of your child is January 19,
2015, according to the Dead Lucky Assassination Bot statistics.
  The good news is that there is only $1.48 bet on this eventuality,
so the chances are slim that anyone is going to go out of their way
to collect (unless you are such a bad father that your child turns
out to be a total asshole).
