  In New Jersey there is a criminal offense called "failure to
properly identify" ... I don't know if its ever been tested, or if it
is still on the books, but as of ten years ago it was there. I think
it was a misdemeanor (in NJ the term is "petty disorderly persons
offense) I cannot imagine it as a felony.
