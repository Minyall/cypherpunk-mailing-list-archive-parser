"Last year, when a major financial columnist suggested
that people should buy stocks and hold them until the
day they died, we figured expectations had hit the
ceiling. We were wrong. Apparently, in a mania of this
magnitude, even the bounds of mortality can be sur-
passed. The Luxemborg-based Prometh Societ√© is
offering "reincarnation accounts" to people who are not
willing to let death stand in the way of their financial
planning (minimum account size is $30,000). When the
claimant returns in the next life and provides a few key
facts, he can claim the account, which will presumably
have grown to quite a size at the generally-expected
30% per annum compounded."
