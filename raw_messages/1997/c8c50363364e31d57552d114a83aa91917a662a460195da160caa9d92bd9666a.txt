Comrades....and associates

Has anyone had any experience in verifying the encryption
scheme used in Bellsouth Mobility DCS system. Apparently,
the system utilizes a signal from 1,850 - 1,925 mhz, and
the the signal is encrypted there after. I've been told that
no one has been able to decifer a conversation as of yet. 
Also, has anyone been able to view or alter the contents on the smartcard within the phone......


All suggestion will be analyzed carefully at discretion



Thanks in advance.......
Antonio Montana....
