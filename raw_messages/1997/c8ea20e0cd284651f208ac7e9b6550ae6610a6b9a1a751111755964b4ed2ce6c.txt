In addition, to keep life even more interesting, prior to exchanging
the public exponentials g^x and g^y, commitments (hashes) to those
values are exchanged...  If the commitments don't match the final
values, the protocol terminates.  See http://www.comsec.com/vp1-protocol.ps 
for all the details.
