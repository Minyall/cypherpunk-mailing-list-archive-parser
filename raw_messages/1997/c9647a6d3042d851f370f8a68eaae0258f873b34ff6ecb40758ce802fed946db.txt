Back up just a minute.
Aren't inventions protected if the patent is pending?  If not, why do such
well known companies who undoubtly have savvy legal council produce products
stamped "patent pending"?
Is this just a way of forcing those who take this special treatment to bow
to additional government restrictions?  An action which they would have to
do as if they didn't, a competitor might get the inventors idea patented
before the inventor?
Sounds more like a manner to place certain inventions that are crucial to
"national security" under tighter regulations.
How long before they expand the definition?  Because, if they impose
additional contractual conditions upon the advanced patent, this could mean
that crypto could be regulated constitutionally in the future by regulating
who the inventor could share it with.
