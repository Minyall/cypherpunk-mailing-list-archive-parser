Unix and other OSes were designed for Elite Techno-savvy Info Warriors like
yourselves.  Windows and the other MS apps are designed to appeal to the
"common folk" who would still rather use a pc than a Mac in spite of
psychological counseling against it (<g>).   They have choices, there are
many stores and vendors, they take their pick.

As long as you can get what you want, what do youall care what other people
use - why do you worry for everyone?
