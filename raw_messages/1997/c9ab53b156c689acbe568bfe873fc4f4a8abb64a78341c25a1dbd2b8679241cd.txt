I disagree. If you want "straight crypto", subscribe to Coderpunks. This
list is first and foremost a political list. Yes, I said it. Cypherpunks is
a political list. If it was just a technical list, it would have never
become as popular as it did. Nor would it have helped to create such a
strong sense of community amongst many of its long time subscribers.

As to firearms: Crypto is a weapon. There are very good reasons why
governments determined to overstep their bounds are working so hard to
restrict access to both crypto and firearms. You can't have one without the
other. At least not for long.
