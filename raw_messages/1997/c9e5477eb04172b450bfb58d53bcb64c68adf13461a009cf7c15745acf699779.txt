Not my point. My point is, you make sure the chips are deep enough that
they can't be removed without removing a great deal of body mass (and
probably killing the subject).  The chip also has to be monitorable
externally, so that a number of transponders or whatever positioned in
many different places can isolate each chip and ID it, much like police
do with auto licence plates.

This way, it's vastly more difficult (or impossible) to operate the
so-called white-slave rings now sponsored by various elitist groups
and protected by corrupt police authorities.
