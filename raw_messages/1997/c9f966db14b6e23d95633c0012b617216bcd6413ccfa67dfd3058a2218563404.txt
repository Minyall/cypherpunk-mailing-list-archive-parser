Yet another person who needs a good stern talking to by the nearest
cypherpunk --- this guy posted to comp.lang.perl.misc with the following
blasphemy, which I luaghed at until I had tears in my eyes.

for security holes.
--END COMPLETE STUPIDITY--

If anyone wants to spam this guy, or at least show him the error of his
ways, his sig explains the necessary info:
