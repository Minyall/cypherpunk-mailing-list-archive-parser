Because the guy who wrote it was let off after that on his jail 
charges, so I'm not going to use anything he made after that if
I don't know why.
I'm not saying that he rolled over or nothin buyt I'm gonna be
paranoyd like he said in the book. I dont suposse he'd mind,
since he said it.
I'm not real smart sometimes but I'nm not a real lamer, either.
(I don't think)
