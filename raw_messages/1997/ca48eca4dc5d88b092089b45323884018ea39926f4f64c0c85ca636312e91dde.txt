Cypherpunks,
  I'd like to thank my many fans on the list for their support for my
latest album. You've been great.

  Sorry I can't take time to chat, but I've got to get out to the ranch
and deliver some supplies for spring planting.
  My truck broke down this morning, so I had to rent one. I've got to
pick up some fertilizer for the fields, and diesel fuel for the 
tractors.
  I've also got to stop by the Federal Building in Denver and drop off
the money order for that traffic ticket I got last week, so I've got
to run.

John Denver
