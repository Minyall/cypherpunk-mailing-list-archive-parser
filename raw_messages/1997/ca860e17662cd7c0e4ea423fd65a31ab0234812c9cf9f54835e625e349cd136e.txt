Looks like Jim has been sentenced to 10 years without the right
to correspondence.

To those who do not understand the cultural connotations of this 
phrase, I will explain. During Stalin's purges around 1937, a lot of
people were arrested and nothing could be found out about them -- 
not even when they were held. Their relatives were later notified that
the prisoners were sentenced to 10 years without the right to
correspondence.

That was an euphemism for being executed.

I would not be surprized if Jim committed a "suicide". With the advance
of modern psychology and psychotropic drugs, that could even be a true
suicide, done without physical assistance of Jim's captors.

Or Jim might suddenly die of "heart attack".

In fact, I am willing to bet 40 cents against a dollar that Jim will
notg et out of jail alive.
