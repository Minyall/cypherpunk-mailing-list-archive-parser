I know for a fact that an action against Intel involving its putting graphics
on the CPU and/or support chips is in the works.

However saying that M$ is one of the good guys just because their position
on GAK and strong crypto is a little more palatable than Netscape's and
because they don't donate as much $$$ to the Democratic National Committee
as Netscape does is, IMO, a little too much of a stretch.

This is a baseless, lawless, outrageous action, but I'm glad it's aimed at
someone I don't like.
