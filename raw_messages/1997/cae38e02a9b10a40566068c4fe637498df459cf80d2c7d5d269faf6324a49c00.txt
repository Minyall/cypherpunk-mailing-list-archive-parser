If I live in the US and put the perl RSA code in
my sig, then post in an international newsgroup,
have I illegally exported encryption?

If I put that same code on my web site, then
post requests to view my site in an
international newsgroup, have I exported it?

What is the penalty for exporting powerful
encryption?
