For an almost totally off-topic followup, there was a religious sect
in England in the mid-1600s called the "Ranters"; one of the books by
Quaker writer Robert Barclay is called "Anarchy of the Ranters"
(he was against them ...)

Here on Cypherpunks, we've got the "Ranting of the Anarchists" :-)

Another writer on the Net, who's more pro-Ranter, says that
