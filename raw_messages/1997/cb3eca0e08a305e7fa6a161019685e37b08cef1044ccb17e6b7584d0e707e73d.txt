The Libertarian Party.

It has strongly supported the Second Amendment, and has not, so far as I
know, tried to screw up any other of the important amendments.

My problem with it is that it is a political organization, and the
newsletters and local chapters are focussed on "inside baseball" of various
elections. And the California State Convention I attended some years back
was about the most boring thing I've ever been to.

I suspect the Cato Insitute is also Pro-Second without screwing with any of
the other good amendments.

As Greg knows well, of course, the ACLU is to avoided at all costs.
