Perhaps we should start suggesting to members of the press that they
ask the U.S. Congress members how far they take the position of key
escrow.

After all, the primary government utilization of cryptography is in
the military and intelligence community.  Given the long, colourful
history of rogue operations and criminal actions hidden under the
cover of secrecy (including the usage of strong cryptographic systems),
we might propose that the U.S. and other governments escrow their own
keys--how about the UN, with the Security Council members having the
right to decipher messages, or InterPol, or the World Court.

After all, if individuals have no right to privacy, why should any
organization have one?  Is the right to privacy and secrecy something
that comes from additive rights?  Does it come from possession of
military force, up to and including nuclear weapons?  What's the line?
I personally wouldn't mind knowing the threshold I need to cross to
have a 'right' to privacy.  It gives me a goal.
