Dimitri rights code sometimes.  He wrote a cancel-bot.  Very
constructive piece of work in an indirect way.  See: having nice
freely available cancel-bots enables technically clueless, would
be-censors to censor more.  They censor more, and cause a nuisance for
themselves sending out tons of cancel messages.  This incentivizes
more and more people to ignore cancels (the trend in news
administration these days I understand is to ignore cancels entirely),
which means that you can't have your USENET posts censored nearly as
easily.
