I thought that was the whole point of the PGP design.  It makes the
presence of third parties clear and visible to all participants.  This
seems to be the fundamental principle.  PGP is designed to allow Alice
and Bob to be informed if third party access is built in.  Key escrow
and re-encryption are inherently less visible forms of message access.
