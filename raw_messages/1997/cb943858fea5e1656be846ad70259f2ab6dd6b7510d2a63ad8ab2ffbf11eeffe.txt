It seems without exposure of our views to a wider, educated, audience
there's little chance of being heard above the clamor raised by LE.
Although PBS is partly gov't funded it does seem to have tacked some
relatively sensitive political topics in a balanced manner.  Why don't we
write and call to suggest they plan a segment on this issue next week?
Declan, got any juice?
