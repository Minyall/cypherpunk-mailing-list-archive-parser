Excuse me while I laugh so hard the milk comes out my nose.

Oooops... Self re-flatulance. Excuse me...


So, let's have fun, if it's really possible, with a name, shall we?

Um,

Normless Dick?

Normie Dickless?

I also find it hard that a "ranking democrat" has a normal dick, anyway,
impute that how you will...


Wiping the front of my shirt, now,
Bob Hettinga
