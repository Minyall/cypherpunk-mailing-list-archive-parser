I don't know that I can agree with that and still be for freedom.  By
that standard, so is posting or mailing "non spam" articles containing
a topic that the owner of a recipient machine is not interested
in. The magnitude of the theft is not relavent.

My point of focus is freedom. Deleting others' messages is not
justifiable for -any- reason, IMO. If you have a problem with what
is sent, you should take it up with the source of the transmission.
The carriers of that transmission cannot care about the content and
still profess to be "free" in any way.

A person was frighteningly ugly. Once he was asked how could he go on
living with such a terrible face. "Why should I be unhappy?", answered
the man. "I never see my own face; let others worry."
