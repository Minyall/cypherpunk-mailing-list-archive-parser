Besides doing things at the SMTP, IPSEC, or SSL layers,
another approach is SSH.  You could build an application-specific
relay (e.g. something sitting on your machine receiving SMTP
and something sitting on your mailhost relaying it to sendmail),
but SSH does close enough to that that it may be the way to go,
except for occasional annoyances about who can use Port 25.

Also, there are two mail protocols to address - 
smtp for sending, but pop3 (or imap4) for mailbox-retrieval.
Using either SSH or IPSEC or something SSL-based
can help you cover the POP3 end as well.

On the other hand, you can also use Hotmail or a Hotmail clone
with SSL and bypass the whole process.  Or you can use a
PGP-equipped remailer.
				Thanks!
