This is a similar idea to implementing, say DES, with independent 
subkeys. Layering encryption in this manner makes the plaintext more 
difficult to determine providing that:

a. The involved cryptosystem is not a group, or does not posess strong 
group like properties (eg. There are no large subgroups).

b. Independent keys are used for each encryption

For a good example of a particular case of your idea see 3DES

This law would be difficult to pass, because it is essentially saying 
some sets of data may be encrypted and some not, and there are lots of 
ways out to give plausible deniability "It isn`t an encrypted file 
officer, it`s random bits being encrypted as cover traffic", if the 
cryptosystem is strong the cyphertext shouldn`t be distinguishable from 
random values.

As for circumventing it, any law such as this should just be ignored.
