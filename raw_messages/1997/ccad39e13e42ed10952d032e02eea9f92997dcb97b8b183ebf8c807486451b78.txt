According to an article in Saturday's San Francisco Chronicle, the US
Senate's Rules Committee denied a junior Senate member's request to bring
his laptop to the floor. Aparently, the Rules Committee believes that
laptop use is incompatible with the hallowed nature of Senate debates.

Diane Feinstein is cited as saying that she strongly opposes laptops in the
Senate. She warned that if laptops were permitted, as many as 30-40 of the
100 members of the chamber might start using laptops (while making vital
decisions about the future of this nation).

The article also stated that mechanical pencils and wrist watches have
however been permitted since the early 1900's.

These people banning laptops amongst their peers are the same people who
will decide on the future use of crypto by the masses.

Give it up. Any dollar spent lobbying these Luddites is a dollar wasted.
