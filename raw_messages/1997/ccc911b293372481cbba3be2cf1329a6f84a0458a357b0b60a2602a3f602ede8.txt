No, you can't enforce corporate snooping without a mail enforcer. You can
meet the corporate demands which PGP claim to be supporting without a
mail enforcer. There's a difference.

The only real benefit of CMR over the alternate systems suggested is that
the corporation can snoop on all email sent to their employees. Yet PGP
Inc have claimed on several occasions that this is not their intention.
Odd, that.
