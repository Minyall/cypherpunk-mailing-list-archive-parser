This week we've taken one of the net's most respected magazines - and 
curried it. That's right, we proudly invite you to feast on the Curried 
Issue of Shift Control, a veritable korma-copia of spicy treats. Our 
menu includes every curried delicacy ever invented - plus one or two 
that Shift Control's own masters of masala have cooked up themselves...

The starter: Poppadum will eat itself (a poppadum taste-a-thon).

The main dish: A tour through the three levels of curry house, from the
corner kormarama to the true viceroys of vindaloo.

The side dishes:
Curried thumbs - a tasteful selection of microwavable curries.
Curried songs - from 'Korma Chameleon' to 'Vindaloo Sunset'.
Curried Spice Girls - if the Girls were curries, what kinds would they be? 
Curried films - featuring 'Last Mango in Paris' and other screen platters.

Also on the menu this week...

The best curry of the millennium and a quiz to test how wild you are about 
curry - all with a rich and fragrant smothering of instant granulated Chip 
Shop Curry Sauce. Mmmm.

We also cater for those who prefer British fare with a fine selection of 
fiction, including your chance to win Â£200 - a lot of curries - by entering 
our short story competition.

So give yourself a tasty treat and partake in our sumptuous offerings, all
of which are hot, steaming and awaiting your delectation  at
