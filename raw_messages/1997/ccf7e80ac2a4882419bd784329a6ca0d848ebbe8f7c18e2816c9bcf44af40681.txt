  You forgot to add, "...and your mother wears army boots!" before
your attempted "guilt by association" slur and the placing of your
esteemed self on an intellectual pedestal.
  I have noticed in the list's dick wars and pissing contests that
those with the shortest dicks put themselves on pedestals in order
to compensate for their physical shortcomings and those with the 
smallest bladders use the largest dictionary in hopes that extra
acidity will compensate for lack of volume.

  It is my contention that those who enjoy "mental masturbation"
also "find lust to be a noble urge."
  Of course, I'm Chinese...I could be Wong.
