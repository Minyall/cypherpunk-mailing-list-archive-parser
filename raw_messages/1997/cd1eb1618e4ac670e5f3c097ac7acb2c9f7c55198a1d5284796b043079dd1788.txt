Where do people get these bizarre ideas? C2 didn't censor the list. A guy
who happened to work for C2 dropped some messages from one list. The
messages still went out on the unfiltered list. Had he worked for Mc
Donald's or the the NYC Sanitiation Department, would you blame them for
this as well?
