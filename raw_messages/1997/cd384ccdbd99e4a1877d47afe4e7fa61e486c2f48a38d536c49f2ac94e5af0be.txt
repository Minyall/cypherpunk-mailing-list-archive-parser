Well their are some basics that seem to get overlooked:

Corporate Access to Plain Text (CAPT)
- ------------------------------

- -- You work for the company
- -- Any documents you create on company time are owned by the company --
The company uses PGP 5.5 to ensure they can decrypt *their* documents --
You know which documents they have access to
- -- CAPT is flexable and can be adjusted to fit the security needs
   of the company.


Government Access to Keys (GAK)
- -------------------------------

- -- The governemnt works for you (at least in theory)
- -- Any document you create are your own.
- -- The govenrment want your keys so they can read *your* documents -- The
government wants access to ALL your documents
- -- There is no fleaxbility in GAK they want it all


There is a clear distinction here between one haveing the ability to
decrypt their own documents and a non-owner decrypting someone elses
documents. This is the distinction between corporate access to plain text
and GAK. The company *owns* the documents. They have a right to read them
any time they want. If you don't want your *private* corrospondance to be
read by others in the company then don't write them and transmit them at
work.
