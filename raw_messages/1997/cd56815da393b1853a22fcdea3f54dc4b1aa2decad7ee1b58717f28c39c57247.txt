The only newspaper article I've read about such matters was written about
three months ago by Joseph Sobran(sp?).  He's a regular libertarian pundent
in the Las Vegas Review Journal's Sunday edition, and certainly not
mainstream.  If 60-minutes, or an equivalent TV journal, would have the
nerve to carry such a segment it might open quite a few eyes which will
otherwise remain closed.

        I know not what instruments others may use,
         but as for me, give me Ecache or give me debt.
