I used to models of various commodities and the common wisdom is:

the cost of carrying precious metals (gold, silver, platinum, palladium)
is so negligible that they can be treated as foreigh currencies with
interest rates. That's how most people treat them in practice.
(There are more exotic metals with little carrying costs, like
rubidium...)

Commodities like oil, gas, lumber, as well as baser metals (aluminium, copper)
have a cost of carry that must be figured in your model.

I suggest that if you want to model internet bandwidth as a commodity, you
must assume that it depreciates as it becomes less scare.
