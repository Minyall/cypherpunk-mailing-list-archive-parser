Someone wrote to the list in the last day or so (I seem to have mislaid the
message) asking what happened to the ITAR's personal use exemption. The
introductory comments to the new 12/30/96 regs indicate that:

"License Exceptions TMP and BAG effectively replace the Department of
State's personal use exemption." (Federal Register, p. 68575)

License exception TMP is described at 15 CFR 740.4, and BAG is described at
15 CFR 740.9, both of which are available via John Young's helpful
hypertext version of the EARs at <http://jya.com/740.htm>.
