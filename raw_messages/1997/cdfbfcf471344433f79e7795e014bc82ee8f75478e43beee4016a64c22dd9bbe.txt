Tim, what you are proposing is no different from any other cypherpunks
node. So if you suggest to add more nodes, I am all for it.

What you describe above is precisely what algebra, cyberpass, and
ssz.com do now.

It is not a "just another service" as you suggest below, it is
exactly the same service, but on a new node.

Actually, I think that it is important to add one more node to the
network: ssz.com has mail delivery problems and the two more or less
reliable nodes are cyberpass and algebra. I do not see it as *sufficiently*
robust, since the probability of both of them being down is on the
order of 0.5%.

Tim, if you read what goes into your filter file, putting anyone there
does not mean that you ignore them.
