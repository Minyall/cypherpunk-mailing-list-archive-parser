Hey, thanks everyone, no more pointers are needed. My favorite crypto guru
in the Estekhbarat gave me a pointer to his site. Alas, my version of the
Macintosh OS is not recent enough to use this program.

(Funny how most Windows software will run on the 6-year old 3.1, but Mac
software often requires the latest "x.01" rev of the unstable OS. I knew
I'd pay a price for defecting from the Borg.)

Shows you that ordinary compatibility issues are a more effective bar to
world-wide use than the weak attempts by the USG to limit access by
foreigners. When the Estekhbarat has it, you _know_ such controls are
pointless.
