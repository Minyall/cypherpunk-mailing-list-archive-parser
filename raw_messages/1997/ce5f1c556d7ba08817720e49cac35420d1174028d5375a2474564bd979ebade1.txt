No offence to you as a reporter, but I wouldn't trust Reuter's paraphrasing
of what he said as far as I can throw my monitor.

They paraphrase and then call it a quote.

Does anyone have a transcript of what he actually said?
The whole speech?

It's not on the whitehouse site, nor CNN, nor the SPA site.
