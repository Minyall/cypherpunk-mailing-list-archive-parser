  I think you just showed the answer to the question is "Yes."
  Politicians build a house of mirrors with bills that they
"introduce"--agencies that they "propose" be funded--causes
that they "support."

  I'm not interested in a reporter quoting "the record" to me.
I can get that from Feinstein's glossy handouts. I want to know
what a politician has *done* for me (or against me), not how 
much she purports to *love* me.

  I enjoy many of your articles, Declan, but please--no more
"Senator XYZ introduced a bill that supports mom's apple pie
and the flag." tripe.
