"fucking porn" no longer returns anything, but "fuckin porn" does.
(iterestingly enough, neither "fuckin" nor "porn" return anything
interesting by themselves).  Perhaps we're seeing ebonics in action.

And here's some more phrases to try:

rimming 
nambla  (now, that's what I call "family friendly")
warez
phreaking
remailer*

I wonder which of the above will be removed first....
