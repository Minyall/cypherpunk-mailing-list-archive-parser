Well I *ALWAYS* have any legal documents signed & notarized and then
snail-mailed. Faxing/e-mail is only used for drafts.

Be vary wary of Digital signature laws. They are being drafted by the
clueless and IMHO will cause more problems then they are worth in the long
run (no law is better than a bad law).

A case in point; I just received word that under the Utah Digital
Signature Law "encryption, of and by itself, would constitute the legal
force of signature". Now I received this third hand but the quote came
from the author of the Utah law. Why this is a *BAD* thing is left as an
exercise for the reader.
