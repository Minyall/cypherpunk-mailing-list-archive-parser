It was a joke.

As you are a non-native English speaker (Belarus?), my subtlety may not
have been as obvious as it would be to any reasonably-bright American or
Brit.

In any case, I use a Macintosh and Explorer 3.0, and no browser came with
my Mac when I bought it in '94. Many machines of various flavors were sold
prior to Explorer or Navigator being bundled.

Me, I have no immediate plans to switch to Explorer.
