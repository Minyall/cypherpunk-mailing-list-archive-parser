The API as it stands is done, and tested fairly well on linux and bsdi.
Over the next week or two I have more to add though, and have to do some
porting, notably to windoze. But that's roughly the ETA. I think I'm gonna
set up some sort of mailing list for it, I'll post details.

BTW, I think the API header made it's way to this list a couple weeks ago,
but if people want to know what to expect, lemme know.

Regards,
Jeremey.
