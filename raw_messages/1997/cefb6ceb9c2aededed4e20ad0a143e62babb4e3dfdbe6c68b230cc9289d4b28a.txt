Greets, kiddies!  Quick question.  Has anything constructive come
out of nobody@replay.com in the past month?  I've just signed on
with this mailing list, and all I ever read from that anon addy is
a flame regarding one person or another.

Personally, unless at least a couple folks using replay.com have
pitched in usefull information in the past while, I'm irate enough
to open up my .kill file.

Thanks for your help,
The Sheriff.
