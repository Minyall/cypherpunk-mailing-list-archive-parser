I really resent and hate spammers like Jason William RENNIE, who keeps
spamming me with his repetitive views about SPAM!

I want to know why Cypherpunks are not working on getting laws passed to
stop SPAM like this from reaching me! I want to know why Cypherpunks have
not gotten laws passed forcing Jason William RENNIE and Philip A.
Mongelluzzo to stop sending me SPAM I don't want to read!

When I took my oath, I promised to defend and protect the perquisites of
Congress, and I promised to uphold the laws of the United States, including
the one which says "Congress shall make laws which they claim will protect
the children, regulate commerce, control bad thoughts, uphold Christian
values, and provide for the common welfare system."

So, you Cypherpunks, are you up to the challenge to get these laws passed?

That's why I want a law banning your anti-SPAM SPAM from being spammed into
my mailbox!

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
