I've always been told that software with function hooks for crypto was
just as unexportable as crypto itself.  This however doesn't make any
sense, because then anything with a plugin interface falls into that
category.  Hell, anything that can call external programs would qualify as
having a plugin interface, and all web browsers, mail/news readers, IRC
clients, editors, and possibly even all operating systems would fall into
that category.  Of course, this is the goobermint we're dealing with...
what did we expect but another arbitrary-arrest law.
