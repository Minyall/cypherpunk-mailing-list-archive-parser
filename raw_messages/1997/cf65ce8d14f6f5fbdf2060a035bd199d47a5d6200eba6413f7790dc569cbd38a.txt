Hashcash has a double-spending database to prevent this -- one use and you've
got to wait until it's out of the database (quite possibly a long time) before
you can reuse it.

Nyet. It can be phased in over time...people install the software, mailing
lists warn their users to exempt them, and the big servers start asking for the
hashcash, little servers pick it up.

This's already been addressed.

Well, it wouldn't be much trickier than a Pine address book (few things are :) 
or a killfile.
