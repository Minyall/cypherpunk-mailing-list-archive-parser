The problem here is that we are talking civil action not criminal
prosecution. Both James Dolan and his co-conspiritors should be up on
criminal charges and spend a nice long vacation at "club fed".

I am sure that the federal appologist on the list will have some excuse
why federal agents should be exempt from procecution when they commit
felonies against the citizens of this country that they are hired to serve
and protect.
