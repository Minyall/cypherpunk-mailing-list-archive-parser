My reading of Jon's post was that the SMTP policy enforcer only worked for 
outgoing messages.  Perhaps that's wrong, but that needs to be double-
checked.  See below as well...

The snooping key.  If it doesn't exist on *my* keyring.  (Say I have your 
key, but not the key designate as your snooping key...)  [BTW: Forgive the 
English, I'm tired and speaking in choppy sentences]

If I have your key, but not the other key that I'm also supposed to encrypt 
to, PGP (whichever versions, I'm not entirely sure how the feature set breaks 
down, but I believe this applies to all versions of 5.x)  will not even 
mention that there was another key it would've have offered to encrypt to.

Greatly complicating the "web of trust" method, but..  You can only chain 
signatures so far before you run into problems, and getting people to 
continuosly recertify could be a major pain, but I can see the point you are 
making.   It got clearer.

Well, at least with RSA keys, I believe the memory requirements to handle 
current factoring algorithms are quite untenable for 2048 bit keys.  I think 
768 is out of the range of current systems.  I think this came up on the RC5 
(Bovine) mailing list, and the figures for the required server was something 
absolutely ridiculous.  To distribute the job using the more efficient 
algorithm required machines with 128 meg of ram, but the slower one was a bit 
more doable.

In short, I don't think 2048 RSA keys are reasonable target in the forseeable 
future.  [Remember, Moore's law is only applicable for another 12 years or 
so.  Then quantum mechanics starts to be a serious problems, and electrons 
start switching channels in the chips.]

But this is a bit of a wandering topic now.  Let me continue...

Hmm.. I must've missed that.

Well, I wasn't really encrypting anything I really cared about.  It was 
backups of autoexec.bats and config.syss, I just wanted another copy that I 
*knew* when it was made, it wouldn't get overwritten, and it wouldn't get 
modified without me knowing.   And I needed something to use PGP for, so...

In all honesty, the public key baggage is 512 bytes ( I think, possibly bits. 
 I've forgotten now )  Quite insignificant if you're dealing with CAD 
drawings.  The added benefit of reducing passphrase uses is quite significant 
(with current PGP versions, the database of keys is a better idea actually).  
Possibly more portable across a range of users as well.

I was actually thinking something along the lines of creating a file - 
encrypting it to your whole workgroup, and leaving it on a server.  Now you 
have the advantage of not having any security problems even if the server is 
compromised [without workstation compromise, of course], and all the 
important people can access it.  Of course, the last person to modify it 
resigns it, and it gets dropped into your RCS system.

you get the added advantage of being able to rotate your keys here as well, 
so even if one key is compromised, and the server is compromised, you don't 
lose the whole system.  Identical argument as for communications keys.

That's a different problem.  For that you're [in this ultra-theoretical 
world] probably going to want something along the lines of this:  Symmetric 
encryption for speed on the partition, and that key stored with several 
recipients in the same place as the Secure Partition Driver (SPD).  (This 
falls in the, "If you're going to build a system, make sure you think of 
everythign you want and make sure it fits in the framework somewhere" method)

I'm not sure you need to escrow anything, as long as there is a way to share 
things among certain groups of people.  Jon's ideas of non-hierarchical 
recovery systems seem a lot more secure anyway, especially with the rest of 
this thread.

Oh - for the situation with Andy Grove (Intel CEO) describe earlier on this 
thread - let me give this suggestion:
	AG's key w/extra encryptions to CFO (or Pres. of Board, or someone else with 
significant influence and a close working relationship.  Backup for problems 
with intransit e-mail.)
	Similar setups for everyone else in the company.  Probably the top-level 
executives all have AG as the backup.  This elminates snooping entirely in 
the company, on the top level execs.  This partially hierarchical method 
wouldn't be horrible, and limits snooping to the level above you, or to 
peers, depending on setup.

Yeah, you covered them fairly well, and cleared up the issues where I 
honestly thought it was a fear-mongering problem.  I still don't completely 
agree with you, but we've clarified the problem areas.  Thanks.  (Too many 
wars get *way* too religous on the net.  Let's try and avoid that here, ok?)
