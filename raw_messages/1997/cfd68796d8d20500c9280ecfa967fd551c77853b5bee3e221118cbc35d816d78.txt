    as I heard the story, NA was not really aware they were in KRAP; seems
    like a marketing type (no brains as first requirement) signed them
    up at the inception --however, they never made formal signed application;   
    and, they never paid their dues. rest as follows....  and it does not
    make me trust PGP 5+ anymore than I ever did. PGP 5.5 may not endorse
    KRAP and he rest of that nonsense, but it sure has the hooks for it.
