I can see the utility, but it means a lot more CPU cycles burned on
toad.  It also brings up the age-old clearsign verification spectre.
(does anyone have that figure for the percentage of clearsigned posts
that verify as good?)

In general, I think it's a good extension for majordomo.  It may not get
used on this list, but it makes new tools available for future lists.

Has anyone looked at using Cryptix-extended perl and their PGP lib?  I
haven't got the Cryptix extensions to build on my linux box yet.
