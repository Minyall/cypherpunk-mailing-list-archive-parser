* News of the Weird reported in 1994 on the controversy over who
owned the world's largest cow hairball, but it now appears that an
also-ran at that time, Mike Canchola of Sterling, Colo., is now
number one.  In 1994 a Garden City, Kan., historical society had a
37-incher, but Canchola has since come across one measuring 43.3
inches around.  In the course of his work at a local beef plant,
Canchola plucks out the non-championship hairballs, dries them,
has colleague Frank Alcala paint faces or scenery on them, and sells
them for $50 each.
