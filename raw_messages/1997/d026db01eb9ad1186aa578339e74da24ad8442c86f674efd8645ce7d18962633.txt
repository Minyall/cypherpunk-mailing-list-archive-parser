Thanks for posting this!  My hat's off to Senator Gephardt for
coming out in favor of economic and personal freedom!

(Of course, it's not like I'd set my hat _down_ where he could
steal it or check its national origin label :-)  Dick's still a 
statist protectionist, but even if he's doing the right thing
just to annoy the right-wing statists like Clinton, it's a good start!)
