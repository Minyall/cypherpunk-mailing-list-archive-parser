Strongly disagree. That would be too arbitrary.

In practice, a system such as Chudov's STUMP reduces the latency and 
moderator effort considerably, as responsible posters get put onto the 
white list for auto-approval (to be degraded to hand-moderation if they 
lose it). For list regulars, it's as if the list were unmoderated.
