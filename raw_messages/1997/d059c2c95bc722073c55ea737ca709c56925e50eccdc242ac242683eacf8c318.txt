Mr. Sabrin also accepted political welfare (matching funds, a form of
compelled speech if ever I saw one). This annoyed me, since he did it
in a nationwide campaign for contributions claiming that this retreat
from principle would give him a chance to win. As I recall, he got
about 10% of the vote, and IMO didn't even deserve that.

He was, however, another great argument for NOTA's (None Of The Above)
candidacy -- as if another one were needed.
