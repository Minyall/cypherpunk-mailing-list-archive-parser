Actually, and sort of to the point, no, the keys never actually ever the
BBN box, except as part of a backup procedure in which they are
extracted in a doubly-encrypted form for which for security reasons you
need the manufacturer's help in restoring.

To this day, no human or computer other than the box itself knows the
key.
