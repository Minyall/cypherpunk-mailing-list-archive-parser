Electronic Frontiers Georgia is forming a working group on Secure 
Authentication Methodologies.  This is the procedure for verifying who really 
owns the public key that has been placed in a database repository, or 
Certification Authority (CA).  Issues at question are not only the technical 
considerations, but also concerns of privacy, consumer protection, and 
legality.  Questions have arisen as to whether to use picture ID, notary 
publics, existing databases, and governments to enforce secure 
authentication.  Another question that has been raised is secure 
authentication possible at all?

Also explored will be hierarchical vs web of trust models for CA's.

The first working group meeting will be held at Georgia State University Law 
School at Professor Mark Budnitz offices.  Since many people who would like 
to be involved in this subject cannot attend physical meetings, this is a 
call to participate electronically.

If you have an interest in being involved with this group, please contact 
Robert Costner, EFGA (770) 512-8746, mailto:pooh@efga.org
