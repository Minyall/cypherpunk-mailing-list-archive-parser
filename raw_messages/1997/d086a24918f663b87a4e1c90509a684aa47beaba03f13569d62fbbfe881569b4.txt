Please don't get the wrong idea, that I'm paranoid or something, but
I think I just saw a tiny leak, a miniscule Freudian slip of sorts -
Sandy says "I will do nothing to restrain ..... the unedited list...".

Do we now have to have occasional assurances that the "unedited" list
is not being restrained?  I thought that was a given, beyond question
of any kind.  I thought *all* of the controversy revolved around the
edited/censored list (having stole the original list's name), and that
everyone understood that the uncensored list was untouchable.  But now
Sandy is taken to offering reassurances.  What's next??
