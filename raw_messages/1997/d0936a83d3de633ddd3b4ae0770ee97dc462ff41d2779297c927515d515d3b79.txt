Undoubetedly there will be attempts to create display chips with built-in decryption and special display and/or raster/vectorizing approaches which are comfortably viewed but are difficult to snap shot using "screen shooters" or simple capture hardware.  With the new USB and FireWire interface standards this isn't too far fetched.  All, as you say probably doomed to failure.
