I've had a couple requests to redistribute or post the info I have on Jim
Bell. I've decided not to. There's a good bit of personal information in
there, including his SSN and information about financial investments, that
I don't feel comfortable posting. I suspect Jim has enough problems
already.

Yes, I know, "information will be free" and all that, but I don't have to
be the cause of its release.
