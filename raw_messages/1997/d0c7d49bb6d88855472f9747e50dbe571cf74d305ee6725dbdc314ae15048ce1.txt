If you super-encrypted the IDEA encrypted traffic with A5, it should
not require cooperation of the cell phone provider.  You always need a
capable device at the other end.  If the phone at the other end isn't
IDEA/RSA/DH capable, you can fall back to only A5.

My question about electrical interfaces was wondering if the above
could be acheived by producing a plugable mini-smartcard, or
desolderable IC which would allow this to be done with standard GSM
phones.

Not from Newt's eavesdroppers sure, but it wouldn't cost that much for
someone who wanted the traffic.  40 bits of effective key space at
most,
