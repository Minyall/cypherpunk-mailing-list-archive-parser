If anyone is going to be in south Orange County, California during the
third week in March, and is interested  in speaking to a group of high
school students on Cryptography and the political and economic
considerations involved, please contact me via email at tobin@mail.edm.net.
 Thank you. (I'm not on cypherpunks, so don't email the list.)
