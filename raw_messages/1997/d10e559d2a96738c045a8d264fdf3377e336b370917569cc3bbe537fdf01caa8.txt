Hi,

Just talked to SWBT and they apparently show the ISDN line as disconnected.
Upon further digging at my request they determined that indeed there had
been some sort of cable throw yesterday. They issued me a trouble ticket
number and will check the line. Considering the intermittent nature of the
drop my suspicion is a bad punch-down. If this is so we should see the line
stabalize sometime this afternoon.

More as I learn it.
