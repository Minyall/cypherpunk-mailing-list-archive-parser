I avoid Radio Shack as a general rule, because I haven't been pleased with
the quality of their products and I find their privacy-hostile behavior
annoying. But when I have made purchases at Radio Shack, I've had no trouble
with them if I say "This is a cash sale. You don't need my name or address."

But I understand you're considerably less courageous in person than you are
from behind a terminal a few thousand miles away, so it's entirely possible
that a mousy Radio Shack clerk asking for your name does pose a significant
threat to your privacy. I had overlooked the "wimpy nerd" problem in my
earlier message. Thanks for pointing out my oversight. In the future, please
assume that when I mention a hypothetical consumer, I mean one of average or
greater fortitude. Perhaps you can find a friend who's not scared of the
Radio Shack clerks to make your purchases for you?
