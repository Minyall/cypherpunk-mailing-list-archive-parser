The FBI has published in the Federal Register today:

Implementation of Section 109 of the Communications Assistance
for Law Enforcement Act

AGENCY: Federal Bureau of Investigation, DOJ.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This rule implements section 109 of the Communications
Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), which requires the Attorney
General to establish regulations which set forth the procedures that
telecommunications carriers must follow in order to receive
reimbursement under Sections 109 and 104 of CALEA. CALEA requires that
this rule enable carriers to receive payments in a timely and cost-
efficient manner while minimizing the cost to the Federal Government.
Specifically, this rule sets forth the means of determining allowable
costs, reasonable costs, and disallowed costs. Furthermore, it
establishes the requirements carriers must meet in their submission of
cost estimates and requests for payment to the Federal Government for
the disbursement of CALEA funds. In addition, this rule protects the
confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information from
unnecessary disclosure. Finally, it sets forth the means for
alternative dispute resolution.
