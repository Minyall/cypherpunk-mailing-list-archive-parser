You have a sucking big cancerous growth which is the government, it
provides legalised theft services, and the politicians acts as power
brokers in bartering back the stolen money to special interest groups.
The huge burgeoning unproductive work force which ineptly administers
this monster is a large burden on the economy.

Those persons you describe who inconsistently advocate big government
is natural enough -- they are sucked into the game, they are lobbying
in their special interest groups for some of the stolen loot to be
handed to them.

A leftist is someone who buys heavily into the legalised theft
concept.  Charity taken at the point of a gun is not charity, it is
theft.  And the stolen funds are used incredibly inefficiently, mostly
having the opposite effect to the claimed problem being solved, for
game theoretic reasons.
