Thanks for pointing this. We got a TXT version from GPO Access
and put it at:

   http://jya.com/s376.txt

With a link to your HTML.

On Waasenaar, we've written a few folks about finding a full copy, but
so far the word is the same as State's: none has been publically released.
Hope you get it.

When the pact was first discussed at State a recorder transcribed 
"Vasinor (phonetic)," so that term might turn up in searches.

As you noted, for those interested, we've put a few Waasenaar docs at:

Back to your FOIA to CIA, and the Agency's referral to FCC: I wonder if 
there might not be something to that lead. As you must know, the legislation 
covering national telecommunications security puts the FCC in the center 
of infowehr C4I. Excuse this cite to a pro citer, the NatSec Telecomm 
leg is at:

  http://jya.com/47cfr2.htm

This might support the CIA's intel that FCC is the chokepoint for CPI for
the IC.
