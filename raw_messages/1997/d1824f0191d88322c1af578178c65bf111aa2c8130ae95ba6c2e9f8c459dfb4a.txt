Yes, we will add this feature in some future release.  It will be
configurable, so if the user doesn't want to check CRLs he doesn't
have to.

Aren't all certs VeriSign issues only valid for one year?  This isn't
any different.

There's nothing preventing another CA from getting permission from the
USG to issue these magic certs.  We would have to distribute a patch,
but I don't see any problem with that.

I fail to see the problem.  Right now, if you want to communicate
securely with exportable web browsers, this is the only way to do it. 
Either you do it, or you don't.  If VeriSign doesn't renew your cert,
then you're right back where you were the previous year.
