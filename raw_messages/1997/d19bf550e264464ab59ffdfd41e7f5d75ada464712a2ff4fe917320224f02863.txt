Another game you can play, with the audio, is to have music playing in
the background, so Eve not only has to fake Alice's voice, but has to
fake Alice reading numbers against a background of an arbitrarily-selected
musical piece.

Now, the effectiveness of the technique may depend on the musical
tastes of the players ("Hey - that's not Toscanini conducting
Beethoven's Fifth - that's the Furtwangler version on Deutsche Gramophon!"/
"Oh, was that Elvis?  I guess so."/ "We're being MITMed - the Terrapin Station 
during the numbers was off the album, where Jerry remembered all the words, 
and now you're playing an audience tape version from Nassau in 89" )
and with some genres of music, it makes it easier to notice if 
there's a gap.
				Thanks!
