Latency may be a means to get security in the current remailer design,
but it is a means to the end and not the end itself.  This doesn't
mean we shouldn't use latency to get security, but it is undesirable,
like using cinderblocks for construction.  The reason I point this out
is that it is important to separate design choices to achieve a goal
from the goal itself.

If we had a remailer network in which each customer had a constant
bandwidth connection to one or more remailers, you could have zero
latency mail. (Actually, this would be nice to use with those Comsec
phones.)

It is my understanding that serious naval vessels like aircraft
carriers use constant bandwidth channels to defeat traffic analysis.
That is, to every place they might wish to communicate, they
continuously broadcast encrypted information.  Most of the time the
channel is empty, of course, but nobody outside can tell when.
