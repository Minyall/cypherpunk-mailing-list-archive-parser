  The editor of the main newspeak print media for the area I live
in told me that their reporters are instructed to write their 
articles so as to be readable to someone with an eighth grade
education.
  I certainly do not envy Declan for being in the position of
having to make his articles readable for the people who are still
trying to find the "Any" key while trying not to leave the 
cypherpunks with the impression he's a fucking retard.
