   For a paper on CAST see:

      http://www.nortel.com/entprods/entrust/cast.html

   "Constructing Symmetric Ciphers Using the CAST Design Procedure"

That URL didn't work, but the following URL did....

	http://www.entrust.com/library.htm

Does anyone know what the intellectual property status of CAST is?
