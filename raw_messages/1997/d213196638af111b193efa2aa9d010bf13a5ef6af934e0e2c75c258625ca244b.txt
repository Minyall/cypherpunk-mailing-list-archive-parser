This is what I fear, too.

I now regret any "help" I provided him in adding crypto and digital cash to
his plans. (When I first came into contact with him, he had utterly zero
knowledge of how crypto worked, and how it could ultimately be used. His
"wonderful idea" was cheesy, built on nothing but hot air. But once certain
ideas were explained to him, his system became actually workable, albeit
not actually extant.)

I expect an arrest of several of us, on typically trumped-up RICO-type
charges.  Mere speech has become criminalized, through vague, speculative,
conspiracy charges.

Fuck them.  If it's war they want...
