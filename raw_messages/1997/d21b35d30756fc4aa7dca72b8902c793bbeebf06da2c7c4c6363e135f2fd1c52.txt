In an interview to be aired on "60 Minutes" this Sunday, Alexandr
Lebed, former Russian National Security Advisor, will reveal that
his country has lost track of more than 100 nuclear bombs made to
look like suitcases, and has no idea what happened to them.

Probably not a good time to visit the Zionist Entity. :)
