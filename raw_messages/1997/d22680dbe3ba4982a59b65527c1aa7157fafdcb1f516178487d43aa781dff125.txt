The main french PGP HomePage is now here :
http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bay/9648

The page is called "PGP POUR LES FRANCAIS" ("PGP for the french people") and is wholly in french language.
You can find here a lot of informations about PGP 2.x and 5.x and a detailed PGP history.

A bientot :)
