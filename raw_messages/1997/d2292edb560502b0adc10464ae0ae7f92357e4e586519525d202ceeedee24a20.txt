How's that again?  Earlier you were saying that if any human considers
another human inhuman, all huamns lose humanity points, I showed an
example whereby all of humankind's inhumans action (by your model) would
calls all humanity - including the cop - to lose their humanity points to
the point of having negative humanity points therefore being human.  Why
are cops an exception to this?

OTOH: By your new example:

If you now take a blood sample from the plungee, is he human as well?  If
so, then both the cop and the plungee are human, therefore neither has
lost humanity points, and if someone else came with a chainsaw and cut the
cop's head off, and you now take all three persons' blood, they all are
human.  

Whether or not the chainsaw dude did it with malice and thought the cop
inhuman, all three blood samples will still show human.

So what's your point now?
