This is another bizarre issue in the whole CMR saga. PGP Inc are going
to corporations and telling them that the SMTP enforcer will allow them
to read all incoming email. Then they go out on the Net and tell people
how to get around the system. Either their customers are as dumb as PGP
appear to think, or the corporations will simply scrap CMR and just escrow 
keys in case people start taking PGP Inc's advice.
