  A beta implementation Ver:1.0 (for Win95/NT) of the
  CDSA API's has been posted to the web yesterday
  for free download.

  You can find it at www.intel.com/ial/security

  The implementation will timeout on Feb 28, 1997 and
  is non-exportable. Any feedback/comments on the
  implementation would be appreciated.
