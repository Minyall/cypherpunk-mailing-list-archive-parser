(However, unlike Bell, my solution would not involve the roundabout charade
of setting up some kind of betting market--as if the population at large
would care about J. Random Narc. Under my solution, the cops who pulled

given a fair trial and then imprisoned for a lot longer than the Thomases
will ultimately be imprisoned.)
