How are you planning to detect which bytes are passed in this way ?
Chosen plaintext attacks would do it, and show where (a+b)^(a0+b0) == 0.
Looks like you've just doubled our progress.

If the key is reused with a different message I don't think there's a
weakness.  An IV is a good idea, but aren't we _attacking_ this thing ?

I've grabbed a few search-engine hits and not read them yet.  I'll be
looking for clues there.
