Let me see if I understand you correctly. Your wife/gf/mother/brother
is getting arsefucked by a cop with a toilet plunger and your
preferred course of action while his/her rectum is perforated would
be to video tape the event? Why? So we can all watch on Real TV. So
the perps can launch another cover up internal investigation?

You really wouldn't consider intervening to stop further damage?

Of course this assumes you're actually able to be present and witness
the 'interrogation', which you more than likely will not be, unless
it's your turn next at playing scrub the toilet bowl.
