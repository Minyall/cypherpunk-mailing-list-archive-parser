You could probably do it with one church congregation's worth of
people.

Or, perhaps the basis of political power is a general acceptance of
the rulers among the ruled and acts which would disrupt this
acceptance are more dangerous to the government than you would think.

Amnesty International has been successful just by organizing massive
letter writing expressing disapproval of the treatment of particular
political prisoners.  The regimes affected could not reasonably be
described as "civilized."

For that matter, the U.S. and British governments have not always been
so nice when they didn't think anybody was looking.
