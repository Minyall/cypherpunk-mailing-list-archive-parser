Can anyone tell me if a person could expect to encounter any difficulty
with US Customs if they leave the US with PGP on a lap top machine? Would
you be questioned about the contents of your machine? Would you be obliged
to demonstrate that the machine was "clean" before it would be permitted to
leave the country? Would a person be compelled to divulge the contents of
any floppy disks in their possession before leaving the country with them?

Perhaps the prudent thing to do is download PGP to your machine after
leaving the US.
I must take a decision on this matter in a few months. Any advice would be
appreciated.

Cordially, rarab
