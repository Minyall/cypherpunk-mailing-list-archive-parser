Just a bit of new info about recent court actions, which is 
documented at:

   http://jya.com/jimbell-dock4.htm

In short, on November 17 Jim's attorney (D') and the prosecutor
(P') submitted Sentencing Memoranda to the Court. On November
21 (the previously scheduled sentencing date), D' presented a 
Supplement to Sentencing Memo. Both of D's memos were 
Filed Under Seal, but not the P's.

On November 21 the Court acks receipt of the sentencing
memoranda and a Pre-Sentencing Report (PSR) from the Probation 
Officer (PO). There was argument. The Court will present counsel with 
additional questions on sentencing. The sentencing is postponed 
(continued) until December 12. Jim, jail (D' remanded).
