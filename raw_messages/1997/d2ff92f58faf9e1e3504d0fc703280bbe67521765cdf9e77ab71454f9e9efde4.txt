Or post to a news group.  (Some form of transport that can be automated
and widely distributed without having to create new protocols.)

Also maintaining the temporary keys on some sort of volitile storage media
that does not leave traces for later when erased.  (RAM disk or the like.)
Keep the private key on the card and erase the old key as part of the
private key generation process.

The only weakness I see here (there may be others) is keeping the long
term key secure.  (Keeping the bad guys from generating their own bogus
keys for later timestamps and the like.)
