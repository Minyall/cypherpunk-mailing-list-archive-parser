	Freedom from embarrassment? I don't consider the Digital
Telephony debacle to have been lived down yet. I certainly don't have
a lot of faith that the people who brought us that are going to do any
better nowadays.
	I sense another dirty little deal is in the works, where we're
told they didn't "support" it, but "it could have been worse".

	OK. How about telling us how that's going to be done. And at
what point will you start calling for megaphones and marches
(metaphorically). If the answer is "never", well, I think that settles
just how much of a factor you'll be.
