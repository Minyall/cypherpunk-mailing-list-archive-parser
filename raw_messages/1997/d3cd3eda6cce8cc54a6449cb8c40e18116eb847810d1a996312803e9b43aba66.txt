    the claims have not been withdrawn.  there was an article 
    recently in the American Physics Society rag. anything goes at 
    absolute temperature including the proof of the einstein-bose
    predictions where molecules literally overlap.  plasmas have 
    some interesting effects on spatial relationships in non-miscable
    crytal structures, but the einstein-bose...

    there are at least 300 projects on cold fusion running... and one
    plausible explanation which I am aware of.  also, look at the other
    end --politics continues the Princeton ring, while the LLL Shiva
    project has not been metioned for several years.  go figure.
