I was wondering if anyone can comment on what type of encryption is used
for the passwords on zip disks..i've been seperated from the literature
that came with it, but i seem to remember reading that the actual
password info is kept in the hardware? and i was just wondering how
secure  it was (before you encrypt the information on the disk with your
own encryption methods)..

thanks..
