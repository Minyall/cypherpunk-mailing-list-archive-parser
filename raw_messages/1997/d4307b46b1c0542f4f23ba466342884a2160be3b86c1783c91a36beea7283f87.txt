Senators Lott, Burns and Ashcroft discussed encryption
policy reform on June 27. The Deschall crack is cited as
a risk posed by Admin-McCain-Kerrey limitations. Ashcroft 
stated:

   I am privileged to serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee 
   where we will address this issue after the July recess. I 
   pledge to work with members on that Committee and with 
   other interested Senators and the leader to try to move a 
   bill in that committee that will capture the essence of Burns 
   substitute.

   No nationwide key recovery system, or a new licensing 
   requirement for certificate authorities should be brought 
   to the floor without thorough examination, analysis and 
   understanding. We must further study the impact of these 
   provisions well before this bill is brought to the Senate floor.
