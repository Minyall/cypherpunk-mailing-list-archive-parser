I agree; that's why I don't. But I see an inconsistency here. PGP keep
telling us that CMR isn't so bad because you can work around it, or
superencrypt, or otherwise avoid the company's right to snoop on all
communications. Yet you, who believe in this right, support CMR, which
can be used to defeat that right, over simple escrow of employee's 
corporate communication keys. Why?

Again, I'm not saying that the companies have no such right. Personally
I'd rather escrow my corporate key than see widespread CMR in its current
form.
