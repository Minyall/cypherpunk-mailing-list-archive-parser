blanc has put forth an interesting assertion relating to nationalism and 
the
Internet. If he is correct then we will have a one world government (ie
technocracy) whether we like it or not.

When your little company grows up to become a big World Leader in robotics, 
will you then be a member of this technocracy, participating in a one-world 
government, whether we like it or not?   Will you sit on the Board of 
Honchos making important decisions about net access for all, perhaps active 
in the Chamber of Borgs?
