All the respect I deserve. :-).

Rodney Thayer, who's the IPSEC editor, among other things, is going to be
the event manager, and he's cc'd in the letter I sent out to begin with.
Some Producer got our names confused...

Besides, you'd better respect Rodney. The last time I saw him in a
flamewar, the other guy walked out holding his guts in his hands...

;-).


Oh. I talked to Some Producer this morning. He's pitching Buckley, et al.,
on the idea this weekend. I'll know by the beginning of next week.
December's open, and so are a bunch of months after April.

I haven't had this much fun since the hogs ate my little brother...

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
