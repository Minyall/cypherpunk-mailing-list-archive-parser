Sandy Sandfort, our Leader, Moderator, Guidance Counselor, Censor,  and
Speaker-to-Gilmour said:

"By the way, contrary to what Dimitri has alleged, I have posted
every message from him in which he was able to restrain himself
with regard to gratuitous insults and/or spam.  In other words,
the set of Dimitri posts that have appeared on the moderated list
is not the null set."

However, KOTM wrote:

"Anything?  My good friend TRRCJ3 reports from San Francisco that the
city is much nicer now that so many homosexuals are 6 feet under.

"Thank God for AIDS."

(end quote from KOTM)

Nice to know Sandy is doing such an efficient job of moderating out the
"flames," such as by kicking Igor's crypto-relevant article on denial of
service attacks to the flame bucket while bending over backwards to appear
to be "fair" to KOTM.

Face it, it's a bad idea. The Cypherpunks community is not the private
sandbox of Gilmour and Sandfort, and we don't need Sandy's "guidance" to
keep us from being straying sheep. The list may currently be hosted on
Gilmour's computer, but having Sandy decide what's right for us to read is
inconsistent with Cypherpunks ideals.
