I believe that many of them are people who feed off of the
endorphin/adreniline rush of being "outraged".  They need something to get
upset about.  Who cares if it is real or who gets hurt?  They are "doing
good by getting pissed".  It is that "moral outrage" that makes them forget
just how worthless and pathetic their own lives are.

It would be pretty sad if was not for the fact that so many people buy into
their moral crusades.
