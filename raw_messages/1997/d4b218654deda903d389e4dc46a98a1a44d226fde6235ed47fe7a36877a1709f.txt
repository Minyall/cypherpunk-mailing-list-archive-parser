I've just written a brief installation guide for PGP called
"PGPSteps". It's not meant to compete with any of the FAQ's but
rather intended to be a short and easy reference for DOS/Windows
users, who want to install PGP.

If you are interested in a copy, please reply privately...
Comments are very welcome as well.

Ciao

If encryption is outlawed, only outlaws will have encryption...
