STATE DEPARTMENT TRAVEL INFORMATION - Togo
============================================================
Togo - Consular Information Sheet
 June 20, 1997

Country Description:   Togo is a small west African nation with a 
developing economy.  Tourism facilities are limited, especially 
outside Lome, the capital city.

Entry Requirements:   A passport and visa are required.  Proof of 
yellow fever immunization is required.  Travelers should obtain the 
latest information and details from the Embassy of the Republic of 
Togo, 2208 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20008.  The 
telephone number is (202) 234-4212.  Overseas inquiries should be 
made at the nearest Togo embassy or consulate.

Areas of Instability:  Togo has experienced periodic violence and 
strikes over the past five years. Although the situation has been 
calm since 1994, the potential exists for unsettled political 
conditions.

Medical Facilities:   Medical facilities in Togo are limited.  Some 
medicines are available through local pharmacies.  Doctors and 
hospitals often expect immediate cash payment for health care 
services. U.S. medical insurance is not always valid outside the 
United States.  The Medicare/ Medicaid program does not provide for 
payment of medical services outside the United States.  Travelers 
have found supplemental medical insurance with specific overseas and 
medical evacuation coverage to be useful.  For additional health 
information, travelers can contact the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention's international travelers hotline at (404) 332-4559.  
Internet: http://www.cdc.gov.

Information on Crime:   Pickpocketing and theft is common, 
especially along the beach and in the market areas of Lome.  There 
has been an increase in the reports of carjacking. 

Business fraud stemming from Nigerian scam operations target 
Americans and pose dangers of financial loss and physical harm.  
Persons contemplating business deals in Togo with individuals 
promoting investment in Nigeria, especially the Central Bank of 
Nigeria or the Nigerian National Petroleum Company, are strongly 
urged to check with the U.S. Department of Commerce or the U.S. 
Department of State before providing any information, making 
financial commitments, or traveling to Togo.

The loss or theft abroad of a U.S. passport should be reported 
immediately to local police and to the nearest U.S. embassy or 
consulate. The pamphlets "A Safe Trip Abroad" and "Tips for 
Travelers to Sub-Saharan Africa" provide useful information on 
protecting personal security while traveling abroad and on travel in 
the region in general.  Both are available from the Superintendent 
of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 
20402. 

Drug Penalties:   U.S. citizens are subject to the laws of the 
country in which they are traveling.  In Togo, the penalties for 
possession, use or trafficking in illegal drugs are strictly 
enforced.  Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and fines.

Road Safety/Automobile Travel:   Intercity roads are generally 
paved; however, conditions are poor and  dangerous.  Overland travel 
off the main network of roads generally requires a four-wheel drive 
vehicle. Poorly-marked armed checkpoints, often manned by 
undisciplined soldiers, exist throughout the country. Nighttime 
travel on unfamiliar roads is dangerous.  Banditry, ranging from 
extortion by security forces to armed robbery, has been reported on 
all major intercity highways, including the Lome-Cotonou coastal 
highway.

Credit Card Usage:  Not all major credit cards are accepted in 
Togo.  Travelers planning to use credit cards should be aware which 
cards are accepted before they commit to any transaction.

Embassy Location/Registration:  U.S. citizens are encouraged to 
register with the Consular Section of the U.S. Embassy at the 
intersection of Rue Polisher Caventou and Rue Vauban, Lome, 
telephone (228) 21-29-91, and to obtain updated information on 
travel and security in Togo.  The Embassy's fax is (228) 21-79-52 
and the mailing address is B.P. 852, Lome.

 No. 97-106

This replaces the Consular Information Sheet dated May 3, 1996, to 
update information on entry requirements and provide information on 
credit card usage.
