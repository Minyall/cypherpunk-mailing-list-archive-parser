Seems like it is a matter of value judgment.

To stretch your values a bit, suppose that someone steals your car
and I buy it. Suppose also that I have bodyguards so that you would 
not be able to use force to take it back.

Would you be content if you could not (if the system worked according to
your values) sue to get the car back?

This is confiscation of property, ie, something that the owner has a title
to. A stolen car is not a property (as far as i understand it).
