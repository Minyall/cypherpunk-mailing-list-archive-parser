Declan,

Is there any way you can get me a copy of the amendment? My congressman is
on that committie and I intend to raise a stink down here on this.

Copies of the transcripts from the meeting and voting recored would be
helpfull.

I understand that 1 congresscritter voted against the amendment, do you
know which one it was? I would like to make sure it wasn't Joe
Scarborough.

Thanks,
