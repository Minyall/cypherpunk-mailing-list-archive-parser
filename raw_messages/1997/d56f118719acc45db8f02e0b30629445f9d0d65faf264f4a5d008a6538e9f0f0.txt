Jim,
  You seem to be getting better drugs than I am. Got any numbers
I could call in order to re-up?
  I have to admit that your grasp of technology is superior to my own,
since you are capable of posting to the list from a parallel universe
where it is already Thursday, Feb. 27, 1997.
  Interestingly enough, one of the UCE/Spammers that is mailbombing
various lists also lives in a parallel universe where it is already 
Thursday, Feb. 27, 1997.
  Small univerese, isn't it, Jim.
