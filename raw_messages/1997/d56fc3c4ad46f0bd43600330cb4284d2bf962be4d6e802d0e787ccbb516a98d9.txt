What has Arsen "Ray" Arachelian to do with cypherpunks?

Nothing, because he doesn't know anything about cryptography.

Graham-John, when I spoke to you on the phone, you sounded like
a reasonable guy.  Right now you're behaving like a total twit.
People are probably killfiling you by the  dozen. It's just too
bad, because I know from alt.2600 that you're capable of saying
something interesting sometimes.  Please stop being an asshole.
