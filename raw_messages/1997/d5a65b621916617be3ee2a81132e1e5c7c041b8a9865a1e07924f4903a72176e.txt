There's a Linux beta on www.pgpi.com which you may or may not
consider to be "really old", and I think I heard there's now
a Linux version on www.pgp.com or mit.edu.
However, it's likely that it will still break command-line
versions that think they know too much about the 2.6.2 output format,
unless the PGP porting folks did a spectacular and annoyingly hard job.
				Thanks!
