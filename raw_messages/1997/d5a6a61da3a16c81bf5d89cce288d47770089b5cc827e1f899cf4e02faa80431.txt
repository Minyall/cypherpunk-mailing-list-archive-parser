Without taking a position on the rest of the following post, I should say
that it's the conservative thinktanks and grassroots groups that are
leading the opposition to all administration proposals and are taking a
crypto-absolutist stance.

Sure, libertarian groups are just as good or better, but there are fewer
of them. (Cato -still- hasn't come out with their crypto policy analysis
even after they've been working on it for half a year. At least their
privacy paper should be coming out soon. And CEI doesn't have the staff to
devote someone to this issue.) They've done a few conferences and such,
but they're limited by numbers.
