	They spent 18 months searching and they only found a combined total
917,410 instances of the above?  That's hilarious!  It's times like these
that remind me that parents really do need to watch out for what their kids
do on the net.  Of course far more than 917,410 people are killed every 18
months in car accidents, so the net shouldn't be at the top of the list of
scary things a parent has to deal with by a long shot.  Good advice: Never
let your children use search engines.  _I_ can rarely find what I want
using them.
