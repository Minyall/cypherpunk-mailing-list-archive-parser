	While I agree with some of your points, I would think that a clear line can
be drawn between Religions as expressed in organized churches, and religously 
oriented political organizations. Raplh Reed & Crew have distinctly different 
characteristics than does Da Pope. 

	I don't believe that the churches religious activities should be taxed or
regualted, however their commercial enterprises should be taxed like every other 
corporation.
