Speaking as a parent, the best defense is to be able to discuss the
information your children receive with them.  Your opinion will carry a lot
of weight.  If you say that nice people don't spend their time looking at
photos of naked people, well they are very likely to believe you and act on
that belief.  However, remember that children have a very sensitive
hypocrisy meter.  You better live your own beliefs.
