Arguments about National Security generally trump both;
if you can spin the discussion right, remember that
widespread strong encryption protects National Security
and helps protect YOUR KIDS' privacy from those EVILDOERS out there.

And by the way, you'd really hope the cryptographically-protected
arming circuits for nuclear weapons don't have their keys escrowed....

Sure, and that's why import laws won't stop crypto;
if you can smuggle Heavy Weapons into the US by packing them in dope,
you can smuggle in crypto floppies wrapped in darn near anything...

Some countries simplify the mechanism and pay the cops directly in dope....
