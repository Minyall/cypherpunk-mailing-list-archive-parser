I just sorted my mailbox based on name, to see what you've contributed. Of
the articles I've kept (about half of all articles, roughly), the only two
I have from you are on this topic. (It may be that you have written other
articles which I don't have, but your name does not spring to mind as being
a contributor.)

Again, if you want discussion, discuss already.

Complaining that others are not writing the articles you want to read is
never fruitful.

Probably you'll be happier doing what you said you were going to do, leaving.
