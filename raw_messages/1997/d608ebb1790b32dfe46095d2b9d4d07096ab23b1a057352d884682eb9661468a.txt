  The above is a lame forgery by some troublemaker, and only 
serves to underscore PRZ's new position, namely, that access
to privacy should be supervised by people who have shown that
they have the maturity to act responsibly, as evidenced by
their success in a corporate atmosphere.

  I am PGP signing this post so that there can be no doubt as
to its source and authenticity.
  Cypherpunks list subscribers should be more careful about
checking signatures before believing everything they read.
