If Monty would like to send a suitable 486, I'll see to it that it becomes
a remailer.  If you would like to send two 486's, I'll see to it that they
both become remailers and at least one of them has a latency under 60 secs
average.  Donated machines (stuffed with ecash, I hope) may be sent to:
