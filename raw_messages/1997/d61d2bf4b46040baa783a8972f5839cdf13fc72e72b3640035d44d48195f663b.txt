This has been widely used as a (very) local area network - you can 
find a number of Hobby-style projects in electronics magazines dating 
years back.

The transformers, which are designed for 50/60Hz, should look like 
brick walls to any carrier frequency that can cope with a meaningful 
bandwidth. This probably explains why it is local. Additionally, I 
have heard that the power companies tend to get uppity about even the 
local variant - apparently it impacts their supply monitoring.

But much cheaper and easier is using the signalling gulleys that run 
along the side of the railways - no High Tension precautions, no 
scaling pylons. This, incidently is the reason that a number of 
telecomms consortia (in europe, at least) include a railway element - 
they provide the long-haul backbone.

And that's the 'cheap & easy' mentioned above?
