That may be the wish, but it is probably not the intent, since the
government already argues that the administrative decision to classify
a ``product'' as an ``encryption product'' is not subject to
administrative review.  That was the case pretty clearly under the
ITAR, though it may not be the case under the EAR.

But in any case this language would not prevent the courts from
hearing constitutional challenges to the regulations themselves or to
their application in particular cases.  So it will not affect the
constitutional claims in Bernstein, Karn and Junger or similar  claims
brought by anyone else, even if it passes.  But it might affect some
of the administrative law issues that are still being raised in the
Karn case.
