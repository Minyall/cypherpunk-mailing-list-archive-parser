How do the US export restrictions affect investments into non-US crypto
companies? Is it legal for US private persons or companies to invest money
into companies developing strong crypto applications for example in
Europe? 

Since Sun bought the Russian Elvis+ company it seems to be Ok, just wanted
to check if there are any other opinions. Does anyone know of any other
non-US companies that have received US investments, or venture capital or
whatever?
