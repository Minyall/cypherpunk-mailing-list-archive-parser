This week, in the Pub Issue of Shift Control...

"Some pretty scary things are happening to British pubs - 
apparently in the name of pleasing women. Rat and Parrot, 
Slug and Lettuce, All Bar One, Wetherspoons - they all 
signify the general white collarisation of the pub with 
blonde wood and windows where the cheap repro mahogany 
and frosted glass should be." 
- Kate Spicer wonders what's wrong with the good ol' local.

"Some London pub crawls have their origins in history (the 
Jack the Ripper pub crawl) or literature (the Sherlock 
Holmes pub crawl), while others are just a desperate attempt 
to justify a booze-up (the Monopoly board pub crawl). But 
the greatest of all is the Circle Line pub crawl. It has no 
discernible beginning and no discernible end. All that's 
certain is that the Circle Line has 27 stations, and 
somewhere near the exit of each of these is a pub." 
- Paul Robinson takes on the ultimate pub challenge.

"Nowadays even boozing and chatting have gone hi-tech. And 
while electric toothbrushes caught on and talking cars are 
here to stay, is there really any justification for the 
virtual pub?" 
- Rebecca Fox asks if online boozers have really lost the 
pub spirit.
