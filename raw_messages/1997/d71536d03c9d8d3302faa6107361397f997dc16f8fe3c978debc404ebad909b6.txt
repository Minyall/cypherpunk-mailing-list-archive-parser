Tim's mention of cypherpunks reaction to Waco savagery at
the time prompts an offer of the NYT firebrand today on nationwide
reaction to the film, "Waco: The Rules of Engagement," which
is revealing an upsurge in anti-government questioning of the
official story, and "not just from the wacko right" says one of
the leftist filmmakers:

Audience members boo Attorney General Reno and "any other
figure of authority in the film."

For the officials' growing record of the "still smoldering story," see the
Treasury Deapartment's file on the Waco Administrative Review 
Group Investigation:

It's fair to guess that FBI has a similar cache on deer-killing dissidents
in the national interest, but it's not flaunted to wolf-freak the sheep in the 
feebs "privacy" file, unlike Treasury's baiting of "for law enforcement use 
only" -- Tim's aptly acronymed FLEUO replacing FU-CU.
