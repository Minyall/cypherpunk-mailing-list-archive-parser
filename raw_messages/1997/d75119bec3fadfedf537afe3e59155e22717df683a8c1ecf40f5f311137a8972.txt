You're both taking the wrong approach - make the originator of the message
generate the hashcash, and make sure the remailer syntax lets them paste it in
as needed.  For chained remailers, generate multiple layers of hashcash.
Maintaining whitelists is a losing game, but unnecessary here.

Mailing lists are still hard, and perhaps best handled by the user's software
(or some fancy variant like user-selectable filters at the ISP mailbox.)
It's hard to tell a real mailing list from a spammer's mailing list,
and both of them do mail explosion and send their mail to names not 
listed in the To: line, so it's hard to do a technical fix.
There are scads of attacks against any fix, like having 
disposable_user@juno.com join the mailing list for a while and them spam it.
But remailers are easy.
				Thanks!
