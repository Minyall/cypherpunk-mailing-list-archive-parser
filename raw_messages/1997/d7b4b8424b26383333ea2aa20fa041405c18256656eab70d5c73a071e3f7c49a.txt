6-16-97, NYP:

With a groundbreaking Supreme Court decision imminent on a
new law restricting children's access to indecent material on the
Internet, senior Clinton administration officials are preparing a 
policy that undercuts the administration's strong support of the 
law until now.

Administration officials, anticipating that the court will strike the 
law down as an unconstitutional abridgment of free speech, 
have been quietly fashioning a new communications policy that 
leaves most regulation of the sprawling online world to the industry 
itself.

No announcement will be made until the court rules on the 
constitutionality of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. 
And officials noted that the current draft of a working group's 
report, dated June 4, is not necessarily the last word spelling out 
the new approach. The president makes policy, they said,
and this matter will not be settled until he approves.
