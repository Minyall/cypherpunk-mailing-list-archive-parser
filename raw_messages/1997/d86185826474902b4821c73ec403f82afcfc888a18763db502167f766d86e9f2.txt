Good point execpt are we talking of suing a States' governemnt for damages
or are we talking of suing individules, who happen to be part of a State's
government, for damages? I think that it is universal that one is
precluded from suing a memeber of government for carying out the duties of
office (ie: you can't sue the Governor of Texas for passing a law you
don't like while you can sue the govenor if hits your car going down the
road).
