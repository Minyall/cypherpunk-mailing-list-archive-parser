Records are kept for (a) tax compliance, (b) as a way of further 
marketting spam that tracks usage/purchase patterns.  Presumably the 
marketting weasels require this info because of their belief that doing 
so will increase sales in the long run.

I'd predict that in such cases mom & pop candy stores and small grocery 
stores wouldn't bother with record keeping, while big huge stores with 
marketting spam budgets would.

Though all things considered some record keeping is needed for inventory 
tracking, employee pay, etc.
