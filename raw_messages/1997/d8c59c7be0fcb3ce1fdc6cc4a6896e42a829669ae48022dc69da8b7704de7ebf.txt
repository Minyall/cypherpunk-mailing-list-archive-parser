C'punks,

I am preparing to retire my old 1024 bit RSA key. It was generated 1/14/1993 
and good key hygiene suggests it is time to retire this key. What better time 
to generate a new key than now that PGP has moved away from shaky MD-5 and 
patent encumbered RSA to DSS and DH.

I would ask anyone that signed my old key to please sign my new key with 
fingerprint 4A17 A6D7 8E80 3B44 C196  F509 8971 9FA7 B663 B0FD.

The key is on the servers.

Thanks,
- --Lucky
