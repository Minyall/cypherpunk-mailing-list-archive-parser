Okay.  Let's suppose that there are 10,000 messages (more realistic for a
large remailer i think)  And I am going to spread it over five servers,
And I use a 32-bit hash function (one in four billion chance I get someone
else's message)

First I download the list of Message IDs/Hashes. (40,000 bytes)
Then I download the recipient list. (another 40,000 bytes)
I find a message for me.  Let's suppose the messages are 20K each.
I send each server a list of the messages I want (10,000 bits, which is
1,250 bytes each, so 6,250 bytes total)
Finally, I get back five 20K messages from each of the five servers.

So that's a total of 80K to download the IDs/recipients lists, 6.25K to
upload the requests, and 100K to download the message pieces, to read my
20K email.  I guess that could work.
