In reading one of the lawyer letters going back and forth between Peacefire
and SolidOak, one of them
<http://peacefire.org/archives/SOS.letters/james.tyre.2.bm.txt> describes
the "encryption" used by the filter file in CyberSitter.

You are going to get a big chuckle out of this one...

The "encryption" is XORing each byte with 0x94!

Just when I thought my contempt for Millburn could not get any worse...
