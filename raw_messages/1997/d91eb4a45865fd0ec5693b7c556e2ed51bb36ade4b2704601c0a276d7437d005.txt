You're right -- I misspoke.  I confess that I don't pay much attention
to tape technology.  I was just thinking about the robotic silos at
work -- of course, they hold a lot more than gigabytes -- individual
data files on them are frequently many gigabytes.  In this environment
(admittedly atypical, though some commercial enterprises are probably 
at least as large) it would clearly be cheaper to guard keys than it 
would be to guard the tapes.  But they guard the tapes anyway.

After all that humiliation, thank you for exactly making my point. 
You guard the keys, you don't guard the tapes.

Ah yes, remembering *all* those passphrases, and what happens if you 
forget?

You are screwed if you forget it, to.  Either eventuality can be 
disastrous, depending on the circumstances.  For many types of data 
losing access to the data is a far bigger disaster than unauthorized 
exposure.

I am quite familiar with all these issues, Ray.

The scheme is that you write the passphrase on a piece of paper, and 
put the paper in a vault.  This reduces the risk of loss of access, 
and increases the risk of exposure.  In real environments you 
evaluate both risks.  Put it in other terms:  you have $1000000000 in 
untraceable ecash sitting encrypted on your disk.  Which is worse: 
having it stolen, or losing the key that decrypts it?  The answer is, 
they are equally bad.

Indeed you can use secret sharing techniques to hide the key -- for 
$1000000000 I probably would.  For all the secrets I currently know, 
putting the key in a vault is sufficient security.
