If I read this the right way I would suppose that you are saying that a 
corporate agreement to include rating systems in all browsers would be on 
a par with mandated inclusion pushed through by the government. Not so: 
The government uses force and violence to make individuals and companies 
do it`s bidding, if the government did not enforce laws they wouldn`t be 
wrong, because there would be no act of agression. Assuming a large 
company such as M$ were to decide any company not including rating 
systems in their browsers could be fined by M$, then that would be a 
similar situation to the one currently experienced with the government.
