Speaking of misrating:

Of course, it would be relatively easy to set up a proxy server that
automatically labeled every page it encountered as "suitable for
children".  In fact, a smart 12-year old could put up such a proxy,
and provide uncensored views to all his friends.

Interesting legal complications, too.
