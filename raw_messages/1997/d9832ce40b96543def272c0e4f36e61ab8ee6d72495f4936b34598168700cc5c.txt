As a sometimes member of our braindead society, let me thank you for
reminding
me of the long-term positive implications of the Anita Hill Trials on
the
future of our Country.  In regards to the "pubic hair in my coke"
travisty
that we all experienced, let me say this:

	Sometimes things have to get worse in order to get better.

Meaning, if you walk into someone, you back up, excuse yourself, and
walk around
them.  From what I've seen, my hat is off to Judge Clarence Thomas.

Which reminds me of another Troutmanism:

     "Dave -- We used to have heroes, people who were known for being
heroic.
      Now all we have is a bunch of people famous for being famous."
