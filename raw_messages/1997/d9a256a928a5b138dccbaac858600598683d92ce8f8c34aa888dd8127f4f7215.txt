Indeed.  There seems to be a frequent misconception that security == government
intrustion.  Security provides solutions that can be voluntarily accepted or
rejected and which exist to specifically thwart attacks on a system.
Government intrustion provides solutions that benefit government agencies and
not non-LEA types.  Comparing the constant releases of security advisories and
patches to knee-jerk legislation just doesn't work.  As for the point about
"evil criminals with big guns", the libertarian/cypherpunk solution to such a
problem would be to carry a bigger gun and not prohibit the ownership of guns.
