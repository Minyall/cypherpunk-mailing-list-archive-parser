I think that Tim May (and formerly Jim Bell) serve a useful purpose--that
of the canary in the coal mine.  When Tim gets disappeared, the rest of us
should know to convert our weapons to full auto, pack up our ammo caches,
head for the wilderness, and wait for the sewage to hit the fan. ;) Of
course, you actually have a life, your mileage may vary.

We seek not your counsel, nor your arms. Crouch down and lick the hand that
