  The same could be said for Charles Manson's aims being "provably
false". The country has been going downhill since the 'Communist plot'

  I know it's midnight, the drugs are kicking in, and there are

to start a new thread, as opposed to taking the easy way out and
piling new drivel on top of old drivel.
