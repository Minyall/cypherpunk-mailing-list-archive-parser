Bullshit. The majority on increased crime from the Welfare leaches could
be handled with a $200 shotgun and a $0.50 Deer Slug.

This seems *much* cheaper then the $25-$30,000 being spent per Welfare
leach right now not to mention the billions being spent in overhead in the
varrious government agencies that manage welfare.
