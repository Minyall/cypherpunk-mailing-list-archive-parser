Nice idea Declan, but what's "lots of folks"?  Rhetorical question --
what percentage of the populace in the U.S. is even on the net?  Another
one -- of those, what percentage even know what PGP is?

On one list I'm on, people whine all too often how difficult PGP is; on
another, most probably would think PGP is a drug.  Hmmm ....

Of course education of less well-versed net users is important.  But if
we're talking the Now instead of the Future, education of those not even
on the net may be more important.

So, the last rhetorical question -- how do you convince someone who's
never used a browser (the vast majority of the voting populace, I'd
think) why crypto is important?
