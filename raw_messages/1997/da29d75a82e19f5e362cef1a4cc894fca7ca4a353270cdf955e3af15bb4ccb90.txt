As a result of the GATT treaty, patent expiration times for some US patents
changed. The international standard is 20 years from filing, while old US
law was 17 years from issue. On the day which GATT took force for the US
(June 8, 1995), all outstanding patents' expiration dates were changed to
20 years from filing or 17 years from issue, whichever is later. This
affects some cryptography patents as follows:

Here's a summary of some relevant crypto patents:

 Name             Number     Filed          Issued          Expires

Diffie-Hellman   4,200,770  Sept. 6, 1977  Apr. 29, 1980   Sept. 6, 1997
Hellman-Merkle   4,218,582  Oct. 6, 1977   Aug. 19, 1980   Oct. 6, 1997
RSA              4,405,829  Dec. 14, 1977  Sept. 20, 1983  Sept. 20, 2000
