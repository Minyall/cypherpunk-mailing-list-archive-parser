What I have heard about these suitcase nukes is that they yield about 1-2
kilotons.  I know of no technical reason for them to be thermonuclear
devices.  As such, the decay of tritium would not seem to affect them.
(They will still need a source of neutrons, which might go bad faster than
the plutonium/U235.)

I feel very little comfort.
