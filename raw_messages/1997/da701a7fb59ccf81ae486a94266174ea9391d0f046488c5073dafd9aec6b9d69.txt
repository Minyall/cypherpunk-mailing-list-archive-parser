I expect you're new on the list, having only seen your name the last few
days. Welcome to the list.

As for "on whose watch did this one get out?" question, I hope you are not
assuming or expecting that remailer operators screen messages for
politeness, or even for sedition, libel, and copyright violation?

Remailers simply remail. Some remailers have elected to have lists of
addresses they will not send to (like *.whitehouse.gov), and some limit
sizes, and a few other such things. But neither _content_ nor _title_ is a
screening criterion by any remailer I have heard of.

Get used to it.

(Oh, and please send posts to one of the "real" Cypherpunks lists, not the
temporary toad.com address.)
