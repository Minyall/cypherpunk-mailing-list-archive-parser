The quotes from the Constitution, which you apparently didn't read, clearly
indicate that the role of the Supreme Court is more than a simple appeals
court. Further, while they may refuse to hear appeals, hence confirming the
lower courts ruling with a supreme stamp of approval, there is *nothing* in
the Constitution and hence their rules that allows them to refuse to accept
cases where they are the only Constitutional jurisdiction, such as
impeachment proceedings of Congressmen relating to un-constitutional actions
that may result in their impeachment.

Once the case is submitted to the Supreme Court then Congress, not the SC,
chooses the place and time.
