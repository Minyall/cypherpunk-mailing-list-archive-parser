Hi all,

Check out,

Virus
Bill Buchanan
ISBN 0-515-12011-1
$6.50 paperback

Very interesting book about adaptive technology and one possible 'alternate'
future. May not be technicaly correct but then again, what prediction is.

On a related note (at least future tech predictions), I saw the new book put
out by Wired on this issue (don't remember the exact title) in the science
section of BookStop. It belongs in the sci-fi section. A bigger pile of
wishfull thinking with no realistic view of either technology or society
doesn't come to mind immediately. Is definately not a 'buy it'.


"For a succesful technology, reality must take precedence over public
 relations, for nature will not be fooled."
