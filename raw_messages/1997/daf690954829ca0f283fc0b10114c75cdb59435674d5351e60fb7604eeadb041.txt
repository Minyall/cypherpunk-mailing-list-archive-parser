Yes this is true just as it is ligit for me to make arp request to their
routers, lots of arp requests <EG>. There is nothing ilegal from me sending
such a request nor is their any limitation on the number of request that I
make.

As far as the "denial of service" problem that is theirs not mine. After
all they were not concerned with the problems they caused by dumping
+1,000,000/day e-mail messages on AOL's servers so why should anyone be
conserned with their network problem?

Yep and sending me spam is saying "Make more arp requests!!!!"

So?
