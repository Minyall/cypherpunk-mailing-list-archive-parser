I am pleased to announce two significant improvements to The Anonymizer
(www.Anonymizer.com).

First, we have fixed the HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR and HTTP_VIA security holes.
This was a problem for people accessing The Anonymizer though a web proxy.

Second, we have introduced accounts on the Anonymizer. The poor performance
of The Anonymizer (to put it lightly) has been due to our attempts to keep
it from completely swamping our T1. Paid accounts on The Anonymizer bypass
the slowdown mechanisms, and also provide access to anonymous news and
anonymous anonymous FTP.

Finally, while it has been true for some time, it is not widely known that
the Anonymizer is owned and operated by Infonex. We took over management of
the Anonymizer several months ago. For those not familiar with Infonex, we
have been active in the privacy business for some time. We host several
anonymous remailers, we offer anonymous shell accounts through our
subsidiary Cyberpass (www.cyberpass.net), and I personally developed the
Mixmaster anonymous remailer system.
