on monitor emissions - you can read the screen someone's looking at, and 
not just the key-clicks.  Won't get you blanked-out passwords, though.  
Much of the monitor's emissions may be out the back.

Other places to look for emissions: the power supply, and the connection 
points for peripherals.  Make sure you leave adequate ventilation, though 
(another tricky part).
