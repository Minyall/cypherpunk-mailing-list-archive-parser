The point I was making was rather different, I think the total volume
of PGP mail of all types is probably not a large enough fraction of the
trafic on the net to be secure. Taking any use of PGP as prima facie
evidence of subversive activity probably provides a reasonable cut.

If you want to take this offline I can discuss actual examples of 
countries that use this type of trafic analysis. The point is to
identify social networks. Anyone attempting to conceal their social
network is probably subversive.

Note that the type of government I'm talking about here is way beyond
the US in authoritarianism, much more like the USSR of old.

How many people in total do you have using the mixers? How many mixers
are there?

Not if the principle applied is that any use of the mixer taints the 
person concerned.

If the total usebase is bellow 10,000 then identifying which person 
received which message is probably not too necessary.
