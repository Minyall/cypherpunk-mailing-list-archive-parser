(Sometimes people have three names, sometimes two names, popularly used.
Criminality has little to do with it. For example, Richard Speck, Charles
Manson, John Walker, Aldrich Ames, Ted Kaczynski, Timothy McVeigh, Terry
Nichols.  Most of them presumably have middle names.)

Oh, and as to divining what Tim's "intention" was, this mindreading and
psychoanalysis shtick is getting old.
