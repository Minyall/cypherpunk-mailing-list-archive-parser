I thought I was on the cypherpunks edited list.  However, I appear to
have seen some of the messages that Tim says got lost.  Moreover, I
keep getting ASCII art messages flaming someone with the initials DLV
(though I haven't seen any more of the TCM flames [I haven't looked
too hard, either]).  My mail headers have:

>From cypherpunks-errors@toad.com  <date>
>Sender: owner-cypherpunks@toad.com

Now I'm really confused.  Which list am I on?
