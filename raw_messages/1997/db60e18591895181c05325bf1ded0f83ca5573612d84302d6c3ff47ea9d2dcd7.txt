I think that is redundant -- if only the user can decrypt to get the
actual plaintext -- you'd just as well send encrypted to the user
alone.

Super encrypting with a non-CMRed company key is perhaps what you are
thinking, and then encrypting internally to user and CMR key.

This would be a definate improvement over straight forward CMR because
it is effectively a poor-mans Transport Level Security (TLS), and
therefore denies access to the ciphertext (and attached CMR recovery
info) to governments and other intruders.

Still I think better yet not to send recovery information over the
wire at all, unless there is a user requirement for message screening.

The stated corporate user requirement for CMR by PGP Inc is recovery
of stored files.
