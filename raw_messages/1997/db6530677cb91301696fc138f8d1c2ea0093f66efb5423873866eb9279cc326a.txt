It looks like we're seeing different parts of the problem. You're 
worried about the long-haul backbone. I'm trying to see ways to
get a 10Gbps fibre into my living room.

The backbone cost is a tiny fraction of the cost of getting fiber
into every house in the country.

Building a few optical fibers into a cable as it is being 
manufactured is cheap and easy, as is using fiber-equipped
cable if you are installing new lines, or replacing old ones
for other reasons (installation costs are usually far higher 
than the cost of the line itself). It's hooking up all the 
fibers into a meaningful network that gets expensive, 
which was my point.
