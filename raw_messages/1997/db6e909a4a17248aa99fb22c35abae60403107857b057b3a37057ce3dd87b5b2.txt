The paper today said something about a rash of "Poetic Terrorism"
going on in New Orleans.  Boxes of random poetry manifestoes showing
up around town, stuff tacked to billboards, toasters and other unexplained
objects in artistically arranged spaces, demands for official poetry-readings
by the police department.  A couple of suspects. 

Somebody's been reading Hakim Bey again....
