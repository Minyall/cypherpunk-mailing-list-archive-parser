Yes, Hallam-Baker seems unable to handle a killfile.

I think the "John Gilmore is a cocksucker", along with the 
OBModeratorFodder material played a strong part in bringing about an 
uncensored list, it is often necessary to bring the censorous 
motherfuckers out into the open, there is no better way to do this than 
posting rants they do not like, for a good example of this technique see 
Dr. Grubor.
I should also note than not all Dimitri posts is one-line rants, not now 
anyway ;-)...
