Therefore you're a censorous cocksucker and an asshole.  Fuck you.

C, P, & G. Lewis reside at:
483 Vances Side Road (Box 124),
Dunrobin (a suburb of Ottawa),
Ontario K0A 1T0, Canada,
home tel: +1 613 832 0541, office tel: +1 613 763 2935

I hope some homicidal maniac makes use of this information.

Chris Lewis uses the resources of his employer, Northern Telecom / Bell North
Research, to forge his cancels. Complaints about Chris Lewis should be sent
directly to Human Resources. That way they go directly into his personnel file
for safekeeping and remain unadulterated by his chain of command. Nortel does
not have a security officer in personnel (incredible as it seems, it's true),
so use the director as follows:

Jim Young, Director, Human Resources
Tel: +1 905 863 4636
