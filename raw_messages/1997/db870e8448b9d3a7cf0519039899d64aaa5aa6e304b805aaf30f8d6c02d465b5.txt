Thats fine but, i dont want to be invited to look at nasty naked 
cheerleaders. And isn't it somewhat problematic when a 15 yr old looks at 
the mail box ?? BEsides i hate junk mail too, and if i could stick a no 
junk mail sticker on my email i would.

Can this be done ?? Any ideas anybody ??
