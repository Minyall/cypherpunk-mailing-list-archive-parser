I would go for a HK 93 or G3 model myself w/ Zeiss 3x9 scope w/ some sort of
laser designator for long range (> 200 yds.). Chambered in .308 and will give
about a 4 to 6-in. group at 600 yds. from what I have seen - very handy for
shooting throug 4 in. brick walls as well. Very accurate (a very popular
sniper weapon) and more than forgiving with the environment. It's little
brother the MP-5 pretty much owns the SWAT and similar sorts of jobs.

A Desert Eagle chambered in .357 (you just *think* those .223 go through
vests) would be my close in choice.

Course you ain't gonna touch the HK for less than a few $k and the Desert
Eagles are over $1k.

Don't worry about it - go with a HK and you can fill the chamber with gunk
and the next cycle of the blowback bolt system will clear it. Excellent all
weather weapon. It'll even fire if un-oiled - not something you should do
with a M16/AR15.
