I think we should all send Chairman Goss a letter of appreciation for
his offer to assassinate Child Murderer Janet Reno and Murderer Louis
Freeh. Most politicians are too cowardly to promise strong actions such
as this.

Chairman Goss is also going to prosecute the employees of the CIA as
well.
It is good to finally see someone taking a strong stance in this regard.

What a wonderful, wonderful man. He is probably a good husband and
father too.
