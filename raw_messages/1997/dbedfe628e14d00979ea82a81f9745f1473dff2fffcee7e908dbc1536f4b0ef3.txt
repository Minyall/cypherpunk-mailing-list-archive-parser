Well, Raph Levien applied for an export permit for the RSA-in-4-lines-of-PERL
shirt several years ago, and the export thugs stalled on it and never
responded positively or negatively, in spite of their publicly stated
policies that they "will" respond in some small number of days.

Since then, they've changed the laws, and the PERL RSA has gotten shorter...

Of course, it's not a violation for Adam - he's not an American :-)
