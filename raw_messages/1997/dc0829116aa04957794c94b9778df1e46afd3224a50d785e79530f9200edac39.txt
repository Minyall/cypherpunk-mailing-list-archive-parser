Sure...that's where the whole privacy debate comes in. Basic point 
is, if I take steps to hide that information from them, they can't 
shoot me. No company, to my knowledge, is claiming a *right* to know 
things about me -- they may demand to know things about me as their 
half of a contract, but I'm free to refuse, or falsify. And I often 
do.

I wonder if the government could 'sell' GAK to liberals, at least the 
dumber ones (not anyone on this list), by saying, "And we'll use it 
to make sure that information collected about you on the web isn't 
used improperly!" (I mean, if businesses encrypt their internal 
communications unbreakably, things like civil rights suits and the 
Pinto 'smoking gun' will be harder to prove as well. )
