Yeah, and he's applied a patent on the idea of /dev/null. Since it 
produces zeros, he plans to sue every unix var on the planet for patent 
infringement right after he gets the patent.  (Little does he know about 
EOF - but soon as he gets a clue, he'll sue on the concept of EOF as 
well.)

He's working on a beta of a program that produces 1's.  That's  secret 
project he's working on next. :)

We really should be careful with ROT13 though... He might get some ideas 
there too...
