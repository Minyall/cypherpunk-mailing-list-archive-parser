No, the Internet interprets cocksucker John Gilmore as censorship, shits on

ObCrypto: I was offered a 76GB changer for $350.  I thought of the following
demo application: a user e-mails a piece of a Unix passwd file (password+salt)
to a server, which looks up a password that works.  Problem is, 76GB doesn't
seem sufficient for the lookup table. :-( (Assume infinite time available
on a fast box.)
