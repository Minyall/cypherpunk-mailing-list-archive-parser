RSA, PGP IN LEGAL FLAP OVER ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGY
RSA Data Security has filed a lawsuit against Pretty Good Privacy (PGP),
alleging that PGP failed to comply with the terms of a licensing agreement
that RSA had signed with Lemcom, the company with which PGP merged last
year.  RSA says Lemcom had "no ability to transfer rights to the source code
for the Licensed Product to an OEM Customer or anyone else."  When informed
that its license agreement to RSA technology was canceled, "PGP demanded we
sue them in order to exercise audit rights clearly laid out in the
agreement," says RSA President Jim Bidzos.  "Their behavior makes us wonder
what they have to hide."  Meanwhile, PGP says the products it's developing
don't rely on the RSA encryption scheme.  "Those new products will be
encryption-algorithm independent," says PGP VP Robert Kohn, which will
"break RSA monopoly on this technology."  (InfoWorld Electric 9 May 97)
