Yes.

All versions of PGP5 supports RSA for encryption/decryption.

PGP50freeware from MIT can not generate RSA keys, but the scanned version
PGP50i
<ftp://ftp.ifi.uio.no/pub/pgp/5.0/international/unix/pgp50i-unix-src-b8.tar.
gz> can generate both RSA and DSS/DH keys.

If you have PGP50freeware, you can still import RSA keys (from 50i or 2.6)
and use them, you just can't generate the keys.
