It would have a profound effect on government as a high percentage of
government workers are Mormons.  (Especially amongst agencies like the
IRS.)  There are some interesting reasons as to why this is the case.  It
has to do with the great efforts the Mormon church has gone to to be
accepted by the "authorities".
