The second snapshot for mac68k is available at the usual locations. This 
time the newest installation tools are included. The errata of the first 
snapshot have been fixed. Please report all errors, problems, failure, 
and (of course:) success to Theo de Raadt or at least to the appropriate 
mailing list.

Thanks to Allen, Rodney and Thomas for the last-minute-help!
