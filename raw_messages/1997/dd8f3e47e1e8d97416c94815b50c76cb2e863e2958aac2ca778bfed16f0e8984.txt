Does anyone have any idea how extensive the legal entaglements might
be for a US Citizen to accept work overseas developing crypto software
for a foreign company?

Someone at a company in Australia is interested in hiring some
crypto-clued folks, and has asked me if it's even worth pursuing
any US citizens.
