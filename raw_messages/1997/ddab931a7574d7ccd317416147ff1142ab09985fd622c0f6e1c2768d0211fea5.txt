I rest my case. That's *bias* and essentially *bribery*, folks, and its
responsible for a good portion of the corruption of the media. and what's
more amusing, not a single reporter involved in it has any pangs of doubt.
DM is downright proud that he's so clever that he's figured out this
ingenious inbred system of you-scratch-my-back!! congratulations on your
ingenuity, DM!! you will truly go a long way with your clearly highly
negotiable and hockable ethical standards...! I see you must be eyeing the
NYT or the Washington Post, eh? 

(DM, imagine the manipulation that you are describing getting *worse*
as you rise to the top, with your scent of it only a small whiff in
comparison, and you begin to understand the corruption that infects
the reality that surrounds us..)
