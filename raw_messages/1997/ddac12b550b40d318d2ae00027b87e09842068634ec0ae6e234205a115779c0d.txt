Circ uses 3DES for encryption and does key exchange with RSA. 
It runs on top of irc, and encrypts/decrypts by running a program
in the backgound. There is also a standalone client.

I'm not sure that authentication is wanted or needed for irc. 
There have been a lot of problems with people grabbing a list 
of everyone on irc at a given time, then e-mailing them spam 
or vague threats. ircd 2.9.2 implements the +a mode for channels
which somehow disallows listing user information even if you are
on the channel with them.
