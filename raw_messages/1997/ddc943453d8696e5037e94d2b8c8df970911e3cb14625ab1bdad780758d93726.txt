Tim,
The system above you are proposing is [C,G]AK, plain and simple. This is
what some companies are doing already. And it is a Bad Thing.

[Sidetrack: which is of course why PGP had to find another solution to
present to those customers already using GAK. IMHO, and I can't help but
be a bit surprised that I find myself in the minority on this
issue, at least as far as the list is concerned. What PGP did was
_elegant_.]
