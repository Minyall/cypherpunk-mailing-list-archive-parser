My copy of PGP 5.0 seems to be completely compatible with 2.6 versions.  This 
message is signed, and my key is included within the message for those of you 
who have software that discards the non signed portion.  (If you don't know 
how to extract my key, copy it and fix the broken dashed line, or use a 
keyserver)

This is a store bought copy of Eudora 3.0.1 upgraded to 3.0.3 with PGP 5.0, 
and the $5 RSA add in from PGP.  If anyone who knows how to properly use PGP 
has a problem reading my signature, or my key, please let me know.
