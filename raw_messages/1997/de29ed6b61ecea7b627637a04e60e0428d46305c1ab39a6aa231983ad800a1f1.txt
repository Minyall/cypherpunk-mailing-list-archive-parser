    well, that's good so far. of course, you are ornery enough to stick up
    for your rights --what few we have that have not been fucked over
    totally by Bubba who sees no reason for privacy since only crooks have
    reason not to be transparent.

    aint much that is important enough to put up with those attitudes.
    we are what we are --start bending over to polish the apple and you'll

    Stanford was in Palo Alto the last time I looked... is the "City of

    yup. either look like the average joe couch potato or expect to be 
    profiled out for special treatment.  anyone with the fire still
    burning in their eyes is obviously some sort of maniac with a 
    problem.  "yes, officer, I just happen to normally carry a gallon
    of naplam in my briefcase... it's my lunch down at the circus."

    maybe Chelsea has them all nervous.
