I also applaud what my local Congresscritterwoman says, and especially her
quotation of the Dan Gillmor column from the local Silicon Valley
newspaper. I saw this colum several days ago and was impressed, especially
by the quote I include below.

This is the point I make to people who ask about the "bad" things crypto
will make possible. I say "Of course it will."

Then I go on to cite the same "bad" things that curtains on windows make
possible, that locks on doors make possible, that private hotel rooms make
possible, that whispers make possible, and that privacy in general makes
possible.
