Filling in the cross-references between 5D002 and 5A002 in the above URL,
I read the following: 
a.  Software having the same characteristics, or performing or simulating
the functions of of equipment designed or modified to use "cryptography"
employing digital or analog techniques to ensure "information security" is
controlled.  
b.  Software designed or modified to use such software is controlled.

This is the clearest control of software "hooks" I have read in the reg.  
The software module performing encryption would fall under control due to 
(a) and the software designed with "hooks" for the encryption module would 
fall under control due to the restriction in (b).

FWIW
