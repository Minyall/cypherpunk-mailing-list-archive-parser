I was surprised not to see Netscape or Microsoft on the list.

Anybody know the URL of a web site that publishes and regularly updates
this list?

Below is a list of the members of the "Key Recovery Alliance" who are
working hard to make the world safe for GAK. I intend to boycott them,

just
about anybody in the computer industy. It is sickening.
