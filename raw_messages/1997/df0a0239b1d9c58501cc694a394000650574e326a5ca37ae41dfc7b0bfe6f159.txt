I can sympathize with the demonstrators that the Humboldt Sheriff's
Department sprayed with pepper spray during their sit-in/protest.
The police have done the same thing to me during the closing scenes
of my performance art, as I climb out of the performance victim's
window and try to make a run for it.
I have found that judges are seldom impressed with a plea of, "Everyone
wants to be a critic!"
