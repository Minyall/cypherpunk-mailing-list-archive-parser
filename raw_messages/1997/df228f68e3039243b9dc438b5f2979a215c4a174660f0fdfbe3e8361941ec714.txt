The last I heard, approximately 1500 illegal aliens had been found to
have voted in that election (Dornan lost by about 940 votes) but
Democrats in the House were stonewalling taking any action to
Reinstate Dornan.  The INS was also refusing to cooperate in the
effort to determine if suspect voters were actually citizens or not.
