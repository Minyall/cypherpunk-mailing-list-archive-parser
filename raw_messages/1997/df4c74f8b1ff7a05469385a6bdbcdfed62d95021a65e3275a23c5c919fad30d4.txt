I spoke this morning with cryptographer William H. Payne in NM 
(505-292-7037), who confirmed that the NSA suit is authentic. 

He spoke freely about it and said he was pleased that it was 
being publicized. There's more to tell, he says, and is
doing so through several pipelines.

Says NSA is crimping him financially in retribution, so he may
go offshore to make a living fighting their shitty crypto shenanigans.
