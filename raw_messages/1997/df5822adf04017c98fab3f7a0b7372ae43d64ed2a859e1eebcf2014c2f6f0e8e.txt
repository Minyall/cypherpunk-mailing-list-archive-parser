considering developing software for in voice communications.

This software will be used to remind patients of their upcoming
appointments, allow them to confirm or reschedule. After confirming
which patients will not be able to make their appointment the system will
contact all individuals that are on a waiting list to schedule them for open 
time slots.....

For assisting us we will mail you a FREE certificate for 100 rolls of Kodak film 
and a 35 mm camera. NO ONE WIll CALL YOU!

for them using a personalized Voice system reminding them of 
their appointments?
