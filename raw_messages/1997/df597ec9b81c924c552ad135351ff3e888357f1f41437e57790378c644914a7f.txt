    anyone have any doubt about my "Call to arms against F[reeh,uck]"?

    read what Declan said; the Congresscritters are just regrouping. 

    the man must be stopped: Freeh Fuck wants to make J. Edgar Hoover
    look like a saint, garter belt and all. Hoover looked like the     
    slimeball he was; F[reeh,uck] looks like the Hollywood stereotype of 
    the valiant and honest defender of the American way.

    just wait for the hammer to fall in some rider to a spending bill;
    American legislative morality is pure snake shit amorality.
