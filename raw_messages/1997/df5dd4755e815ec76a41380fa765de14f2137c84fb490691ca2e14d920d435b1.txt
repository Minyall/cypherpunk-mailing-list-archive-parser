Heh - it's already that way in some places if you try to
buy a car with cash :-)

After the results of the 1990 Census were in, New Jersey was re-gerrymandering
their Congressional District boundaries.  Aside from the usual goals
(making sure the Republicans, who were then in power, had solid districts),
there were the usual concerns about racial balance, so they wanted to
create a district in the east-central side of the state that was mostly 
minority (largely Hispanic, in this case).  The first cut didn't have
enough minorities, so they moved the boundary to include Rahway Prison.
The legal system being what it is, the residents are largely minority .....
and most of them can't vote :-)
