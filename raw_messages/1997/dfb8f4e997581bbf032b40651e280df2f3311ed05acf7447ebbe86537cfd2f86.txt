  Whenever I see the dying embers of the spam debate being blown
to life (along with similar non-issues), I wonder what the disinfo
artists are trying to distract me from.
  I don't have to wonder too hard, however, since I can always 
count on the usual suspects to step forward and pooh-paah whatever
they don't want anyone to look at too closely.
