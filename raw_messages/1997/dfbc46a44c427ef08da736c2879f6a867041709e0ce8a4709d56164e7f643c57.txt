Note another characteristic of cult thinking -- total separation of
the illuminati from the "herd" -- the idea that the "chosen" are
irrevocably different from those other unfortunate creatures that
accidentally share the same physical form. 

It is also worth noting that frequently cult members are very
intelligent, very capable people -- high intelligence is absolutely no
defense against insanity.
