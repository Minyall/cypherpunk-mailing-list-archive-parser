Somehow I find it unlikely that this is authentic.  Last I heard, Jim Bell
was being held without charges for some incredibly long period of time --
like a month or so. 

Seems that any lawyer worth his salt could get any conceivable charges
dropped on that count alone.  Admitting to a felony in this case seems
unlikely, but then you never know.
