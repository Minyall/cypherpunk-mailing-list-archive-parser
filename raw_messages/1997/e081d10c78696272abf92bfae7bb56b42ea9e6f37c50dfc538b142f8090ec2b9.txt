I am sorry.  Somebody who should know better cross-posts incendiary
messages to both fight-censorship and cypherpunks.

I just can't stand reading obviously idiotic messages without
responding.  I will try to refrain.

By the way, I am not subscribed to cypherpunks, soif you have something
to say, CC me.
