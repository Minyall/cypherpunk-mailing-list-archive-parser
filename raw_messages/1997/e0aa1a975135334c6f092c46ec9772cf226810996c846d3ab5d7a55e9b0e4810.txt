Where did you get the information that: "permit from the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs is required for export and for transit through Estonia." ? 
I find it pretty hard to believe, because our company as probably the
leading security software reseller has imported and exported every kind of
crypto software to and from Estonia and done transit through Estonia. Or
could someone point me to the source of the sentence in your crypto law
survey?
