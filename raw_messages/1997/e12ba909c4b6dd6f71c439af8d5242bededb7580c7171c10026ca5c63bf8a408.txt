CTP is an acronym for Composite Theoretical Performance, 
a definition of computer capability used in the Export 
Administration Regulations. See EAR Section 740.7 
Computers (CTP) at:

The US Department of Defense, Office of the Under Secretary 
of Defense for Acquisition and Technology, is the author of 
the Militarily Critical Technologies List (MCTL). See

This should not be contrued to mean that I'm not also ignorant
of what I quote and quack about weird lists of holy-shit technology.
