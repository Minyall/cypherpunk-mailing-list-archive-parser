True, however the number of questions asked by El Al decreases amazingly
when you answer in Hebrew, however that did not stop me being addressed by
five security personnel after a trip where had been doing a photo
documentary and was still wearing a photo vest full of black metal
cannisters (lenses). Of course when the security head finally approached me
I used Hebrew and that was then end of the episode. Unfortunately speaking
English is not a very good determination of airline safety.
