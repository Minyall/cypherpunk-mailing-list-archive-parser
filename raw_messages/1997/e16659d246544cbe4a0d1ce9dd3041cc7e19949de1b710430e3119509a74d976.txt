  I definitely would not want an emergency PIN to fail to dispense
cash,
unless it dispensed some 00 buckshot. Now that's a thought. Enter the
PIN
number backwards and you get a shotgun blast to the chest.

  A Good Idea(tm) would be to have a reversed PIN number red flag the
ATM and
alert the police (as well as forward the videotape to the proper
authorities).

  A gun would have been a good idea for Levin to own, but probably
would not
have helped him since it was a student that he knew and trusted. He
probably
didn't feel threatened until it was too late for him.

  Also, if the card was one of the Visa Debit cards (or even a real
visa card
for that matter) there are tons of places that it can be used without
entering
a PIN number or submitting to an ID check. Grocery stores and gas
stations are
two examples, although you cannot get cash from anywhere without using
the PIN
number (that I know of).

ps. PGP 5.0 seems to have mangled my line ends in the process of
signing this message. Anyone know a cure for this?
