Translation: We can't figure out how to tax these pricks so we'll just 
ban it because it represents a perceived threat to our own rigged and 
heavily taxed government sponsored tax collection casino cells.

Backed by NAAG! Well if that isn't a ringing endorsement I don't know 
what is.

The article quoted starts off with how concerned the gubmint is about the 
possibility of consumer fraud wrt on-line casinos and shows how they 
propose to protect the consumer: 12 months in prison AND a $5000 fine. 
Consumer fraudsters should take note, they have a competitor in the ring!
