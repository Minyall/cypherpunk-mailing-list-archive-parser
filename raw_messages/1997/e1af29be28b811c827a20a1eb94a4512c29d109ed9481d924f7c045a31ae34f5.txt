  Hey, pal. If you're going to attack Tim May on this list, you'd better
be ready to back it up with some ASCII Art graphics.

  I tried to tell my fellow CypherPunks that it was a mistake to 
include that racist, white supremacist cypherpunks-j list in with 
the other CDR lists, but they still let those slant-eyed white
supremacists join our Mary band, skirts and all.

  As opposed to promoting the wearing of "Shoot Me First!" T-shirts
to bed, in support of no-knock, black-clad government Ninja's?

  You must have had your hands over your ears if you missed the
cheering, whistling, hooting and cat-calls by _some_ of the
list subscribers over the OKC wake-up call issued by some unknown
person, in response to the government slaughter of men, women and
children at Waco.

> Its original purpose all but forgotten, 

  I believe that the original purpose of the list was to piss off
people such as yourself. I imagine that individual list subscribers
all have their own concept of what the "original purpose" of the
list was, even if they only subscribed yesterday, like yourself.

  Sure, change the subject and attack _me_, now! (Did I forget to
announce the results of the vote taken last night at the Coal Dust
Saloon in Bienfait, Saskatchewan?)
