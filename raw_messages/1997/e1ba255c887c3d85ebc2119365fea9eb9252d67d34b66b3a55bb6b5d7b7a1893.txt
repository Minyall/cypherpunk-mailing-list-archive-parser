MONEYCLIP DOES ONLINE BANKING

A group of companies has developed a device that turns
almost any PC into an automatic teller machine.  The
MoneyClip, which is a diskette that incorporates a
smart card and access software, enables users "to
perform virtually any ATM transaction from the comfort
of their homes," says the CEO of the Home Financial
Network, one of the four developers.

In order to use the MoneyClip, a PC has to already be
loaded with online banking software and the owner has
to have an account at a bank that offers online
banking.
