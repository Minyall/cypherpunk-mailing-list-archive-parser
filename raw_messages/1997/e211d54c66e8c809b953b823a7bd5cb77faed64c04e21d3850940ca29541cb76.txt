Jim,

Any idea on what they define to be a "legitimate" research project? I'd
hate to travel 3000 miles to research the Holocaust Lie, only to be told
that my research on how the Holocaust Lie was sold to support FDR and
Truman is an _illegitimate_  research project.

arrest upon my arrival at any EEC port of entry.)
