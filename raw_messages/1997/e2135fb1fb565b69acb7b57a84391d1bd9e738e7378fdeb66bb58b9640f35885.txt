  How about if you are selling something on your web site and giving
pointers to information/advertisements located on a foreign website?
  Let me guess...hhmmm...disabled grandmothers who are selling their
home-grown chamoemille tea will have their homes confiscated, and
corporations with expensive lawyers will be approved for an exemption
on some flimsy grounds.

  Anybody know of any Mexican laws I can break by putting something
illegal there, but legal in Canada, on my web site?
  Any CypherSpics who would like to put up a "Canadian Hate" page
that I could link to?
