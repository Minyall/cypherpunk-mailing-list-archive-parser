My local cable killing Mars rover deployment in favor of local dog tag
ordinances (as required by the city), made me realize it that getting my
own dish is way overdue.

I would appreciate reports on any first hand experiences subscribers to
this list have with satellite services. Yes, NASA TV and the SF channel is
a must. :-)

Thanks,
