PJ sent me his web site which others may be interested in,
with pointers to Karn and Bernstein:

http://samsara.law.cwru.edu/comp_law/crypto_export/

so, essentially, there are now 3 pretty significant cases
challenging ITAR on constitutional grounds, which I find
highly encouraging. of course the Bernstein case has already
had very positive results so far.
