Are you referring to the receiver anonymous protocol?

This is how I understand that protocol,

Alice wants to receive e$1 from Bob. She creates a random number, blinds
it, and gives the blinded number to Bob. He shows the number to the
Mint, asking for a withdrawal of e$1 with a signature on this coin
number. Bob gives the signed and still blinded coin to Alice. She
unblinds it and spends it, end of story.

I thought that in this scenario, Bob can spend the coin before he gives
it to Alice, so she runs the risk of receiving a coin that has already
been spent. Is it impossible to spend a blinded coin if you can't
unblind it? Or are you thinking of something totally different?
