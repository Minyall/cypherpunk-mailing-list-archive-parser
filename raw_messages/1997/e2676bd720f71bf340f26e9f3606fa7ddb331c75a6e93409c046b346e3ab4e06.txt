There is nothing much new in that law.  Internet service providers
have always been subject to the general Privacy Law.  Also have a look
at the EU privacy directive, which is similar in spirit:

You'll probably not be very surprised to learn that e.g. many credit
card companies operate from Denmark or the Netherlands, and that even
the state-owned railway company has orders for their customer cards
processed in the US and the cards mailed from Holland.
