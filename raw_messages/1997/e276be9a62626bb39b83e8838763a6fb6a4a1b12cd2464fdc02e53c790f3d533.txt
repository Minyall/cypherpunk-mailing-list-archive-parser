Perhaps with proper moderation, having access to a cloistered
environment without all of the 'noise', cypherpunks will be able
to come up with a true polymorphic virus that will make the Atom
Bomb look like a child's toy.
  The rabble who rant on endlessly about 'social issues' can 
surely not be trusted to contribute anything of value on what
are, in fact, merely a question of 'numbers'.
  It is up the the elite, the code writers, to lead the cypher-
punks into a New World Order, in which the results of cryptography
are only used for proper, approved purposes.
