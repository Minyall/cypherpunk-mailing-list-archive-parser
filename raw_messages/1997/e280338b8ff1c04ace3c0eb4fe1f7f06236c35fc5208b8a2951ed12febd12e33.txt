Don't be too sure that crypto is that far beneath the radar. I spent
Thursday through Saturday at an annual privacy conference for activists
from around the country, and they understood the principles. Their
voicemails were filling up with calls from reporters last Friday about the
Gingrich incident, and I know they were talking crypto.

The only other journalist who was there made an interesting point, that
encrypting cell phone traffic only up to the point it hits the phone
system wouldn't hinder L.E. access but would protect privacy. (Or,
perhaps, would be worse in the long term since we wouldn't have such
luscious examples.)
