What do you think about celebrating the expiration of the Diffie-Hellman
patent by getting all the PGP users in the world to switch to DSS/DH keys

It would take a massive education effort, but imagine the effect... we
could even celebrate it annually, since there'd inevitably be significant
lagging.
