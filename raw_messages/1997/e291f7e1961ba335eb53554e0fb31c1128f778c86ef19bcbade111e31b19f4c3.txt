   A "big government fetishist" is cute, but it seems fairly
non-specific.  Are moral majority types leftists?  Are the supporters of
the Department of Commerce leftists?  Are supporters of a bloated
defense department leftists?  Can't get enough of that CIA funding
leftists?  IMF supporters are leftists?  FED lovers are leftists? 
Groups that lobby for higher crop supports are leftists?  S&L bail out
supporters are leftists?  Supporters of GATT are leftists?  Are
supporters of more NIH funding leftists?  (how about the PhRMA support
for this?)  Supporters of aggressive new government programs to define
(and enforce) new Intellectual Property rights are leftists?

    I think the term "leftists" must mean something more than "a big
government fetishist."  Frankly, I know of few persons who are
consistently advocates of big government, but I know lots of groups,
many certainly not leftists, who have their favorite government
programs.

   Maybe, however, you think all these folks are leftists?  

   Jamie
