I_Love_SPAM,



I saw your posting online and was wondering if you market products/services using your computer and would like to learn how to do so QUITE a bit better than what you are already doing?

I use to use Floodgate, and I have come accross something that has really put this to shame!  If you would like to see the information, just reply back at UBS95@IX.NETCOM.COM with the message:  "No Flame" and I will send you the file that could mean the difference between success and failure in the online marketing world.

Please do not hit reply......Just send your inquires to:  ubs95@ix.netcom.com and include a note: "No Flame".  Thank you!

Sincerely,
Carol Miller
