[C program which allegedly does a DoS attack on a server]

I thought the correct way to do this was to spew packets with random
return addresses and fill up the host's listen table with half open TCP
connections waiting to time out. 

Opening 1,000 genuine TCP connections to a host wastes both the host's
resources as well as yours, and is a tad obvious should your target
log packets with your IP address in them.
