  I knew that! I must have eaten too many of the yellow ones tonight
to keep track of my Crayola lines. I'd better eat a couple more of the
red ones to get myself back on track.

  Oh, I see my mistake! I had Caesar, wearing a 'Toga', connected to
the anti-Christ with a red Crayola line, and mistook it for 'Tonga'.
  No problem, I'll just eat a couple of the brown Crayola's and throw
three Hail Flutie's.
