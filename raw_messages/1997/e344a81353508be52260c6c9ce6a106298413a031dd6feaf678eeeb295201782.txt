Well there are some distinct differences between a Utility
(Electric,Water,Gas) and that of Ineternet bandwith.

With a public utility the greatest expence is not in providing the pipe
(bandwith) but in generating the resources (electric,water,gas). The
oppisite of this is true with the internet. The monthy telco charges for
prividing the bandwith is much more than the cost's of providing the
resources (data).

I think a closer analogy to the Internet is that of a highway system
(Information Highway, who knew? <g>). You have the upfront expence of
building the highway (bandwith) and then the expences of up-keep &
maintinance (telco charges - profit).

Now we have two camps for how this should be paid for. Should the users
pay upfront for a certian amuont of usage (This is basicaly how it is
today) or should users pay a metered rate simmilar to a toll-road.

I myself prefer to pay a flat rate and make use of my time & bandwith as I
see fit than to pay on a metered rate. I remember years back with
Compu$erve paying a metered rate and getting +$100 mo. bills from them.
