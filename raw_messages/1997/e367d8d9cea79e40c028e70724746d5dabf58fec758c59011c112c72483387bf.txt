I guess we will have to see how the "experiment" goes.  The original list did
say that one of the non-moderated lists would be discontinued.  Anyone who
wants to receive the full list but be able to sort according to moderator's
approval will have a difficult time doing this without subscribing to more
than one list.  If one of the two non-moderated lists gets dropped, the only
way to do this would be to subscribe to two lists receiving duplicate messages.

Bandwidth is a problem.  This list distributes about 50 2K messages to 1500
subscribers per day (this is just an estimation, but I don't think it's too
far from reality).  This amounts to 150Mb per day.  I'm sure compute cycles
aren't too much of a problem.  Anyway, I'm just basing most of this on the
original announcement.  I don't know to what extent this will effect toad.
