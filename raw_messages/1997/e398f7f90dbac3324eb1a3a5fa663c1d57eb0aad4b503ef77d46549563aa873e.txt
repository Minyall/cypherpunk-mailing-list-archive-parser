SAN FRANCISCO (May 22, 1997 9:13 p.m. EDT) -- A clever hacker slipped into
a major Internet provider and gathered 100,000 credit card numbers along
with enough information to use them, the FBI said Thursday.

Carlos Felipe Salgado, Jr., 36, who used the online name "Smak," allegedly
inserted a program that gathered the credit information from a dozen
companies selling products over the Internet, said FBI spokesman George
Grotz.
----
Said hacker used a sniffer to gather the numbers, and as part of the
process, he encrypted the database he sold to an undercover agent.
Anyone care to take any bets on whether he shows up as a case for the
'use a cipher to commit a crime' argument?
