These are text, perhaps with occasional illustrations, so the current
interim export rules say it's ok.

For optically-scannable printed data, the government's announcement says 
it reserves (somehow) its right (acquired in unspecified manner :-)
to re-evaluate the exportability at a later time.  I think they
haven't settled on whether they'd be more embarassed by banning it
(which bans export of printed material, risking serious Constitutional
challenges) or by not banning it (having people laugh at them while
exporting source code or even binaries in OCR-A on loose-leaf paper
with page numbers and checksums.) 

Of course, by moving crypto off the Munitions List, and allowing
export of printed material, they're also reducing their exposure
to ridicule for not responding to Raph's T-shirt CJ request....
(huh-huh... made you say Unconstitutional ... huh-huh....)
