I hope you're not referring to Lucky, or Time May, or me.  Lucky has a 
successful career in a computer-related field.  Tim was exceedingly well-
integrated into the work force at Intel and did a great deal of valuable and 
lucrative work for them.  I am married with four children (who I never sent to 
a government school) and get along well with a host of friends and co-workers. 
 I have achieved a modicum of success as a writer and speaker.  I happen to be 
a neo-victorian myself.

Why is it that when someone like Al Gore expresses strong and extremist views 
as he did in "Earth in the Lurch" (or whatever that book was called) no one 
ever claims that he is " a pathetic strange little boy swaggering around in 
never-never land.  A lonely individual with a shriveled heart, stunted morals, 
and a feverish imagination."

How do you know our hearts are shriveled?  Can it be because we can do the 
math and figure out the Feds are *much* bigger killers than McVeigh?  Why 
don't you bleed for *their* victims.  Remember, government's crimes are worse 
than private crimes (even apart from the higher body count) because a serious 
breach of duty and trust is involved. 

Look, people are bound to disagree over social policy and even right and 
wrong.  But since everyone is much more powerful than they used to be, a force-
based monopoly on policy and morality ("others" government) just can't be 
sustained anymore.  Your side just simply doesn't have the artillery.  It 
would be better for everyone if you would recognize reality, step back, and 
allow self-government to replace others-government.  It will happen anyway.
