Barnes and Noble does in fact sell "Hit Man" for $10, the apparent list
price.  While a non stocked item, it can be special ordered and the
delivery time is claimed to be four to six weeks (I've found that in
practice about one week is usually required on special orders.)  Ingram
Books (wholesale) does not seem to carry Hit Man, but Amazon.com has it in
stock for $8, delivery in two to four days.
