There was a hilarious parody of Scientology on tonight's episode
of "Millenium."  A Cult named "Selfosophy," created by a really bad
writer named Onan Goopta, with a propensity to sue everyone, was
featured.  It had a large celebrity membership, and helped people
overcome negative thoughts with a device called an "Onan-o-Graph."

LOL!
