Forgive me, but isn't this just the standard technique for calculating
these things? Recall the algorithm for calculating points in the
mandelbrot set -- a point X0 is in the set if the infinite series
described above converges to a value within certain bounds? 
[The infinite series defined by 

	X0 = something
	Xn+1 = a * (Xn) * ( 1.0 - (Xn) )
]

This iterative technique is the fundamental idea behind the creation 
of the mandelbrot set and Julia sets, as I recall.

I don't know anything at all about the "Chaos Cryptosystem Algorithm",
but there might actually be more to it than just another onetime pad.
