If such a thing actually happened, I strongly suspect they'd
activate the contingency plan that was developed to maintain
tax collection after nuclear war; a flat 20% sales tax, 
collected (I think) by surviving Post Office employees.

Come to think of it, that might be better than what we have
now....
