Suppose I want to give ecash to somebody who don't have an account with
Mark Twain Bank, and I want the receiver of the coins to know that the
coins are genuine.

I would have two accounts at MTB, one for savings and one for transactions.
I want to give away a million bucks, so I deposit that amount in the
transactions account. Then I give the account password to the receiver, he
withdraws the money, and I change the password so he can't get any more
money from me. I trust the receiver not to change my password, but if he
does change it, then I can simply ask MTB to change it back, explaining
that I lost my password.

Would this work?


Mike.
