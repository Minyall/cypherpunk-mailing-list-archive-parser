"There are, however, two companies working on devices that examine the
human iris,
 the most notably being IrisScan who owns the patent. The technique's
major
 advantage over retina scans is that it does not require the user to focus
on a target,
 because the iris pattern is on the eye's surface. In fact, the video
image of an eye can
 be taken from several up to 3 feet away, and the user does not have to
interact
 actively with the device. Sensar, a company that has licensed the iris
scanning
 technology from IriScan hopes to position its IrisIdent product into ATMs
in the
 coming years."

I suggest you contact the manufacturer for more information.
