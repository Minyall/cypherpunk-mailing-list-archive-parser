This still would not make the digits random since knowing p-1 one can
calculate p.

In a random series of digits knowing p-1 should not have any effect on the
probability of the value of p.

With e if you know the value of p-1 is 7 then you can calculate the value of p and know if
p is 3 or not. In a random series knowing that p-1 is 7 there should be an equal
probability of p being 3 or any other number.
