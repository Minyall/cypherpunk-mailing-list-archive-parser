Unfortunately, this is not entirely true.  Within US-occupied North 
America (:-), a number of the NAPs are still government funded, 
though many of the big carriers also have direct interconnections rather 
than only peering through the NAPs.   One of the early NAPs, 
the Commercial Internet eXchange (CIX), was created specifically
to avoid the content censorship required for use of the government parts
(the old Acceptable Use Policy, which banned commercial discussion.)
In other countries, your kilometerage will vary substantially.

Also, the DNS top-levels are largely managed by governments or their
subcontractors - not just the root servers and NSI's .com/.org/etc,
but also .fr, .de, .ru, etc.  Some of this may change with the IAHC plan,
but some of it won't really.
