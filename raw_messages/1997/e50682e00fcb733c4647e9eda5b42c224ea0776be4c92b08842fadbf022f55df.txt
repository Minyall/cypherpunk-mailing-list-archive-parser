Well this is a UK telco problem not an Internet problem. I most certianly
do not wish to see my rates increase in an effort lower yours.

I highly doubt it. Currently the going rate in the US is $15-$20/mo
unmetered rate for a standard dial-up ppp account. This includes 1 or 2
mail boxes, 5-10Mb quota space, WebServer, NewsServer, POP3 & SMTP
servers. This is fairly standard offering but will vary slightly from one
ISP to another. This is what the market will bare due to fierce
competition in the ISP bussiness. I doubt that switching to a metered rate
system will lower prices any and more than likely will *increase* prices.

There have been ISP's in the past who have offered metered rate services,
they are no longer in business. People have voted with their walets and
have overwhelmingly stated that they do not want metered rate services
(this is why you hear some on the list talking about "educating" the
users).

>(My current ISP has truly pitiful performance.)

Get a different ISP. I have switched my webpages and mail accounts to a
shell account so I can switch ISP's at will without any problems.
