: Maybe it's time for Alex to join this thread and either say "no, we don't
: filter on any words at the Replay remailer", or else "yes, here's a list
: of the words we consider to be objectionable, so please omit them from
: your posts through the Replay remailer".

As stated before we do not filter.
