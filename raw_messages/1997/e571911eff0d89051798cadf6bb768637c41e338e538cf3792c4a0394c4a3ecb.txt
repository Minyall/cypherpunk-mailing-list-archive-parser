* United Hospital in St. Paul, Minn., announced in May that it was
looking for someone to take over curating its collection of more
than 14,000 human hearts, each stored in a plastic bag and the
collection featuring specimens of nearly every kind of heart disease. 
Dr. Jesse Edwards, who started the collection and is now 85 years
old, is retiring, and says maintenance of the hearts by a staff of five
costs $650,000 a year.
