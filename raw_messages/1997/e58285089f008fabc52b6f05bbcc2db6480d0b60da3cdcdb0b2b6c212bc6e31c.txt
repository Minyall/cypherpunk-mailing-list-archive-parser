I'm trying to find instances of crypto code published in computer magazines in 
the last few years.  I know of Blowfish in DDJ, are there cases of more 
mainstream computer mags like Byte publishing crypto code (I know Byte did DES 
in 1977, I'm hoping for something a bit more recent)?.  Please mail or cc 
replies directly to me, nntp.hks.net seems to have died :-(.
 
Peter.
