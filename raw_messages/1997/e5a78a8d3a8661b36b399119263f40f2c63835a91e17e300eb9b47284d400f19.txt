Thanks for all of the wonderful information on courses. As a result,
the list has really grown and been corrected in several places. The
newest version can be found at

   http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~rubin/courses.html

And I'm pretty sure I got the URL right this time. This is a good place
to point students who are interested in studying cryptography.
