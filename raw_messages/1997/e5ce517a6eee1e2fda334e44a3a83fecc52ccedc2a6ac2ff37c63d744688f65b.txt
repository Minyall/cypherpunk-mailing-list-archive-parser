Umm... reading your faq... (http://www.querisoft.com/SFFAQ.html) you
state that you use the windows95 user password as the password for
encrypting files. You also seem to imply that you don't actually
_ask_ for the password, windows gives it to you (albeit hashed
or something already, I imagine). If that is the case, that is extremely
worrisome. In fact it's outrageous.

That would imply that any _other_ application, benign or evil, could
also 
access the same password and immediately decrypt files.

Is that so? (Not coding much on windows, I don't know if applications
can access the user's hashed or encrypted password, but I would guess
they could.)

Jeremey.
