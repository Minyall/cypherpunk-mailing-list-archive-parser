No big deal.  When I was in law school in Oregon in the mid '70s, the Oregon 
Board of Social Control [I kid you not] was still on the statute books 
although I don't think they had sterilized anyone for a while.  

Eugenics, widespread sufferage, prohibition, central banking, the direct 
election of Senators were all popular causes promoted by US progressives at 
the turn of the century.
