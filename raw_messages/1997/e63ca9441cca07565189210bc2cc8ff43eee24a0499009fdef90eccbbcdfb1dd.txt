You must be referring to the Cult of Redistribution.

"A Fatal Tendency of Mankind

"Self-preservation and self-development are common aspirations among all
people.  And if everyone enjoyed the unrestricted use of his faculties and
the free disposition of the fruits of his labor, social progress would be
ceaseless, uninterrupted, and unfailing.

"But there is also another tendency that is common among people.  When
they can, they wish to live and prosper at the expense of others.  This is
no rash accusation.  Nor does it come from a gloomy and uncharitable
spirit.  The annals of history bear witness to the truth of it: the
incessant wars, mass migrations, religious persecutions, universal
slavery, dishonesty in commerce, and monopolies.  This fatal desire has
its origin in the very nature of man -- in that primitive, universal, and
insuppressible instinct that impels him to satisfy his desires with the
least possible pain."

-- Bastiat, "The Law", June 1850
