NYT has a front page special report today on the booming
computer investigative industry which is using legal and
illegal means to mine and peddle personal, corporate and
political data, dirt and damaging secrets. As one nabbed
dick says, it's no longer ex-intel and ex-feebs who are
doing it, now the techies and beagles of all sorts have 
rubbed their eyes at the amazing golddust on their screens. 

It might boost the demand for crypto and other essential
tools for privacy, or it may just lead to more cyber-TLAs 
and -bounties willfully busting the wrong Jim Bells while 
warning their still-connected buddies of "court-okayed" 
wiretaps and traps.
