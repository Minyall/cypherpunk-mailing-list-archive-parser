You misordered this: it should say "Nor do I have any evidence to 
present."

No, you're the one trying to torpedo its sales to get back at certain
individuals for some perceived slight.

Amazingly, C2Net doesn't like to see its product publicly slandered 
by reptiles like Vulis.  If Vulis' opinion were based on anything
other than personal ill will - ie, if he had ever actually downloaded
and examined Stronghold and found any problems with it - he would have
a leg to stand on.  As it is, his allegations are completely unfounded.

Keep in mind that anything Vulis says is in all likelihood a complete
lie.
