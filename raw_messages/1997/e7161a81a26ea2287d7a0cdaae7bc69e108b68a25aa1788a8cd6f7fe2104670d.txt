Please forward to this coward that have no balls to put his real email
address on his emails (I using you guys as he put CC to you guys in his
letter, but by no means does this reffer to you).

Dear CRYPTO CZAR INTERNATIONAL Idiot,

usually we ignore people at your level, but we'll try our best for you, as
it might be just temorary insanity.

1) The million dollars challenge have ended at May 15,1997. The current
challenge have NO monetary prize.
2) VME flowchart, algorithms and the VME application itself is already in
the hands of the large 250 sotware corporations for evaluation. If any of
them will prove otherwise, then you might be able to jump and make an idiot
of yourself as you did now.
3) We beleive they might like what they saw, as we currently have them
lined up to license the technology.
4) Try to keep your pathetic self away from the court room, as next time
around you will face legal steps for alleging "fraud".

Maybe you really should try and develop some future encryption algorithm
instead of mumbling with envy showing your stupidity and ignorance, But on
the other hand you're probably not capable of - you're too narrow minded
and busy sticking your long nose where it does not belong.

Do us and you a favour, keep yourself in your pathetic hole and shut your
mouth up.

Thanks and worst regards,

(we won't bother putting our name on the same email with your name).
