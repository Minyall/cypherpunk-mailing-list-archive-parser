Penance for Pirates
by Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)

        When it comes to protecting his company's computer software,
   nobody compares with Bill Gates. Not only is the nation's richest man
   thumbing his nose at government antitrust lawyers, but he's also
   toasting his latest victory: a draconian antipiracy bill that
   President Clinton signed yesterday.

        Piloted through Congress by the deep pockets of the software,
   motion picture and recording industries, the law punishes unapproved
   "reproduction or distribution" of books, magazines, software, music or
   videos. The painful penalties must bring a smile to the face of
   software executives: fines of up to $250,000 and five years in federal
   prison.

        While you're cooling your heels in Club Fed, you'll have plenty
   of time to consider your misdeeds -- which in this case could have
   been making just three copies of Microsoft Office (cost: $360 each).
   If it's any consolation, you'll have plenty of company. Joining you
   will be anyone who "willfully" infringes copyrights worth at least
   $1,000 within a six-month period, with stiffer penalties if the total
   jumps to $2,500.

        Ouch. The cost of prosecuting millions of malfeasants has led
   critics to wonder, sensibly enough, if the FBI's time could be better
   spent chasing violent criminals. After all, software companies can
   (and do) sue copyright infringers already. "This is a dreadful piece
   of legislation," says David Post, a law professor at Temple University
   who teaches copyright law. "Congress is doing exactly what they
   shouldn't be doing: reacting in a panic and saying there's so much
   copyright infringement we need to throw people in jail."
