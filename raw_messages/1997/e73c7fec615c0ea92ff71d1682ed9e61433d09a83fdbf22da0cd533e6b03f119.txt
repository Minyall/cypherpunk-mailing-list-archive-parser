 A million monkeys operating under the pseudonym 
 "Dr. Dmitri Vulis, KOTM <dlv@bwalk.dm.com>" typed:

> Do drop by whenever you're in NYC. :-)


I appreciate the invitation.  I'll be sure to do so when I'm in
NYC.


In other news, I made some t-shirts at HIP.  On the front they
have an excerpt of an e-mail message looking something like 
this:


  From: Stan <wallace@netvertisement.com>
  To: Winston <1072SmithW@citizenunits.org>
  Subject: MAKE FREEDOM FAST!!!

  "I may disagree with every spam you send,
   but I will defend to the death your right
   to send it."

                      -- Voltaire


On the back they have the following slogans:


                MAKE FREEDOM FAST!!!

                  Spam is Speech.

              Censorship is Censorship.


And at the hem there is the legend: 


   This is: AN OFFICIAL SPAM DEFENSE T-SHIRT
   Manufactured at: HIP, 1997
   By: Zooko Industries





I gave one shirt to Alex de Joode and one to Joichi Ito, and 
I kept one for myself.  That leaves one, which I originally 
intended to snail mail to Dr. Dmitri M. Vulis, KOTM.  But if 
you don't want it then I'll auction it off via cypherpunks.  
(Currencies accepted will include PGP-signed letters stating 
your undying adoration of and loyalty to Zooko.)
