It may make for good copy, but I think it's just fantasy to think the 
administration or their opponents, for that matter, will get what 
they want this year. Let them swarm. Who cares.

At earliest, August of 1998 before anything passes - and even that is 
highly optimistic.

I predict shouting on the floors of both houses and maybe even a 
shoving match or two before this is settled. Early evidence of the 
passions stirred: my story at 
http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/content/inwo/0911/inwo0007.html. the 
atmosphere in that room was, to put it politely, charged.

Another prediction: if the administration loses, you can count on a 
huge shake up at the top of the FBI. A defeat on this issue will make 
Ruby Ridge, Waco and Hoover's days of wiretap abuse and blackmail 
seem like the good old days. And since the FBI is playing front for 
what is now clearly White House intent - forget meaningless blather 
over what is "policy" and "not policy" - it will be the Fibbies who 
take the hits.

Crypto wars? Hell, we haven't even seen a good border skirmish yet.
