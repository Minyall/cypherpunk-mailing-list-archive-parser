This is to announce the release of Mixmaster 2.0.4 beta.

  Mixmaster is a new class of anonymous remailers. Inspired by the

  remailer technology.

Mixmaster is available from:

ftp://ftp.replay.com/pub/replay/pub/remailer/Mix-204b1.tar.gz

What's new?
- several bug fixes.
- "middle only" remailer.
- messages compression.
- support for /dev/random.
- rudimentary support for the list of reliable Mixmaster remailers.
- new installation script.
- can be compiled under DOS/Windows.

Mixmaster is (C) by Lance Cottrell <loki@infonex.com>.
