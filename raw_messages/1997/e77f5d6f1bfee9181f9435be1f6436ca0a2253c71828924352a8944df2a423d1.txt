I found this address for it after a couple of tries getting to the
"Diehard.html" site. I couldn't connect to that. This FTP site works though.
I found it at 

http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/bob_jenkins/testsfor.htm

To qoute, "An excellent test of random sequences is DIEHARD, maintained by
George Marsaglia. You get it by ftp from stat.fsu.edu, login anonymous, cd
pub, cd diehard, then get what you want. NOTE: George needs you to send him
mail at geo@stat.fsu.edu when you download it so he can keep getting grants
to support his excellent work."
