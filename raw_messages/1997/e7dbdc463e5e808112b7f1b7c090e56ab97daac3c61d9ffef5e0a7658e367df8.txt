And thus there is no true freedom of speech and such in Germany. I can
either say "Fuck the Jews" or I can't. I can either say "Bill Gates can blow
me" or I can't. I can either post naked pictures of myself or I can't. (And
yes, this means that there is no true freedom of speech and such in the
United States either.)

Nice try.
