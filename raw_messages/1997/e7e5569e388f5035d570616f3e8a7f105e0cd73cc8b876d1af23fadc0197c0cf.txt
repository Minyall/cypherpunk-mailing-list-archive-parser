Hello

 I send you links to my site where my crypto algorithm is published. I
hope you will find time to visit it and see what I have
discover. Algorithms I have design are Anigma and MEX128. Anigma is
encryption algo based on use Variable Function Technology, it
main characteristic is possibility to create unique encryption function
for every possible key. This make algorithm strong to all
known attacks, this is only my thesis I look for your help to find out
is it true. Please visit
<http://eon.pmf.ukim.edu.mk/~kbajalc/algo/index.html>. Documentation
about Anigma and Mex128 now are available only in Macedonian.
I will appreciate very much if you give me your opinion about Anigma and
Mex128 or give me address of people who can do.

                                                                        
Koki
