There's damn little you can do in a free society.  KeyKOS provided a
facility where you could give information to a program and ensure it could
not communicate it elsewhere.  However this facility involved running the
program in what amounted to solitary confinement.  While you can get away
to doing this to programs, people are (rightfully) different.
