I think the point they were trying to make was the data is not left in the
clear on the storage media (this is typical marketing droids at work). 

For practical reason data must be in the clear in memory at some point in
time. Also the data must be transferred into some type of peripheral so
the user can do somthing with the data (read text off a monitor, print a
document, listen to music, ...ect).

This is the biggest failings in these systems. Once the user has the
ability to decrypt the data the game is lost. One does not need to break
the crypto system as they give you the keys with the product!! 

Will this prevent John doe from giving a copy of the document to a
friend?? Nope as he will just give the friend the passphrase (or what ever
mechanism they use) along with the copy.

Will this prevent the Warez groups?? It may slow them down some but it
woun't get rid of them.

Will it stop commercial pirating?? HAH!! It will not even slow it down, a
minor inconvenience at best.
