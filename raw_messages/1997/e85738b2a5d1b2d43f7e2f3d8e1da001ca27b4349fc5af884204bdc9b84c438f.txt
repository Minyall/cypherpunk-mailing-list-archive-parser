But according to alt.security.pgp (4/28/97):

BONN, Germany (Reuter) -- A German cabinet minister called Monday for
increased efforts to fight crime on the Internet and demanded that
cyber-sheriffs have keys to unlock coded messages.
Interior Minister Manfred Kanther told a conference ....."The
technical and organizational competence of agencies charged with
fighting computer crime must be strengthened." 
"The criminals are hiding in the anonymity of the networks, wiping
their electronic tracks." Kanther said.

So clearly the government disagrees.
