And somehow this justifies their actions while allowing them to be human,
and doesn't justify our hatred of them and makes us inhuman?  How's that
again?   The logic of this escapes me.  Perhaps you're much brighter than
I, and can see what I can't.

It's called having the punishment fit the crime precisely and exactly.
It's your choice to live or not live like that.  Nobody is forcing you to
live in any way you dislike: except those that make the laws and enforce
them with toilet plungers.

That would be Hoover.  Correct: corruption.  And why have we accepted and
allowed such corruption of ideals from the start?  The bastard should have
been shot the day he started this shit.

Erm, when the jack booted thugs come at you with automatics, I'd like to
see you throw PGP disks, or source code at them to see if it can do more
damage to them that their bullets to your body.

The cure happened once before.  Recall England and the lovely colonies
that rebelled.  Do you believe that cure was worse than the Kings taxes
and troops?

True, and agreed.  Doesn't mean we should accept the current fascists in
power and bend over when they ask nicely.

Nor stroking the egos of Klinton and Freeh, nor their position.
