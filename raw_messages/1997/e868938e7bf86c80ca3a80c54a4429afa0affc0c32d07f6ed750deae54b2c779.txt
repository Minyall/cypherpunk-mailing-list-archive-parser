Those who tell the government the actual address where they sleep at night
have no expectation of privacy.  Most governments don't care if you
substitute an accomodation address.  If you find a government that does
care, shop around until you find another that doesn't.  I've been turned
down exactly once in my career when I attempted to use an accomodation
address for DMV purposes.  I went elsewhere.
