After all it is *very* important to have the Federal Government defend 
boarders against exploitation by their landlords! :-)

Seriously though.  Getting all emotionally tied up in concepts like 
"defending the borders" and "forcing" citizens to "aid in this invasion" 
may sound good, but whose land is it anyway?  I don't own a single acre, 
not even a single square foot of land in the entire southwestern/western 
part of the North American continent.

What gives the hoodlums in Washington, D.C. the right to draw a line on a 
map and try to control people's travel across that line?
