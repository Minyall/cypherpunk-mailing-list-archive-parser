Adam, you've tossed out half-baked ideas buried in several thousand
lines of anti-GAK rant.  None of them were thought through in terms of
infrastructure impact.  The idea of reencrypting the data strikes me
as half-baked, as well -- I sit and wonder about the pass-phrase
handling for the transient encryption keys that are changing on a daily 
or weekly basis -- or is there no pass-phrase -- is the key just 
stored on disk with no protection

The evidence seems to suggest that the PGP folks agonized pretty 
heavily over their design.  A stupid attack such as yours is far more 
likely to cement resistance than it is likely to win cooperation.

Trying real hard...

I work for a large organization, I have a unix workstation, an
xterminal booting off a departmental server, and a Mac in my office. 
As is typical in large organizations, a system admin team takes care
of all routine administration of my systems.  They all have root, of
course, and routinely do system upgrades and software installs on my
Mac.

Your solution doesn't seem to fit this environment very well...

Must be a very special boot floppy, of course, otherwise I just 
subvert the floppy driver, feign forgetting my passphrase, and 
collect the corporate crown jewels.  Or I hack into somebody else's 
system and corrupt their key...

Unfortunately, for real products you do have to consider these 
factors.

This is great.

Key lifetime is a major issue.  Keys are either protected by 
pass-phrase, or vulnerable.  Think about how you are going to 
generate new keys every day, or every week...

Think about off-line composition of email -- I have a laptop, download
my mail from the pop server, compose email.  Now I can't store my
friends public keys on my disk, because they expire every day.  So I
have to go to the public keyserver for every correspondent's public
key -- if the keyserver is unaccessible I'm out of luck.  This
radically changes the expected semantics of email.
