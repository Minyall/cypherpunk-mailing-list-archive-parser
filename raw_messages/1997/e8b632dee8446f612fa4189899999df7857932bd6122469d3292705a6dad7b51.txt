This triggered a thought that may have already been discussed, but I thought 
I'd throw it out anyway.  Since the export of cryptography = munitions, what 
happens if I write an application that's the "shell", and contract with a 
national and resident of a foreign country to write the crypto module.  I do 
not export the crypto technology other than sending them a printed book 
(which Phil Karn's filing determined was exportable as a non-munition).

I then retail the software as a 2-component system (distantly like PGP 2.6.3i 
could have been) on the web.  FTP the "shell" from my domestic site, and FTP 
the "crypto" from the foreign site.  Both install to make the seamless 
finished product.

Anyone seen anything in ITAR addressing such a hiring arrangement?

I'm not planning it, just spewing hypotheticals that tickle my curiosity.
