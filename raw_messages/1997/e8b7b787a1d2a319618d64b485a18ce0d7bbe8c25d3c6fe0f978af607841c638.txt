Someone forwarded this item to me. As he didn't cc: the list on it, I'll
protect his identity. Could be he's understandably worried about who's
reading the list.

This item indicates that the same team that busted this "gang" could indict
several of us as "co-conspirators" (isn't this a redundancy?) along with
Bell.

Lock and load.

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
