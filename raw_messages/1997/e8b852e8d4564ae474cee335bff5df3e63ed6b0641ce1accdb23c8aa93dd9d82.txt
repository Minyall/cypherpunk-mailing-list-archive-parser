Hi all
please help me, this is the problem
our network admin is monitoring our internet access for "bad sites" detection
he is also blocking many of these sites
he is also (again !) blocking ports 8000-9000 (for public http proxies) and 3128-3130 for public squid caches

what to do than ?
please if you know a public proxy accessible under a port not in the blocked range,
or if you know a proxy or a search engine with SSl enabled please email that to me

*** really sorry for using a remailer, i cant access my mailexcite account cause he may sniff my password
*** but i'm sure of one thing, he is not subscribed to this list ;-)
