Just as a side remark: why what standard are hallmark and giant foods "white"?
If they're like most big corporations, they probably bend over backwards to
promote blacks via "affirmative action" quotas, and have more blacks in
positions of responsibility than they possible could have if they based their
hiring decisions on merit. Evidently this is not good enough for racists
hatemongers like Jesse "Hymietown" Jackson and Louis Farrakhan.
