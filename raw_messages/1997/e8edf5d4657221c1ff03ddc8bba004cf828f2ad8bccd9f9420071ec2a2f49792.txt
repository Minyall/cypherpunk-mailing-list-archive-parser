        "There must be some way out of here",
        Said the joker to the thief
        "There's too much confusion --
        I can't get no relief.
        Businessmen, they drink my wine
        Plowmen dig my earth.
        None of them all along the line
        Know what any of it is worth."

        "No reason to get excited",
        the thief he kindly spoke
        "There are many here among us
        Who feel that life is but a joke
        But you and I, we've been through that,
        and this is not our fate
        So let us not speak falsely now
        The hour is getting late."
                       
        All along the watchtower
        Princes kept the view
        While the women came and went,
        Barefoot servants, too
        Outside, in the cold distance,
        A wildcat did growl
        Two riders were approaching
        The wind began to howl.
