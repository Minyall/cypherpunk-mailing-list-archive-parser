Yeah. A conspiracy theorist might be prompted to theorize that Intel
deliberately placed this in their processor, took a chance that nobody else
would find it and publically release it, and then leaked the information
themselves. If they refuse to replace the P5s many people will upgrade to a
PPro or a P5. Of course Cyrix and AMD throw a wrench into this theory, but
I doubt there are a whole lot of people who won't be buying any more Intel
products due to this, and some of the clones have or did have big problems 
such as annoyingly slow FPUs.

If they don't make it extraordinarily easy for me to replace my processor
I'll probably be one of the people who falls into the latter catagory and
goes off to Cyrixland.
