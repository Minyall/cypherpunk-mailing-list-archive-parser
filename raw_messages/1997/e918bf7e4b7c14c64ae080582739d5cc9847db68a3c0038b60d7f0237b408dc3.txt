'Mericans probably don't realize that there is a distinction between 
Permanent Residents (PRs) and other sorts of ferriners.  All of the Feds' 
cute extra-territoriality ploys:  outlawing gold ownership in '33, outlawing 
unlicensed space launches in 85(?), outlawing working on anything in Cuba or 
on nuclear power plants in the old bad South Africa, or outlawing exporting 
crypto, or blocking ownership of 60% of the world's mutual funds, or levying 
taxes on worldwide income, etc. apply to US citizens, US permanent residents, 
and in some cases those present in the US.

Thus US citizens and PRs were prohibited from owning gold anywhere on earth 
from 1933 to 1980.  Same with the rest (with numerous complications).

A student Visa holder is most assuredly not a PR and so would not be covered 
by these laws save to the extent that they cover all those present in the US.
