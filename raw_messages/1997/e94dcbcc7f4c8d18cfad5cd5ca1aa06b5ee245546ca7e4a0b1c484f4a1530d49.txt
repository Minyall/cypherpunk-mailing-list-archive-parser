I asked Jim last night if he wanted any of the documents associated
with the raid published and he said not yet:

That the local papers were publishing selected parts to inflame reader 
lust. 

That the feds had set it all in motion with lurid affidavits, with press
invitation, with paraded troops and battle armaments to fit the show
and tell tinhorn war gamers seeking more funding -- tax time at hand.

He seems bemused that his script was followed so dutifully for Act 1. 
And awaits the next acts, instigated not only by his taunts but by
the national campaign to divert attention from TLA/LEA snafus.

In this spirit, for a truly homicidal, bloodstirring script read the National 
Defense Authorization Act for 1998:

Now that's Assassination Politics to feed the lust of the best and brightest
of all nations, if not that of a few of the overmuch AP protestors here.

Jim's telephone number: 1-360-686-3911

For a reality check compare Jim  to the world's presidents, parliaments, 
high-tech industrialists, spies and media infowar gamers trying valiantly 
to alarm the Disney-narcotized citizenry.
