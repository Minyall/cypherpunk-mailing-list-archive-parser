Not to my knowledge.  But See, subpoena comment above.

I am amazed that no one has suggested a pool of moderators with
provisions to blind a given post from attributation to a specific
moderator.  (Attornies- what might be impact of a Res Ipsa attack on this
kind of set up, and incidently, on other anonymous pool arrangements?)

While as far as conduct goes I agree, in defining what will eventually be
the list content, and thus what I should or should not use/waste my time
typing up, it is an important ex ante condition that a stated policy
exist.  There are two questions here.

1>  Will my material be booted off only because it disturbs the moderator?
(I think this is the one answered by your common law reference)

2>  Will my material violate some restriction and be booted "for cause?"
(This can only be predicted accurately if there is a stated policy on what
constitutes a violation- and then only where the policy has teeth or is
generally respected).
