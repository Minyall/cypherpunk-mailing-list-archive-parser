This is exactly what is happening.  In fact one ISP mentioned recently on
this list keeps alt.anonymous.messages traffic for an extended period of
time for their customers.

On a more practical note, if the user downloads all the messages, or uses
secret-sharing techniques, the ISP can sell accounts using non-anonymous
payment methods and not know which users are receiving which messages.
No blind ecash needed.
