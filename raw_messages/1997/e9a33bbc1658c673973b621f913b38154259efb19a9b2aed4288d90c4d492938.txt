Not me.  I ordered both the crypto CD and the latest Dr. Dobbs on CD (back
issues and such) at the same time.  I got the Dr Dobbs Mag CD about two
months ago, but no crypto CD. :(


You might wanto check Remo Pini's Crypto CD.  It doesn't have the books
online, but plenty of cyphers and stuff. (rpini.com ??)
