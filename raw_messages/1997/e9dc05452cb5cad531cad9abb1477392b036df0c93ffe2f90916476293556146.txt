Well part of the problem with using chemical agents is they are not very
efficient. This is a lesson that was learned in WWI and most likely was
the largest factor in them not being used durring WWII (durring WWI one
was just as likely to be hit by one's own gas as the enemy was).

It is even questionable as a terror weapon against civilian targets due to
the quantities that would be needed to attack a large city like London.
