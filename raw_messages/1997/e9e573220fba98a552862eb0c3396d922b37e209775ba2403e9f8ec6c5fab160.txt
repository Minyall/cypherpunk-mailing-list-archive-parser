	A client asked me today about where he could find evidence of the
relative strength of different encryption algorithms, when all are
restricted to 40-bit keys.  He assumed dot-Gov was going to restrict his
export product to the 40-bit limit, but he wanted to provide the strongest
security he could within that limitation.

	How should I have answered him?
