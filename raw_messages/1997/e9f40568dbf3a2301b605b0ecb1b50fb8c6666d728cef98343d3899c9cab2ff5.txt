  Those who *do*not* believe 'The medium is the message' usually think
that Socrates' world-veiw would have been exactly the same if he had
been using the InterNet as his means of viewing and communicating with
the world.

  Right, Jim. Give us your prediction of when this is going to happen...
(Yes, I *am* laughing at you...thanks for asking.)

  Reality is that even when the medium evolves to the point where we
can use it to convey the totality of what we are trying to convey, that
after we have done so the 'powers that be' will flash a graphic of
us on the computer screen, making us look for all the world like a
drug-dealing, terrorist pedophile.
  There will be few sheeple with the dicrimination to recognize that,
in your case, it is true, in 'my' case, it is not.

Not that I'm a troublemaker...
