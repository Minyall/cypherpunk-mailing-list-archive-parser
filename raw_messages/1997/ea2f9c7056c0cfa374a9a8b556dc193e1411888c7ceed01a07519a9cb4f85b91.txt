CCI:
   CRYPTO CZAR INTERNATIONAL ANNOUNCES UNBREAKABLE CRYPTO CHALLENGE
   ----------------------------------------------------------------

Crypto Czar International would like to announce the development of the
fastest and most secure encryption product on the market today.
We plan to develop this product early next week, as our employee has 
already finished the first two chapters of 'Applied Cryptography.'

We are so confident of our future product that we are challenging
MagNuts, Micro$oft, Nut$crape and everyone else to break it. We are
willing to pay out a $10,000,0000 prize to anyone willing to give us a 
$1,000 good-faith deposit, which will be returned upon completion of our
open-ended Crypto Challenge.

Please send ten copies of this to your friends and to your business
associates.

  The address to send the good-faith deposit to:
	Crypto Czar International
	c/o Electronic Fraud Foundation
	Box 281,
	Bienfait, Saskatchewan
		CANADA  S0C 0M0
