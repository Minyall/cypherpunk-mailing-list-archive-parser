Actually, he was prosecuted for the murder of 8 federal employees.  The
remaining 3 counts he was convicted of were conspiracy, destruction of
government property, and use of a weapon of mass destruction (or
something like that).  Oklahoma does plan to file 160 murder charges
against McVeigh.  Then there are the wrongful death lawsuits...
