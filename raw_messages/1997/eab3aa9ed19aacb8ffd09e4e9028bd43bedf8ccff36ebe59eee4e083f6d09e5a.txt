Given that Matt did the exercise the one time it was worth doing, as a
"demonstration," and given that nobody has been prosecuted for this sort of
thing, and given the "personal use exemption" issued a while back, what's
the point?

If your point is to show that you, too, can jump through hoops and run
around collecting papers, then it hardly seems fair for any of us to give
you help, right?

(P.S. I seem to recall that some time _after_ the Matt Blaze experience
there was an even more clearcut statement that laptops leaving the country
for temporary trips did not need _any_ permission forms, even officially. I
dimly recall this as part of the new BXA/EAR documents.)
