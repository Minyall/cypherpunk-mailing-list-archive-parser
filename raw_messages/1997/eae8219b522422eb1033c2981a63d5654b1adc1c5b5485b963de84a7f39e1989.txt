While trying to submit the cypherpunks.to website to a few search engines,
I noticed that none of them seems to support indexing of https URL's. Is
anybody here aware of a search engine that indexes secure web pages? And
if there is no such search engine, what are the thoughts on using https to
deliberately keep pages out of indices?

Thanks,
