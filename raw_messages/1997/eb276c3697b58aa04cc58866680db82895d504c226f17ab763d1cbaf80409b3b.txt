Maybe reputation capital is not the right word. There are some people
who do not necessarily like what I am saying in Japan. I am using all
of the media spin that I can to keep the tabloids out of my face. I
regularly gets calls from the tabloids here trying to find something
to tear down my reputation in Japan. This method of media spin is
how most politicians in Japan extort and put pressure on public figures.

Even if everyone here knows exactly what I mean, people can quote
me out of context and things can escalate from there.

So yes. I fear being cast as a cypherpunk hardliner and having it
distorted in the Japanese press. I know for a fact that a few people
are trying to do this and more will in the future.

You are correct. It is difficult to be a successful dissident in Japan.

They are resented in Japan. The problem is, I have many of my assets
in the United States so taking a Japanese nationalist stance against
the NSA is not very intelligent for me. I like many things in the US
and I would like to protect my ability to access to those things.

I agree. I am trying to keep my politics rather disorganized and
focused on cutting through lies and bullshit rather than building
a political position. I have not organized anything other than a
regular cypherpunks meeting where many different types of people
exchange views and work on technology. I do not "negotiate" with
the government. I just express my opinions. For now... but I understand
very well the risk of political exposure. Many of my colleagues
and friends have been  socially destroyed when trying to break a pact
with the "dark side." I have already had several "recruitment"
pings from the "dark side," and the most recent attempt in the form
of a bribe offer, I reported Time Magazine. The "dark side" doesn't
like me, but they don't have anything on me... yet...

Same. Markoff promised that if I received a threat from either the US
or Japanese government, he would write it up in the New York Times
for me. I think this is the best protection I have.
