No that is not what they do. :(

In addition to *RESTRICTING* the use of *DOMESTIC* crypto it provides a
rather scary president:

An Admendment to the Constitution of the United States is only valid if
Congress says it is and only if the Rights provided by those Admendments
are exercised by The People in a manner that meets Congress's approval.

If Congress really want's to do somthing then let them pass a resolution
that the export restrictions of crypto in the EAR is unconstitional and
therfore null & void. Anything less or more is unneeded, unwanted, and
unconstitional.
