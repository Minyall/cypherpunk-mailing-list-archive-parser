Well I haven't done alot in the area of writting crypto algoritims I have
done quite a bit of work in the area of crypto implementations (mostly in
the PGP - E-Mail Integration).

I have also been working on improving performance of PGP when working with
large keyrings (primary & secondary indexing, multiple keyring lookups,
public key caching, real time key retreival from BAL servers).
