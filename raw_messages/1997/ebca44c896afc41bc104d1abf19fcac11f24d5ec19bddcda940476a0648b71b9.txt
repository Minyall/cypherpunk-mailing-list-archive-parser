Professor Denning has an evolving statement of her position 
on encryption policy, the latest dated May 26, 1997:

http://guru.cosc.georgetown.edu/~denning/crypto/position.html

Excerpts:

"I do not advocate domestic regulations mandating key 
recovery. Neither do I advocate that cryptography necessarily 
be free of all regulation, including export controls. I constantly
struggle with the issues and do not see easy answers." 

"I support the program of the Clinton Administration to 
liberalize export controls for key recovery products, to adopt 
key recovery within federal agencies, and to promote the
voluntary use of key recovery technologies. I believe that 
key recovery can be done without compromising privacy 
and security, but acknowledge that there are also costs and 
risks associated with key recovery."
