And people said my old prediction that we'll see 10 year sentences for use
of illgal crypto were extreme. Swinestein must be drooling at the
prospect. As usual, the masses will love the idea, as long as it (might)
save just one child.

On a completely unrelated note, is there some interest in starting up a
"Cypherpunks Nuclear Physics Study Group"? I recently finished reading
"The Curve of Binding Energy". Fascinating book.
