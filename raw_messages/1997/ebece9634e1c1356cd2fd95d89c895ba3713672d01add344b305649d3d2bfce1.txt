Here's a problem.  I don't have "technical" capabilities in the area of
communications software, and I have too full a plate to start studying
now.  But, I/we need to monitor the "moderator", to make sure he doesn't
allow people to attack others, then cut the responses.

If he does this, and he doesn't rectify it when it's called to his
attention, he would need to be punished in some way.  One of the
questions I have is, how do I know what's cut when all I subscribe to
is the uncensored list?  I do *not* want to subscribe to the filtered
list plus the "flames" list, out of principle.  Is this something that
would be forced on me/us in order to monitor the censorship?

In other words, can I separate the censored email without having to
have two accounts?
