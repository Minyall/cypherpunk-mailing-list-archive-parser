Reply to Duncan Frissell:

Mr. Frissell asserts that Germany lacks rights
such as freedom of speech and 
association.
This is not true.
The German Basic Law provides for everyone the right to freedom of speech,
religion and association.
However, Germany prohibits hate speech i.e. National Socialism and 
incitement to racial, religious and national hatred.
The reason for this exception is the German history.
While I do strongly disagree with the German goverment on free speech, to 
lie about
the holocaust and to promote hatred, I understand why they have this law.
It should be noted that the ban on National Socialism was first imposed 
by the
allied nations, including The United States, 
after World War Two.
The democratically elected parliament of the new republic chooses
to continue this policy known as Radikalenerlass.
