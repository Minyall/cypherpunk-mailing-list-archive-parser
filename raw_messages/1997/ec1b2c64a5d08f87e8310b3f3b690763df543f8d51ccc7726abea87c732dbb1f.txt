The control message may take a few more hours to propogate, either 
that or your newsadmin has rmgrouped it. The charter was clear and 
concise and explained the issues so I don`t see why it should have 
been rmgrouped. Can you mail me if it hasn`t been created by the time 
you get this email and I`ll re-issue the cmsg. However, I`m sure it 
was OK as Robert Hettinga (sp?) found it on his news server today...
