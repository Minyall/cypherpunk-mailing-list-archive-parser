(JF won't see this, unless Bob H. chooses to pass it on, Sandy-style. This
is why those who want to participate in the debate should actually do so,
on unedited, undelayed lists, not on digests and delayed condensations.)

Read the real list.

As a comment, sometimes when I try to "reply to all" to these messages from
folks reading digests, I get "you are not a member of this list" or "this
is a private list" messages.

Fine, but it's why I won't waste time on folks who may not even see what I
write unless I address it to them personally.

JF, get a decent mailer and get on the real list if you want to participate.

(Oh, and "cypherpunks@toad.com" is NOT the proper list address. It may
work, for a while, but it has been replaced by 2-3 other names.)
