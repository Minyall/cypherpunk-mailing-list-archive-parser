Yes it does, if one has a strong moral sense about things like individual 
rights and privacy, and the government attempt to deny the people these 
rights, the government have commited a great wrong, it is only to be 
expected that the natural response is to encourage their removal. I find 
it amazing how many people support the punishment of murderers and 
kidnappers in society at large, but exempt from this the particular group 
of people composing the government.

Oversensitivity, plain and simple, I find some racist jokes funny, I am 
not racist.
