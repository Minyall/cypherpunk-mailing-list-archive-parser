After yesterday's crypto-hearing, I decided I should write a story about
Stupid Senate Tricks -- how your elected representatives misspeak,
misstate, and misstep when it comes to technology. From the "What is PGP" 
question at a recent hearing to Feinstein's meaningless blather yesterday,
this is fertile ground. 

Do you have any favorite quotes? Not just crypto, but CDA, copyright, and
technology in general. Send 'em to declan@well.com.

thanks,

Declan
