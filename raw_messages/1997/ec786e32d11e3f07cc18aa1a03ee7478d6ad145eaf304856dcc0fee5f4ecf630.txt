40 bit encryption obvious that can be broken...

This sounds wrong to me.  Many strong ciphers run just as fast if not
faster than weak ciphers.  Eg 128 bit RC4 runs at the exact same speed
as 40 bit RC4.  IDEA & CAST are pretty fast, etc.

DVD with stupid copy protection is bad anyway.  Copright police are
