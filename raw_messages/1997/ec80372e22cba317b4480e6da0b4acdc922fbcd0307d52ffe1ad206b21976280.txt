With all this talk about relocating the home of cypherpunks, I decided to
see if any second level domains are registered under the cypherpunks
name.

Both cypherpunks.org and cypherpunks.com are registered by one
Elias M. Levy in Ft. Meade, MD. I haven't seen his name on the list
though. Anybody knows more about this?
