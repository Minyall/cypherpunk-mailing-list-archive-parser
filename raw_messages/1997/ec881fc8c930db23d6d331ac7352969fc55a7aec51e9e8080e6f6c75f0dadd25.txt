BTW, do you remember what happened to her first husband?

You are in denial.  Her firsthand experience with gun violence has 
clearly been a serious formative factor in her values and opinions.  
However, I agree that she has authoritarian tendencies.  Furthermore, 
she is, in my opinion, pretty lightweight intellectually -- not quite to 
the Reagan level, perhaps, but (as Reagan demonstrated) one doesn't 
need intelligence to succeed in politics.

Oh, give me a break, Duncan.  These are absolutely pathetic 
examples.  Much more indicative of her "caliber", I think, was her 
mind-numbing efforts to get a new stadium built.
