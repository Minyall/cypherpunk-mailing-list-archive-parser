  Right. And you're going to use examples pertaining to huge 
health industry corporations who exist only because of the mountains 
of government regulations which keep small health care providers
from providing simple, sane market options.

  The totality of today's medical profession and health care system
*is* 'government-caused.'
  You can't piss in a pot you keep under your bed without violating
a hundred laws from the Health Department to the EPA to...
  Kiss your child's 'stubbed' toe 'better' and you'll end up in prison
for unlawfully practicing medicine.

  No. Libertarians complaining about government perversion of a
free market.
  If you cry, make sure you wipe those tears with a towel that meets
government standards. (Cost: $3,000.00)
