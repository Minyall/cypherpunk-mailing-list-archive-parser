Criticizing the bill is not the same thing as "attacking" its
supporters. Criticizing the arguments of those supporters in
favor of the bill, and questioning seeming inconsistencies
therein, is not the same thing as "attacking" those supporters.

Nor does such criticism imply an accusation that all, or
even some, of those supporters "have turned against crypto."

The illogical equlvalence you set up, however, does seem to
be characteristic of these supporters' arguments.:)
