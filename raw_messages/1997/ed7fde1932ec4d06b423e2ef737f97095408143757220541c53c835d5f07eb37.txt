I did.  I may have been declared an `interested party' because I host
a copy of Bell's AP essays.  I certainly never asked to be put on
their list :)  (Also, it came to me via an older address, one which I
was about to close; if _this_ kind of weirdness keeps showing up,
I may have to keep it a while longer.
