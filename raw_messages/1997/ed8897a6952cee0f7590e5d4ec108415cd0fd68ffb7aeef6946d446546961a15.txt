There's a difference between being open minded and gullible Sandy.
Nothing like ducking and running away when your little game didn't turn

This is not a flame, it is my opinion but none the less I'm sure that it
will end up in the flames list or be conveniently lost in the masses of
mail that John's majordomo receives every day.
