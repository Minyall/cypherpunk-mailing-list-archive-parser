   You can not.  You need another account.

Not quite true.  I'm going to use one account on a host running qmail
to find the differences between the lists (one will go to
accountname-mod@qmailhost, the other to accountname-raw, and a cron
job will do the comparisons every few minutes).  If you have an
account on a unix box running sendmail, you can have .forward run a
program to sort messages out by sender into separate files for normal
mail, the raw list, and the moderated list.

   I wrote to Steve Case about this censorship problem, and I am waiting
   for him to respond.

   Do you want another account to get the censored list at?
