Actually, the real "sucker rates" are the amounts small businesses pay for
insurance.

The big businesses (who can buy in bulk) get a pretty reasonable deal for
what they get.  The smaller companies who cannot bargain the price down
get screwed.  (The rate my wife's employer was paying was close to double
what my insurance costs and it covered ALOT less.)

I seriously doubt that most people could afford to self-insure at the
going rate.  (Not unless they have some serious income they want to get
rid of.)
