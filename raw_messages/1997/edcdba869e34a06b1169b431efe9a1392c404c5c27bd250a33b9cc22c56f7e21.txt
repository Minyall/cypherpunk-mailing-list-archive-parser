Then you may  be OK, as the best time to trigger such events is probably at
rush hour in the morning, where I assumed, being a reporter, you're still
recovering from the shmooze parties the night before.

One thing that seems possible is a coordinated, multi-city detonation
(assuming the freedom fighters have several armable devices, which seems
possible). Several small nukes being detonated in A, B, C, and D (where
these are the capitals or centers of influence of one's political
opponents) would synergistically magnify the terror effect. Detonating just
one of them would probably result in severe travel restrictions, martial
law, etc., and so make detonation of the later ones problematic.

More of us will be executed, tortured, or otherwise injured in the
aftermath of martial law than would be injured in a suitcase-nuking of the
snake's head. (By "us" I mean reasonable people like ourselves, not the
unemployable welfare addicts and unemployable government lifers who cluster
around the target zones.)
