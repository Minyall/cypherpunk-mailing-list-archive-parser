Hi all,

I just started working vfor a local ISP and they found out, i was on
this list and knew a little about crypto. Anyway they seem to have the
impression this would qualify me to know something. At any rate, on to
the point of the mail. Could someone point me in the right direction for
info on secure http servers ??  Also maybe info on which is better than
the other ??

Jason
