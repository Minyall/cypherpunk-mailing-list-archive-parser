Just an interesting point here about the 
absence of * and # keys on Anguilla's 
phones...  

The US is not immune from similar anti-
competitive tactics at pay phones.  A number
of new pay phones now have only numbers on
their keypads (no letters).  The reasoning
behind this is that people will not be able to
place their long distance charges though
other companies (e.g. 1-800 CALL ATT etc.).
