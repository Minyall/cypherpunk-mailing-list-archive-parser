* Among the recent rules established by the Afghanistan Taliban
office formerly known as the Department for Promoting Virtue and
Preventing Vice:  No paper bags (because the paper possibly could
have been recycled from discarded Korans); no kite-flying; no
clean-shaven men (unless they are prepared for a career of street-
sweeping); no women employed in senior positions in hospitals, or
seated in the front seats of ambulances, or riding with foreign
citizens; women visiting hospitals must refrain from making noise
with their shoes while walking; athletes must grow beards and wear
full Islamic dress in the field; and sports-event spectators must not
clap.  However, the ban on watching television was lifted.
