   "During the Cold War period of 1945-1977, a total of more than 
   40 reconnaissance aircraft were shot down. The secrecy of the 
   reconnaissance programs prevented recognition of the slain 
   military personnel at the time of the incidents. Their loss was 
   mourned by their fellow soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines in 
   similar programs, but the fallen could not be accorded public 
   honors. The end of the Cold War has allowed the United States 
   to lift some of its security restrictions concerning the 
   reconnaissance programs, permitting us at last to accord due 
   recognition of the achievements and sacrifices of these intrepid 
   military personnel, and to tell their stories. "
