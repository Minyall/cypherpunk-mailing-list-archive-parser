I disagree. I think it's quite conceivable that a serious point could
arise from the flames. If a moderator can't be challenged based on
what happened with the reject list, what's the point of having a reject
list in the first place?

Anyway, I don't think such a rule is possible to implement, nor would it 
protect the moderator from other forms of denial-of-service attack even 
if it were implemented.
