Oh, I'll agree with that.  I think that governments will do it anyhow.

>From a government standpoint it's ok if it's basically unenforceable, because
it makes a nice "dual-use" tool:  if someone the government doesn't
like is using a forged IDL, they can be busted for that.  Remember, 
wiretaps to gather evidence are now legal if they're "in good faith".
All it takes is one mention of your forged IDL, or a slip in your
code, and the secret's out.
If they do use a valid IDL, then they're traceable and can be
traffic-analyzed into revealing their "co-consiprators", then busted.

Of course these techniques will only be used against terrorists, never
against freedom fighters.
