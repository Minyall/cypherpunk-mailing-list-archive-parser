Ah, but he is not a "terrorist," then. Being hired by anti-Castro forces in
the United States automatically makes him a "freedom fighter." He's only a
terrorist if he works for Oceania, er, Eastasia, er, whomever we don't
currently like.

Had he blown up a Cuban airliner, as CIA-supported forces did a while back,
he would still be a freedom fighter. Had he sent a package of pamphlets to
Hamas to aid in their struggle against the Zionist occupiers, he would be a
terrorist.

Is it clear now?

There's something wrong when I'm a felon under an increasing number of laws.
Only one response to the key grabbers is warranted: "Death to Tyrants!"
