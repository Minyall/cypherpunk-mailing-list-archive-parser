  When the post arrives with three or four sets of '> >>' (<--whatever
the
fuck these things are called), then even those of us who lost the better
part of our brains in the Drug War are able to figure out that it is a
forwarded-forwarded-forwarded post.
  I think Tim is fighting old wars in his head. (Find your shoes, yet,
Tim?)

  I can sympathize with Tim, here. People who plagarize the works of 
others, or who steal credit for other's ideas, are the scum of the
earth.

Just say "No" to "Plagarists Inside"
We got no ethics, we're stealing sig lines, I know that that ain't
allowed.
