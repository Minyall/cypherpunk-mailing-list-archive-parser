With PGP, they'd get the source code because users insist
that it be available so they know whether they can trust it.
With some commercial products, they'd have to pay for a source license...

In America, the standard Constitutionally-approved method for law enforcers 
to get access to private papers is to get a court to issue a warrant 
naming the probable cause to suspect that a crime has been committed 
and the particular items to be seized.  If the FBI wants to accuse Sun
of export violations, they can do it.  Last I heard, the NSA's
job didn't include law enforcement - just building tools to protect 
government communications, and eavesdropping on foreigners,
and occasionally providing technical expertise to other government agencies.

[BOOGA BOOGA BOOGA!]  Understanding their actions doesn't mean approving.
