Bill, while I intensely dislike FDR's politics, he was nowhere near the kind
of crook and murderer that Slick Willy is.

FDR tried to pack the Supreme Court - this ain't nice, but it's just politics.
What did he do that could compare to peddling plots on the Arlington nat'l
Cematary to political contributors (that later get dig up and reburied :-)
or to Waco?
