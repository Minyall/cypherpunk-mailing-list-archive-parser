Karl's worried that the new GLTD system might mean that some sites
will be unreachable, so he's going to lobby ISPs to not accept the
new GLDTs to ensure that sites are unreachable?

This reminds me of the Vietnam era "We had to destroy the village in
order to save it."

If I didn't already think that Karl was an idiot, I'd sure think so after
reading this.
