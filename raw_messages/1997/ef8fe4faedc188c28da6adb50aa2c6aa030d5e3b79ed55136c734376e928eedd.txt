Reason for my asking is my questioning the veracity of the contents of the
email.  The mail specifically stated: "in previous court hearings [plural],
IRS Inspectors testified.."

Could've been a bail hearing although they are usually decided on motion
papers.  Additionally, there are no hearings for the request of a
search/arrest warrant - primarily because the request is ex parte.  Probable
cause is decided on annexed affidavits.

I'm also surprised that that JB's plea did not hit the local newspapers given
the initial coverage.  There's usually a follow-up report of the entry of a
guilty plea.

If JB did plea guilty, the next docket entry should reflect "for sentencing"
or words to that effect.
