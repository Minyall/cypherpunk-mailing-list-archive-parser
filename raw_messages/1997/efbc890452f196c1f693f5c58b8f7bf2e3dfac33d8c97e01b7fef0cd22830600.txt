It's legal in the US, but other countries have export restrictions,
too. They're usually pretty hard to find out about, especially
considering that the people who passed the laws don't have a clue what
the law means.

Your best place to check is the Crypto Law Survey at
http://cwis.kub.nl/~frw/people/koops/lawsurvy.htm
The disclamer states that the findings may not be "exaustive or
legally reliable," and given the opacity of crypto laws, you'd better
belive it. That said, it is an excellent resource.
