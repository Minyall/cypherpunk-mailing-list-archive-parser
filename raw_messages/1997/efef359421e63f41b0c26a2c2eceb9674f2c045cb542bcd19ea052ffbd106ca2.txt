 Yup, I don't disagree with that. But, I have trouble answering the
 obvious question, 'well, how many lives _does_ it take before something
 is done?'. Is there any way to quantify this kind of thing? 
 
 We hear on TV etc people saying "If this draconian measure saves the
 life of one innocent child its worth the loss of my right to walk in
 the park, or whatever". This is clearly shit, but can people suggest a
 sensible measure of when new legistlation is justified?
