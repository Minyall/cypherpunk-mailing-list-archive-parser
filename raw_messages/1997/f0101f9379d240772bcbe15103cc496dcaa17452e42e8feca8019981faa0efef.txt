  I can walk alone and armed anywhere I damn please, without fearing
for my life.

  Without fascist gun control measures in place, Canada had never had
a big problem with gun-related violence.
  The fact that the Canadian government has gone to such great lengths
to 'solve' a problem which does not exist, speaks volumes.

  This is precisely the reason that governments are pushing for stronger
and stronger gun control laws.
  The government has no interest in removing the source of crime. Crime-
-violent crime, in particular--is the government's best friend. By using
gun control to disarm *only* the law-abiding citizens, they put the 
safety of the citizens in the hands of their own LEA's. And by failing
to
provide safety for the law-abiding citizens, they force more and more
of them to break the law in order to protect themself.
