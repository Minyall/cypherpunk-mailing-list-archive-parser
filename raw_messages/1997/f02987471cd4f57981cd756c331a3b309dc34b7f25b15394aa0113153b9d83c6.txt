Bill, more than 2,000 people have dies from planes being blown up by
terrorist in the last 10 years alone.

Old Prince Ferdinand, you know the bloke whose death started WWI allegedly,
had an attempt on his life the morning of his death via bomb. He shrugged it
off and got shot.

Stalin had millions killed for political reasons.

The Isrealis have killed tens of thousands in their expanionisitic,
non-survivalist motivated actions.

The US backed Central American death squads have killed hundreds of
thousands if not millions.

People kill for religion, politics, insanity, and fun.

Terrorism has a long history in human culture.

Yours is a unreasoned view.
