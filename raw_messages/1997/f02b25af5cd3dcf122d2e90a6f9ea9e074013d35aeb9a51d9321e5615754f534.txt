  When I was running a nude club in Bell County, Texas, the local
paper carried a small item about how the Sheriff would soon 
announce his bid for re-election.
  The next day, the constabulary raided my club, complete with
press, camera crews, etc.
  The following day, beneath the press report on the raid, was
another press report detailing the Sheriff's announcement of
his bid for re-election.

  I eventually left Bell County, but David Koresh moved in to fill
the void, apparently so that elected law enforcement officials
would not lack for bodies to lay on the scales of electoral justice.

  Chasing the Disney Dragon is one way to become comfortably numb.
