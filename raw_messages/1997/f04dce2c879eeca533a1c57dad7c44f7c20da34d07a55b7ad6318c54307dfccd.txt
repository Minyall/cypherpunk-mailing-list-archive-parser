First off they did not lie in wait for anyone. They were in their home not
bothering anyone. You make it seem like they were in the bushes on the
side of the road and ambushed a peasefull group of BATF agents on their
way to a sunday picnic. The local police had been out to the Waco compound
several times without incedent. There was no reason to suspect that
another vist would have gone any different. Instead the BATF went in there
like an invading army with guns blazing and rightfully got their asses
handed to them.

Last time I looked (horror of horrors) guns are still *LEGAL* in this
country. As far as child abuse there was no evidence of this other than
the word of 1 disgruntaled former member of their group. Even if the
*local* police felt that this complaint warented investigation all that
was called for was a vist by a Human Services Case Worker not a military
invasion.

All this aside I guess you feel that the Feds should be able to wage
military campains against its citizens just on unsbstantiated rummors. Gee
where did I put that quarter? Perhaps I should call the BATF and give them
YOUR address. It would be intresting to see how much you love their
gestopo tatics when it's your house being riddled with bullets.
