Adam,

the answer is that it happens because of my spam filter for cypherpunks.

you would not believe how much spam it catches... and bogus mailing
lists that cypherpunks were sub-scri-bed to...

the theory behind it is that if something was not sent to cypherpunks
explicitly, it most likely does not belong there.

naturally, I DO forward all stuff that belongs there to the list.

igor
