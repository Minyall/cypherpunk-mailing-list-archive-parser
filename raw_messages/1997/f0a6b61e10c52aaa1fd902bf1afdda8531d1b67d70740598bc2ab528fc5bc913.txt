Today on TV, I saw an advertisement.

Image:	Two ships exchanging searchlight-type signals.

Voiceover:
	It's common sense, really.
	You should be able to communicate with anyone
	without worring about the security of your communications.

	Sprint PCS. Secure digital communications.

It's nice to see that a large multinational corporation is
publicly expousing cypherpunk attitudes.

(The reality of their phones is not as encouraging, but...)
