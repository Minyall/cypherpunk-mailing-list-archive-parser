I was cleaning up my HD when I came across a 43 page PowerPoint presentation by Carlo Kopp called "The E-bomb - A Weapon of Electrical Mass Destruction."  It contains a good amount of technology, use and threat assessment data for this sort of EW device.  Very professional.  It was given at IWC-V 1996.  A good candidate for amateur experimentation ;-)

A little alta-vista search brought up Kopp's home page (with links to the above paper) and a wealth of related material, in particular http://www.au.af.mil/au/2025, the Austrailian Air Forces Year 2025 look in to the future,  with a link to http://www.xp.hq.af.mil/xpx, the US Air Force's Strategic Planning Directorate. Very good IW reading.
