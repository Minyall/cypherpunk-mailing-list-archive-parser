As a filtering service, it would be great, though most of the duplicates
I see are articles posted on one or more of (cypherpunks, coderpunks,
cryptography), and I'd see a few more dups if I read alt.cypherpunks
regularly.

On the other hand, one of the reasons we have multiple list servers
is to reduce the risk of a single cypherpunks list site dying again
(as well as just the effect of several people volunteering at once.)
A filter site is a single point of failure, though it's a less serious
failure if there are still multiple lists feeding it.
If the filter can set the headers appropriately so that the
author and originating-list information still works, 
then it matters even less if it goes down.
