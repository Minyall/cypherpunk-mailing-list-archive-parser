I share and/or swap my email accounts with others on a 
regular basis, particularly at times when I can verify
I was somewhere other than where the account was logged
onto.
I do the same with non-essential crypto keys, etc.

This sharing, in many legal jurisdictions, turns your
accounts into a 'public street', so to speak, meaning
that any 'tracks' left behind don't necessarily lead 
to your own doorstep in a legalistic sense.

A word of caution: If you don't have access to *good*
legal services, the above methods may work against you,
if push comes to shove.
