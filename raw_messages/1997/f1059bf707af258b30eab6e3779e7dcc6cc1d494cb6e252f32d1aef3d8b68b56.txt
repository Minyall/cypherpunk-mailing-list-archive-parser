If all mail relays were either limited to sending to or from their
domains, and had a settable quota on Bcc: it would go a long way.  Since
mailers are high in Bcc, they could get a large quota.

I don't think spammers now send 500 discrete messages, especially long
ones, merely Bcc: 500 people.
