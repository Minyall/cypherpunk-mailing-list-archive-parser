NYT reports today on the State Department's new 
"1996 Patterns of Global Terrorism:"

   "By the State Department's definition, nations cannot
   commit terrorism, only "subnational groups or
   clandestine agents" who carry out "politically
   motivated violence" against innocents. If a nation's
   air force bombs civilians that is not terrorism; if
   civilians blow up a plane, it is."
