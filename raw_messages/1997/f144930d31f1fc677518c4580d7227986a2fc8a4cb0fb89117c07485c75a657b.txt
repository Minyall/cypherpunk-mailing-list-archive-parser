You are far from being the victim of anything.  If anything you're a big 
huge thug who spams the list, posts racist flames, posts homophobic 
flames, uses social engineering to find out info on his "enemies" and 
then posts that info online with requests that others send flames to that 
person's employers.

These are plain facts, and if anyone wants to verify them, all they need 
do is a net search on the word "Vulis"

Your only reason for bitching here is that your glorious spams will no 
longer be posted to the list which you've been kicked off of for abuse, 
and continue to abuse.
