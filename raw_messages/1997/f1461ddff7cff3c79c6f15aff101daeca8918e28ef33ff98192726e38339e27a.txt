Welfare does indeed seem to be a thriving niche.

We get to see how well the welfare recipient adapts.  Guess we get
some real life evolutionary pressures :-)

However, I think that western countries are rich enough that there's
not really much danger of anyone starving to death.  Most of the
welfare recipients could find sufficient employment to feed themselves
if they had no other choice.

Yeah, I'm not trying to be insensitive.  I know how to work systems
just as well as any other.  Clearly plenty of intelligent people can
make a decision to work the welfare system to their financial
advantage.

My claim was that the average welfare recipient is less intelligent
than the average non-welfare recipient.  There will be plenty of
counter examples, lazy people, people who have more interesting things
to do than work, and are happy enough with the adequate lifestyle
welfare brings.

It does seem unfair however for those who could easily obtain work to
live from the indirectly stolen assetts of those who are working for a
living.
