The ban on alcohol went away, why not the ban on drugs?  It won't even
require a constitutional amendment.  Are you being sarcastic or agreeing
with me?

In any case, the analogy between crypto and drugs is interesting. Perhaps
after the ban many people will obtain their crypto and crypto-related
services from organized crime.
