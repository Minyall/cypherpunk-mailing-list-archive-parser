As I recall your point, it was that most people are a few weeks away from
running out of money and hence cannot change jobs readily. I was saying
that a small amount of self-discipline and sacrifice can quite easily
translate into having a few _months'_ worth of savings.

Granted, this takes discipline, to put money away instead of spending it.
But even minimum wage workers are quite capable of saving...this is how
many move out of minimum wage jobs into running their own small shops or
businesses. Examples are legion.

If they won't make these spending tradeoffs and have not even a buffer
sufficient to carry them through a month or two or three, I say screw them.

I won't support restrictions on what a company may do, when perfectly
legal, just because Joe Sixpack spent his paycheck on beer and is now
afraid to look for a job with a better company. Or because Rawandala Brown
spent her money on crack and now is "trapped" in a job.

The Mormons teach self-reliance, and savings. So do other religions and
belief systems. Many of them urge their followers to have money put aside
for just these kinds of situations.

As I said, even minimum wage workers have a proven ability to save. If they
won't, this is there problem. "The Grasshopper and the Ant" is far more
important for children to read and internalize the lessons of than the
currently-popular "I Have Two Mommies" crapola.

Don't you mean, in your world view:

If success is outlawed, only failures will succeed.


(I urge you to think about how your criticisms of the free market fit this
aphorism.)
