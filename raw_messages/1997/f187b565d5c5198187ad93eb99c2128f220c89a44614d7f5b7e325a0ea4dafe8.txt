I do not think that it is entirely impossible either, but the likely
scenario is that the government may first try to harass us and attempt
the criminal charges only after some time.

In any case, the present structure of cypherpunks list is entirely
unacceptable. We have only three working nodes. This is bad since all
of these nodes reside in the US and can be taken out easily.

Besides government raids, we are all too susceptible on things like 
internet providers kicking us out, hard drives failing, and so on.
Theree nodes is not a good redundancy.

I plead foreign cypherpunks to at least establish backup nodes that could
be turned on should anything happen to the US-based ones.
