You made a lot of hay about setting it up, if I recall correctly. If you
didn't know what remailers are, and what they protect, why did you set it
up?

More to the point, do you think anybody is now going to "break anonymity"
to tell you that anon.efga.org allowed them to notify the authorities that
their father was raping their baby sister? Or that it allowed Hamas
supporters to funnel technical information to drive the ZOG government out
of Jerusalem? Or whatever.

And if someone used a remailer to send you accounts of what anon.efga.org
was used for, would you trust these accounts?

Get a clue, man.

An affidavit sounds like a legal statement. If you "need to write an
affidavit explaining why the remailer should not be shut down, " just who
is threatening to shut it down?

Tell them the anon.efga.org remailer is an important conduit for protecting
the secure communications of the Grand Wizards of the Ku Klux Klan, a
Georgia organization. If they balk, ask if the Klan does not have a right
of free speech and security in their papers and homes.

If they don't understand this, shoot them as enemies of the people.
