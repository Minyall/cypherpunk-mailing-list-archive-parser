Actually, these last two words are well-established, at least in some
circles of hackers. "Phranking" is a combination of "Phrack" and
"franking," and is the hacking of digital postage systems.

"Cryptomography" is a chiefly British term, and refers to the combination
of cryptography, chromatography, and mammography. The intended meaning
should be clear from this. (Hint: think of disappearing writing and getting
your tits in a wringer.)
