Yes, it's the very same Bimbo who scuttled Gary Hart's campaign, and then
parlayed that notoriety into a modeling contract.. Mind you, I'm
all for Bimbos knocking dipshit hypocrites out of the running for a 
presidential nomination, but the idea of having this "party girl" try to 
police the content of my beloved internet really pisses me off.

She made money in the past wiggling her tits for the camera, and again,
I'm all for bimbos making money wiggling for cameras, but when she tries
to tell me what I should or shouldn't be able to see, my reply *must* be:

	Fuck you, you hypocritical, ignorant, little slut.

I am also going to take issue with her trysting with a married man.  I wish
Hart's wife had verbally beaten the living shit out of her.

Obligatory Crypto Policy reference: Why couldn't she have scuttled 
Feurher Clinton's career, instead?
