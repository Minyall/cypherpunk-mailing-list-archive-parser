NorTel isn't exactly Canada's phone company.  NorTel manufactures 
telecom equipment.  It is however 51% owned by BCE, which owns 
or has controlling interest in Bell Canada and several of the regional 
carriers as well a huge mess of other telco stuff.

ISDN is available fairly widely in my area of the country, but I'm
not aware of an commercially available ADSL  UUNET Canada
has been conducting ADSL trials in a couple of cities, but that's
all I've heard of thus far.
