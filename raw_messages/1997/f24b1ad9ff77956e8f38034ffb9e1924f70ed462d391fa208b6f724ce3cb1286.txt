I must side with Declan here, true, sometimes Declans articles show a 
subtle hint of insiderism <tm>, but I believe that is an inevitable 
consequence of working around people in D.C. who don`t want to be 
directly associated with certain statements, to quote them against their 
will would be journalistic suicide and would soon see Declan with no 
contacts whatsoever. 

Also, although his articles are often written to be readable by the 
uninformed rather than security experts or cryptographers they often 
raise important points. Remember, although through Declan and John Young 
we have a lot of current news posts coming on to the list the average AOL 
account owning newbie won`t know about these things and reading some of 
Declans articles might just get them thinking.
