Without answering any of the points raised by Wei Dai, let
me address the subject line.

I have been a long time reader of and occasional contributor to
the cypherpunks list. Since it is high volume, I prefer not to have
it show up in my mailbox, but read it from either nntp.hks.net or
infinity.nus.sg/cypherpunks. With the recent change in status of the
list, what I get at those two places is the edited list. The same
would apply to other sublists subscribed to cypherpunks@toad.com too.
If hks and infinity started archiving the unedited list, this wouldn't
bother me so much.

Other than that, I am saddened, as much as a Tim is enraged, that
a supposedly libertarian and anarchistic group of people has decided
that censorship is the right solution to their problems.

Btw, what is with nntp.hks.net? Seems to have been down for couple
of days.
