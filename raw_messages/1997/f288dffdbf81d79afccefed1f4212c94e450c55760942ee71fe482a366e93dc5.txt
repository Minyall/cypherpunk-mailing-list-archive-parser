I have always had a healthy fear of the alphabet soup "cyber rights" 
(never trust anyone who calls a lot of wires, routers and telephone lines 
"cyberspace") groups, but what turned me against the EFF in particular 
was the way in which their obvious support for their main source of 
funding (ie. coporate groups and interests) turned them against their 
public, they sold out, and they sold their members out. Of course the 
Gilmore <spit> incident convinced me even more.

The term liar after cabal is an unnecesary redundancy. All cabal members 
are censorous liars, but what`s new...
