The "us" I mentioned did not refer to the freedom knights, but "those

It is our ability to act as ourselves, freely and of our own choosing,
that is the greatest gift to mankind; my Creator, the sole being in the
universe who legitimately had power over me, gave me that power freely
in order to enable me to become what I am.                  -- Russ Allbery
