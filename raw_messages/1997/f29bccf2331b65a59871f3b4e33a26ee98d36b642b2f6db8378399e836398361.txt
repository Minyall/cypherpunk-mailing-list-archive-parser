Well IMNSHO hashcahs mail sucks!! It opens up the pandora's box of usage
based charges for everything done on the 'net. What will be next? FTP
sites charging hashcash for DL's? WebPages charging hashcash per hit? DNS
servers charging per lookup? Routers charging per packet?

Note: In Adams proposal for hashcash only charges the user CPU cycles. The
incentive for wide implementation of hashcash is going to be a real ecash
based system where the implementors can make $$$ off it.

All this talk of "educating" the user is scary. After the newspeak
translation: "Lets condition the sheeple to accept a metered rate Internet
even though they don't want it".

Hashcash is an evil worse than a 1000 Spamfords. I will not support
Hashcash now or in the future and will do my best to stop its spread. As a
matter of fact I plan on writtin Declan on this personaly. I also plan to
form a coalition to block any adoption of hashcash within the IETF. Hmmmmm
sounds like a good BOF for LA :)

This crap will do nothing but place an unnecessary burdon on users while
doing *nothing* to stop SPAM.

I have *PAID IN FULL* for my Inet usage!! What bits I send over the Inet,
how many bits I send, and who I send them to is NO ONE's BUSINESS but my
own!!! -- Last Anarchist of the Inet.
