I called Bliley and Dingell, their offices are saying there is no
dedicated 'staffer' on encryption, that its all being handled by
Commerce Committee staff, both offices forwarded my call to the same
Commerce staff person. The staff person says that right now there are
no amendments formally being considered. That Oxley/Manton is just
talk for the moment. Anyway I spoke my piece and said I encouraged the
congressman to resist any amendments to HR695. He thanked me and said
goodbye.
