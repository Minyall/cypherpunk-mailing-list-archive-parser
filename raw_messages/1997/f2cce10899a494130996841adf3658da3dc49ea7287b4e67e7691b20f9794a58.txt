The "Geigerburg text" referring to William H. Geiger XIV's request
that InfoWar submissions be in text rather than HTML.

Mime, HTML, Acrobat, microsoft word, uuencode, PGP armored etc. is not
generally suitable for mailing lists.

I wonder how many people actually are using something which will
display HTML correctly.

Oh yeah, and the cypherpunks list is _not_ at "toad.com".
