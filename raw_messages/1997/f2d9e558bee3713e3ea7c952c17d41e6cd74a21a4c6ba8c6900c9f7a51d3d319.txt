There is a pgpmail45.exe at ftp.hacktic.nl/pub/replay/pub/incoming.
The file has an md5 sum of 'ffd56d7647c30152a5c9fe7616a3d9ef'.
Could somebody who bought the software check that this is the same
file.

It is presumably free for use outside of North America, since PGP
Inc. can't be expected to accept payment from foreigners... :-)
