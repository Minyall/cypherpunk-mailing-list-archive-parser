I spoke briefly this afternoon with Kelly Miller, the
clerk of the district court handling Jim's case.

She said that the USA, Jim and Jim's attorney agreed
to waive (extend) the deadline for speedy indictment 
so that additional material could be assembled by all 
parties.

And that no action will be taken until on or about June
30; Jim will remain in jail until then.

Jim's attorney, Peter Avenia, confirmed this but would 
not comment further except in answer to my question 
about getting in touch with Jim said that he had advised 
Jim not to make statements to anyone.
