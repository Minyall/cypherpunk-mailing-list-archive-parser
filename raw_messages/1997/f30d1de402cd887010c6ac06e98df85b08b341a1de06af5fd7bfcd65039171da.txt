MCI RELEASES FREE DENIAL OF SERVICE TRACKER SECURITY TOOL
MCI has released an interesting piece of software called the Denial of
Service Tracker (DoS). The security program helps track the source of
denial of service attacks, which aim to overload a target computer system
to the point that it's unusable for anything else. According to MCU, the
DoS Tracker works against SYN, ICMP flood, bandwidth saturation, and
concentrated source attacks, and is currently being modified to detect
other DoS-based attacks, including a new attack called the Smurf. The info,
a free download, and all the technical information is at the site. A must
have for sysops. <http://www.security.mci.net/dostracker>
