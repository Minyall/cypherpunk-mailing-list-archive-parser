The feds say that key escrow is not a single point of failure,
because private keys will be split between arms of the bureaucracy,
and an attacker would have to con three or more independent
agencies or agents to gain access to a key.

Now, running buffer overflows on three machines with dialup accounts
paid for with stolen credit cards and hooked through the payphone in
Cloyne hall seems just as easy as running buffer overflows on one.

Single point may be worse than three points, but one and three seem
almost the same when compared to 250,000,000.
