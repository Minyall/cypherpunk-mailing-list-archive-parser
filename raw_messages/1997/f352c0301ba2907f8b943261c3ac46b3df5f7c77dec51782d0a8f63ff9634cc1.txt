  It seems to me that we now have to take all posts from sameer with a
large grain of salt. Now that he has a vested interest in a security
product all of his posts are just Marketing Propaganda and over
statment. This is wrong when either side of the issue does it (ie. the
claim that strong crypto will only be useful to terrorists rhetoric).

  Personally I'd like to see these posts dissapear from the mailing
list. But of course that is just my own opinion.
