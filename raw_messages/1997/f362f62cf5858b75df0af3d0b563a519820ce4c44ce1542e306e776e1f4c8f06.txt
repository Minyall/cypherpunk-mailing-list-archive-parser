  Nothing personal, shit-for-brains, but this sounds like the 'standard
speech' you have prepared, waiting only for a 'trigger' before you fire
it off...

  I was making reference to the simple fact that 'Caveat Hemptor' still
rules, but does so with the backing of men who can afford to hire thugs
called policemen to back their action.
  My point is that Safeway has every right to bring their competition
to financial ruin, just as Nestle's has every right to give away their
baby formulae for free in impoverished countries, just long enough for
the mother's milk to dry up, at which time their babies die if they
can't afford to buy Nestle's product.
  I reserve the right, however, to whack their sorry asses out if 
I decide that my world will be a better place without their scheming
for their own profit at the expense of those who believe the fairy
tales they tell while planning to buttfuck the people all along.

  The rest of your post is proof that one should not read Ayn Rand
while high on acid, but I'm glad you could get all of that off your
chest, just the same.

  The point I was making, if you care to respond to it once the buzz
wears off, is that the 'playing field' has been twisted so far out of
askew that it is difficult to make any judgements about capitalism
versus socialism, etc., since the world is standing on its head.
  I sincerely doubt that 'capitalists' getting paid 'not to grow' 
cotton/corn/whatever, are a far cry different from the socialists
getting paid 'not to go to work.'

  There are no longer any capitalists or socialists, there are only
people projecting images with political rhetoric and ten-second
sound-bytes.
  I am beginning to think that the *only* way to level the playing
field is with a nuclear grader. (If only I could figure out where 
this damn yellow wire goes...)
