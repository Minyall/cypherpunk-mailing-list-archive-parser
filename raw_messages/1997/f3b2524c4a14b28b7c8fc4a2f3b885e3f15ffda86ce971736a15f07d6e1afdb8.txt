Isn't this the common ploy. "Hey, aren't we the civil liberterians; we were
going to take away _all_ your civil liberties. You should be PLEASED we took
only those we did. Besides, it's for your own good, and will be used _only_
to control those filthy drug-dealing bikers, not the decent citizenry."

What has the reaction been in Canada?
