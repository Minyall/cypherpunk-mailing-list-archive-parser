It is not the only one, however it doesn't run at the toad.com level.

What kind of concealed human involvement?  Running a raw list + a 
moderated list doubles the traffic.  Running a moderated + flames list 
keeps the traffic the same.  What's there to conceal when a flames list 
exists?
 
If your threat model is that paranoid, what's to stop someone now from 
intercepting traffic from toad.com from the sendmail queues?  Mail gets 
sent (typically, not sure about toad) every 15 minutes, that's enough 
time for human interaction.  What's the difference?

Cute, ask a question, then answer it yourself for me?  If there is 
continous traffic, it's because of the flames that are autogenerated.  
There's been a rare day when there has ever been continous traffic.
