This is Sandfart's and Gilmore's trick - substitute a censored list
for the unmoderated one, and hope that no one will notice.

Also a lot "subscribers" to the original list are not real people, but local
redistribution lists, or deamons who post the traffic in local newsgroups or
archive it at various repositories. It would be a good little hack to send a
'who' to majorodomo to get the existing subscribers to cypherpunks,
coderpunks, and cryptography(@c2), and forge a separate "subscribe
cypherpunks-unedited" from each address to majordomo@toad.com. Then let the
ones who don't want duplication unsubscribe from the original list (now
moderated). If someone wants to pull thos off, but needs technical
assistance, please e-mail me offline and I'll explain how to do it.

Of course I can't subscribe to the "unedited" list because the lying
cocksucker John Gilmore (spit) instructed his Majordomo to play dead when it
sees my address.
