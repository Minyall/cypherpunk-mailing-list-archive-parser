  I received an anonymous email giving me the instructions on how to
build a Neutron Bomb which kills all people except those named Dimitri
and leaves all the buildings standing.
  The last few lines of the message were corrupted. On the off chance
that the anonymous sender happens to read the cypherpunks mailing list,
I thought I would post this to let them know they should resend the
message.
