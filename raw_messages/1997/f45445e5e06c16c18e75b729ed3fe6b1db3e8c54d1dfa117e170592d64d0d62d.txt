Yep, I started to write just such an analysis this morning when I saw
Declan's report. But I felt the arguments had already been made, in other
cases, so I never finished the article.

Look, the state-as-employer or the state-as-library has, for ontological
reasons, various rules, conditions, etc. which have nothing to do with the
state-as-sovereign.

If the state-as-employer insists that English be spoken in offices, is this
an infringement of First Amendment rights in even remotely the same way as
if the state-as-sovereign illegalized the speaking of Portugese in Texas
(or anyplace else that was not a state-as-employer office)?

When the state-as-sovereign sets up libraries that don't carry Everything
(hint: and not even the LOC carries everything), then the choices it makes
can be seen by some to be First Amendment violations.

That way lies madness.

A better solution is to get Government out of the business of running
libraries or providing Net access.

Again, I see no clearcut First Amendment issues here.
