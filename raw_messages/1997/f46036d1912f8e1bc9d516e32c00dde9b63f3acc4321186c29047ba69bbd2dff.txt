Which is what any sensible attacker would do anyway.

How about a big dog (living in a doghouse or inside the home) that is
properly trained? I think that it is the best and most sensitive early
warning system.

How about reinforced metal sheet doors? THose are not supposed to be too
expensive and can be made to look pretty.

Are there any legal ramifications (like liability in case of death of
the intruders) if the homeowner gets out of the locked bedroom and shoots
the attackers?

Depends on a safe, really.

My understanding of all this, which is pretty limited, is that safes are
a good idea for storing things when the homeowner is not home or does not
immediately control access to valuable things.

I would never follow any fucking orders from my parents.
