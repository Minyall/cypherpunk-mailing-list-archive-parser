Guilty on all 11 counts, of course. 

Of course, once you eliminate the testimony coerced by holding witnesses
for days and threatening them with the death penalty, the "bomb residue"
invented by the FBI Crime Lab, and numerous other things, nothing even
places the defendent at the site of the explosion, much less proves he was
responsible for it. 

Of course, to have the correct psychological effect on the Sheeple, it is
not necessary that the government convict and execute the prepetrator. 
Killing any government-hating militia-friendly scapegoat will do. 

For extra credit, let's have a pool to predict the number of federal
buildings which will blow up on the day of the execution.
