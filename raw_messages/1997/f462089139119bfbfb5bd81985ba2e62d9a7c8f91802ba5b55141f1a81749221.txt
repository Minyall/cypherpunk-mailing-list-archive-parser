Subject: PGP 5.0 doesn't tell me Which key a message is signed by! [SEVERITY 1]

Yow!  I'm using PGP 5.0, with the PGPtray and the Eudora Plugin,
in a version that appears to be b14c3 for Win95.

When I receive a signed email message, or check with PGPtray,
it tells me the message is from "User <email@foo.com>",
but doesn't tell me it's from KeyID 0x12345678 or the 
fingerprint of the key or anything even vaguely difficult to fake.
Thus, I've signed this message as Phil Zimmermann FAKE <prz@acm.org>,
and if I'd left out the FAKE it would be difficult to tell it
from a real Phil key.  The GUI happily gives me a message box saying
"Good signature from Phil Zimmermann FAKE <prz@acm.org>".

We've been discussing 0xDEADBEEF attacks on Cypherpunks and Coderpunks,
but this appears to be far worse - I hope it's been fixed
for the production version?
