Here is what happens if you are using freeware/personal privacy:

It brings up a dialog box and gives you the option of encrypting to Alice
alone or Alice plus her corporate recovery key. If the "strict" flag is set
on Alice's CMRK and you remove it, we display a dialog box that wags a
finger at you and tells you you're being naughty, but that's it. If you
remove Alice's CMRK from your key ring, it just sends to Alice alone and
doesn't bother you at all.

If this isn't what happens, it's a bug. Tell us, we'll fix it.
