Turn the facetiousness down a notch, Monger-san.  This moron sent death
threats to individuals.  Its stupid that Fed "hate mail" laws inflate
the case, when its already a death-threat case, and its stupid that it gets
press because its the internet, but hey, this is the 90's.

It is pretty reasonable IMHO to hold people responsible for direct threats
when AND ONLY WHEN they can be traced to them (duh).

As for the loser in question, 'fleeing' to Mexico is an short drive from
Irvine,
its not like he actually had to pull some desperado stunts that would have
endangered others.

I'm frankly surprised Machado (or his presumably more intelligent
attorneys) didn't try
to deny sending the messages ("I left my terminal to go potty").  (This may
have to do 
with the technical circumstances of his capture, of which I'm unaware.)
But if the messages
were traceable, I've not yet read a (usually brilliant) <T>Monger rave
wherein you argue
that personal responsibility for threats is a null concept.
