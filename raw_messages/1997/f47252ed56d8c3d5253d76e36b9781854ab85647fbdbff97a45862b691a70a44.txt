Well here's DES... shouldn't be hard to construct a 3DES out of it

How high can you crank up the bit rate?  How about pgp.exe (270k or so
from pgp263)?

Couldn't you sample voices, and use that through a vocoder?  Say one
line of the music was DES above which would come out as a real short
burst... even pgp.exe at 270k wouldn't be that long at stereo CD
quality sample, right?
