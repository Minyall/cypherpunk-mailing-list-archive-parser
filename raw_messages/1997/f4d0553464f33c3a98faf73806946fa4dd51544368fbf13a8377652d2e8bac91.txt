Some argue that things have to get a lot worse before they'll get better.
The media coverups and brainwashing will ensure that it has to get pretty
damn bad before Joe Shmoe is going to notice anything is amiss.  Perhaps to
the stage that he knows a few people who have first hand experience of
family members assasinated by storm-troopers "protecting" them from
themselves.

The BATFuckers are just one symptom.

A few more major BOOMs would accelerate the trend.

But just how bad is bad enough?  As bad as Stalins Russia?  What was it, 1
in 10 assasinated?  What sort of place would this be like to live in when
it gets that bad?  What is the likely replacement system going to be like,
what sort of government is going to arise out of that kind of mess?

Would a similar system fill the power vacuum, or would we be left with a
the desired anarchy.

I wonder.  There might be an argument for just laying low until
cryptoanarchy starves the bloated cancerous growth.
