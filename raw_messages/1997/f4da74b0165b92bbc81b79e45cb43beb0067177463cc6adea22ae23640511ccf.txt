  Zundel's web site contains pointers to the sites of those who disagree
with him. The Holocaust promotion web sites, however, contain pointers
only to sites which are in agreement with their views.
  e.g. - At Zundel's site:
> For relentless Holocaust promotion, on the other hand, contact Nizkor. 
> For another Jewish point of view, contact the Simon Wiesenthal Center (tm) 

  Thus, the Canadian Human Rights Commission's primary goal seems to
be to limit Canadian's access to infomation to only that which is in
alignment with the goals of those holding the reins of power.
