I must object to this.

We at bomberpunks (TM) are getting the real work done. New and intresting
technologies are currently being developed. Also further improvements in
command and control, communications, stragic and tactical planning along
with an increase of "in the field" training with numerious "freedom
fighters" worldwide.

Bomberpunks coming to a "soft target" near you.
