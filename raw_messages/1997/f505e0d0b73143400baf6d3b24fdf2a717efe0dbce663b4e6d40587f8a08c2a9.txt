That's right Phil you can sleep better now that all the evil millitia have
been distroyed. I'm sure you woun't mind when the Constitution is gone
too. Nothing to worry about after all you have Bill Clinton and his
buddies to make sure your safe. They said they would and they would never
lie.

I'm sure if you were in Germany during the 30's that you would have
thought the "Jewish Solution" was a good thing after all the government
said it was. Or perhaps you would have felt more comfortable in Russia at
the same time when Stalin was trying to outdo Hitler in mass murders.
After all it was the government doing the murders so it must be ok. They
said it was and they wouldn't lie would they?

That's ok Phil 1 little white boy will fry in the electric chair. But just
maybe your children will never have to know what it's like to live under a
Hitler or a Stalin because there are some in this country who are willing
to standup to the STATEST in DC who if given the chance will enslave us
all.
