"If all the personal computers in the world - ~260 million computers - were put to work on a single PGP-encrypted message, it would still take an estimated 12 million times the age of the universe, on average, to break a single message."
-- William Crowell, Deputy Director of the National Security Agency, 
testifying before the U.S. Congress on March 20, 1997
