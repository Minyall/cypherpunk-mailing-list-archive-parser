The holidays are upon us...for some it will be a time for getting 
together with friends and family, maybe some heavy drinking of the 
egg nog, and good fun.  For others, this may not be the best holiday 
time because of life's usual difficulties, whether real or imagined.
Don't be depressed and alone--in general, but especially this time of 
year.  Push yourself away from keyboard & monitor for the day (or 
two) and get together with your friends and family.  A special 
greeting and reminder is sent to the paranoids of the list that it 
might do them good to give it a rest, make that special call to the 
psychotherapist to tell them how much you appreciate his/her service 
to humanity, go out and get some fresh, brisk air, and maybe go up to 
a stranger--maybe a fellow militiaman--say howdy, and maybe dare to 
give them a friendly hug.
