>      WASHINGTON (CNN) -- As celebrations begin for Kwanzaa, the
>      30-year-old African-American holiday, some black business owners say
>      they worry the celebration, which emphasizes black self-reliance, is
>      being hijacked by white-owned corporations.
>      
>      "When this holiday came into existence, it was almost a
>      laughingstock," says Magaji Bukar, a gift shop owner. "And now that
>      (retailers) can make some money, now (they) want to be a part of
>      this. We're saying, 'No.'"
>      
>      "This is more than just money. This is culture," he said.
>      
>      Bukar is one of about 1,000 African-American business owners who
>      have launched a letter-writing campaign, demanding that large
>      companies -- including Hallmark Cards and Giant Foods -- stop
>      selling Kwanzaa-related items. They are urging African-Americans to
>      buy Kwanzaa supplies and goods only from black businesses.
>      
>      But not all African-Americans agree. For example, Pamela Rucker of
>      the National Retail Federation says merchants are simply responding
>      to the free market and showing respect for the holiday. Magaji Bukar

>      consumers didn't tell us they wanted Kwanzaa-related products, or
>      other ethnic or culturally-related products, retailers wouldn't
>      stock them."
