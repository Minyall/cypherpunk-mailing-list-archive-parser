Front page:

"Not content to monitor the progrom on your television set, the FCC now
wants to install a vchip in your personal computer -- a move that could
extend the agency's reach into cyberspace...

"Lawmakers said the vchip law was intended only for TV sets..."

"Some question whether this will lead to FCC regulation of the Internet..."

Dave Banisar, Rep. Tauzin, Ed Black make appearances.
