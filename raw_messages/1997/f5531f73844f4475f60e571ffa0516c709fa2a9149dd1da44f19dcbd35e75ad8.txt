Why? All crypto has already been exported. If you're trying to get
Spamford in trouble by blowing the whistle on him for EAR violations, it
won't work. He'll just claim that he wasn't aware of the crypto export
and then he'll shut down that auto responder. It is not illegal to
export crypto unknowingly.

Spend your free time on debugging PGP5 instead.
