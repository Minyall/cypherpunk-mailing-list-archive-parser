Exactly so. Once able to go into the listener's ears, the viewer's
eyeballs, or the customer's whatever, the battle is basically lost.

About the best that can be hoped for is to insert some "almost unnoticeable
mark"--a watermark, a notch filter (a la early scheme for combatting DAT
piracy), etc. And even these "almost unoticeable marks" are easily twiddled
away. Unless they are so noticeable that serious image or sound distortion
occurs when the marks are removed or obscured.

Even purely digital works are easily copied. Even unique IDs per software
piece are easily removed (e.g., by having N customers compare and diff out
the noncommon bits).
