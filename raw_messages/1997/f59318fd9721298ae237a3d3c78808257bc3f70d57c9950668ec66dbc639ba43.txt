So just who is "our main man"? Who are "the starting players"?

Why the coyness? Why tease us with vague mentions of who the main players
are, who the guy who can get Clinton on the phone is, etc.? Either they are
or not (main men, that is). Either you know who they are or you don't.

Don't keep us in suspense.
