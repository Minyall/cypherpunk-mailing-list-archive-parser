I fail to see any reason why you need to filter out "anonymous" email.
I think that restricting anonymous email goes a long way against ability
to discuss important issues in general. I find it overly restrictive and 
unwarranted.

Your explanation as to why you find it necessary to exclude anonymous
postings from your particular newsgroup will be much appreciated.
