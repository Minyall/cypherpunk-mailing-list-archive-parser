	My wife is a pathologist, and she tells me that some of the more
aggressive HMOs get away with paying 15-20% of the posted "official" prices
for procedures and tests.    The difference between what insurance
organizations pay and the nominal price is usually 2 to 3 to 1 for most
things these days.   And for many years Medicare has set defined prices
for medical reimbursement that less than the gold plated bill amount
as well.
