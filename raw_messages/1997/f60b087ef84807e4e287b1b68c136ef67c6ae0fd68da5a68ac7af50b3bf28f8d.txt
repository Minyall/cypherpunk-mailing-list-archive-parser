In 1958, there was an Italian photographer named Tazio Secchiaroli who
discovered that newspapers would pay big money for pictures of "surprised" 
celebrities.  He is best known for a photograph of Egypt's King Farouk
overturning a restaurant table in frustration after being harrassed during
his meal.

When Federico Fellini made his 1960 film, "La Dolce Vita," where Marcello
Mastroianni played a frustrated gossip columnist, he created a
photographer sidekick for him based on Secchiaroli which he named
"Parparazzo" in the film. 

Since then, annoying photographers seeking to intrude upon celebrities and
provoke them into performing for the camera have been referred to as
"Paparazzi."
