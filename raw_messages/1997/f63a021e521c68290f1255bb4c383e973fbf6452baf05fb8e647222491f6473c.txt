Actually, the best signature law proposal I've seen comes from the, so help
me, Massachusetts.

It's a single sentence which says that there will be nothing Massachusetts
law which can be construed to preclude the use of a digital signature.

Double negatives aside, the above translates into legal digital signatures.
Period. No bullshit about "Certification" "Authorities", or what
constitutes a "legal" digital signature, or any other cruft. If you sign a
state, or other, document with a digital signature, then, if it can be
proven to be your signature, you signed it. Game over.

Even broken clocks are right twice a day, I guess. :-).

Now if we can get away from the whole idea of biometric signatures
altogether, that would be the next trick...

Cheers,
