Perhaps we should point out to the media (and everyone else who has 
his ears connected to his brain) that the implementation of GAK will 
make the Cyber Terrorism scenario _inevitable_ not just possible.

After all, if the government's thesis is that the entire commercial 
infrastructure could be cracked by hackers, they should readily 
accept, as a fact, that GAK makes the info terrorist's job easier.  
Those terrorists would simply subvert the access mechanisms to GAK
and gain access to _everyone's_ keys.
