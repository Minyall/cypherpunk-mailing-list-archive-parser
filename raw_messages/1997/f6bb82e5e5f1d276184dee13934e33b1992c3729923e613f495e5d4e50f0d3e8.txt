The American Association for the Advancement of Science filed a rather
good 62-page "brief" arguing that:

    I. The Regulations Violate the First Amendment

    II. The Regulations Violate Equal Protection Applied
    to the Federal Government Through the Fifth Amendment

    III. The Regulations Violate the Privileges and Immunities
    Clause as Applied to the Federal Government under the Fifth
    Amendment by Infringing the Right to Make Use of the Most
    Effective Commercially Available Means of Communication

    IV. The Regulations Violate the Constitutional Right of Privacy.

Their arguments are novel, interesting, and generally well presented.

In addition, the Citadel for Constitutional Government has filed a sixth
amicus brief with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.  We are still pursuing
an online copy of that brief.
