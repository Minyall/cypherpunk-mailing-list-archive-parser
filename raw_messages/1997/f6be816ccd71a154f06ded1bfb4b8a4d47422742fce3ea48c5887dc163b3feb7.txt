But they are not ad hominem attacks on Tim May.  The are my
opinions of some of his arguments.  Even very smart people such
as Tim say poorly thought out or even silly things.

Nor I, Tim's.  Nothing personal, but that's the point.  It is
still possible to conduct ourselves with mutual respect even if 
our views and styles differ.

After reading through Tim's post, I don't think much would be
served by doing another point by point response.  From Tim's
tone, it appears he is still seething about how this all came
about, so I'll just leave our two expressions of opinions where
they were.  I have no wish to exacerbate any hard feelings Tim
may be having.
