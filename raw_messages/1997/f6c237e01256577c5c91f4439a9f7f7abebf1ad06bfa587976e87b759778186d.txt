  This is very true. We now live in a society that expects to be
'protected' from everything, including their own ignorance, by Big
Brother. Free Speech is just that -- free -- and should be accepted as
such. We have various private organizations that have made it their
business to oversee the truthfulness of product advertising and
quality and this is how it should be.

  I believe that we have actually given up some of our free speech
rights in order to be protected against the 'big bad companies looking
to rip you off'. This has resulted in the government making a grab for
more and more of our rights, the building of a buearucratic
infrastructure to support this grab, and a seperate society back there
in Wasington DC.
