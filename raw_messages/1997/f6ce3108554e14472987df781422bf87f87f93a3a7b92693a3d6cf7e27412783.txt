Blanc, you're not getting it.

In the Klintonista kriminal kode, calling someone a "nigger" or even thinking
that some aspects of the "african-american kulture" (drug use, illegitimacy,
violence, unwillingness to work) are "inferior" are far worse krimes than
when a representatives of said kulture takes away your property (at gunpoint
or via taxation/welfare/wealth redistribution). When a black man kills a
white man for calling the black man "nigger", it's justifiable homicide.

Just having racist thoughts, let alone expessing them, is equivalent to
extreme violence. Remember the student who got suspended for a semester
for laughing while singing "We shall overcome"?
