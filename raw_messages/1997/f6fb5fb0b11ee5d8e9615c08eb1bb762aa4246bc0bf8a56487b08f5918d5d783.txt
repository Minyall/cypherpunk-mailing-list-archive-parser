This is revisionist history.  I can't recall any intimation at the
time that any messages were filtered from the unfiltered list.

Obviously I can't say whether _all_ the censored articles came out 
on the unfiltered list.  But I do know that I received at least one 
message from Vulis with an unsubstantiated allegation [of a secret 
backdoor, I think?] in Stronghold on the unfiltered list, as well as
some later complaints from Vulis that Sandy's filtering was unfair
and hypocritical.  Unfortunately I didn't save the original message--
I just wrote it off as the typical Vulis spew.
