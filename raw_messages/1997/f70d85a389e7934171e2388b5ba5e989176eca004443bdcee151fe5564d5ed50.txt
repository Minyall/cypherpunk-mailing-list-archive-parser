Very much depends on how `ISP' is defined.  All my mail now comes in
via UUCP, which is another port (540, I think).  Outgoing mail goes
to another system which is run from a friend's house, and therefore
probably doesn't count as an ISP (again, UUCP).

It certainly _can_ be done.  Almost anything _can_ be done.
Whether it should (and in this case, it shouldn't!) be done is another issue.
