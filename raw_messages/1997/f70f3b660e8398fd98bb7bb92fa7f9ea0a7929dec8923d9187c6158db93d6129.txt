The criminals currently in Wash DC are less discrete about their abuses.
They also have no style. FDR fucked around on Eleanore a lot, but can you
vizualize FDR having his minions fetch a secretary to his office; pulling
down his pants and ordering her to suck him off; and firing her for refusing?

FDR was shit, but Lincoln did much of that and worse.

Amen. And let's not forger the Kennedy Klan: the murderer and bootlegger
Joe Kennedy accummulated lots of $$ via his criminal activities during the
prohibition and figured (correctly) that he could buy political posts for
his kids. Joe kennedy personally murdered more people than Al Capone and
Dillinger (I'm not talking about sending goon squads)

I can't argue with the obvious fact that FDR was a motherfucking dictator and
deserved a bullet in his head the same way Lincoln did. However FDR did not,
as far as I know, sent death squads dressed up as ninjas to murder civilians,
the way Slick Willy did at Waco, Ruby Ridge, et al - possibly just because
FDR didn't have the goons that are now plentiful in the feds' employ.
