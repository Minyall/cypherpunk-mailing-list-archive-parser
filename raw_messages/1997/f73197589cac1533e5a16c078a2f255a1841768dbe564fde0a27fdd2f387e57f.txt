Tim, my question was related to items 2 and 3. I think that Nobuku san
suggested a way to generate a stream of pseudo-random bits from an 
inputted text. The important question is, how Prof. Nobuku is going to
do it exactly. If done right, I believe that his system is great if the
key is never reused.

Is that correct?
