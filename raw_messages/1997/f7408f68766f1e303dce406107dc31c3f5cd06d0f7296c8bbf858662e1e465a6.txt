If I say I doubt this message will make into the "Approved By Sandy" list,
it perhaps will, but my very mention of this may mean Fearless Leader will
then chuck it into his Reject pile, but then....

See "sarcasm." Once again, Sandy flames, but calls it erudition. He uses
sophistry to explain why *his* flames are actually just "corrections".

#Nonsense.  Richard may have read my response on the Unedited list

More pointless sarcasm. This is the stuff Sandy would presumably dump into
his "not fit for True Cypherpunks" pile, except that he wrote it, and so it
is by definition approved.

Utter hypocrisy.

#And wrong yet again.  Not a personal attack but commentary on
#wooly thinking.

Remember children, "If it comes from Sandy and appears to be a flame, it
really isn't. It is just a comment on "woolly thinking.""

#One might read my posts on this point and pay attention.

And I urge our Enlightened Leader to take his own medicine. Stop flaming
the list and calling it mere commentary.
