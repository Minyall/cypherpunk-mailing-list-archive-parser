I have always envisioned Mac users as sitting at their computers and
drawing flowers while they bounce a cute baby on their knee.

Lately, however, I have seen increasing militantism from a wide variety
of Mac users, from the quote above to "MacNuke DC" ranters.
Is this a 'Death of the '60's' thing, or a sign of 'Armageddon'?
