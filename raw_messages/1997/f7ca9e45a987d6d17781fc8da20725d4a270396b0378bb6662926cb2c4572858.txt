Creating chains of hashes lets you do this without having to
do signatures on each piece - you just sign the hash at the end.
So you'd create 
	hash_page_1 = hash( hash(page_1_para_1), hash(page_1_para_2)...)
	hash_final  = hash( hash_page_1, hash_page_2, ... )
	sign( hash_final, signaturekey )
or whatever hierarchy you like, and to demonstrate you've got page_2_para_2
correctly, you provide the hashes for all the page, and the hashes for
all the paragraphs on page 2.

But then Geiger brings out the other important point:
