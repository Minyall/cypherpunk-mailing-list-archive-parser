Why do you think a private key system, even one based on trendy buzzwords
(e,g, "chaos") is interesting?

Do you think means of generating one time pads have been lacking?

As for "his system is great if the key is never reused," think about it.

As Santayana-san put it, each generation which fails to learn the lessons
of cryptography is condemned to reinvent the one time pad, and to give it a
trendy new name (virtual, chaotic, aptical, gaos, etc.).
