But would the goverment under existing law have a right to force
the publisher  to disclose the real identity of the one who wrote the 
inflamatory message to a foreign goverment?
Does the application of bilateral treaties the United States has with 
other countries require dual criminality i.e. child pornography, piracy, 
fraud etc?
 Most speech that would be considered hate speech in Europe would not 
meet the prerequirement of dual criminality.
