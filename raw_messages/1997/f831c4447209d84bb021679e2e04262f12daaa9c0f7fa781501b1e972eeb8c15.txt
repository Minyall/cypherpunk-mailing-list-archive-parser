It's called a "Green Card," popularly.

(Remember those, "Aliens, remember that you must report to the Alien
Landing Terminal every January.")

No court proceeding is needed to deport illegal aliens, save for a
perfunctory classification hearing to determine whether or not they have a
Green Card.

paid for by the taxpayers, to decide that which is patently obvious?
