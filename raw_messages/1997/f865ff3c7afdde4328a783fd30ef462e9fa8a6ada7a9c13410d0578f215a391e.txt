Doh -- I thought my dataset included everything, but it instead just
covers every article I can think of between:

and the present.  I'm also feeling tempted to incorporate the archives of
some of the offshoot mailing lists, like coderpunks, etc.  

Does anyone know of a good source for the messages before that one?  How
many were there, approximately?  If there are a bunch of them and you can
merge them with mine, I'll be happy to send you a cd of the result.

If enough people want to buy CDs of the data, I'll set up an order page,
establish pricing, etc.  Right now, for me to make a CD requires buying
media and doing it at the media lab, unless I buy a drive, so the cost
is somewhat dependent upon how many people are interested.  If someone wants
to use corporate or government money to overpay for a cd so I can buy
a cd-r writer and make it cheaper for everyone else, I'll think fondly of
whatever organization you represent :)  

Utterly ignoring the copyright issues in the interest of getting wide
dispersal, especially since it's unlikely anyone cares since no one will
get rich selling cypherpunks cd-roms,

(the last time I wished for something in parenthetical postscript it worked.
Wish granting service, will you please make the people of the world 
clueful enough to replace governmental/military force with cryptography?  Or
convince one of my professors that they should sign a blank thesis?)
