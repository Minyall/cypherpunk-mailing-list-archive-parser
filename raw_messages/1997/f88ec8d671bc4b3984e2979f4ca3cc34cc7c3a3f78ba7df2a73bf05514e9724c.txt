Sup, It's Kevlar.
I posted earlier about the "new" encryption method.
It occured to me if you assign the "MAC"'s to computers

and make a simple router 
(some transistors to act at "signaler" lines, one way of corse, so 3 a
computer, A few ic's, hardware, and a power supply, ($75)), 

You have the makings for a basic network. Isn't that allready pattented?

Hope I made somebody think for a second. I know I concidered this notion
quiet a bit.
