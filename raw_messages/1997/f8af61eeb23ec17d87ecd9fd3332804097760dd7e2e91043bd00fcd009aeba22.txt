Spoken like a man who *hasn't* seen the FLIRT (Forward Looking InfraRed 
Television) tapes that show the characteristic signatures of ingoing
automatic 
weapons fire.  Even the Washington Post was "troubled."

Spoken like a man who thinks that if some Federal Government somewhere tries 
to knock buildings down with tanks and releases massive quantities of tear
gas 
(admitted by the Federales), it has absolutely no responsibility whatsoever 
for whatever follows.  It was just an innocent bystander.  All this after an 
armed assault on a private dwelling.

I'll have to try that some time with the Jacob K. Javits Federal Office 
building in lower Manhatten.  I know I can count on you to defend me by
saying 
that even though I hit the place with 20 or 30 heavily-armed troopies and
then 
knocked a few walls down with tanks and filled the building with tear gas, 
nothing that happened there was my fault.

Gee!  Too bad about those Jews.  They accidently wandered out into the middle 
of Poland and committed suicide all 6 million of them.  Religious fanaticism 
can be dangerous.

So who did they shoot in advance of the BATF attack?

There are currently hundreds of "compounds" (probably thousands) in America 
that have more firearms and people than existed at Mt. Carmel (80 people.
One 
gun per person).  There are millions of households in America (some on this 
list) that have *many* more guns per person (20x) than the residents of 
Koresh's religious community had.

The Feds could have done in 1993 what they've done since (Koresh wasn't the 
only one who got burned there) and LEAVE PEACEFUL PEOPLE ALONE.

We pay them to be PEACE officers not WAR officers.  WAR officers we reserve 
for foreigners (and Hispanic teenagers herding their goats on their own land 
and plinking with DANGEROUS .22 assault rifles too near the Mexican border).
