I wonder how Sandy will take the vote on continuing or abandoning
the moderation experiment?

In most states, one juror out of 12 can kill a conviction.

In a revolution such as U.S. 1776, only a tiny percent of the people
supported the revolution.

Will Sandy go with a majority decision (pure democratic), or allow
the moderation to go away if a significant minority wants to kill it?
