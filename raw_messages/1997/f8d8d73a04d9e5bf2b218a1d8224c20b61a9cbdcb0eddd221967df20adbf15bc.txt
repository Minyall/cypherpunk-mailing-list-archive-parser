Move all accounts that use corporate secured email to a secure local
server (e.g. per office), and do something like a procmail recipe that
will decrypt automatically and forward the plaintext to the recipient
(archiving as per policy).  If the messages need security, then they don't
leave the secured server and the accounts are such that I can't read other
people's mail directory and others can read mine.  All the keys are
generated and maintained on this server so passwords are controlled by
the administrator.

Or just have them use the encryption within the corporate standard word
processor, and spend the $100 or so for the 5-second cracking program.

You can automate security to prevent user's not following procedure
(saving encrypted files).  You can't do much about malice or creativity
(e.g. my PGP on my laptop).
