There were 3 lists:

cypherpunks-unedited		(everything)
cypherpunks			(moderated by Sandy)
cypherpunks-flames		(the stuff Sandy rejected) 

At the time I was subscribed to cypherpunks and cypherpunks-flames in
the belief that this would result in getting everything, and save the
bandwidth of subscribing to all 3, but allow me to tell what was
rejected.

I didn't see the censored post at all.  This means at least that Sandy
didn't post it to either of cypherpunks or cypherpunks-flames.  This
is consistent with his later admission that he considered Dimitri's
comments on Stronghold security as a conflict of interests for him to
post, as he was manually posting to both of those lists.

Unfortunately I wasn't on cypherpunks-unedited at the time, but I
thought that it was immediate send out from toad.com without going via
Sandy.
