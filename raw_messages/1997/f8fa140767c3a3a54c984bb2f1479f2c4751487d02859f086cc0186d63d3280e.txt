  This interplay between C2Net schills and MIT schills is getting more
than a little boring.
  We always seem to have the same actors involved in the attacks on the
cypherpunks. First, lightweights like Kent Crispin post some dribble
before the 'event' takes place. After the 'event', the heavyweight
disinfo artists like Hallam-Baker step forward with their bullshit.
  Then their bum-buddy "cheers" Bob Hettinga forwards their posts from
other lists to try to give them the appearance of respectability.

  Bullshit is bullshit, no matter how much these characters stroke
each other's cocks.
