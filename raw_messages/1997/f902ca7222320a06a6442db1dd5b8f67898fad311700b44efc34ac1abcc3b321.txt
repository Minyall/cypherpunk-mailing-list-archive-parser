A specific statement of what constitutes "flames, insults" and etc. might
be a good idea.

How will borderline posts be dealt with?  Posts that contain a great deal
of content and thoughful discussion and still manage to contain flames?

Will flames be an automatic boot for a post (zero tolerance), or will they
be balanced against post content?

What is the threshold which, for example, constitutes an "insult" ?

"Louis Freeh couldn't identify a directed well managed crypto policy if it
bit him on his pimple speckled ass."

"You are so turned around on this issue one is prompted to wonder if you
have any background in higher education at all."

"For the new members of the list, [insert list member here] has a history
of posting idiotic and useless posts, and generally wasting the list's
time like an asshole."

All of the above?  None of the above?

Excellent idea.

I believe the "flames" list should be maintained as long as possible.
Continuing checks on the moderator (whoever it may be) are necessary and
appropriate.  What better way than to directly provide a means to identify
what the moderator has excluded?

(Also, if the flames and non flames lists are maintained, how is this more
bandwidth than the former condition where both flames and nonflames will
posted together?  In fact, if this has a deterant effect on flames (one of
the main reasons for instituting the policy) the bandwidth should be less.
Its only more bandwidth if the unmoderated list is maintained.

Perhaps the unmoderated list should be eliminated, as subscribing to both
the flames and the non-flames will have the same net effect...?

A diversity of moderators makes a detailed stated policy on moderation an
absolute must.

Excellent until the flames list is eliminated.
