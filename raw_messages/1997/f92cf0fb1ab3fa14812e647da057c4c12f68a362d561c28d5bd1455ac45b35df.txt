RSAREF limits the size of the key being generated to 1024 bits.  RSADSI
permitted PGP to distribute a slightly altered version that supports keys up
to 2048 bits with the U.S. version.  2.6.3 does not have the altered RSAREF
code, so the U.S. version cannot use keys larger than 1024 bits (unless, of
course, one uses the rsaref library distributed with 2.6.2).
