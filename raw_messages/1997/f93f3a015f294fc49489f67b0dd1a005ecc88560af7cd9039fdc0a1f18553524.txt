Chaos may be generated with dripping water faucets, with alpha particle
emissions,  with Johnson noise.

It matters not, though, as schemes like this are dependent on key exchange,
and by repeatability of whatever "chaotic process" they employ.

They can be ignored.

The fact that "Nobuki Nakatuji" only appeared on our list days before the
revealing of his profound new breakthrough is telling. And all too
predictable.
