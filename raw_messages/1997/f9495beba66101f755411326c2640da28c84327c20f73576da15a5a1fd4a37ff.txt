Hmm, as usual, you make a good point. The uses I was thinking of were the
kind of uses that people have suggested as reasons for CMR; emailing orders,
etc to companies. Today I rarely do that because telephoning companies is
much easier, and in the future I'd expect to be sending most of them over
the Web rather than by email. I presume these *are* the kind of uses that
PGP Inc are expecting, since their system seems to have no other value 
except as snoopware.

Yep, which is basically what I was suggesting. The user chooses which key 
to use based on their perception of the sensitivity of the message, not 
the enforced company policy. If it's confidential, it's confidential; if
the company think I'm up to no good they can come around and force me to 
decrypt a particular message, or sack me if I refuse. Their call.

Ditto, at least if it's PGP's current 'mandatory voluntary' snoopware 
design. I won't be running any version of PGP which includes this 
'feature' in its current form; I would also suggest that we boycott any 
scanning and proofreading efforts for future versions of PGP which include
this code, or remove it from the source before release. If PGP's commercial
customers lose business as a result, that's their choice.
