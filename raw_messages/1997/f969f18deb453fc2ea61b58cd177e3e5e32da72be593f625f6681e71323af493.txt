Netscape wants money for one of their products. I won't give them money. "I
don't bargain with terrorists."


(What the Danes offered was a straight buiness deal, albeit made weirder
and more frantic by the constraints of time, publicity, and worldwide
attention. Still a business deal, though. When Collabra wanted X dollars to
be acquired by Netscape, was this also "terrorism"? The term "terrorist"
hardly applies in business deals.)
