  As in "Make $$$Money$$$ fast?
  Does putting on a suit and writing 'executive-oriented' postings in a
pompous, pretentious manner raise this type of posting above the level
of ordinary UCE/Spam?
  I don't think so.

  Does moderation mean that UCE postings that promise 'champagne and
caviar' are acceptable, while 'crackers and cheese' post-conference
promises are 'spam'?
  Will 'Subject: Consumer Platform / Make $$$Money Fast' be an 
'acceptable' heading, whereas 'Subject: Make $$$Money Fast / Consumer
Platform' is 'not acceptable'?

(I've got some fine suits, thank you very much. I wear them at weddings,
funerals, and whenever I want to 'screw' somebody.)
