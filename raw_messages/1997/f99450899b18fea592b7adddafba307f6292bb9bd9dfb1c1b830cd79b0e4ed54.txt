I mentioned in a private e-mail to Igor that the though of "10 years w/o
correspondence" occured to me too.  That what a great-grandfather of mine
got.  As for DARE, it reminds me of the great Soviet hero - Pavlik (Paul)
Morozov, a 13-year-old boy who grew up in a small village in the northern
Ural mountains. One day the Soviets decided to force all the peasants to
join a collective farm by confiscating their food and causing an artificial
famine[1]. Pavlik's father buried some grain hoping to feed hid family.
Pavlik squealed on his father, who was shot. Pavlik's grandfather later
killed Pavlik with an axe. The Soviets then shot the grandfather and
a bunch of other villagers, and made Pavlik a great hero worthy of
emulation by all Soviet children.

[1] Interesting enough, anyone in the U.S. who expressed the opinion in
the 1930's that there's a famine going on in Russia, or that the public
confessions made at the show trials might be questionable, was branded
a fascist by the new York Times crowd and was likely to lose his job.
