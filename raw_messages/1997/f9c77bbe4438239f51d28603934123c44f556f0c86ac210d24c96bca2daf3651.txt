So CDT, a few questions:

1)  "The Center for Democracy and Technology, meanwhile, is
supposed to debut a Web page that would give parents information on
how and where to get free smut-screening software, Berman said."

Did ya really?  Smut-screening software?

2)  Do you feel that mandatory voluntary net ratings are an 
improvement over the CDA?  If so, why?

3)  Does the statement by the National PTA, a censorious group if
ever there was one, that they favor "voluntary" action give you any
pause?  That is, if your two organizations are on the same side
here, do you ever wonder if these actions are achieving your goals
or theirs?
