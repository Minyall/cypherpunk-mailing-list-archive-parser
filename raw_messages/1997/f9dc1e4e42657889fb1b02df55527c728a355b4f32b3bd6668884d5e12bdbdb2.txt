Ok, tell you what.

Let's post YOUR address, YOUR phone number, and that of YOUR family.
We'll post that information to every newsgroup and mailing list we
can think of.  We'll offer a $50,000 AMERICAN reward for the quick
extermination of you and your family.  And if some kook takes us up
on it, we might even be good enough to warn you.

It's not censorship, you idiot.  The dude who clipped out your post
was trying to keep some fucking psycho from killing somebody else for
some imagined (or not, who knows?) $50k reward.

It's common sense, in other words.

Best wishes and fresh-roasted peanut taste,
The Sheriff. -- ***<REPLY TO: sheriff@speakeasy.org>***
