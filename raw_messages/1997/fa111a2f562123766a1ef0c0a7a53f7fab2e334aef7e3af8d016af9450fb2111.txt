Made in UK, imported into US from UK, and then re-exported.

EAR.  But it was still ITAR at the time.

Nope, I wore it out again (under another garment -- concealed
munitions).  Had another one in my luggage which they searched.  My
luggage was searched on the way in and on the way out, and lots of
nosy questions were asked too.  Walked straight through both times in
the UK.

There are I think a number of US people who have worn them through US
borders.  Perhaps we should collectively turn ourselves in and demand
they enforce the law.
