 I agree. Next thing you know, we will be receiving our messages from
the socialist CDDR list.
  I put a lot of thought, time and effort into my posts, and I resent
having to share them with the lurkers who add nothing to the list.
  From now on I will be sending my posts to the list only to myself.
