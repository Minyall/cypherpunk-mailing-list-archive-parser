A "public announcement" by the proven liars at C2 doesn't constitute a
release from liability and wouldn't do much, legally, to protect Vulis
from harrassment lawsuits. C2 can turn around and sue Vulis anyway.

If someone other than Vulis (me, for instance) published the Stronghold
backdoor (widely known by now) via an anonymous remailer, then Sameer
Parekh could still sue Vulis for having discovered it first, or to
"make example" of him, and to intidimate other security experts who
are aware of Stronghold's many holes.

For example, Sandy Sandfort, Parekh's marketing director, wrote to Vulis:

}       ... we'll slap a libel suit across your emigrant ass, take back
}your green card, deport you and tell Russia that you called Yeltsin a
}cocksucker ...

C2 is obviously deperate to suppress the information that's already known to
an increasing number of people in the field. Their threats against Vulis may
be one of the reasons why none of the security experts, who confirmed the
presense of serious security flaws in Stronghold, are saying much about this.
