Russian roulette was invented by the Russian poem Lermontov, who
also had some unkind things to say abotu Armenians (sorry, Ray).

What about "Russian leather" and "black Russian"?

"Please not to use Russian leather when binding books".

Or is it, "Please to use, but to call something vegetarian."

Russians also invented baseball (called "lapta" in Russian).
