Still did last I checked.

   Don't let the old-fashioned look deceive you.  Most mail storage boxes
   use lever tumbler locks (similar to what's used in safe deposit
   vaults, though obviously the mailbox locks have a flimsier plug).

How is that obvious?  Safe deposit locks generally aren't designed to
be hard to open, just hard to open without damage.  There's always
either a guard or a locked vault door protecting the locks.
Mailboxes, on the other hand, generally aren't kept under guard or in
vaults.
