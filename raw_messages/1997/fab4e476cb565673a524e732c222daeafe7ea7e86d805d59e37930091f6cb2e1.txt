My computer went into the shop a few days ago, and I was unable to take 
my PGP keys off it before it went in.  What are the security risks here?  
If the repairman chooses to snoop through the files, what would he be 
able to do with my key pair?  Will I need to revoke the key and make a 
new one, or will I be relatively safe since he doesn't have my 
passphrase?

If you need to know how to set up a mail filter or defend against 
emailbombs, send me a message with the words "get helpfile" (without the 
" marks) in the SUBJECT: header, *NOT THE BODY OF THE MESSAGE!*  I have 
several useful FAQs and documents available.
