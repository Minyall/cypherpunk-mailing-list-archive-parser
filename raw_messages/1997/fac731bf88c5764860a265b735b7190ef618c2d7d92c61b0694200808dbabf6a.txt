Those looking for shorter range, large payload, weapons with small size and low weight should look into shaped-charge munition projectors.  Relatively easy to build and reliable, they can accelerate items to well over 10,000 fps (depending upon explosive used) and pretty accurately deliver multi-kilogram payloads over a 1/2 mile.  Good against buildings and hardened targets, like tanks, as at this velocity even more conventional projectiles can breech advanced armour.  Major shortcoming is they are use once items and not for close combat ;-)
