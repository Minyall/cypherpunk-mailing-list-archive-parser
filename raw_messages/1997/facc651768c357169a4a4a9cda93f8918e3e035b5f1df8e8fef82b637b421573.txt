I don`t believe in copyright in general, but I would be perfectly happy 
to pay a US cpunk to send me a copy of this CD-ROM, *BUT*, physically 
mailing a copy like this is more risky for the US Cpunk. I don`t believe 
in ripping people off, and rarely copy copyrighted material, but I don`t 
hold with copyright laws and see nothing wrong with this being posted.
