This is really encouraging news!  Computers would likely lead to increased 
efficiency in Congress, and *that* isn't in the interests of any of us. 
These folks 
are in the business of taking peoples' life, liberty and property, for fun,
profit, and ideology. Just about anything that slows them down, including
their own mind-numbing stupidity, is a good thing.
