Hmmm.  Aren't such images all over Usenet already?  I think people manage
to find them without Eternity servers delivering them via a handy "point
and click" interface.

I think Eternity server administrators should take a pledge not to censor
content, and simply take servers down if an unacceptable amount of heat is
applied.  Perhaps we need "Eternity Server In A Box", and of course
"Eternity for Windoze '95/NT." 

For now, with only five operating servers, we need to concentrate on
otherwise homeless free speech, and not spend time replicating the Dregs
of Usenet in a new and interesting format.
