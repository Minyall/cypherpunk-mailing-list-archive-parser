You should read the complete article (I provided the URL, after all) before
complaining that I'm somehow not critical enough of Singapore.

PS: I value economic freedom quite highly. Besides, it's part of other
freedoms. Can I publish a political newspaper as easily if my business is
heavily regulated by EEOC and other bureaucrats, and I'm taxed heavily by
still others? What about the economic regulations (like those on banks)
that are used to intrude on our civil liberties? Final point: democracy
isn't all that wonderful by itself. Singapore is a democracy, no? Forget
fetishizing "democracy," already, and give me freedom!
