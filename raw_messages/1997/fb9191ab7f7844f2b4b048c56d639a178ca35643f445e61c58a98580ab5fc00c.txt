In financial, as well as freedoms, cost.

Yup. Like drugs, "intelligence" agencies will also get <ahem>
intimately involved, and then deny it, in a romantic tradition
dating back before language.

A negative part. Tax-spend. Spend-tax.

The real winners will also be in a strange quarter. The Playboys
and Penthouses of this world are concerned about profit, not
morality, but they will be perfectly willing to surreptitiously line
up with the Christian Coalition on this one. Strange bedfellows.
