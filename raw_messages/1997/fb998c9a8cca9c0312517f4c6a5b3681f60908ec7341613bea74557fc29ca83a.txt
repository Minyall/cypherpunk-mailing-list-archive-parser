There are lots of good reasons to use remailers, but thinking that you are
not responsible for your actions is not one of them.  Anything you send
may be around to haunt you for many years to come. 

If you believe that any computer sytem is foolproof... you have a lot to
learn.  There is always a possibility that people will found out your real
identity and where you live, through a human error or a flaw in the
remailer.  (Right, toto?).

There are easier and safer ways:  get some exercise, or check out a porno
site, or go to a rifle range, or write a reply but don't send it.
