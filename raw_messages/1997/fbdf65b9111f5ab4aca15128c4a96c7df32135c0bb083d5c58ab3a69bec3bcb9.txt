A few weeks ago, every message sent to the "cypher punks" was re-sent
again and again and again by "crypto@uhf.wireless.net".  Ray Arachelian
officially blamed me for the mail loop and even complained to my upstream
feed about multiple copies of my articles. Ray's lies were never retracted
by Ray himself or John "cocksucker" Gilmore.

Now root@uhf.wireless.net posts multiple rants in favor of moderation.
