Absolutely, something does not have to be practical to be 
interesting, Igor`s example of Cantors double slash argument (useful 
for example in AI research) is something that seems very abstract 
until we find a use for it, and most abstract mathematical concepts 
and theorems of this kind do eventually come into use by some other 
class of scientists.
