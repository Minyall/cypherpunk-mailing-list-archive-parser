A couple of people have complained of the huge efforts put into
breaking keys, and of the small efforts invested in cypherpunks code
writing of late.

Perhaps there is something to this challenge stuff, in terms of
getting contributors, neatly tabulating results, working up
enthusiasm etc.

So... how about a code writing challenge, an award for the best
cypherpunk project every month.  (No monetary prize, just vote on list
to decide most significant project).

Perhaps a list of how many lines of code.  A hall of fame if you like:

% wc -l `find . -name \*.h -print -o -name \*.c -print`
