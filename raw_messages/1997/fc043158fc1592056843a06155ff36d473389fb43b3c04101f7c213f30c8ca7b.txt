  Anyone notice the court ruling in regard to the company that sued
to retrieve information that was inside an employee's head, claiming
that his employment agreement made *all* of his ideas the property

  Anyone notice that the Thought Judge ruled that the Thought Laws
required the individual to divulge said ideas, or be imprisoned by
the Thought Police?
