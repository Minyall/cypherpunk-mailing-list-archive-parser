There's a provocative list of forbidden CIA and NSA/CSS 
records which are not available under the Privacy Act, and

   http://jya.com/cia-privacy.htm  (82 categories)

  http://jya.com/nsa-privacy.htm  (19 categories)

There are similar lists of national privacy proscriptives for 
most federal agencies available at the source for these. The

the TLAs.
