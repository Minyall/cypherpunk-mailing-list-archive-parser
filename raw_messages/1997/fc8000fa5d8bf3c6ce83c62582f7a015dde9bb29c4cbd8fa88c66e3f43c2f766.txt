I hadn't shopped for a gun in 10 years, and the only high-quality
Colt revolver I knew of then was the Python, which was $675 new
in 1986.  I'm sure the equivalent today would be $1200 or more,
so I thought the Cobra at $475 used was a good deal.  I assume
the Cobra is equivalent to the Python, it sure looks and feels
like it.  If you're familiar with these things, you can tell a
lot just by pulling the trigger and "feeling" the action.
