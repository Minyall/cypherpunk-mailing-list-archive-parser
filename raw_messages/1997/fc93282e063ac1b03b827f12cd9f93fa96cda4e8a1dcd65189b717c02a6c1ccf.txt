After eying the disingenuous CIA letter to Greg, it may be
worth eying disingenuous USG laws on electronic surveillance, 
most of which ostensibly apply to foreign targets but may catch 
US citizens in the global sweep, say, as on Cypherpunks -- 
keep at it, Greg.

We've put some of them on our site today, as listed at:
