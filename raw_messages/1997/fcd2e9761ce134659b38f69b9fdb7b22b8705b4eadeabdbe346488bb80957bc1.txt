Imgis Inc. would like to point out that these libelous accusations
are being made by a sick, twisted individual who has visited over
3,000 pornography sites in the last six months. (68 of them on
Mother's Day!)
Will Rodgers is well known to Imgis Inc. to be a perverted leftist
loser who spends the time he is not busy slandering honest, decent
people such as ourselves, cruising the InterNet in search of 
underage teenage sluts who like long walks in the park, holding
hands under the full moon, AND CROWBARS SHOVED UP THEIR ASS DURING
STRANGE SEXUAL ACTIVITIES WITH FARMYARD BEASTS!
He has AIDS, cancer, and will soon have his health insurance canceled
by one of our biggest clients. He worships the *wrong* God and votes
for the *wrong* political candidates.

Our future projections, based on his past activities, indicate that
he will soon become a drug dealing pornographer and a terrorist
pedophile.
So ask yourself, "Is this the kind of person I want to have shaping
my views about Imgis Inc.'s public service software?"
If your answer is "Yes.", then perhaps we should reveal what we know
about YOU!

Sincerely,
A. Hoir
Janitor,
Imgis Inc.
