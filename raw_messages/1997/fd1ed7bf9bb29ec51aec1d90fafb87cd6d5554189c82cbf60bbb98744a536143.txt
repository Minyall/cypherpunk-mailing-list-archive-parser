  Key escrow is an easy-fix for securing company communications, and I
am sure that it has its place in a situation such as yours, where you
have to baby-sit people who want the full benefits of a technology
that is beyond them.
  The problem, of course, is that, as TV has shown us for years, the
'lowest common denominator' becomes the rule. People will use key 
escrow for things that should actually have uncomprimisable security,
and they will scream bloody murder when it is compromised.

  It wasn't that long ago when I was talking to the CEO of a company
on a plane to Nantucket, and he was boasting about how he encrypted
his files with Pkzip to thwart would-be intruders.
  I decrypted one of his files for him on the trip between the mainland
and Nantucket (you go up, you go down, you're there). He was astounded.
He had told me that his kid was a hacker, so I told him to ask his kid
if he could access his 'protected' files.
  I forgot about the incident, but a few weeks later the guy tracked
me down in Tucson (I had told him the name of my company), and told
me that it took his kid less than a week of scouting around the local
BBS's to find a program to crack Poppa's 'high-security' files.

  Key Escrow, I suppose, is like most other things--a trade-off.
  BTW, I occasionally 'write down' a reference to my passwords, as 
a 'reminder'.
  e.g. - Password / Zappa Concert--1980
         (this reminds me of the password I used, which was
           38-24-37RedHead)
      (sorry, no pictures)
