I know this is probably like preaching to the choir, but
I remember Freeh recently saying that there were no 
significant losses of software exportation to foreign
software companies.

Well he is obviously ignorant or lying through his teeth.

I'm about to recommend a software purchase from a foreign
software company that might exceed #300k.  Is that 
on Freeh's radar yet?

Mind you, I don't care where people get their software, but
if Freeh is trying to calm the America Firsters by saying 
that crypto imports aren't important I think someone is
congress ought to be informed.

Declan?  You're still out there in the pit of vipers.  Why
don't you tell them.  My congressman doesn't seem to listen
to me.
