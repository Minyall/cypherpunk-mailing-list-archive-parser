Actually he recieved those instructions from the great Cthulhu himself 
while channeling the same in a fit of glossalia brought on by a diet 
consisting of way too many cypherpunks message of high spam content.
The fact that the very elder gods themselves have directed the hand of 
John in this matter is a very subtle hint at how silly Vulis is.

Why, the great Nyarlatheotep, the great, mad, blind god at the center of the
universe finds Vulis's constant spams a competitive threat to his quest for
chaos which is why he has asked Cthulu to send his minions at toad.com. 

Ia! Ia!  All hail Cthulu. :)
