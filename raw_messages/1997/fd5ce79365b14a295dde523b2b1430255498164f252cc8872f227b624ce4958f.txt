In Ian Slater's book Showdown such "burst activity" was put to use. In
order to find where the rebel headquarters was located rummors were spread
that the rebel leader was dead. Soon afterwards there was an increase in
radio trafic from the headquarters in an attempt to kill the rummors
thereby giving away their location as the "sudden burst of activity" stood
out like a sore thumb over the normal radio traffic.
