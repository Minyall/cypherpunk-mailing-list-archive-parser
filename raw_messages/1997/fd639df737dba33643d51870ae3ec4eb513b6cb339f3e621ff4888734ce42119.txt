Hi all,

The 9th Circuit  Court of Appeals has set the specific date and time for the
oral argument.  It will be on Monday December 8, 1997 on the 1:30 p.m.
calendar.   It will be held in Courtroom 1.

The 9th Circuit is located at  95 Seventh Street in San Francisco.

There are 5 cases scheduled for the yet-unknown panel.  The first 3 are
limited to 10 min oral arg per side.  The other two (us included) get 20
min per side.

Cases are generally heard in order so as it stands we would be last.

Cindy
