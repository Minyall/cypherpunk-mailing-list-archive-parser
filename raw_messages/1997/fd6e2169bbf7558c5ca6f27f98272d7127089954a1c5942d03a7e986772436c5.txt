It's not a tough sell at all, just a different sell.
Rather than terrorizing businesses about NuclearNarcoPornoChildTerrorists,
you encourage them into supporting Insured Key Management Hierarchies and
Subpoenable Encryption, giving them protection against Intellectual 
Property Bandits at the minor cost of their own security,
so _they_ won't get in the way of terrorizing the public,
because they've got their business cases covered.
				Thanks!
