In a free society, the "poor" have more money (collectively) than the rich 
and outbid them for resources all the time.  Were this not so, communities of 
the "poor" would never increase in size and yet they do.  

It is also much easier for the poor to get money in a free society than for 
the powerless to get power in the sort of societies you favor.

I can teach a poor person in America today the simple ways to triple or 
quadruple his income.  I could not teach a resident of France or Germany or 
Japan a simple way to triple or quadruple his "influence" on his government 
and indeed a tripling of such influence would give him much less than a 
tripling of income.
