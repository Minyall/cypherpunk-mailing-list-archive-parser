Electronic Frontiers Australia has succeeded in obtaining the "Walsh
report", with a few paragraphs excised.

It's available at http://www.efa.org.au/Issues/Crypto/Walsh/.

It is a broad technology and policy review like the US National
Research Council's, though it's more succinct (only a hundred pages
long) and done by a single person, on contract to the Australian
Government.  I recommend reading it.  Here's a sample:

"The review encountered significant scepticism about mandated key
escrow or TTP systems.  The national sovereignty of the agencies
providing these services could not be guaranteed, with consequent
implications for the national interest.  There is the strong
likelihood that these agencies would become the major targets of
foreign intelligence services."
