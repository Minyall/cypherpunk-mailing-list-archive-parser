Well, as I understand it, the problem with the seven bad countries is that US
law generally prohibits any trading with them at all.  You can't sell them
cryptographic software but you also can't sell them a peanut butter and jelly
sandwitch or a rubber band or anything.  The restrictions against them are
based on international policy, not the nature of the articles you want to
trade.
