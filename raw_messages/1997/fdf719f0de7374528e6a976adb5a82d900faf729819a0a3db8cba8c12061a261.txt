<sigh> I can hear the violins playing in the background.

This is no different than shooting a burglar that has broken into your
house and is robbing it. I think that you are missing a basic concept that
it is not their country!! If where they are at is such a miserable
shithole then maybe they should do somthing to fix their country rather
than comming here and attempt to make it yet another miserable shithole.

It is not the fault of America that Mexico is the shithole that it is.
Perhaps if they were to overthrow their corrupt government and replaced it
with one based on freedom (both political and economic) there would be no
need for them to come here in the first place. California, New Mexico,
Arizona, and Texas should not be the release valve for a corrupt Mexican
government so they can continue to rape their country and leave their
citizens in poverty.
