Hi there,

Credit Cards are the universal currency of the Internet, and, if you want to do business online, you need to be able to Accept Visa, Mastercard and American Express cards on your Web site.

Trouble is, many banks won't give merchant status to businesses that are new, home-based or located in cyberspace instead of a real-world storefront or mall.  That's why we're pleased to present a special offer from USConnect, a major merchant account provider that's helping companies like yours get merchant status on the Net.


The benefits include:

* 2% Discount Rate
