If you're worried that someone might find out who is subscribed to the list
by querying some of the majordomos, don't bother.  I already have a list of
all your IP addresses.

Sendmail has a nice feature which checks all the sender or recipient
addresses by doing DNS lookups on them.  My nameserver is watching you. :)


P.S. I'm sure none of you would be foolish enough to use penet-style
remailers which do not encrypt the message headers.
