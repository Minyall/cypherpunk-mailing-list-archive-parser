Well I realy can't see having a bunch of yahoo's shooting off guns in a
crowded park to be a good thing. :) I guess it depends on what one means
by a "park". If we are talking a few acre's of trees and grass in a city
then one really shouldn't be using firearms unless in self defence. If we
are talking "parks" in the sq. mile size that is a different matter.

As far as carrying firearms IMNSHO there should be no restrictions as they
are blatently in violation of the 2nd Admendment.
