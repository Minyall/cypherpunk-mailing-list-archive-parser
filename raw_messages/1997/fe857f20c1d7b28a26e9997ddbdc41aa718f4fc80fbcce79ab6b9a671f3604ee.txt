I think it tells us that Verisign managed to convince the government that
their product is only used for authentication, not encrypting content. 
Which appears currently to be true, no?  And since AFIK (Please, someone,
correct this if I'm wrong!) you can't with netscape anyway download
another party's key that you verify with a Verisign certificate, it would
take a fair amount of work for the ordinary user to set up a secure
channel using the current Verisign infrastructure.   

The ITAR exception for authentication-only products is of long standing.
