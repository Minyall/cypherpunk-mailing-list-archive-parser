That's right. People who are too lazy to drive a fourteen year old
to New Mexico, where they can legally fuck their brains out, should
go to jail for a long, long time.
When I cruise the children's chat lines, I always tell them I would
like to meet them in New Mexico and fuck their brains out. That's
legal.

What I love about the law is that it gives us clear guidelines to
help us recognize the difference between those filthy fucking
child-molesting perverts fucking fourteen year olds in California,
and the decent, upstanding citizens fucking the fourteen year
olds in New Mexico.
