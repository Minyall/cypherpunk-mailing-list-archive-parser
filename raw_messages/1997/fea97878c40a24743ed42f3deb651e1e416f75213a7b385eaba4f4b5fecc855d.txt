I've always regarded it as "We applied for a patent and it hasn't actually
been refused yet, so keep off."

[The following is based on various magazine articles, net discussions etc.]

Until the last year or so (when it harmonised with GATT) US law produced
"submarine patents".  These were patents applied for, subject to a period
of waiting of course, and then (if granted) were valid _from the date of
the application_ i.e. back-dated.  This meant you could quite innocently
find yourself being clobbered by a patent that had only just sprung into
existence.  There were other problems including the US granting patents
to the 'inventor' - rather than the 'first to file'.  'First to file'
is actually a good indication of who the inventor is.  The other scheme
just got inventor-identity disputed by the lawyers.

For a vision of patents as they should be, I know nothing to beat
Phil Karn's web pages.
