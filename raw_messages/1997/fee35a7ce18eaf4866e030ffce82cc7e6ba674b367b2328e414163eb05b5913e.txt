Ya gotta love that Saddam, eh?
Allowing the press to do a photoshoot of all those children who don't
seem to be the child everyone is desparately trying to save by taking
away our basic human rights and freedoms...

I loved watching the western newswoman on TV yesterday, trying to 
explain to the local citizens how the US embargo that was resulting
in the deaths of their children was all Saddam's fault. (Although I
must have missed the part where she explained Saddam's authority to
set US foreign policy.)
I think we should immediately drop-ship a few thousand baby T-shirts
to Iraq that have "I am not _the_ child!" stenciled on them, so that
Americans watching at home don't mistake the starving Iraqian children
for the one that we are saving by allowing our government to monitor
and oppress us.

  Next time you pay your taxes, try to remember that you are just 
following orders...Saddam is evil...those are not _the_ child...you
are only doing what is required by law...Saddam is responsible...you
are just obeying the law...you are just following orders...you don't
put them in the ovens, you just pay for the ovens...you don't turn on
the gas, you just pay for the gas...you are just following orders...
