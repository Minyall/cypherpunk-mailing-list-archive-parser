For simplicity, I suggest posting announcements to alt.cypherpunks.  I
would assume that most people on this list also read alt.cypherpunks.

If each site keeps logs of all messages sent to the list for the last n
number of days, a simple Perl hack would allow the admin of the downed
site to compare logs with another site and send all the unsent messages
to the distribution list.

How would this be different from any other list site?  I don't know for
certain, but it should be the case that each site is subscribed to at
least two other sites for redundancy.  A necessary consequence of not
subscribing to two or more lists is the fact there will be one single
distribution point which could go down at any time.
