The MIT site has a precompiled Linux ELF binary of PGP5. Source is, they say,
coming RSN.

And yes, all versions of PGP5 will, for the time being, break just about all
your old scripts.  Eventually, they'll finish the pgp2 emulator (they claim
it, too, will be out RSN) and most of your old scripts should work again.
