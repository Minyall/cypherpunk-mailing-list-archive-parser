What I meant by this was that the Copyright Cops will only go after those
who illegally copy the items made by big corporations and other friends of
the enforcers. Netscape and Oracle are Friends of Bill, so they'll get
quick attention. Joe Blow will be put on hold.

Even though my article is given a value of $1000 by me (who else?), there
will be no interest whatsover in prosecuting someone for illegally copying
my article.

However, let the cops find some Zip drives or CD-Rs marked "Microsoft
Office" in the home office of someone like me when they finally get around
to raiding my home, and they'll look to see if each and every item has full
receipts (which I don't usually even keep anyway). And they'll look for
more than the _one_ allowed backup, or whatever the law finally says is
permissable...

"Al Capone jailed for violation of the Copyright Act...Ness says the
Copyright Act can be used to get criminals untouchable using ordinary laws."

"Anarchist's home in mountains raided...thousands of dollars worth of
illegally copied articles, files, and CDs found...prosecutors say "three
strikes" law could put anarchist separatist survalist spy May away for life
without the possibility of parole."

And now I need to go mount  that Leupold scope on my new Remington 700 .308
sniper rifle....just the thing to reach out and touch someone.
