   If this is true (and I have no reason to believe it isn't), then why is the
   key escrow code written (although not turned on) in the source code for 5.0
   that was posted internationally from PGP?

Bruce, I understand that you don't like any form of data recovery, but
there is no key escrow in PGP. Perhaps we should talk about this on the phone.
   
   Makes no sense.
