However there are meany peaple that sepearate these things philosphicly.
Any accruate mesurment of a persons polical views must also take this into
account.

I would argue that while the goverement has no right to stick its noise
into who (or what) I am fucking in the priversy of my bedroom [1],  I
would consider its duity to force comperneys to tell me what (or who) that
have put in the meat pie I eat afterwards. 

This would brake your assurtion that everybody beleaves that EF = PF.  For
anouther example there is a very powerfull group called the lyons forum,
this group is very very pro free trade,  however thay where behind the
scrapping of both ethuenasia laws and other laws desined to increase
personal liberty.

So the devide exists out there and any fair measure of politial option
should measure this.

[1] Given the normal proviso of concenting adults.
