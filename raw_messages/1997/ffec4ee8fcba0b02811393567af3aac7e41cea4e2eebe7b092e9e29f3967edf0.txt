  I think that a simple fdisk /mbr should take care of the problem.
The drive is booted from the master boot record. There is no way
around this without a bios change. LILO overwrites the MBR with the
LILO program to boot Linux (and other OSes on the system) so it too
would defeat their software.

  Doesn't sound like too much of a solution when you're dealing with
even a slightly knowledgable thief.
