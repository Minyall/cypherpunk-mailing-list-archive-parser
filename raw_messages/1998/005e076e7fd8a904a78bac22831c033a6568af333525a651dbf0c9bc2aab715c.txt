Crypto Canucks: Hands Off Our Keys! 
                      5:03 am PST 2 Apr 98 - The captains
                      of Canada's cryptography industry sent a
                      message to Ottawa yesterday: keep
                      clear of domestic crypto controls, and
                      lighten up on the export policies. Was
                      anyone listening?
