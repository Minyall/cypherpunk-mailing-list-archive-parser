Try this:

/sbin/route add -net 199.95.207.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 lo
/sbin/route add -net 199.95.208.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 lo

Goodbye doubleclick.net. ... Repeat as necessary with other ad networks.

I wrote an init.d script for Debian GNU/Linux that automagically handles
this for a couple ad networks, if you're intersted.
