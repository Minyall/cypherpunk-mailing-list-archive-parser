Balonely, do your research somewhere beside a bar. JFK had no intention of
sending more troops in and every intention of withdrawing the troops that
were there. There are two sources you can look at to verify this. The first
is the troop count over time and the internal presidential memos to the
Chiefs of Staff. Had JFK not been shot there would have been NO US troops in
Vietnam by the end of '64.

LBJ is the nit-wit who crewed the proverbial pooch.
