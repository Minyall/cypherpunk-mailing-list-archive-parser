You have this backward,

The "Red Book": NCSC-TG-005 "Trusted Network Interpretation of the Trusted
Computer System Evaluation Criteria"

The "Orange Book": DOD 5200.28-STD "DOD Trusted Computer System Evaluation
Criteria"

A NT machine to meet DOD 5200.28 C2 rating needs to be seriously crippled
when comapired to normal operation. No removable media, No Modem, No
Network Connection, hell pluging the dam thing and turning it on probably
puts it's C2 rating in jepordy.

The reason M$ downplays their C2 rating is that in average day to day use
of this OS it does not meet this rating.

NT has never had any RedBook rating and is not certified for use in a
secure network.
