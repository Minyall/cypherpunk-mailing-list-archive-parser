Hi,

Sorry for the downtime but a big (40ft.) tree fell and took out the phone
lines, nearly squished one of my dogs, and had the power lines under some
considerable tension.

If you're receiving this then everything should be back up and operating
normaly. No further downtime is expected.

Now back to your normal bat channel...
