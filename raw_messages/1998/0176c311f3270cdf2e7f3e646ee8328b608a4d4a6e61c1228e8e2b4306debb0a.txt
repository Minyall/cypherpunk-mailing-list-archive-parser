Your scope of privacy seems to be rather narrow. It is not only communication.
Privacy is also needed on public places (e.g., violated by face recognition systems), 
at work places (e.g.,violated by telephone tapping), for your body (e.g., endangered by 
abortion control),


Copyright protection is only one way of hiding subsidies to industry. The amount
of money which is sometimes claimed in relation to copyright violation is wishful thinking.
If copyright protection would work, then the value of sold products will be much less.
A very small number of people would buy the product for the regular price. On the other
hand with piracy, the market share is growing extremely fast. The current situation
is hypocritical, because industry wants both.
