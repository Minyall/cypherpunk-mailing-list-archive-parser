	Actually they use optical amplifiers rather than repeaters and
are thus repeaterless in that sense rather than depending on the loss of
a single passive fiber being small enough to work all the way across
the pond.   But one supposes the technology of tapping the cables must
have been developed, though indeed a lot harder because one has to
actually dig into the cable (and deal with the high voltage for powering
the amplifiers and so forth) and tap the individual fibers with quantum
coupling type taps.   And one supposes the taps are more detectable.
The whole issue may be moot by virtue of the extent to which the carriers
are in bed with UKUSA anyway, however, as there aren't very many fiber
cables run by unfreindly parties unwilling to part with the bitstream...
