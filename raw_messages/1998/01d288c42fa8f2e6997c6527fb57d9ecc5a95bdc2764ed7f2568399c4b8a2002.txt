Ascend MAX 4000/4002/4004/etc units running certain code versions emit a
"burp" tone  before they initiate carrier.  If your friends ISP is using
these, then he shouldn't have much to worry about.  A quick way to test
would be to just call up the ISP and ask, though that's a little obvious.
What you can do is go to a payphone and make a call to the ISPs dialup
number and see if it emits the tone then.  If it does, I'd go ahead and
make you next call to the ISP.  Just give some poor schmuck in tech
support a hard time and find out what equipment they use for the dialin
pool.  If it's Ascend, then that's your problem.
