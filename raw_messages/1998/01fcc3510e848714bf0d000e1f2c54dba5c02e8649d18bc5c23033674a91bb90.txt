On NPR's "Talk of the Nation" yesterday, Bill Reinsch, who
is an undersecretary for Export Administration in the  
Department of Commerce, stated that a change in the export
regs should be expected around Labor Day. 

The context was that the 'promise to compromise your future 
products, and we'll let you export un-escrowed DES until 
the end of 1998' deal is running out, and BXA wants 
business to know (slightly) ahead of time what the new 
regimen will be.
