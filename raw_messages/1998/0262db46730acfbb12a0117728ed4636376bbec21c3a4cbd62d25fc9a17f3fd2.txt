Wouldn't it be more efficient to use TLS or SSH as an encryption protocol
between the POP3d and the POP3 client? This could also be used for
sendmail<->sendmail transactions.

This still does not address local storage on the POP3d server. I am
looking to setting up procmail to automatically PGP encrypt incomming
messages and the forwarding them to a local account so even if the sender
does not have PGP once the message is received by the PGP mail forwarder
the messages will be PGP encrypted (I have had several people contact me
looking for solutions to ISP's snooping on their mail without relying on
the senders using PGP).
