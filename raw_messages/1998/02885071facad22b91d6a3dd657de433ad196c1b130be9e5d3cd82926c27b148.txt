In CA it is now a felony to eat a horse. I don't remember asking to be
transported to Walt Disney World...wait 'til someone other than Gary
Larson anthropomorphises the chicken, cow and pig!

On a lighter, more technical note - 

Avoiding carefully, for the moment, Harvey Rook's statement that
weaknesses in cipher systems often lie in key generation and management
and not in the crypto algorithms, I'll ask a few -naive- questions:

If we construct a CSPRNG with a ?sufficiently? large state and then use
the output of that PRNG to generate a new key for each block encrypted
by a standard block cipher have we gained anything? Large files vs.
small? When used with triple encryption like 3DES? The ROI for finding a
single key is certainly much lower if the PRNG is "good".

I've never seen a PR keystream for a conventional block cipher discussed
so I thought I'd lob it out there.
