The debate about ECHELON - last week in the European Parliament - has
again
highlighted the role of the NSA station at Menwith Hill, Yorkshire.  
The
report prepared earlier this year for the STOA (Scientific and Technical
Options Assessment) of the European Parliament resulted in widespread
coverage in Europe and the US.   

We have recently made a new batch of copies of the 1993 Dispatches
documentary on Menwith Hill - "The Hill" - based on revelations based on
NSA documents obtained by women peace protesters at the Hill.   It also
covers ECHELON and other NSA activities in the UK.   Tapes (45 mins) can
be
ordered from :

At 10.95 including postage.

I will e-mail trancripts of the programme free of charge to anyone
requesting it.
