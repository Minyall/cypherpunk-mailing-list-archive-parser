We have an answer to this one, unfortunately drowned by the various
sex scandals of assorted congressional chairmen (and other sex
scandal trivia).

Mr Freeh recently testified that he wanted access to private
communications and was immediately contradicted by the Vice President
who stated that Freeh was expressing a personal opinion and
not administration policy.

Whitehouse spin or a sign that Freeh is loosing his grip? Freeh's
attempts to ingratiate himself with the republican party have
done him no favours of late.
