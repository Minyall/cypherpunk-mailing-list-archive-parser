On 1/12/98 3:32 PM, Tim May (tcmay@got.net)  passed this wisdom:

>Any implications for crypto? If Congress can successfully make

>why not a ban on certain types of mathematics research?  

 I think many of us are understandably nervous about the mistakes that
could be made in the process of perfecting human cloning. But Tim's
point is well taken, yet another potential 'slippery slope.'

  It also begs the question again of 'are we getting too paranoid?' I
think the nanswer is still "no, not yet", as the Klinton
administration proves to us almost every day it seems.
