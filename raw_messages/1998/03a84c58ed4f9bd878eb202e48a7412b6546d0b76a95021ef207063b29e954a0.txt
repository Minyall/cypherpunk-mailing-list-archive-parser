	It may be rash to condemn or dismiss a cryptographic proposal just
because corporate PR is unable to coherently explain the work. Cramer and
Shoup are serious players, and they are presenting a paper on their work at
Crypto98 today. The technical paper can be viewed at:
<http://www.zurich.ibm.com/Technology/Security/publications/1998/CS.pdf>

	For more uninformative PR, see:

	IBM (Shoup's employer) offers a PR contact: Mike Ross, at IBM

	Suerte,
