The toys are just getting too easy to deploy. Imaging, compression,
networking, mass storage etc...Fucking engineers, oops!

A few fronts: 

Political - this is the preferable way of dealing with this crap but
also the most disturbing because many of those in power seem to think
snooping is a wonderful idea. Tough to convince them that a little
uncertainty is a *good* thing.

Technical:

Briefcase-sized EMP - fun idea but I don't know how to make it workable.

HV generator on the end of a stick - not too tough.

High power LASER to burn out CCDs - buy anonymously, nice, works from a
safe distance.

What's needed are moles to leak detailed info on systems as they're
planned and installed. Then it would be easy to determine the weak
points. If each camera had to be guarded there would be a *huge* problem
just keeping the systems alive.
