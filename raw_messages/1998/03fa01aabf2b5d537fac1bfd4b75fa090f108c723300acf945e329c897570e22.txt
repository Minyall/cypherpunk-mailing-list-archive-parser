Hi all,

I was hoping someone might be able to point me to details on .PDF file
encryption.  I'm specifically interested in key-generation (which hash is
used?) and if there is consistant known-plaintext in .PDF file headers.

I've searched around, and all I can find is that Acrobat uses rc4, which
isn't very helpful...

Thanks!
