Actually, the last time that I was called, the largest proportion of potential
jurors were people who work for the government in one form or another.

City park workers, school teachers, post office workers, clerical workers
who work at city hall, etc.

Retirees were the next largest group.

Between the two, they accounted for 80+ of the jury pool.

"Yes, the president should resign. He has lied to the American people time 
and time again, and betrayed their trust.  He is no longer an effective 
leader.  Since he has admitted guilt, there is no reason to put the 
American people through an impeachment.  He will serve absolutely no 
purpose in finishing out his term, the only possible solution is for the 
president to save some dignity and resign."
