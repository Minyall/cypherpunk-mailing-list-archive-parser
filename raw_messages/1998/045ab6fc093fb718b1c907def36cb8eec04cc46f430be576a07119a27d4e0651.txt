Reeza,
  Stop hacking those military computer accounts, and quit backtalking
to your teacher, or you'll never get out of grade 4...

  Yes, the passage of SAHMD, regarding putting electronic probes into the
brains of children and other monkeys was Real (TM), as is almost every 
other 'example' used in the True Story manuscripts, although there is
often small 'liberties' taken with the details, names, etc., for reasons
of protecting someone's ass (usually mind) for disseminating classified
material without proper authorization from an officially recognized law-
breaker/news-leaker, or just because I'm drunk.
  It is often left as an ExerciseForTheReader, if they are interested, to
do a websearch, or whatever, and see if they can uncover such details as,
say, a person who might be named, lets say, for the sake of argument...
E.B. Montgomery, who was engaged in giving MonkeyBrains direct electronic
subscriptions to Wired Magazine, and who recently moved to Chicago, to
continue his work on a new level.

 troublemaker is hacking and posting through, as well as forging
 chapters of SAHMD under the alias, LREED.}
