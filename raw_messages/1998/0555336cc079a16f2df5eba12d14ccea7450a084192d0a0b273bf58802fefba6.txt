aside from the fact that for a virus to correctly write to files on the unix
system you would need to have suffficiant read/write access,  you are
obviously too stupid to be able to accomplish this successfully.  One way to
ruin the system would be with a gun, that  is about the best that you will
be able to do considering your intellect.
