Actually, we've been persistant victims of a misspelling, here.

According to Rush Limbaugh, the true spelling, evidently, is "Sucker", not
"Soccer" Moms.

Just what they've been sucking, I suppose I would as an exercise to the
reader, though I bet they didn't inhale more than once without getting a
severe um, headache, and we all know that "blow" is just an expression...

Cheers,
