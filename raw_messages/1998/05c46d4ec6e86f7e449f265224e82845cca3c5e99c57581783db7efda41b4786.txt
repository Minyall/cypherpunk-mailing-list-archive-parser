A REAL "nobody" writes  (behind the list's back) - "Have you gotten rid of
that stansquncr virus yet?  You know, the one where you've been sucking dick
for $5 crackrock?  Guess not." and "Your parents should have fucking killed
themselves for having offspring like you."

"Nobody", I'll tell this to you (at least) once - 

Not only do you not seem to understand the simple nursury rhyme - 'Sticks and
stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me', you don't seem to
understand that I do.

Your friend,
Stan the Liberal
