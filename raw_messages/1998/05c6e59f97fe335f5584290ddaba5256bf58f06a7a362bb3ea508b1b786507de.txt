No the key requested is 'snoop@microsoft.com'.

But the ROT13 encoding is true even for PGP5. If you move or rename the
randseed.bin to an other location (i.E. to install pgp2.6.3(i)n and pgp5
simultanusly) the file will be modified, but all encrypted messages have the
same session key.

On the other hand pgp5 does not confirm the OpenPGP draft. A converter can
be found at ftp://ftp.iks-jena.de/pub/mitarb/lutz/crypt/software/pgp/OpenPGP/
