I have produced some FC'98 files in suitable formats for the Palm Pilot.  I will be adding more as the date approaches.

So far we have:

A map of Anguilla (looks great in Image).

A map of Monserrat with eclipse lines. 

and in DOC format:
 
The Wired article on FC'97.

The Forbes cover story on FC'97.

and finally:

For purposes of amusement only, a Jfile databse of the first 4 quarterly reports of the (1786) names of Taxpatriates (those with too much money who renounce their US citizenship) as reported to the Secretary of the Treasury last year by the State Department.
 
More to come including a schedule in .dba format as soon as The Powers That Be settle on one.
