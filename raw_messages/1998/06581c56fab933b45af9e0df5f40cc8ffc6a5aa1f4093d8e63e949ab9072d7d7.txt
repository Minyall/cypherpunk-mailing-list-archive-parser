Who are these "USENET newsgroup operators," anyway? (A few newsgroups are
moderated, by individuals or committees, but the vast majority are not.)

Newsgroups get removed from university and corporate newsfeeds, or by
nations, and Adam's ruse would not stop them from continuing to do so.

I assume you are serious, and do agree, as it is a very solid criticism of
the "Eternity as continuous posting to Usenet" model.

I see several axes to the analysis of the various Eternity schemes.

-- retrieval time for a customer or client to obtain some set of data,
ranging from (I assume) ~minutes or less in an Eternity DDS file system to
~days or less in a Blacknet system to (I am guessing) ~weeks or months in
an Adam Back sort of system.

(Given constraints on Usenet in existence today. Technological and
political constraints in how many gigabytes will be sent. The binaries
groups are already overloading many systems, of course.)

-- bandwidth consumed in the system

-- number of nodes

-- security

(I have my own biases, and will elaborate when I get some time to put my
thoughts together.)
