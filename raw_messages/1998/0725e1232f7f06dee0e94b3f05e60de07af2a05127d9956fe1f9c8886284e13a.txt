I just picked up a Moniker Crypto Card, made by Litronic, Fortezza
Compliant, PCMCIA v2.1 type 2 card. Seems all the software went behind a
$600month, 6mo min, ftp site as of oct 1, 1998.

I don't want to seem like a warez d00d, I am looking for software to use
this card, or further info, but may be up the river.

Its a risc processor in a card to do fast crypto and store info on it.

Thanks
Bryan
