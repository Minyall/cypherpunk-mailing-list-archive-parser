This is a good one.  What about the other half of American life (the
uncivilized?). You know, the americans who live in those old
refrigerator cartons? The ones that nobody sees?  I think they get more
than 2 weeks out of their shirts.

The sad fact is that city brats haven't got the faintest idea what
survival is all about  (you mean I have to *walk* to the supermarket?).
It was in the 1890's when Queen Victoria issued an edict that forced all
the english to 'bathe at least once a year'.

Sit back and enjoy the carnival.
