In my previous mail of a couple of weeks ago I offered to 
produce a CD of the CP archives. So far there have been no 
offers of data for this exploit.

This is a polite reminder that if someone can offer a copy 
of the archives in an easily transportable format, I will 
take care of the creation and distribution of the CD.

Come on Cypherpunks - don't let your apathy get the better 
of you.
