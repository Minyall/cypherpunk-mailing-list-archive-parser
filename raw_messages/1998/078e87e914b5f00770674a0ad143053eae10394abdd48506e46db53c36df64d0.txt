Stefan Brands patents?  Not sure if digicash would claim these
infringe the blind sig patents.

Ian Goldberg's HINDE/money changer with or without blinding -- in
general notion that you can obtain anonymity by anonymous exchange
from a trusted money changer, or with blinding from an untrusted money
changer.  As with remailers you can increase the strength of anonymity
by chaining through multiple money changers.

Or perhaps Doug Barne's proposal for a identity agnositic bank and
blinding clients distributed from jurisdictions where doesn't have
patents?  (The client is the software which does the blinding).

Pseudonymous approach to anonymity -- ecash accounts without an
TrueName indentity bound to them.

Others?  (Ryan you suggested 5 but didn't list them explicitly?)
