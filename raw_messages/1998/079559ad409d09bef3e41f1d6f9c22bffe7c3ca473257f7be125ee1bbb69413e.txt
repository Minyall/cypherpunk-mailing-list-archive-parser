I personally dont see money laundering as a "bad" thing, but fraud
definitely is. What you do with your money is your business as long as you
dont hurt someone else. This was not the case. (IMHO)

I'm sure it will.

Hell no, I personally do not think it would not be practical, moral or
cost-effective to use key-escrow methods. Key escrow empowers governments,
not individuals - at the cost of the individuals right to privacy.

Then why doesn't someone do it? Like I said we have to start somewhere.

Well it definitely is the latest and it definitely is one of many, so your
suspicions are correct.

BTW, The Digital Society Group has been selected to deploy the entire
Digital Society Package within the new Agulhas Bay Free Zone in the
People's Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe.

I'd advise a look at the new content on the Digital Society website.
