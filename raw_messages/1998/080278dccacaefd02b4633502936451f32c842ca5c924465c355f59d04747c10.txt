Thanks to Anonymous we offer the article which
describes the AU government attack on Eric Young's 
and Tim Hudson's full-strength Cryptozilla for Netscape:

   http://jya.com/oz-crypto.htm

It's also a good overview of crypto policy battles down 
under -- the pols, the crats, the laws, the regs, the 
obfuscations, the work arounds of export controls
and runarounds with chicken heads off -- like like 
all around hereabouts.
