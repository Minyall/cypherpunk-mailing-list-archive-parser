It didn't go over my head at all. What amazes me is that it took you this
long to figure out that one could munge signatures.

Um, I don't believe that is true. It may be the first time members of this
list have managed it.

No, it challenges basic assumptions regarding the importance of identity.
In no way does it effect the basic math of crypto, public or otherwise.

And people wonder why I don't sign my messages...

I've taken no issue with Toto or his ravings.

Have a nice day.
