I've noticed that the text appears to be scanned in.  (and ocred).
Ther'ess numerous minor grammatical errors, such as missing commas, a "d"
instead of the ")", and other misc. stuff in the first chapter of Applied
Cryptography...

That's actually more disappointing than the lack of anHTML version of the
books, in my opinion..

Oh well..  Perhaps we can convince them to correct it?

I do notice that the reader tends to make the left edge of the text very
difficult to pick out from the edge of the window.. Ahh... well, , it
obviously suffered some strange problems in manufacture...
