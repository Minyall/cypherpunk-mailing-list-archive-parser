Folks,
I would like to coordinate the wireless communication efforts for FC'98 in
Anguilla. If you were there last year, you know that the lack of a
meaningful communication infrastructure is the number one problem on the
island.

If you intend to bring, or have access to, wireless modems [Ricochet],
satellite ground stations [VSAT, INMARSAT], or the like, please get in
touch with me immediately.

Thanks,
