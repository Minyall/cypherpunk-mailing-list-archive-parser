A test measures only what it measures.

You never know if this is sufficient.

A sample of a non-random process may pass your tests
if they don't measure the right thing.

I only find it interesting that the test can distinguish between
the two data samples.  To the eye, or ear, or Diehard, they appear the same.

I'd find it surprising if any did, given what I described.
