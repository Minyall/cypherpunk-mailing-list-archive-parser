f() = belief function
A = hypothesis
^ = not

f(^A) != ^f(A)

At least not without placing requirements on f().

Then you claim everything is a belief, so f() is meaningless. But then
you deny A == A when you claimed that metaphysical objectivity is a
belief, so what was the point in writing the equation in the first
place?

Go transcend.
