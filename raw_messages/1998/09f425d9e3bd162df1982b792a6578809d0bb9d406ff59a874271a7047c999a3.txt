You generate a key pair on your machine (Netscape keygen tag or MS
CrappyApi.  The public key + other self-referential materiel is sent to
Thawte/Verisign et al (actually I like Thwart better).  This is via broken
PKCS#10 for MS, or proprietary SPKAC for Netscape (ever wondered why there
are multiple buttons for your browser type?).  They then send you a
reference number via email. You cut and paste the number back onto their
site.  A PKCS#7 mimetype is downloaded, causing your browser to grab and
stash your new cert. Netscape stores the key in its own special way, and the
cert in a PKCS#12 format.  MS stores both in PKCS#12 format, which is rather
easy to hack.

If I was to request a cert from Thawte (the only really useful global, free,
full strength one), and specify cyphers@punks.net (a well known interneting
list) as my email address, then the email would be available to all
subscribers of the list.  Certs being public, this is not a problem.  The
crucial part being that the private key I originally generated, matching the
public key in the cert, remains on my machine. I.e. I am the only one who
can decrypt stuff encrypted with the cert's public key.  This is an
interesting way of receiving encrypted mail (pseudo-)anonymously.  Expect to
see a rash of Thawte "collect your new cert" emails, followed by much
encrypted mail that only one list subscriber has the wherewithal to
decrypt.  Another alternative is to distribute the private key to selected
buddies on the list, to provide a shared cert.

Netscape specific: Migrating use of a cert requires an email to yourself
that you will receive on your new machine, after copying the key*.db files
and/or *.p12 files to the netscape/.../users dir, and importing it.

As to how sexdegrees.com could use this technology ... this would require
some degree of know-how which would probably preclude signing up in the
first place.
