OK. But if used prior to another cipher wouldn't it substantially
complicate the job of, say, looking for English letter distributions in
a test decryption?

I like the other explanation of the hash isolating the key bits from the
whitening operation and adequately serving the same purpose as another
source.

Expensive how? In terms of CPU time?
What alternative makes traditional block ciphers obsolete?
