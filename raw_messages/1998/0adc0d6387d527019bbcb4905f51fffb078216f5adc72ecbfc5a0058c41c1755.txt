I don't understand why there is so much talk about guns here lately.
Unless someone comes up with a weapon that has some very unusual economic
properties, individuals cannot hope to compete with governments in the
domain of deadly force. If we have to resort to physical violence, we've
already lost!

Think about it: if we can defend ourselves with guns, why would we need
crypto?
