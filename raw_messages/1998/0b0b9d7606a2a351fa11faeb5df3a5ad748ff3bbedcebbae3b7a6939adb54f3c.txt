Scuze me for picking nits, but if the missile doesn't have a
warhead then its just a rocket (plus some guidance systems).

When does a rocket become a "weapon of mass destruction"?

Maybe what American officials should be investigating is how US defense
contractors got an export license to sell ICBM components to the ChiCom's. 
I heard it was OK'd by the pres himself -- theorectically for big
campaign donations.

If those missiles are targeted at US, then that would constitute
blatant treason, would it not?

Inquiring minds want to know.
