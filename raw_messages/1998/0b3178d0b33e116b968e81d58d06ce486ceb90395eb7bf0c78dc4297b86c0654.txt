This list will move to another machine tonight because it is relocating
to another colocated server.

It has nothing to do with subpoenas.

Hopefully things will work transparently, but if they do not, write me
to ichudov@yahoo.com (there is a possibility that all algebra.com
may be shut out of mail).
