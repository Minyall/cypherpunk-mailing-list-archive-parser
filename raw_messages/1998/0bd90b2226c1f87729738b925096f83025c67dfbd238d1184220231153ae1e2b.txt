Me and my friends are so lonely!! 
I wish that you would come and see me. 
With Valentines day coming I don't want to be alone. 
I will do anything to make you happy, 
if you want me to I'll even invite a friend over to join us.  
Just PLEASE don't let me be alone!  
I'll be awaiting for you every night.
I'll be at: http://www.cyber-fantasy.com/
