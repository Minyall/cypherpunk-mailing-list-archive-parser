In terms of "work factor," such connections are nearly worthless. They
might be a bit harder to trap or trace than typical connections, but they
are only "security through obscurity" compared to the effort to break a
typical cipher.

(Put another way, would you feel safe hosting a child porn site just
because some of the links were over ham radio or the like? I wouldn't. I'd
be waiting for the FCC vans to triangulate....or for the cellphone
companies to "cooperate," as they so often have.)
