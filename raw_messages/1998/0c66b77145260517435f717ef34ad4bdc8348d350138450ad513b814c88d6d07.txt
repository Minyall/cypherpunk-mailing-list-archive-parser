Armor-piercing ammo, the common kind, is just steel-core ammo. This is
readily available in most calibers, esp. military calibers. (A less common
kind is "KTW" handgun ammo, which is under some recent restrictions. And
even less common, and almost certainly unavailable to the proles, are
"sabot" rounds, some with tungsten cores.)

Importation of steel-core ammo is under various restrictions. Klinton
recently blocked import of a lot of foreign 7.62x39 steel core ammo, on
nebulous grounds that they represented a threat to the ruling elite and
their police bodyguards.

But it's still widely available. Check the gun shows.

(There is little need for this, for even folks like us. We are not likely
to want to disable fleeing vehicles, etc. And even conventional lead-core
rifle rounds will cut through body armor easily, which is all I care about.)
