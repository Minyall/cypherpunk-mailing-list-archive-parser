I had tended to not take too seriously the posts of someone who signs
himself as "Uhh...this is Joe," but the reasoning he displays below makes
me take him more seriously:

Just so. With one minor caveat: the amount of time should be replaced by
"effort expended."

Clearly there are a lot of flaky algorithms which have been given scant
attention. It would be wrong to assume that the first year spent trying to
break Blowfish is comparable to the first year spent trying to attack
Virtual Matrix Superunbreakable Amazing Algorithm.

But I generally like your intuition.
