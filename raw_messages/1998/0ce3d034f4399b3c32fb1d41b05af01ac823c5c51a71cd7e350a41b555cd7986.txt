"Yeah, officer, I dropped my ID in the street and it got run over.  Don't
give me such a hard time about it, I'm just glad I got it back..."
I really doubt you are going to get convicted for accidently dropping your
wallet because your ID got scraped up a little bit on the back side.

Seriously, the best way is a strong magnet.  You can also put it in your
shirt pocket and iron it, then apply a strong magnet.  The heat will make
it lose its magnetism more quickly; just make shure you don't melt it. :)
