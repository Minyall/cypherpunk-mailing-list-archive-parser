I'm looking for something to encrypt all of my web browsing while I am
at work.  My work keeps a couple gigs devoted to a cache file in the
proxy and I want to find a cheap way around that for my work. 
Personally paying for Fsecure SSH is not worth it just for work.
I would be wiiling to pay for an account at cyberpass.net for their
ssh server but the software is way too much.
