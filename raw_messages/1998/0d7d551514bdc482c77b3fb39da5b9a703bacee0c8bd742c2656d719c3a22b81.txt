Kevin McCurley, IBM, delivered a paper on using electronic commerce techniques (i.e., d-postage) to deter SPAM.  He cites a work by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor, "Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail,"  http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/Papers/trs/CS95-20/abstract.html  I wan't able to access that paper and would be interested to know how similar their appraoch is to HashCash.
