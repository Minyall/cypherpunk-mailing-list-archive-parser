Subject: 128 bit or 40 bit?

Being outside North America, I have an "export" version of 
Internet Explorer/Netscape Navigator. These offer 40 bit 
encryption. (40 bit RC4, I understand).


My financial institution has a 128 bit Verisign certificate.
To my surprise, they claim this offers 128 bit encryption to /me/.
[in transactions to https://secure.mybank.com.xx]

I thought my 40 bit client limited the security to 40 bits.
Who is right? Please explain.

TIA
