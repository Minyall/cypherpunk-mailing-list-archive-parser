A couple of other points.

I've never claimed the monopolization would exist over nite or that it
wouldn't be filled with short term conflicts and ups-n-downs. Only that the
*long-term* result is a monopolized market. A point you seem to gloss over
as irrelevant. Let's give the market another 5-10 years and see where Linux
stands. Right now the estimate is 6-10 million users world wide use it. Share
wise that isn't a lot. The reason that Linux garners so much press right now
is that it is in fact an exception when an organization uses the software
(eg NASA). The test will be whether it grows significantly over the long
run and not the 5 years that Linux has been a serious os.
