Of course.

Such schemes usually increase the amount of piracy in the long-term,
because it encourages people to convert the material into a more easily
copied form.

If you've ever followed any of the warez scenes, what you find is
generally about 1% of the population acutally obtain and convert the
material, and the other 99% just trade copies around.  (Consider, for
example, the number of people who actually know how to dump the
contents of an eprom chip versus the number of sites where you can
download copies of nintendo/sega/etc games.)
