Are there any web sites offering bounties for Americans, like the Americans
have for foreigners?  Or have their domain names been deregistered, their
spines pinched at the backbone, their WANs LAN'd?

Surely the well-funded jihads could do this.  And they haven't got
some law prohibiting assasination to hold them back.
