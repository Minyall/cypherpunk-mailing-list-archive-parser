	What was tbe average life expectancy in Victorian England?

	Those "other half" (more like other .05%) who live in refridgerator
cartons regularly clog up ER's with gangrenous wounds, stinking of filth
and decay. They tend not to live too long like that. Many of them also get
a hot shower at least once a week from a homeless shelter.
