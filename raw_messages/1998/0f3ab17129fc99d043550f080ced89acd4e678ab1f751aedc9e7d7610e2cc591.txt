I 'own' my freedom but I *never* control it. Its expression is a direct
result of *others* respecting that ownership.

Another example is a very old Chinese proverb from The Masao:

You are
What you do
When it counts

The point being, you *never* have anything to say about when it counts.

Not to mention the obvious retort, what do you mean by 'control'...

> any true cypherpunk must be a libertarian..

In your opinion.
