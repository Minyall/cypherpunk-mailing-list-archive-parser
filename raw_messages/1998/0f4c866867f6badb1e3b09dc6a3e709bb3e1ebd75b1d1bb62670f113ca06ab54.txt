Actualy there are equivalent oil and gas deposits in SE Asia and Antartica.
But they doesn't belong to the USG either.

Of course the point is valid. Though it almost begs the question of why in

are actualy very few technologies that care whether oil or gas is used in
energy production or some entirely different process.
