Hi,


I have a box of confidential papers that I do not need. I would prefer not
to just throw them away, but to either shred or incinerate them. Due to
the sheer size of the box, it is not practical for me to buy and use a home
shredder. Would anyone have a suggestion as to what is the best way to
destroy them? Aer there any services that do it inexpensively?

Thank you

igor
