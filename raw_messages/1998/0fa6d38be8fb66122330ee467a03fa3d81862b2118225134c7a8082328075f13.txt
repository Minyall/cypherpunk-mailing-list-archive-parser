This is why I have been responding to "sixdedegrees" contacts with threats,
death threats, threats to put them on my spam list, promises to contact

They have become an Internet bomb, exploding in our midst.

Respond to them in kind.

That's right. I say death to Sixdegrees and death to those who spam us.

Kill the fuckers dead. Let Frodo sort them out.

Wiping out the corporate monstrosity that is "Sixdegrees" will be sweet.
