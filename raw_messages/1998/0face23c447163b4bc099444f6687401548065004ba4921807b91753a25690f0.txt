>From what I have read of Ken Starr's report Washington insider's all 
knew of Clinton's relationship with "That Woman".  Now if Law 
Enforcement (LA) knows Clinton has skeletons in his closet they can 
go to him and tell him he must support lets just say a total ban on 
strong encryption.  Clinton is inbetween a rock and a hard place, he 
must go along with proposals from LA, whether he supports the 
proposals in principle or not.

We have seen some of Clinton's dirty laundry in a segment of his 
life that his attorney wife was not able to advise him.  Now do you 
think Clinton's general standard of morality was any different in his 
life before this scandal in areas where his attorney wife was able to 
pull the strings?  I personally doubt it. 

I see the whole OIC crusade against Clinton as an attempt to bring 
honesty to government.  Ken Starr is just playing the game by the 
rules set out be the Clintons.  If the game looks too rough who do 
you blame?
