I'm woefully ignorant about reloading, but would this really work?
Would you mix your high-quality smokeless with Tim's homebrew black
powder, Toto's pebble-ground Canada Red Doobie Mix, and Bell's
stinkbomb components and take away the average?  Or are different types
of powder visually distinct enough or similar enough in effect to mix
and match effectively?
