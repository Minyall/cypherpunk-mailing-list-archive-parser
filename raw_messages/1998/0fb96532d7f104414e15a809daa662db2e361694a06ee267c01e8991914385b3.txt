Yow - talk about threats to the Computer Industry - Controlling our
Coffee Supply can affect the productivity of the Entire Country!
These Monopolists are  after our precious bodily fluids!

BTW, if you've ever been to Sacramento, CA, that hive of villiany
and stupidity, there's apparently a law or custom which says that
nobody may make or sell any coffee strong enough to wake up a
government bureaucrat...

				Thanks!
