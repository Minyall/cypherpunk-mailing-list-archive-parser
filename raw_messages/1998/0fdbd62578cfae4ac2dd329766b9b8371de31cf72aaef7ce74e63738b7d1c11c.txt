	I'm not sure that this is the message they're sending at all.
They're trying to work the Linux/GNU model of getting a horde of
volunteer programmers to improve their product, and base other
products on it, because of the ease of integration.  I don't know that
security was even on their minds.

Not that the internet crowd is such hot shit, either.  The freely
usable FWTK contained a *really* easy to find replay attack for about
3 years, befire I pointed it out at the Crypto rump session.

pointing to problems.  Security critical in some instances.  3 Years
to find.
