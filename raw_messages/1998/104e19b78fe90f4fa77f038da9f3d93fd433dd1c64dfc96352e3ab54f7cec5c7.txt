Mostly journalists and scribblers. Typical. Journalists yakking with other
journalists on the same boring panels.

As with the 24/7 coverage of the Lewinsky matter on CNN, MSNBC, CNBC, Fox,
and other networks, it is mostly journalists pontificating with other
journalists.

Oddly, though, this one is not in the usual place, Washington, D.C.
