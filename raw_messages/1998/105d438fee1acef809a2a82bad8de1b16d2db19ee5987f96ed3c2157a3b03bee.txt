When FEAL was written, it wasn't snake oil.  If anybody tries to use it
today, it _is_ snake oil, because it and a number of variants on it
are well known to be broken.  (Too bad, because it was made to be 
small and light and run on wimpy processors, but there are now other
small fast cyphers around.)
				Thanks!
