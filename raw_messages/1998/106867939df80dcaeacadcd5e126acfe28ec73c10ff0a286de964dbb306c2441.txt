The new upcoming version of Windows gives the user the choice of using
Internet Explorer as the main interface for access to the desktop icons,
the computer files, internet services like AOL, or web pages.   It is still
the user's choice to use Win95 as they are accustomed to - they must
manually select this option in order to use it - but it is a new way of
using Internet Explorer, for more than just viewing web pages.

You could say it is becoming the window from which to view the rest of the
rooms in the house, including what's beyond, outside of it.
