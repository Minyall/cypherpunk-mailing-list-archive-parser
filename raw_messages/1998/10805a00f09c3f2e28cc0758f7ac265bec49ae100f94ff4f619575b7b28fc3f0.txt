You know, I wonder why they didn't think about the Federal Interest and the
Legitimate Needs of Government when all this was going on back then.  Are
universities, students, and Physicists working for Foreign Governments any
more (or less) trustworthy than anyone else?  Was there no secrecy at all,
when all these people - especially the scientists - were communicating no
such open networks?  I guess The Authorities also, among other things,
didn't expect encryption (PGP) to grow as it did.
