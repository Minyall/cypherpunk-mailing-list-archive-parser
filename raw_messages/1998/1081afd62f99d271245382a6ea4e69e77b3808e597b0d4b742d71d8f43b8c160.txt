There's the standard shareware model - ask for $25.
There's the Cygnus model - charge money for support.
There's the Netscape/McAfee/etc. model - free for personal use,
	charge money to companies that use it.
There's the Eudora model - basic version free, bells&whistles extra.
There's the advertising-banner model - the software/service is free,
	but usage hits an advertising banner in some way that
	filters money back to you.

There are probably a lot more ways to do it as well, but it's a start.
				Thanks!
