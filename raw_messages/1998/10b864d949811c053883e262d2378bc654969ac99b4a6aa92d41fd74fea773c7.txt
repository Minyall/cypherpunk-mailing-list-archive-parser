Inspired by "Crypto Kong," contributions of crypto jokes 
are requested, to enliven our Web site, which is pretty 
gray these days without congressional buffoonery. 

Thigh-slappers are preferred, but since one person's
humor is another's pain, any bizarre tales of woe,
stupidity and vanity are welcomed. Short as possible,
like Adam's three swines of pearl.

Sure, anonymous zingers are great. No pay, no
apologies for missing the point.
