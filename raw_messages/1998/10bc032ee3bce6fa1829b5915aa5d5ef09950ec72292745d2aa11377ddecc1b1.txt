PSINet snatcheroo?

That's getting tough on complaints. ;-)

I've only submitted a complaint to PSINet so far.

Haven't gotten around to Altopia.

I do actually work for a living, despite Vulis' claims.

He posted from 'cj3@alt.net' _after_ being terminated from PSINet.

Whois gives his number as:

   Billing Contact:
      Vulis, Dimitri  (DV1010)  dlv@DM.COM
      718-261-6839

Ain't it great here in NYC, Third Planet From the Sun?

You could always go over and knock on his door.

I hear he posted a picture of himself to the Net in 1992,
and that "he looked dorky, and his wife fat".

Hey, Vulis is probably looking for a real job.

Maybe he's finally found one.

I can hear him saying:

   "Would you like fries with that?"
