Why do I find this odd?  Because the electromagnetic field acts
locally, the vector potential is not directly observable and depends
on ones choice of gauge, and wavefunction phase is also not directly
observable.  The integral of the vector potential around the closed
path is of course well-defined, but this is global, not local.
 
So it seems strange, and hints at some sort of "action at a distance"
thing occuring.  The wavefunction is being perturbed according to the
magnetic flux enclosed by a path, even while propagating in a region
distant to the flux which contains no electromagnetic field at all.

It still seems counterintuitive to suggest that I can make a tour
around a magnetic field an arbitrary distance away, and get a precise
reading of its strength.  Would it work a mile away?  A light year
away?  Does this result follow from QED?  Some equations might be
helpful.
