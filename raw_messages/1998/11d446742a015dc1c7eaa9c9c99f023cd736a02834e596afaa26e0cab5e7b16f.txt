I was suggesting that when finding oneself in a conflict with LEOs, it is
better to be in the position of a trainrobber hiding in a cave with a
backdoor, rather than in the position of someone getting bombed in their
house at Waco or Ruby Ridge.

You are always better off if you can show your opponent the futility of
his goal.
