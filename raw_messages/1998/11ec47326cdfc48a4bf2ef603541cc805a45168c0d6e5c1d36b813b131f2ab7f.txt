"Civil liberties and privacy grew more tenuous. The
Clinton administration maintained its record of utter
unfriendliness toward the Bill of Rights as it applies
to technology. The administration's hard-line stand
on encryption, the scrambling of data to keep it away
from prying eyes, shows no signs of moderation. And
the administration pursued the absurd notion, which
flies utterly in the face of reality, that private
businesses can regulate themselves in ways that
protect consumers' privacy."
