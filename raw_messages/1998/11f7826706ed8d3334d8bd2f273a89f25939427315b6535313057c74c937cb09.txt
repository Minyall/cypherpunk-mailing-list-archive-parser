   The IRS gave the Church of Scientology a sweetheart deal on October
1 1993, granting it privileges that no other tax exempt organization
gets.
   The above web page  includes the Secret Agreement, IRS tax code
portions at issue, US Supreme Court ruling that the Secret Agreement
violates, and other important information.  I update it almost daily.
