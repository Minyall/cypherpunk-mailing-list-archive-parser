The New York Times reported today that the National Research
Council found that it was not feasible to require taggants in
explosives and recommended that the technology not be pursued.
Instead, it proposed improved licensing and protection of storage.

The panel noted that it would be very difficult to restrict access to
common materials for manufacturing explosives, and that law
enforcement should improve investigation, intelligence and
education of the public.

An unconfirmed Reuters is that the panelists fist-fought tooth-and-nail
gouch&suck-eyeballs over the issue of a confidential investigation to 
determine why there were no ATF agents in Murrah, only the 
head-hammered remains of all the agency's Wintel boxes choked 
with endless incoming of "The Availability of Bombmaking Information 
on the Internet" auto-forwarded from Senator_Feinstein@remailer.to.
