While I understand the implications and outrage here, anybody who uses
cellular phones as a measure of security is a total idiot. The connections
usually aren't encrypted, they're radiated to the rest of the area, and
your position can be triangulated (half-ass) if nothing else.

With that in mind, maybe this one is actually legitimate. If criminals
and/or patriots are that stupid, they'll get caught for something else
like driving drunk two states away.
