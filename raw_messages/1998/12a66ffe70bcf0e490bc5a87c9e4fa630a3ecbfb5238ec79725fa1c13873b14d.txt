Subject: If there's a trial will some of us be witnesses?

If Carl Johnson comes to trial, presumably both sides will call expert
witnesses.

So, who will these witnesses be? Ironically, we are almost certainly the
most qualified witnesses on the planet in these issues.

However, I expect we are too disreputable, to either side, to be called.
Instead, they'll likely call on peripheral players like Dorothy Denning to
explain to the jury what AP is. Or perhaps the "Science Applications Inc."
lightweight who attempted to analyze anonymity and remailers for a
conference paper a year or two ago.

Food for thought.

I'm not sure how I'd react if either side called on me to act as witness.
And if they subpoenaed me, I suppose I'd have to spend a few kilobucks to
hire some lawyer to explain to me how and when I could take the Fifth.
(That's what it's come to, with lawyers needed at every stage.)
