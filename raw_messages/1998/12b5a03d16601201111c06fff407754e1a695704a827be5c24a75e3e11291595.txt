Hi,

my English is fuck, but I hope that anybody unerstand me <bg>
If I`ve got a IP-Adress, f.E. 126.0.202.146 and our proxy denies this
Adress, I can transform this adress in one number...
((126*256)+0)*256+202)*256+146 = 7E 00 CA 92
Is there a mistake?

Can I connect with this adress to a Website? (Netscape Navigator and
Proxy from Bull Systems...)

Please give reply direct to my E-Mail adress, and not to the group...
