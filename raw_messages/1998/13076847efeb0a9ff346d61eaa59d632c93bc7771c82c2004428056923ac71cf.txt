CLINTON/STARR SCRAMBLED 

Wed Aug 12 1998 23:34:51 UTC-- An extraordinary communications security
blanket will be in place
for President Clinton's grand jury showdown on Monday. One of the hottest
telecasts in American
history will be scrambled with the latest encryption technology and put on
a special fiber-optic
line from the White House to the courtroom, the DALLAS MORNING NEWS reports
in Thursday editions. 

Hacker beware: Intercepting the president's testimony could fall under
wiretapping statutes as a
felony, reports the paper. 

Tech workers, claiming to be from a Virginia cable company, visited the
federal courthouse early
week. One court watcher explains that the cover didn't work: "It was
obvious that the guys were not
with 'Virginia Cable' but were from the FBI or some other government
agency... setting it all up." 

Starr is expected to personally question Clinton during the session... 





"[T]errorists are the only true avant-garde artists because they're the
only ones who are still capable of really surprising people." (Delillo q.v.
