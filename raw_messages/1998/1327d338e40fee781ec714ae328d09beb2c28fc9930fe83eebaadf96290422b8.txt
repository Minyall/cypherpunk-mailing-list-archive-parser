	At the risk of raising yet another stupid and silly issue, does
anybody know how this would apply to crypto (such as PGP) available in
source form ?   Would only binaries produced by compiling the source
before the cutoff date be legal ?  Or would compiling the source under a
new version of the OS or new OS or even new instruction set (ISA-64 on a
Merced for example) merely constitute reasonable use of the existing
source product ? How about mechanical translations of the object to
another environment or instruction set ?   And what level of patches,
bug fixes, or actual changes and improvements to the source would be
legal if it was legal to compile the source and use the resulting binary
after the cutoff ?
