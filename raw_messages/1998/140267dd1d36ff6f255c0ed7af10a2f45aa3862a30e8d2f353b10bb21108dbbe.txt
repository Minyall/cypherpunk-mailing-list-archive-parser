     We are sending you an invitation to be one of our special guests this
year, big harry ass lawsuits are always of interest.  Bring a friend if you
like, but I have to warn you, Liberatarians are not welcome.  This years menu
includes red meat and poptarts.  Clothing is optional.

                Sincerely,
