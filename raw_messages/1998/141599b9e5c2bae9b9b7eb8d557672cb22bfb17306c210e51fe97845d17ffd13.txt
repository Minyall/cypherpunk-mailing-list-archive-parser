If they don't have crypto laws it's likely they don't have a lot of other
sorts of laws and the social and economic structure those laws imply. This
makes it very difficult to operate a archive with any sort of stability or
protection.

There is NO financial problem. It costs hundreds of dollars to purchase the
hardware. The connectivity is less than $100 a month in most parts of the
world. It simply isn't expensive or economicaly challenging.

That ISN'T the problem and should recieve scant attention while these other
issues are extant.

Bottem line, if you can't afford to put up a box then you're not going to be
able to afford to deal with the other issues such activities incur mainly
because you're going to be too busy trying to pay your housing and food
costs. In that situation you've better things to do with your time then run
an archive site.
