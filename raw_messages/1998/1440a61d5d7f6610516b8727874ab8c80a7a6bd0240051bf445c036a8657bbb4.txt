THE WASHINGTON TIMES
    Computer hackers could disable military; System compromised in 
secret
    exercise

  So when can we expect to hear the first announcements of high-level 
military resignations over the disgraceful state that they have let
our national security fall into while wasting billions of dollars
of our money?

  Please zipfile the announcements forwarded to the list, so that
their massive volume does not swamp all of our email accounts.
