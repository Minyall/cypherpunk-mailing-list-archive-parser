There is no market-based reason for a general-purpose news server to store a 
file once it is known it is illegal or even offensive and someone puts any 
serious
amount of pressure on them.  You end up needing to steganographically protect
your data in the usenet stream, yet then you have to resort to security through
obscurity, which royally sucks if you have published source :)  You could use
some kind of cryptographically steganographically protected data, such that
you need a secret key to know stegoed data exists, but then knowing which 
files to
extract becomes a pain -- your server needs to try to extract on *everything*. 
 True,
this also solves part of the TA problem (while making the other parts far 
worse) :)

But it really hammers the servers, and makes it unlikely they'll continue to 
let you access
them.  You could then foil this by using a bunch of tentacles to pull in data, 
but this
increases complexity and security vulnerability.

Yes.  This (and the URN issue) was one of the initial reasons why I doubted the
functionality of his Eternity implementation if it ever became popular.  One 
of MIT's
news admins was actually vehemently opposed to this "abuse of usenet", and 
implied he
would go out of his way to not carry such articles.

E-DDS should scale well because everyone involved is trying to make a profit.

My implementation allows flexibility -- someone pays for every scarce 
resource, yes, but
it does not have to always be the same person.  There will hopefully evolve to 
be people
willing to speculate in data, storing it for free in exchange for a cut, 
others willing
to pay the cost of putting their own data up and making access free up to a 
certain point,
etc.

I like CD-ROM distribution.  My discman carried munitions, as well as music, 
recently,
on the same disc.

There are currently-under-development systems which will meet the digital cash 
requirement,
from people who I consider highly respectable and competent.

Yes, blacknet is a perfect model of a distributed high-latency system.  
However,
to get a system which will actually be useful to end users requires quite a 
bit more than
just storing data -- services like reporting on the reliability of data, 
allowing
easy access to data by third parties, etc. are all pretty essential.  
Cypherpunks
may find blacknet highly useful, but most end users want something that works
like the web, or like a database, which is the primary advantage of the current
"Eternity" systems.

Yes, having a persistent URN is highly useful.  Adam's implementation kind of 
solves
this, and I have not yet come up with a solution to it -- it would be easy to
do a pretty simple persistent URL, but having something which would allow
indexing to be something other than a web-search-engine style kludge is more 
difficult.
I've been reading some papers on the topic.

I think perhaps this is inaccurate.  I am interested in being able to subsume 
the
functionality of a database for some applications, but I'm trying to build 
something
more like a distributed active agents system.  A database implies a single 
central
design -- this would be more a medium in which people could place databases, 
agents, etc.
