There's a story in the Dec. 30, 1998 Washington Post about how US intelligence
acquires foreign weapons technology. Specific mention is made about trading
US Stinger missile know-how to China for whatever. My guess is the government's
trying to set the stage to shift blame away from CIA for leaking antiaircraft
missile technology, 1000 Stingers in the hands of Afghan rebels notwithstanding,
and the aircraft disasters to come.
