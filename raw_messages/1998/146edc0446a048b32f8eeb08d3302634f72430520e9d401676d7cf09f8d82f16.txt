Stan, whose mind is held hostage by the heathens at A(h)OL, has not
yet been visited by the revemissionlutionaries of the Army of Dog,
and thus does not realize that the ClueServer died for his sins.

Thus, his body and soul are destined to boil in a big black pot
forged from the melted remains of his own kettles, and fired by
the burning ears of those he has maligned behind their backs, as
are all those who spread FUD out of cluelessness, instead of out
of a genuine desire to be a rabble-rousing shit-disturber.
