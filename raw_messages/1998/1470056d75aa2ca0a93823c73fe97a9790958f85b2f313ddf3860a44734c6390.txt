We need confirmation that pages 11 and 14 are the same
in the NSA algo release except for the words "Figure 7"
and Figure 8."

And that Figures 7, 8 and 9, showing "key formation diagram"
are the same on purpose.

We've asked ever-helpful Ed Roback at NIST about it but 
no answer yet.

Amazingly, thanks to Vanessa Talieri, NSA has cheerfully 
Fedexed us a hardcopy, due in tomorrow.
