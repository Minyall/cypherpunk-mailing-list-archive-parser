There's been some suggestion that the Filegate files
included a lot of Republicans in compromising positions,
which is keeping some of them better behaved than
they might otherwise be (even if they don't know if
the files include them, they may still be worried.)
It's not clear if this includes the picture
of Orrin Hatch that's rumoured to be floating around Salt Lake.

It's all a bunch of bogus pomp anyway :-)
