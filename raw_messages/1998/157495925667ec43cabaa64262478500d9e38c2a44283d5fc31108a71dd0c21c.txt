INTERNET PROVIDER NOT LIABLE FOR MESSAGES OF ITS CUSTOMERS

An appeals court in Florida has ruled against a woman who sued 
America Online because one of its customers, a convicted sex 
offender, used an AOL chat group to try to sell the woman's 
11-year-old son a pornographic video. The court said that federal law 
protects online services from being held liable for the messages 
transmitted by their members sell the videotape of the boy. The 
defeated lawsuit, which is being appealed to the Supreme Court, tried 
to characterize America Online as "a home shopping network for 
pedophiles and child pornographers."  (AP/Washington Post 15 Oct 98)
