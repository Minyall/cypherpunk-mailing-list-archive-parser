"Yes, the president should resign.  He has lied to the American people,
time and time again, and betrayed their trust.  Since he has admitted guilt,
there is no reason to put the American people through an impeachment.

He will serve absolutely no purpose in finishing out his term, the only
possible solution is for the president to save some dignity and resign."

- From 12th Congressional District Hopeful William Jefferson Clinton
during the Nixon investigations
