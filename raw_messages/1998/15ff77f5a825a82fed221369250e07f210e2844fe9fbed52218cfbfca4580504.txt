In this particular case, it's not censorship to point out that the original
posted might get more complete and accurate information by consulting a
simple chemistry text[1] than by posing his question in a forum where
most people don't give a flying fuck about simple chemistry questions.
(He also wouldn't waste evebody's fucking time, but he clearly gives
even less of a fling fuck about other people's time than about his
own fucking time.)

[1] One really Good Thing Jim Bell could do while on probation is to
write a good simple chemistry book. "Stink Bombs for Dummies"
"How to make mustard gas in your own kitchen"
