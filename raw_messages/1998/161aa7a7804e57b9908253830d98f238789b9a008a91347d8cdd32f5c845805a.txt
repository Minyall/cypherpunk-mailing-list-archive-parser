Q for you CPunks: did PGP v.5.5.3i was truly peer-reviewed for flaws or 
backdoors?  If not, which is that last version that was?

Is is not about the right to be free, it is about govt organizing seriously to 
deny that right.   :-S


OK, I'll stop.  No problemo Bill.  OTOH, I will still post articles with 
relevance to crypto from the list or elsewhere.

Some of thoses articles will possibly have nothing to do with crypto except 
that they will be modifications or subtleties of ITAR.

Just so you know: I spend a lot of keystrokes teaching PGP to various peoples 
nowadays...

Ciao all C'Punks.
