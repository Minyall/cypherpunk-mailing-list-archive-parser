I went to a cypherpunks meeting in Mtn View last Saturday. I was
hesitant because I expected a multimedia, in-your-face version of the
list. Surprise!!! This crew is smart, experienced, rational and they are
actually working. Even though the topic of the day, IPSEC and secure
DNS, is not a technical area that I know or care to learn right now, I
was impressed. 

Night and day : list and meeting. When a project comes along that
interests me, I'm in. 

Regards,
Mike

ps - I wish I could offer legal expertise or lots of money *when* the
Constitutional battle over domestic controls gets more direct.
