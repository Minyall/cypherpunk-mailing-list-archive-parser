>From Alia Johnson <lodi@well.com>, CJ's sister, today:

I'm writing to say that CJ has arrived at the Springfield Medical
Referral Center, where he will be held for a month or more (the 
phone says U.S.  Medical Center for Federal Prisoners) for 
"examination". 

Here is the address:  

            Carl E. Johnson
			Register # 05987-196
             U.S. Medical Center for Federal Prisoners
	          P.O. Box 4000
             Springfield, Missouri  65801

Also, to my delight, I received a letter from him today. He sounds okay.

CJ in his letter asks for physical mailing addresses for some of the
cypherpunks (no one specifically) so that he can send you things to 
post since I will be travelling.
