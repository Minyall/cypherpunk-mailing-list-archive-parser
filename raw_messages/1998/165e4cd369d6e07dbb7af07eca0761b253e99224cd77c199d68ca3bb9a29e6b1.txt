>      sharpshooter to stand trial on a state manslaughter charge for the
>      death of white separatist Randy Weaver's wife in the 1992 siege at

>      The U.S. Justice Department decided in 1994 against prosecuting Lon

>      of involuntary manslaughter.
>      
>      Magistrate Judge Quentin Harden decided there was probable cause to
>      bring Horiuchi to trial on the state charge. Harden scheduled a
>      February 13 arraignment before state Judge James Michaud.
>      
>      A federal judge is to hear arguments Monday from Horiuchi's lawyers
>      in Boise that the case should be transferred to federal court.
