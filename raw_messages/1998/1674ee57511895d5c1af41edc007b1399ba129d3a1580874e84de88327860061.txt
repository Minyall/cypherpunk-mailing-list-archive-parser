It says "lawful authorisation" not "search warrant".

That means that sometime later they can go back and
pass another law that says that "lawful authorisation" for
forcing one to reveal one's plaintext or keys is something
much less stringent than a search warrant.
Most proposed US crypto regulations have similar weasel-words.
