MG: you will find most people here will disagree with you.
cyberspace is very, very weak without crypto. when you
think about it, 98% of cyberspace is the "stuff between
the wires". the other 2% are the people on each end.
now, crypto protects the 98%, but agreed, the 2% is
still vulnerable.

this is nothing anyone cares about in the cyberspatial world.
these are thing that happen outside of cyberspace.
the bigtime issue is internet
commerce, security of your mail. how about if someone reads your
mail to steal your money?

no, I'd say it's downright patriotic <g>

p.s.-- can you quote to me how many billions go to the nsa every
year? and would you care to calculate how much of your own
salary  from your paycheck is sent to them?  and you think
you are getting your money's worth? rather than paying someone
to hold you down?
