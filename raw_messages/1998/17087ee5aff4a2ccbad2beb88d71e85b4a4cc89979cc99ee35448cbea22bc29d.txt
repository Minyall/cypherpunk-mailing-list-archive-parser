I do not see where the cooperation of the ISP would be required, unless the 
user had used fictitious or obviously false names and company names (where 
required) for the registration of the programs in question.

I for one, find the claims that M$ is doing this entirely believable, it is 
well within the capability of the program to perform this function without the 
user being aware.

what I want to know is, is it just Win98 that does this, or does Win95 (any 
version) with Ie4 do this also???

Reeza!
