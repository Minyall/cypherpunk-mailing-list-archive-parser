Perpetual motion machines built on violations of thermodynamics involving
hemispherical and ellipsoidal mirrors have been around for years.  They
don't work.

The objects do not change temperature.

Trace a ray from each object.  In every direction, it hits an object which
is at exactly the same temperature as it is.  It may be itself, or it may
be the other object.  But in each case, the temperature is the same in all
directions.  The "sky" is the same temperature as the object, so it does
not change temperature.
