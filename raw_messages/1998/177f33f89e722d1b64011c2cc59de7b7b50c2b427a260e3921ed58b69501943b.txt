No, my definition is the same as it always was.  Maybe you didn't realize
how wide it was.

It is my definition, if others agree, that's their business.  I'm not asking
the courts to do shit about it however.

It is theft, and I do call the cops, or rather in this case the ISP's involved.
The problem is they can't do much as the messages are sent from throw away
accounts.

Show me your spam filters.  Do you not have at least one individual's name
in that list whose messages you route to a folder of trash or delete outright?
I seem to recall that was the case quite a while back with a certain "Doctor".

Indeed, even you make decisions about what is or isn't spam based on WHO sends
it.  In this case, you, not thousands, not tens o thousands of others is making
a decision on what is or isn't spam because you don't care for it.
