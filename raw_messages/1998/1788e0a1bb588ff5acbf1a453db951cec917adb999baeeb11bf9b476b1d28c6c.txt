It's an interesting problem, and I doubt there's a consensus on strength,
in particular, on how much randomness is left after you take a
random sample out of the system.  I'd feel much better if you
also ran the output through a keyed hash before giving it to anyone
(e.g. run pairs or triples of 64-bit blocks plus a private salt through MD5.)
With a perfectly strong RNG, the output should also be perfectly strong,
though with a weak RNG, the block cypher does add some correlation.

You definitely should trash the initial outputs, until you've added
enough bits of real randomness that the block chaining step has
probably accumulated a whole block's worth of randomness.
Otherwise, the first round of block cypher is an ECB on a small
set of input data (e.g. 64 possible values of one 1 and 63 0s
fed into a DES cracker.)
