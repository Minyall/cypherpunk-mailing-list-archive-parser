Senator Kyl has issued a long report, "Crime, Terror &
War: National Security and Public Safety in the Information
Age," which recounts his Subcommittee's hearings and 
recommendations on encryption, Y2K, terrorism, info war,
domestic preparedness, wiretap, and more:

It describes a plan to combat threats to critical infrastructure
and the US homeland which, if implemented, would criminalize
much held dear to a few of this list's subscribers; other lurkers
will be overjoyed to read Kyl coming to the rescue of careers 
and budgets of MIB and their suppliers of technological of
political control. 

He wants DoD to get cracking on domestic protection, move over 
piddling LEA. Civil liberties, nonsense. Crypto genie out of the bottle, 
more nonsense. Getting government access to encrypted 
communications, you bet. Through commercial products, yep.

Thanks to FT for forwarding.
