Very true. I thought about this too. The question that I ask is, 
how much $$ am I worth to whoever might want to snoop at me? And
then I spend money/time (my time is freely convertible to money)
accordingly.

Well, I personally hate these signs, they are very unfriendly.

Hmmm, nice point. 

Now... Just curious, if I simply make my study into a faraday cage via
use of fine (< 1/2 inch) chicken wire, and insulate my power system from
the computer emenations, would that be enough? Chicken wire is not that
expensive, and I think that I could make it look nice on walls.
