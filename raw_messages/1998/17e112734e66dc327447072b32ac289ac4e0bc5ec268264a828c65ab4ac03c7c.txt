How many gallons of gasoline can you raise on an acre?

Actualy the point I was trying to make is that it's comparing apples and
oranges. Until it's in a dollars/gallon for each of them format no real
worthwhile comparison can be made.

Well don't forget crop rotation since the hemp is going to deplete the soil
if you simply grow three crops a year (which is possible this far south).
There is also the issue of water, hemp is a plant that needs lots of water
and is very sensitive to light levels/times, tempearture and pH. Hemp also
leeches nitrogen quite heavily.
