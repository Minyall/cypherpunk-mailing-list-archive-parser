I love the SPACE ALIENS stuff : it's like the X-files on a druggie's
version of a Long Island Iced Tea. The politics are agreeable and
predictable. The up-to-the-minute news and the entertainment is fun but
there's really not much that is technical happening here.

Is there a coderpunks mail archive available anywhere? The URL that I've
found has been down for too long.

How about a list of ongoing projects?

When is the next CP meeting?
