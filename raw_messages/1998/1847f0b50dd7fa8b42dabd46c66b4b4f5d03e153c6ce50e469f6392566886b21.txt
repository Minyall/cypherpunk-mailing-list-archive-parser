Libertarians are well aware of the need for government, they are also
aware of the dangers to personal freedom that governments represent. The
goal of the Libertarians is to provide a system that minimizes government
and maximizes personal freedom. In the US this system takes the form of a
Constitutionally limited government (ie: the US Constitution interpreted
as a limiting document not an enabling one).

Anarchism does not work. It is a pipe dream much like Communism that only
leads to Totalitarianism.
