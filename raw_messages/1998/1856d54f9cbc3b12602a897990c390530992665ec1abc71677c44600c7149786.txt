The way I see it, the problem with spam isn't that it takes too much
effort to delete them, but that it discourages useful advertisement
through email. Email could be a very efficient way for companies to send
valuable information to potential customers, but the incentives are such
that virtually all unsolicited commercial email are of very low value
and are deleted without being read. 

If you like game theory, you might want to search the cypherpunks mailing
list archive for a game theoretic analysis of the spam situation.
