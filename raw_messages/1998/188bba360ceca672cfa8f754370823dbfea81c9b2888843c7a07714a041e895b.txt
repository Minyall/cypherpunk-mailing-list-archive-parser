Thank you for slumming on our list.

And thank you for reminding me to keep my lowly political stuff off of the
"good" lists....I needed that reminder to keep my filth here on
"cypherpunks."

BTW, "toad.com" is not one of the distributed lists. I guess you've been so
busy "writing code" that you are still ignorant of this transition.

Well, if Ron Brown is put in jail they'll have to dig up the casket
containing the couple of pounds of what they found of him when his plane
hit that hillside near Sarajevo a couple of years ago.

You'd have known this, and the rest of that well-reported story cited
above, had you gotten off your "don't pollute the coderpunks" high horse
and actually read some political stuff.

Oh, and what code have you written lately?
