Looks for a real opportunity for civil liberty groups to sponsor Cellular
Crowds gatherings. By this I mean a place where people can exchange
pre-paid cellular phones. Since they are becoming a commodity (cost,
features, etc.) I wouldn't mind swapping mine for someone elses as long as
the amount on the card is the same. Pre-paid air time is still at quite a
premium and roaming is generally restricted, but improving all the time.
