ABQ J 9/24/98 
Iran May Withdraw
Writer's Death Threat

LONDON - Author Salman
Rushdie met with British Foreign
Office officials Wednesday amid
reports Iran is preparing to
withdraw the threat on his life.
The late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini pronounced a "fatwa," death sentence, 
against Rushdie in
1989 after the publication of his
book "Satanic Verses," which many
Muslims deemed blasphemous.
Islamic militants then put a $2
million bounty on Rushdie's head,
forcing the author to live largely in
under British police protection.

I THINK that I heard tonight and saw 
Rushie's picture on TV that the above
was called off.

Progress.

I am reading again your stuff at
http://www.jya.com/filth-spot.htm

Let's all hope for release of the requested documents
and SETTLEMENT.
