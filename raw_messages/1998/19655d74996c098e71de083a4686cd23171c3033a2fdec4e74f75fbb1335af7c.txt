Sealand, about which I wrote about on this list before, was an example 
that should be studied by the offshore advocates. Based in an old 
oilrig housing platform, some unlucky investors attempted to establish 
their own country. They began issuing stamps and passports for their 
"country". As any reasonable person should have expected, nobody would 
move their mail and nobody recognized their passports.

They went bankrupt.
