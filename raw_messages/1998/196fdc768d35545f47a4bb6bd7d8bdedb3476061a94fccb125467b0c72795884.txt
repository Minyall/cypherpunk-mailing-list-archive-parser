What part of Petro's response did you fail to understand? THe "elder 
Kennedy" is not on trail. A grand jury is convened to determine if enough 
evidence exists to bring trail. Those brought before a grand jury are 
almost always witnesses, or potential witnesses, as is the elder Kennedy.

A grand jury hearing and a criminal trail are two completely seperate 
processes. All the grand jury can do is determine whether or not to 
indite, whereupon the accused has the right to a fair trail before a jury 
as you state.

Anyway, the injustice in this matter is that the two most likely 
suspects, who were both dating the victim up to her death, have never 
been brought to trial. Just another abuse by america's "royal family."

The murder weapon was a golf club belonging to, as I recall, the father 
of one of the boys. Both boys were seen with her on the night of her 
death. No trial for over twenty years, plenty of expensive legal 
manuvering to prevent one. And now Jim complaining that a single judge is 
insufficient to determine if an inditement should be handed down.

Perhaps prof. Froomkin is reading the list and can pass on an informed 
legal opinion? I've never seen any regulations baring a judge from 
serving in the capacity of a grand jury, OTOH, IANAL.
