Which BSD are you talking about? From my personal and professional
experience, OpenBSD, NetBSD and FreeBSD proved to be just as stable (and
OpenBSD even more stable and reliable) than Linux. All three of them are
open-source. The OpenBSD project emphasizes the importance of security and
cryptography, and since it ships from Canada there are few export
restrictions. 

Take a look at http://www.openbsd.org/crypto.html for more info.

I hope you meant BSD/OS when you mentioned BSD :-)
