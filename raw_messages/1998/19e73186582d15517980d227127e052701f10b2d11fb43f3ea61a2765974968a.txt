Yeah, let me give you the first rule of acceptable user policies.  Users
shall not spam a maillist multiple times with the same damn request,
because a) their question is a lot less likely to be answered by
annoyed listmembers, and b) said annoyed listmembers will probably
end up mailing the user's ISP and complaining, resulting in
disciplinary action against said abusive user.

Before you start formulating an acceptable user policy, why don't you
go spend some time in news.announce.newusers and learn some
netiquette.
