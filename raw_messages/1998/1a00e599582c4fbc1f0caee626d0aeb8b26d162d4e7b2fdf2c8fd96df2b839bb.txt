I remember discussing the changes with a friend around 1991. At the time
I was reading the changes noted to the law in IRS publication no. 17. I
believe it is also noted on Form 1040 (look in the area used for
children's SSN, it should be ref. in the instructions). Between the two
of these, you should get a pointer to the code, and all of these are
available online. The IRS is the only agency, that I have know, of using
this law and, again, I think that congress made it law c. '91.
