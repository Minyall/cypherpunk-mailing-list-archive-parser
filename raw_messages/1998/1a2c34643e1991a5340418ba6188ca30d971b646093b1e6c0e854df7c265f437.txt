You could challenge the patent, and probably win, for less than $10
million.  There is quite a bit of prior art that Chaum neglected to
disclose, especially a certain incident where Chaum, as editor of
Crypto '84 proceedings, tried to supress part of ElGamal's paper which
discussed 'signature conversion' (aka blind signatures).
