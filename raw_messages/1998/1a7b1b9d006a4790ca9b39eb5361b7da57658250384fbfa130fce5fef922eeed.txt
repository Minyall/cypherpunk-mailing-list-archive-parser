Wouldn't that be fixed if the state lost its monopoly on
power?  Distribute power and the abusers can't have it
all.  While it may be easy to hookwink the masses with
propaganda (without internet/etc), once force monopoly
power withers it will be difficult to convince Joe Blow
to agree to something obviously not in his best interests.

Or something like that...
