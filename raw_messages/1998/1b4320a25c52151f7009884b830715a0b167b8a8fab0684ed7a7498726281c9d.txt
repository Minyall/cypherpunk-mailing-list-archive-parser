There has been quite a bit of discussion on the list of late regarding
covert radio communication. I've been doing some investigation and have
identified a promising low probablity of intercept technology for
terrestrial, ground-to-air and earth-to-satellite communication. I'd like
to assemble a small team to build and test a proof of concept. Anyone with
interest and skillsplease contact me?
