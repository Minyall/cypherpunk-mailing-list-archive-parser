Mailbombing could be a criminal offence.
But libel is a civil and not a criminaloffence.
Under The Communications Decency Act S.230(a) no service provider is 
liable for content authored by others.
Even if someone use a remailer to  slander and libel further action 
requires private civil action.
There is absolute no reason for being concerned about defamation from the 
operator point of view.
The Fourth Circuit Court upheld the service provider impunity defence in 
a recent case
brought against American Online Inc. (Zeran v. American Online Inc.).
However,if a moderator vulunterable approves a libelous message the case 
could be different.
BTW, am I correct that criminal libel in no longer considered constitutional?
