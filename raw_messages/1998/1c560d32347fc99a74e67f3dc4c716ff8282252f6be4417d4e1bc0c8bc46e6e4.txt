Okay, I'd like to set up a remailer - but I don't know where to start! Unfortunatly it's going to have to run on an NT 4.0 box, so the winsock remailer is out of the question, right? And I'm not in the US, so I can't use the juno stuff -- so what (if anything) *can* I use?

Thanks for any help...
