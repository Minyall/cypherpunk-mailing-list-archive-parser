	Well this far in the USA we do not have such a law :<
We should that way stupid fools that spill hot coffee on themselves will
not try to sue McDonalds for over 1.2 Million$ because the coffee was to
hot...   Go figure, hot coffee is not supposed to be hot.

Many other countries have laws that if your bring a case to court and
loose you pay the fees of the one you sued.  Any folks from around the
world that can attest to how your country handles cases?
