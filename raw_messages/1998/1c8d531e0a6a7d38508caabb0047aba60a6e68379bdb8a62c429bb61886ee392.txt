Yeah.  The times I've known the facts in cop-vs-citizen cases,
the cops have often been lying; I have to assume that they're often lying
in cases when I don't know the facts as well.  Of course, getting
somebody with that kind of attitude about cops onto a jury 
is somewhat unlikely, but occasionally you'll find neutrals.
				Thanks!
