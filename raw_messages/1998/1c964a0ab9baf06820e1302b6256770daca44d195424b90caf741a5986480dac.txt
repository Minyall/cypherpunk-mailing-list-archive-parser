The commies I've known are even less tolerant:

Just another regulatory book burning.  (Oops, book *pulping* burning is
environmentally incorrect.

There are plenty of commies itching to fine me, fire me, or lock me up for
criticizing congresscritters within 6 months of an election (campaign
finance reform), refusing to attend their re-education and self criticism
sessions (racial/sexual harassment awareness training), or mailing a number
10 envelope customers (illegal medical device labeling - I kid you not). 

A fundie admin would issue fewer total regs than a commie-liberal admin
(experience suggests) so freedom would be in better shape on balance.
Chart the annual pages of the Federal Register issued by Dems vs Reps.
Dems are *way* out in front.  Taxes would almost certainly be lower
(Clinton's are the highest in peacetime history).

I wouldn't worry.  If we survived Clinton we can survive the Republicans.
Meanwhile the Presidency has been weakened.
