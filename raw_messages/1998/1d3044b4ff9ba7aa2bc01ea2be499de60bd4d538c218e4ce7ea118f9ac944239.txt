Completely illogical. Give me one good reason not to lead with your best
punch? I suspect Starr's work is voluminous but weak on all other counts
so he led with what would create the most publicity. I've said that I'm
no great fan of Clinton's but this entire investigation is blatantly
partisan and has brought the political process in this country about as
low as it is possible to bring it. 

Starr's base approach to justice is the opening shot of what I hope
turns into an all-out scorched-earth battle. Let 'em all fall down. I'm
just afraid that when it's over the only people who will be willing to
run for public office will be truly dangerous people who have no respect
for liberty not of their own definition.
