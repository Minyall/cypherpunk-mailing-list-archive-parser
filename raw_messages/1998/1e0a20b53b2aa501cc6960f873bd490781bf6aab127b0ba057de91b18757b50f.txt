"From: Steve Camfield, SME Board of Directors


It is my privilege to formally invite you to become certified in sales or marketing 
management.  Certification sends a clear message to your customers and colleagues 
that you are a true professional and have surpassed the highest standards of education, 
experience, and knowledge.

For your convenience, I have placed full certification details and answers to questions 
you may have at www.selling.org  (see Certification).

 inquiry, or suggestion by a local SME chapter board member but you may ensure removal 
by pressing the "Remove" option at the bottom of www.selling.org.
