I strongly, emphatically, disagree with the reasoning used here by Jim

"So far it has not done so."

This "argument based on utilitarian need" is at odds with the First
Amendment. The notion that a form of speech in letters and phone calls and
conversations could be compelled because, say, the government concludes
that it is needed to stop some criminal actions, is ludicrous.

A policy requiring certain forms of speech is no different from a policy
saying the government may enter a house when it wishes.

I am drawing the parallel with the Fourth deliberately: no amount of
"study," even a study by such august persons as Denning and Baugh, could
ever conclude that wholesale, unwarranted searches are permissable. The
Fourth was put in just to stop such broad conclusions.

Likewise, the First is clearly directed against such broad restrictons on
speech (and religion, and assembly, and complaining (petitioning)) so that
no "study" can be used to broadly restrict speech.

And make no mistake about it, whatever the accepted arguments for
restricting certain types of speech (notoriously, the "Fire!" example) are,
they are not consistent with a broad requirement that persons face
imprisonment if they speak in codes, or fail to use transparent envelopes,
or disconnect the microphones in their homes!

Bluntly pu, "FUCK "DEMONSTRATED NEED"!"

And what if Denning and Baugh had reached other conclusions? (As well they
might, next year, when crypto is more widely deployed.)

I have strongly argued over the years against ever using some "government
study" as the basis for our arguments, even when the studies appear to
support our position.

What the studies giveth, the studies can taketh away.
