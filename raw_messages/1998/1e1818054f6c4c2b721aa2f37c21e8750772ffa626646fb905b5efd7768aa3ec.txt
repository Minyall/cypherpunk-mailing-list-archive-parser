Well, if it was 40 grams of NaOH and 36.5 grams of HCl, then you 
would have 18 grams of water and 58.5 grams of NaCl.  With 1g HCl to 
.5g NaOH, well, you have an acidic, salty, mess.  However, HCl 
is a gas at STP, and NaOH is a solid...

Basically, it's an incredibly poorly worded question.
