Schneier, Wagner and Kelsey have done some work on an authenticating
camera.

One issue to be concerned with is that what the camera sees is not
always the truth.  Putting a film set together to film bigfoot is
easy.  The fact that the film is authenticated as having come from the
camera doesn't mean a whole lot in some cases.
