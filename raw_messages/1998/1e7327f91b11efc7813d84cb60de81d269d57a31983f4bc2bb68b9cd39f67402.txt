I was very careful to phrase my points in terms of how I _hope_ to respond
in a certain way, not claiming I have in the past or know I will in the
future. Maybe I'll wimp out, maybe I'll offer to tell them everything I
know about the Politician Removal Lottery, maybe I'll open up on them with
my shotgun. Who knows?

My point, parallel to Duncan's, is that talking to narcs and cops almost
always never helps the accused. If one's goal is to help the prosecution,
then by all means talk to the prosecution's investigators.

As for the general points, Duncan and several others have made these kinds
of common sense points in the past...even when you were subscribed to the
list. For example, some folks even carry a "What to do if questioned by the
police" card in their wallet, to either read from--assuming this is
allowed--or to reread occasionally as a reminder.

You, apparently having had personal contact with either one or both of the
parties, and living in the state where both cases are centered, might have
anticipated questioning by the cops.

Don't understimate the help that a helpful person provides.
