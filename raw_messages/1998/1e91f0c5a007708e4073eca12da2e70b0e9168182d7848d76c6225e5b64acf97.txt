My mistake.  Sometimes when you're reading a post that's been re-quoted
several times, it gets confusing as to who posted what.

I don't see a power imbalance here.  If a young woman in her 20's
invitingly flashes her thong panties at a man, I don't see how she can be
portrayed as the victim.  The only way that the issue of power arises is
that Monica was not overwhelmed by someone in power - she was attracted to
the power.

On another but connected note, explain why Monica saved that dress!  I
found this little tidbit to be the "yuck" factor...
