It doesn't matter. In fact this is the smartest thing they 
could have done.  Given their recent financial predicament 
and the level of competence and cluefulness they have shown 
in the past, I am amazed they didn't let inertia and their 
investment in the anti-civilization (and pointy haired 
managers) hold them back. 

I feel that Microsoft's extremely determined attempts to corner 
the browser market has forced them to stop evading reality 
for a while. They seem to have realized that the best model 
for their business is Caldera/Redhat/Stronghold model. To add
value to already existing free software that adheres to an open 
standard. Releasing Netscape 5 code will effectively ensure 
them a standard to capitalize on. 

Best, 
Vipul

   this guy first suggested that netscape should go GPL (on january 12) 
   and predicted they'll do it right away.
