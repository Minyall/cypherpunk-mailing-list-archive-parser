Heh - West Coast Cypherpunks end up on Japanese TV :-)

Good article.  If you're trying to emphasize the financial stuff, 
moving it up to the beginning would help, but I don't know the audience 
you wrote it for.  A few nitpicks:

_Bell_ Labs, and BTW they developed one of the first 8-bit microprocessors;
the MAC-8 was used for building telephone things back in late 4004 days.
However, the Electro-Mechanical telephone switch was Not Invented Here -
Strowger developed it to protect privacy and increase reliability
(he suspected that a competitor had bribed the telephone operator to
connect customers to the competitor's business instead of Strowger's.)
He offered it for sale to the Bell Telephone Companies, who were too
clueless to see the economics and buy it; they caught on a few years later,
and had to pay tons of money to the competitor who'd licensed the patent.

The difficulty, of course, is that geodesic markets with bearer 
instruments make it easy to do business anonymously - so everyone
may know that fraud was committed, but not know who committed it.
(Like the US political excuse "Mistakes were made".)
The lack of need for accounts and reputation capital is part of what
makes geodesic markets financially advantageous.  On the other hand,
reconciling these differences is complex enough that cryptographers
and financial folks can make big bucks getting it right :-)
				Thanks!
