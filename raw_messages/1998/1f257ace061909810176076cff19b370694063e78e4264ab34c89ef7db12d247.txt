Well, if it's used only for spam, get it on some block lists.

Well, it's pretty easy to harass or otherwise push someone off of the Net (I
guess that's why we've got Eternity servers and anonymous remailers)...do a
traceroute and an Internic whois. This will reveal his/her/its/their upstream
provider (a hop or two before the end of the traceroute or as a contact on the
whois results), among other things.

Well, although I don't think this would be warranted for anything short of an
emergency, you could try a more direct DoS attack by hacking, death threats, or
DoS Politics, or you could try to get more powerful entities than yourself
pissed off at the spammer. Like I said, though, I don't think it's wise to
start a Scientology-esque netwar whenever an ISP turns you a deaf ear. Can't
imagine being a remailer operator trying to defend against all this, though...
