	Also, that things are kept secret/unpublished NOW doesn't mean that
they won't be released when the product ships.

	Not knowing anything about this company, they may have seen a novel
way to put existing tools/methods together, and are doing Q/A, interface,
and marketing work, and don't want to publicize their methods _yet_ because
they COULD be beat to market by a product that has less
documentation/Testing/etc.

	If they seem willing to release the algorythm, and essential parts
of the source code, they might have at least a bit of a clue, if Mr.
Schneier is willing to bet reputation capital on it, I'd be hesitant to cry
"Snake oil". At least the first time.
