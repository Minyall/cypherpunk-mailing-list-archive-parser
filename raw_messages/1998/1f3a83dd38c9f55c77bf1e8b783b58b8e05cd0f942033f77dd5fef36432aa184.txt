One of the earliest reports on NSA's global electronic 
interception program appeared in Ramparts magazine
in 1972, which published a lengthy interview with a
young former NSA analyst, "U.S. Electronic Espionage:
A Memoir":

James Bamford, Duncan Campbell, Nicky Hager and others 
have since confirmed what the analyst revealed then and 
greatly extended what was at the time doubted as a young 
man's anti-war exaggeration. 

NSA, according to Bamford, decided to not prosecute in the 
hope that no one would believe such astonishing claims of 
electronic violation of friends and foes. See The Puzzle Palace,
p. 334 (paper editon).

Bamford says Perry Fellwock was the name of the anonymous 
analyst, first called Winslow Peck, a pseudonym. Would anyone
happen to know where Fellwock is these days? That's on the
assumption that Fellwock is not a deeper pseudo than Peck.

What knocked me over was Fellwock saying that the location of 
the NSA training school was at Goodfellow Air Force Base, 
San Angelo, Texas, from whence this counterspy originates. 
We were told the base was mothballed, kept pickled only for
local pork. 

No doubt, NSA was never there, and "Fellwock" was just 
continuing to do his disinfo job via Ramparts.
