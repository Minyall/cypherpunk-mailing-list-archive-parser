My suggestion is not to alter the card such that a visual inspection would
show. In most states it's a felony to modify or alter a drivers license,
they are considered the property of the state and not yours personaly.

Next time a cop asks for ID and you hand him your d.l. you could be in for a
lot more than  couple hundred dollars and a ticket.

Anywhere from a few hundred bytes to a k. Depends on the bit density of the
tape. Go down to your local electronics or audio supply and get a polarized
loupe and count them.
