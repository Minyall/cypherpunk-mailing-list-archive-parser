Satirization or prophesy, the walls are coming down. Whether they be the
borders of  nationstates or the dna of species, the boundaries that once
defined are now dissolving. Look for transgenic terrorists to engineer terror
down to the genetic level. Psilocybin from Saccharomyces, now that'll make a
heady wine. Developments along these lines are advancing in Brazil and South
Africa. Freeze dried packets (with psychedelic holographic label designs) are
available via mail order to csychomimetic enologists.
