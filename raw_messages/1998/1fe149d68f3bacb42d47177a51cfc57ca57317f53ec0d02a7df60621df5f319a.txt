There's another spin to this too.

Since men apparently aren't raped if they get an erection, then it 
follows that women aren't raped if they lubricate. You could take it one
step farther, and say that neither sex can claim rape if the victim has
an orgasm or if they get aroused in *any way*.

Courts never cease to amaze me.
