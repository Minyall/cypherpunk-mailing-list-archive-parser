Of course, you can always download a copy of NFR and watch as the traffic

Subject: Request for Web Browser Information

I would like to know the information my browser makes available to web sites. I use both Netscape and 
Internet Explorer.

Obviously web sites can determine my IP address for any given session; they can also look at cookies left 
by themselves and other sites.

Can anyone point me to where I can learn exactly what other information is made available (browser 
version?, OS version?, system name?, user name?, etc.)?

Thanks in advance.

David
