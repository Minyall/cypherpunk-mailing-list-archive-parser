Under an "anarcho-whatever" people are left to their own devices. This
leaves them free to do anything, including institute governments, pass
laws, form unions, inject themselves with battery acid, shoot everyone
wearing glasses, and climb towers to pick off passers-by with a
high-velocity rifle. What people on both extremes seem to miss is that
the world is already, and always has been, an anarchy; the experiment is
ongoing, and so far "all of the above" is the outcome. 

Cheers,
Frank O'Dwyer.
