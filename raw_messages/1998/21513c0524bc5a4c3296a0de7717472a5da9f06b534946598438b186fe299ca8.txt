Jeez, this is not "ChemPunks."

Calculating exothermic and endothermic yields (measured in "kcal/mole") for
various chemistry reactions was a central part of my sophomore chemistry
class in high school 30 years ago.

I suggest the question askers consult any of the most basic chemistry
textbooks.

union and unity and yoke in English, yugo in Slavic languages (hence
Yugoslavia), and yoga in Sanskrit.
