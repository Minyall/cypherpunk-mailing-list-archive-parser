The interference that laptops can cause with avionics is 
prima facie evidence that laptops are not quiet.

They are not missing the periodic pixel clocking signals though.

Yes, but cables radiate.  Wires are antennae.  Used to be a big problem
when laptops had wired mice.

BTW, in van Eck's original paper, he gives a way to make screen spying
a little tougher: pick random raster-lines to draw instead of the usual
order.  This of course would not be a significant barrier to modern
interception.

Enrico Fermi used to tune a regular music radio to a cyclotron(?) so he
could tell
that it was working, I've read.
