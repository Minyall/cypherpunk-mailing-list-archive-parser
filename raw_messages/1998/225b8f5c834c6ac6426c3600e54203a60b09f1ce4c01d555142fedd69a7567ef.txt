Netscape just announced that they're going to release the source code 
to Communicator 5.0 with a license that allows modification and 
redistribution "in the heritage of the GNU Public License."  No 
details on the specific license yet, but it sounds *very* hopeful.

The point is... we *will* be able to add all the funky new features 
we want.  Complaining about the browser will no longer be acceptable 
now that we will be able to *do* something about it.  It also means 
that Microsoft will get to compete head-to-head with a real free 
software model.  This is an excellent opportunity to demonstrate what 
the free software model can do.  I can already envision non-Netscape 
"distributions," custom browser modifications for big customers, etc.
