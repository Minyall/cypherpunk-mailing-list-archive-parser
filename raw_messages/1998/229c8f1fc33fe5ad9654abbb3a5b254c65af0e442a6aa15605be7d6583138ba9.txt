If you will review that again, you will find that the barb was directed
towards persons other than the President. I may not like THAT man, but I
still must respect the Office and position he holds. I was not calling for
a sanction of the president. I was suggesting in very blunt terms that
various of his supporters would do the world a favor by getting off (of
it). Especially the ones who rationalize and dismiss his various (and
multiple) piccadilloes because he supports their pet social project.
