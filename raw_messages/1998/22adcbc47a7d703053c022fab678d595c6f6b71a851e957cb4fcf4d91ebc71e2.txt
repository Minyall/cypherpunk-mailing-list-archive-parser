Eric Hughes, secretly writing Prologue 15/0 of SPACE ALIENS HIDE MY
DRUGS,
   quoted L.M. Boyd as saying:

 Among black bears, a mother rules a territory. When her
daughter is a year and a half old, the mother assigns a
portion of the territory to said daughter. This doesn't
happen to the black bear son. When he's about three years
old, he's just flatout driven off the property. Look,
there's one down at the end of the bar, saying, "My mommy
kicked me out when I was three."
