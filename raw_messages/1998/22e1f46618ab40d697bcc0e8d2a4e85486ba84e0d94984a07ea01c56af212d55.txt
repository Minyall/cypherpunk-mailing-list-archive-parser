In a further blatant erosion of Constitutional rights, the California
Supreme Court has ruled that a person owing child support who fails to
seek or accept work may be jailed and fined for contempt of court, and
that this does not violate any Constitutional bans on involuntary
servitude or imprisonment for debt. 
 
This reverses nearly a century of contrary rulings.  Look for this
"improved" interpretation to be expanded to other kinds of debts and
judgments as well, as soon as massive public acceptance of it for the
carefully picked child support issue is engineered. 
 
The credit card companies are no doubt carefully analyzing this decision
as we speak.
