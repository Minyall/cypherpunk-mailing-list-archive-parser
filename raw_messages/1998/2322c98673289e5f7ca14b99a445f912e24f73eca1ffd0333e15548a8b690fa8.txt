    what I said was that I am _personally_ against abortion;  and,
    yes, I _personally_ consider it a offense against our God; but,
    I do not go so far as to say it is murder in the social context; 
    I do believe that is not my privilege to tell another they can
    not commit the sin of "choosing when their legs went in the 
    air"; and, abortion statistics show that the vast majority of
    abortions are for "mistakes" or failure of birth control. keep
    in mind, the extreme right has also been campaigning to
    eliminate the availability of birth control --which then raises
    the abortion rate... and, if you want to shade the argument,
    should all abortion be illegal?  date rape? rape? deformity?
    downs syndrome, bifidia? health of the mother?

    yes, let's drop the subject as there is no solution.  

    few can debate the issue calmly, or even intelligently. I just
    look at abortion as a fact of society that has been with us for
    milleniums; you cant stop it any more than Prohibition was
    successful, or the War on Drugs has been successful.  why does
    the government continue the war on drugs? simple, it's
    profitable for them in many ways (as the largest vendor, if
    nothing else). 

    besides, if we want to have a pissing contest, I am as far right
    as it goes --with one exception: I dont want to change anyone!
    we call it "free-agency" --them that wish to go to Hell, line 
    up on the left! --or dont, if you do not wish to-- the choice
    is yours.

    'nuff said!
