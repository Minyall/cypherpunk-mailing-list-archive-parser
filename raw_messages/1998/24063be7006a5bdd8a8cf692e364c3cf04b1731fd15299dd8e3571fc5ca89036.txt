Subject:  News on Wassenaar anyone?




Does anyone have information on the new Wassenaar arrangement, or
information on when official information will be available?

I'm only interested in the crypto parts, and I have already read the
Aaron/Reuter story found on
http://www.crypto.com/reuters/show.cgi?article=912708583

Thanks
