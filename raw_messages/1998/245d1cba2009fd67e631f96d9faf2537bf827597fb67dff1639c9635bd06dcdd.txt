Cypherpunks meeting is almost always at the same time,
but often changes locations, depending on the availability of meeting places
and the whims of the organizers :-)  This month, we'll be meeting in
Berkeley, and as usual I'd appreciate anybody suggesting topics
they'd like to talk about there.

				Thanks!
