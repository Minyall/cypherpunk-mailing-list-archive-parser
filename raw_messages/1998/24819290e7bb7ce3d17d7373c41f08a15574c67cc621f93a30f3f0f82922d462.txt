I decided to do an objective experiment to prove or disprove the 
validity of 'Magical Thinking'.
I shut my eyes and concentrated on psychically willing my TV to provide
me with an indisputably meaningful message relevant to my life.

I turned on the TV, to a random channel, just in time to see/hear 
Dorothy and the ScareCrow singing, "If I Only Had A Brain."

Conclusion: Magical Thinking is BullShit!
