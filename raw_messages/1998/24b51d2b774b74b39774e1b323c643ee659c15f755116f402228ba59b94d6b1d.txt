Hi,

I just started to read about cryptography and during my readings I found a
small problem
probably not very hard but I just don't know how to solve it. My number
theory knowledge is very limited.

a = b/c and
d = b/(b mod c)

I would like to demonstrate that gcd(a,d) = 1 and a*d>=b for any b and c
values(assuming b mod c != 0) is true or false through
logical induction.

Is there someone that could give me a hint ?

TIA
