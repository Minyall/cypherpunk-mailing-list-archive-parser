   WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The following was released
today by Prima Publishing:

   Chinese authorities have refused to allow three publishing
houses to translate a new book -- "The Clinton Syndrome, The
President and the Self-Destructive Nature of Sexual Addiction" by
California-based Prima Publishing. The book takes a clinical look
at the life and behavior of Bill Clinton and explains why the
president would risk his presidency for a sexual relationship with
an intern.

   "We have been told that the Chinese government does not want to
make a book of this kind available in China because they consider
it unfavorable to President Clinton," says Robin Taylor, rights
associate at Prima Publishing. "The Chinese authorities apparently
don't understand why Americans treat their president just like any
other person and allow citizens to write about their government
leaders."

   In "The Clinton Syndrome," Jerome D. Levin, Ph.D., a
psychotherapist, addictions specialist and professor, assesses the
character of a man so driven by a sexual addiction that he would
risk his presidency to fulfill a desperate need for reassurance and
validation of his worth.

   Prima does not consider the Clinton Syndrome an "anti-Clinton"
book. In fact, Dr. Levin voted for President Clinton twice and
agrees with his policies. But he still believes the president is in
serious need of help for a classic case of sexual addiction.

   "We work with foreign publishers around the world on numerous
books," says Taylor. "Never have we had the subject matter of
a book impede its publication in a foreign country. But I guess
it's understandable when you consider the relationship between the
Clinton administration and the current Chinese government."

   "The Clinton Syndrome," published by Prima Publishing of
Rocklin, Calif., is available in bookstores nationwide. For more
information or to schedule an interview with Dr. Jerome D. Levin or
a Prima spokesman, please call Ciana Banister at 800-536-5920.
