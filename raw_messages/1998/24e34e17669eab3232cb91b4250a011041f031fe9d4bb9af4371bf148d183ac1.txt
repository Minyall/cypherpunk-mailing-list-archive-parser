    It isn't surprising that people who want to write non-free software
    are disappointed that the GNU project won't help them.  What is
    amazing is that they feel this is unfair.  They have no intention of
    letting me use their source code in my programs--so why should they be
    entitled to use my source code in their programs?  These people seem
    to think that their selfishness entitles them to special treatment.

This is faulty logic.  I may wish to write some code for free, that
is, have the intention of letting you use my source code in your
programs, and to write other code for profit.  If I want to write
something for free, I'd like it to be free for any purpose, including
commercial purposes, thus the GPL is inappropriate.

I would vastly prefer that people simply place their code in the
public domain explicitly.
