I haven't been following this FOIA request for TEMPEST docs. It seems
pointless, for several reasons:

1. No doubt a lot of stuff will be classified, and FOIA can't break
classification, generally.

2. The physics is what's important, not TEMPEST specs on specfific pieces
of equipment the government may be using, etc.

3. Direct tests on current equipment is more important, anyway.

Why would something designed for large-scale structures like buildings be
all that useful for shielding a laptop? While it _might_ be useful, there
are building tradeoffs that don't apply to shielding smaller objects.

Why not just go with copper, for example? Or mu-metal? Or even mesh?

I don't know who you're doing this project for, but I would approach it
from a different point of view.

* Laptop under battery power...no leakage through a.c. lines

* inside a copper box made of, say, 10-gauge copper. All joints soldered.

* viewing through a kind of viewing hood, with each eye having a couple of
layers of mesh close to the eyes...this should not interfere too much with
viewing the screen (some experimentation would be needed).

* control of keyboard could be done in a couple of ways, e.g.,

-- flexibible gloves coated with conductive material (the skin depth is
likely insufficient to block RF to 80 or so dB, but the combination of
attenuation and limited exit diameter (at the wrists) may be sufficient

-- a new external keyboard with only fiber-optic connections to the
computer, and with no significant local processing, and only low
voltages...I would not be surprised if a keyboard with essentially no
key-varying RF emissions could be built (operating frequency can of course
be very, very low, e.g., a kilohertz or less, and with low voltages, etc.)

-- mouse input, if necessary, can be done with optical mice with infrared
links (helped along with light pipes). No RF to speak of, though this would
have to be characterized in detail.

I'll follow your business plans with interest.

Not to sound like a cynic (you all know I am, though), but this kind of
"crypto chic" marketing ploy seems doomed to failure. "Privacy fashion
statement" indeed.

What more can I say?

Well, I got trolled, it appears, by one of John Young's coleridged rhymes
(and rimes).

I wasted my time addressing what I thought 'til the end was a semi-real, if
flaky, proposal to market a TEMPESTed computer. How stupid of me. I should
know by now never to take John seriously.
