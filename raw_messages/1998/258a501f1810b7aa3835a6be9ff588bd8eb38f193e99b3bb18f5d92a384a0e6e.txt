Yep Eric,
I think that most people have jumped the gun here on this one. These are
not the actual regulations. They are only part of a framework proposal
so the eventual legislation could be lightyears removed from these
principles. (In fact given that most of the discussions between Ira
Magaziner and the Irish government were carried out in secret, I think
that the eventual legislation will be riddled with loopholes. Guess we
may have become the 51st state and we didn't even know. :-) ) The
problem is that most of the journos who wrote about it are relatively
clueless on the crypto aspect of things. There was some input from
Electronic Frontier Ireland  (Irish version of EFF) on the principles so
that is a good thing.
