Sounds interesting.  I am not familiar with plan 9 besides the
enthusings of a colleague reminiscing about the work done at York
Univ, UK with plan 9.

Java has a lot going for it as a candidate due to portability and code
distribution support.  I think the only thing missing from java is the
bidding and scheduling mechanisms.  Your other forwarded message on
plan 9 looks interesting also.
