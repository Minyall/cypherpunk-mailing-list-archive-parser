What you really want is the ability to slow down the mobility of the raid
force while making your exit. In a prolonged siege, the attacker will
always win.  A good way of slowing down the attacker after an initial
armed response is to deploy chemicals. A combination of Tabun and Mustard
Gas works best, but don't deploy them at the same time. Use the Tabun
first for maximium impact. Follow up with the Mustard Gas a few minutes
later. The underground irrigation systems common on California properties
are ideal means of gas deployment. You should be able to retrofit the
system for under $500. Assuming you already have the gas. Of course you
need to make sure to keep a chem suit at home. 

After you make your exit, you can clean out the next with a previously
installed fuel/air explosive.
