There was a typo in the tattoo, fortunately it was correctable, they
missed out a backtick (`).  You can see this on the tattoo gif
referenced above:

it says ...$_=echo "16... and it should say ...$_=`echo "16...

I pointed this out to Richard White when he sent me the gif of his
tattoo, and he had his wife put in the backtick, as there is a
reasonable amount of space between the = and e of echo.

If anyone wants to repeat the exercise, the perl/dc program is smaller
now:

print pack"C*",split/\D+/,`echo "16iII*o\U@{$/=$z;[(pop,pop,unpack"H*",<>
)]}\EsMsKsN0[lN*1lK[d2%Sa2/d0<X+d*lMLa^*lN%0]dsXx++lMlN/dsM0<J]dsJxp"|dc`
