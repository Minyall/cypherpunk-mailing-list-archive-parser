In case of homo sapiens, it is the same thing.  Assholes like the Kennedys
kill themselves though drugs and reckless skiing before they have a chance
to breed (or breed more). One of the reasons why all drugs should be legal
is that people who should not breed will use the drugs to kill themselves,
leaving more room/wealth/resources for their genetic superiors.
