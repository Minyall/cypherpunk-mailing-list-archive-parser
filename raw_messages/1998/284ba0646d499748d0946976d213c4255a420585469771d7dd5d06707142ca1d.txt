Announced on the 6 o'clock news July 15, 1998.

I ask you to read this please; while reading keep in mind
this is easily adaptable to observe firearms owners patterns.

Const. Oscar Ramos and Const. Raymond Payette of the
Vancouver City Police made announcement of their new
"Shame the Johns" software.  It is designed to share
information with all levels of police in the Lower Mainland
and elsewhere.

This software allows the tracking of vehicle movements
and buying patterns.  It allows police to predict when and
where you will be at anytime.  It is designed to collect
name, date of birth, license number, discription of vehicle
- -and-other-information.  It will automatically generate
a letter to send to the persons home informing other
family members of the persons activities.
