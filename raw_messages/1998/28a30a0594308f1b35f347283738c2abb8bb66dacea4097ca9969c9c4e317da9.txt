I wish there were more details.  Namely how they generate their 10^30 byte
"virtual keystream".
In order to be a true one-time pad the keystream needs to be completely
random, this looks more like a psuedo-random stream cypher to me.  But it
should be fast and still might be secure.  

As a competing one-time pad vendor I don't want to be a pot calling the
kettle black, but If I've learned anything from the cypherpunks, it's prove
it.  Which is what we've tried to do.
