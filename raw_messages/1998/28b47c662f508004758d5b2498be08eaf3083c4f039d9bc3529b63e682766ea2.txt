* The London Daily Telegraph reported in January on the thriving
addiction clinics of Dr. Robert Lefever, who specializes in helping
people who are obsessed with helping other people.  Among the
500 patients a year he sees in London and Kent are a number of
women who compulsively marry alcoholics so they can cure them. 
Another recent patient was hospitalized for exhaustion after
caretaking an overweight woman, including obsessively rolling her
in her wheelchair to many places she did not want to go.
