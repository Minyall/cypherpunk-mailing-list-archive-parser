Well, we are going on hour 4 now, most of the power is back.  One group of
2-4 employees caused it they say.  This was admitted 3 hours later, and
then they knew 15 minutes after it happens.. typical.  They expect to be
back on by this afternoon

On the Shell Building at 8:30AM

"Building closed, no power.  Power will not be restored for 6-8 hours."

I wonder how they knew.  The estimate is probably about right too, wierd.

The mission village sub-station has been re-oppened, and most peoples
power is now being revived.  Funny how 2-4 people not following procedure
were able to shut down 4 substations.  Looks like PG&E have lots of work
ahead to find out the cause/effect of this type action.
