I agree 110%. This is something I have though long and hard on and have
come to the conclusion that a single strike to take out DC would only lead
to the establishment of a military dictatorship (though I must admit that
watching those bastards fry would almost be worth it <EG>). Eventually
some form of democracy would be restored (but freedoms would be much less
than what we have now) as it is simpler to control the sheeple if they
think they are running things.
