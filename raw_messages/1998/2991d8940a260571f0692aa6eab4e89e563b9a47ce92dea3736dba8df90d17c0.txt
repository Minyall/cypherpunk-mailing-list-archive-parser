The idea is like with the plug-in for Pegasus Mail. You don't need to
go to PGP encrypt the message and then send it. You can do that right
through the Pegasus Mail. Same idea with my program. Would make it a
little faster instead of encrypting your piece of picture in many
steps you can do it with one push of a button.

Another thing. You're right. You can cut the piece of picture you want
to encrypt and then encrypt that little piece. But if you want to send
the whole image, and make that little piece invisible to everyone else
but the sender... this is what I'm getting at. If someone still
doesn't understand, I'll try again later.

Sincerely yours,
Jan
