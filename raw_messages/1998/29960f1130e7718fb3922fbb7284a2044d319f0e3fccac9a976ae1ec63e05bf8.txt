The tale is true -- it's the *interpretation* that's bogus. PGP is not out
the door. PGP will be doing X.509 too. There's not a lot of difference
between an X.509 certificate and a PGP key signature. They do the same
thing. What you'll be able to do is have Verisign sign your key. The first
steps of this are coming this fall -- you'll be able to drop an X.509 cert
into your keyring and it will magically transform itself into a PGP key. At
first, you'll only be able to use it with TLS (a.k.a. SSL), which is also
coming this fall.
