Not bloody likely.  Inside the social (in)security fund you will find
a big IOU to the tune of many billions of dollars.  In fact, to the tune
of the entire value of the SS fund.

If they end up "saving" social insecurity its most likely that they
will stick to the same game as Doritos (paraphrased)

"Spend all you like...we'll print more!"

To understand why SS has never really been in jeopardy, you must understand
the function of a central, fractional-reserve banking system.  Since
the Fed is a lender of last resort to the government, and since the
US federal government is never likely to voluntarily let social 
(in)security die they will simply print more money.

I don't mean literally print more money.

I mean the fed government sells bonds to cover the difference.  If
the bond market won't absorb it, the federal reserve is bound by 
contract t absorb it.

Just some entries in a ledger to them.  Just some inflation, hidden
taxes and future interest payments to you.
