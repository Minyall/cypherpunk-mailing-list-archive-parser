This technology already exists in Britain (I don't know about any other 
countries), where you can buy a mobile without any subscription information 
off the shelf. To use the mobile, you go and purchase a 'token' which allows 
you to use the mobile on a pay-per-call basis much the same as a public phone. 
I don't know the method of token implementation.

The police have started kicking up a fuss over this technology as they claim 
it hinders their investigation into criminal activity, because if they trace a 
cellular phone which turns out to be one of this type then they can't pull the 
info on the customer to go round knocking on doors.
