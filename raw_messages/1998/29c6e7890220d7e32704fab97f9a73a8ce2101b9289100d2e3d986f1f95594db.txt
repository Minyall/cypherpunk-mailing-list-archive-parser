Hackers Tell About Security Woes

WASHINGTON (AP) - Computer hackers told Congress today that computer security
is so lax, they could disable the entire Internet in a half-hour. Members of
the hacker think-tank called ``The Loft,'' who were praised by senators for
calling attention to the problems of computer security, also warned that they
could transfer Federal Reserve funds by computer and disrupt electrical power.
One hacker, identified by his online handle ``Mudge,'' told the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee ``if you're looking for computer security then
the Internet is not the place to be.''
