Chaum's "limited-traceability" patent includes other features

It's an interesting, nuanced proposal, from 1994, which helps
explain some of the strategy he's been keeping close to his 
chest until patent approval, and which may portend more 
provocative designs in the pipeline for outfoxing the keepers
of the chickens.
