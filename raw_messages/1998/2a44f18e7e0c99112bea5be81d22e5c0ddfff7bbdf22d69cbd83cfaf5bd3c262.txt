Hi,

It is of some import to note that the legaly amend the Constitution takes
considerably more than the 51% that those happy go lucky anarchists are so
fond of quoting...it actualy takes 75%.


				ARTICLE V. 
 
	[Constitution: how amended; proviso.] 
 
	The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it 
necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the 
Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall 
call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be 
valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified 
by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions 
of the three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification 
may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which shall be 
made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any 
Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first 
Article; and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of it's 
equal Suffrage in the Senate.
