Thanks to mctaylor and Carrie Bendzsa at Entrust we offer 
her transcription of the recent Entrust roundtable on Canada's 
Cryptography Policy:

Good, vigorous discussion of how US export policy inhibits
Canada's crypto policy and commerce. And what might be 
done to get the CA gov to defy the supercop without getting 
shackled like US miscreants.
