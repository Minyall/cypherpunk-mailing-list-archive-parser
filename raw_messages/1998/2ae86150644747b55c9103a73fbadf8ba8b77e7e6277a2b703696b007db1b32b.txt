It only took one to turn India around.  Ghandi nearly starved to
death, used nothing but passifism and won the race man.  You can't
discredit the labors of a few, wonderous things can happen when 3

world already, I don't wish to add to it.  We've got nothing left but
hope and what a large flame a small spark can ignite.
