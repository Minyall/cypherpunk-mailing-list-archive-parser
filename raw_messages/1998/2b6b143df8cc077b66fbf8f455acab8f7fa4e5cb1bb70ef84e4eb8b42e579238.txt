Lack of commitment to open standards was made obvious by the fact that
Apple considered the POP/SMTP plug-in for PowerTalk to be a 3rd party
opportunity! However, I was only really talking about the DigiSign stuff,
trying not to get sucked into the whole enchalada of discussing why
PowerTalk failed.

I have no bone to pick with the CA model. Apple was stuck at the high end
of this model when, as Phill points out, many levels of authentication are
needed.

I simply think that starting with a personal model, more like PGP, would
have allowed DigiSign to build some momentum, at least in the Mac market
(not a bad place to start). So, it was in fact a pre-condition for market
acceptance. Market growth could have been accelerated by just paying
attention. As with many Apple technologies, there was never a version 2.0
and 3.0 and so on, to correct for the misconceptions about the market. A
lot of people knew what needed to be done, but management usually remained
clueless.
