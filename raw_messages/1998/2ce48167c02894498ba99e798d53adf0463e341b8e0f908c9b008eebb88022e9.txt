Everyone seemed to agree that DES was weak and the government is going
about things all wrong.  But CNN doesn't get it.

people won't know.  They completely ignored the social and political
implications of cracking DES.  Using encryption to secure your
correspondence, for authentication, or to protect Freedom and Liberty are
geeky Big Concepts that CNN thinks normal people won't understand.
