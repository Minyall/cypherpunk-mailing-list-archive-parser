Blanc,

	Sometimes the best advice is to play the game, get what you want and
let well enough alone.  The fact that they may choose to do nothing does
not mean that bucking the United States of America is a good idea. 
Follow the administrative procedures, leave your anger at home and if
you want to change the way things are, work to be a good example of why
libertarian values are morally correct.
