In the case of my US bank it's the opposite:  ATM withdrawals, unless I use
a machine owned by my bank, cost me US$1.50.  Credit card fees on the other
hand are paid by the merchant, who is contractually bound NOT to pass them
on to me.

My debit card functions as both ATM and credit card.  When given a choice I
will always prefer to use it as a credit card, which costs me nothing.
