ANNOUNCING the most liberal national policy yet on
the encoding of data sent over the Internet, the Irish 
government last week showed it has every intention 
of being an international centre for electronic commerce. 
Ireland listened to its many resident technology companies, 
rather than bowing to pressure from the US, which wants 
access to encrypted messages. Ireland places no
restrictions on the use, import or export of encryption
products. Individuals can choose to offer a plain text 
version of the encrypted document or hand over a key, 
if a search warrant is proffered. The document was 
released to coincide with the Irish visit of President 
Clinton's Internet tsar, senior trade advisor Ira Magaziner, 
who hinted that his views on encryption diverge from 
those of his boss. "Within the next year, there'll be such 
an availability of high-level encryption that the market 
will take over," he said.
