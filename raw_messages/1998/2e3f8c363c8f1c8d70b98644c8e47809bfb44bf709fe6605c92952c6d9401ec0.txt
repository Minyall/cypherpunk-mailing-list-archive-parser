Dear One Nation supporter in NSW

Pauline Hanson has just completed a whirlwind tour of Australia.

The tour has been an enormous success - although this aspect of her rallies
has been largely ignored by the media.

You will have noted the coverage given to the protests and for this reason
we would like to draw your attention to the following web pages.

The first demonstrates the links between extremists within the Labor party
and the violence perpetrated by protesters at One Nation meetings:
http://www.gwb.com.au/gwb/news/onenation/left/meljul98.html

The second looks at the organisation behind the student protests:
http://www.gwb.com.au/onenation/school.html

We would draw your attention to the new moderated on-line discussion forum
which you are encouraged to join and participate in. 

This can be found at: http://plato.itsc.adfa.edu.au/politics/

Finally, to make your navigation of the large One Nation web site easier we
have installed a theme based 'site map' which can be found at:
