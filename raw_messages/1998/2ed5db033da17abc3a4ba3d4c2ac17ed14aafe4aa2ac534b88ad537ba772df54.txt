the new issue of scientific american features
articles on encryption and hacking. one is
by Phil Zimmermann, on public key cryptography.

A policy article by Rivest (of RSA) argues
against encryption restrictions in the US.

a long article on internet hacking and breaking
and entering describes the basic process
that hackers use.

Rivest uses the analogy of "gloves" for
encryption, in the sense that we shouldn't
outlaw gloves because the govt needs always
to obtain fingerprints for identification.
furthermore, "key escrow" is like gluing
fingerprint copies to the bottoms of gloves,
another waste of time.
