I'm working on a web page that would include a list of Internet
providers that either offer anonymous accounts or a better 
degree of privacy not usually seen by regular ISP's. 

Below is a list of providers that offers these services that
I have been able to put together, I'm wondering if there are
some that I am missing.  To avoid noise on the list and I'm
no longer a member of the cypherpunks list, please e-mail me
privately.
