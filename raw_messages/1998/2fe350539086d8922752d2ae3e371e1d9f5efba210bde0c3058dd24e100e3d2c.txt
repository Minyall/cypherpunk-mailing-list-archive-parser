Hmmm, mythical chimeras subject to export control? E. coli with a dinoflagellate
sting? Smegma that erupts into gas gangrene? Surely these nightmares are only
paranoid delusions of national security strategists who may have eaten British
beef too close to bedtime. A pox on their infections! And a swab of flesh eating
streptococcus on the lubri-smooth strip of all their razors, so they can't save
face.
