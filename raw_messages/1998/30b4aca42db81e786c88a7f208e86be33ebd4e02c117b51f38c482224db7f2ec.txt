Save that the impeachment of a president is not the main job of the OIC.  He is supposed to 1) Investigate, 2) Indict, and 3) Report to the AG and the 3-judge panel that appointed him.  If he stumbles across evidence of impeachable offenses he can send a report to the House but that is a SIDE job.

Starr took 8 months to go from zero to "evidence of impeachable offenses" in  Fornigate.  The rest of the investigation continues.  He has 5 different areas of responsibility.  He submitted Monica to the House because he had rock solid proof that Clinton is a lying sack of shit and a multiple felon.  Something we knew years ago but couldn't prove.  

With KKKlinton, you don't shoot unless you have an elephant gun.
