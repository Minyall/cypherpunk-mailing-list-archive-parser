Nevermind that source code is suppose to be "human readable" material that
is _translated_ into function instructions of machine code.

A play is normally considered 'protected' free speech under US law, but
what if robot was created which acted out the play and Gwin's argument was
extended to apply the situtation where a play performed. Would the play
itself no longer be a protected form of free speech, because it is seen as
"functional" instructions to the robot actor? Would the playwrite become
responsible for the robot's actions, such as killing a character/actor?

As a programmer, I have "acted out" source code myself, as part of the
debugging process. It is normally called "a walkthrough," so the difference
between source code and a play is not as broad as some people may view it.
I have followed the source code like a script, acting out the instructions
like stage directions in a play.

Does it matter who might 'read' the material, in regards to the protection
of free speech? Whether it is written so that Russians or computers might
be able to read it? If source code is written on a napkin, it can be
currently exported, but what if tomorrow a vendor announces a 'napkin
computer' which can directly read from napkins akin to a super-low densiy
floppy disc.
