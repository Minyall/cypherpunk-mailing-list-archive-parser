Duhhh Stoned De Ranger
(with his MindFuck, Toronto)

Psychotic Episode #38: First Signs of Toto's Arrest.

Toronto: "Pretty quiet on the CypherPunks List tonight,
eh, Kimo Slobbery?"

[Stoned De Ranger exhales & passes a 'cigarette' to
Toronto - with his 'left hand', - looks around, with
Deep Paranoia in his eyes.] <-' <-'

S. De Ranger: "Yeah, Toronto ... a little *too* quiet ... "
