hey there,

	I am having to formulate an acceptable user policy for the users. Does 
anybody know of any online references, or examples of such policies. 
This would have to include specifications like email use, internet 
access, games over the LAN - anything that you can get your head around 
pertaining to such. This of course would have to weigh up between the 
rights of the users and protection of the network and PCs


	Your help would be greatly appreciated
	Duncan
