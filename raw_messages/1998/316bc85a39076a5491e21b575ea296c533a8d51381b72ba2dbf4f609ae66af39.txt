Ok a for instence,  if I was your boss and I sated that I would fire you
unless you would go *u-hum* cave exploring with me[1].  Such situations
have occured in the past, would you support them.

To me a person with that amount of power is uneceptable.

So allowing someone to stave to death because thay have the wrong collour
of skin, or unwilling to get up close and personal with the boss, is not a
form of harm.

Immagion there is a truck rolling out of conrol in your direction,
keeping silent may harm you by preventing you from jumping out of the way,
but this is not an agressive act, it is a passive one: I have declined to
warn you.

[1] Not that I am thay way enclined.
