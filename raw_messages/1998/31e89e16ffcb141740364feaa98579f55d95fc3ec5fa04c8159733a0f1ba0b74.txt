I raised a similar thread last year. I caused quite a bit of comment. Since
then I've discussed the possibility of employing a common yeast or other
organism to allow individuals to create their own home pharmacies with
friends and acquintances in this sector. Their opinions vary but all
assured me that desktop genetic engineering and production capabilities are
likely no more than 10 years away and that fed measures to prevent this
will likely be singularly ineffective.
