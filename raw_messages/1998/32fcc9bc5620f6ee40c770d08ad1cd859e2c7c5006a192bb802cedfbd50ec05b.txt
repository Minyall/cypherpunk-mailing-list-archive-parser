There are several examples people have mentioned here:
Roxen, junkbuster, etc.

I happen to use one called WebFilter, a patched CERN httpd
(http://math-www.uni-paderborn.de/~axel/NoShit) which allows
program filtering based on URL regexp matching.

Of course, now that Netscape's releasing their source code, what
would *really* help the practice take off would be integration of 
one of these systems into Netscape. 

On the downside, this is sure to trigger an ad Arms Race, with content
providers melding together content and ads.  Right now, I can view the
web with almost no ads, but if a million people are filtering ads off a
site, you can bet there will be countermeasures, and lots of them.  It's
difficult to imagine the filters winning, without more advanced support
(for example, cropping images to remove ads, and collaborative filtering
pools).  But if a million people are using the system, and 0.01% are
coders committed to making it work, well, you can do a lot with 100
brains.

Proxies can do the same thing, and just as well, IMO, and it doesn't
require any ugly binary patching.
