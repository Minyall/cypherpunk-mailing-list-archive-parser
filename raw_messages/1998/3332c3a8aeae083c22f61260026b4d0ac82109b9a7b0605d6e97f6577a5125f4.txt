It has been fifteen years since I even opened a chemistry book, but I think
what you're looking for is called the "heat of enthalpy." You could find
this in most any intro-level chem book, and there's probably a whole
shitload of reactions listed in the _CRC Handbook Of Chemistry & Physics_.

Since HCl+NaOH is an acid-base reaction, you could also use something
called the "heat of neutralization." IIRC, that's something like 57 KJ/mol
for strong acids. But don't take my word for it; I'm Not A Chemist Any
More. P-Chem gave me a great appreciation for math and computers.
