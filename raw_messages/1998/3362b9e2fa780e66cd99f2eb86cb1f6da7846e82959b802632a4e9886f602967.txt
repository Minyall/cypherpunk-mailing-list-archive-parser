FOUR REASONS TO VOTE FOR STEVE LANGFORD
HE IS PRO-BUSINESS

Steve Langford is the only candidate for Governor who has paid the bills of a business and passed 
bills in the General Assembly.  Langford Construction, his family business, was awarded the Family 
Business of the Year Award for 1995 by the Michael J. Coles School of Business at Kennesaw State 
University.  Steve Langford was given a score of 92% by the National Federation of Independent 
Business (the only other Democratic candidate for Governor in the General Assembly got 67%).

HE IS PRO-CHOICE
Steve Langford opposes any government interference in your right to make decisions about 
reproductive health--and he has the voting record to prove it:
-  Voted against state-mandated lectures and forced waiting periods.
-  Voted against--and took the Senate well to speak against--Senate Bill 357, which would have 
banned certain abortion procedures. The Ohio version of this bill was recently ruled unconstitutional 
by the U.S. Supreme Court.

HE IS PRO-ENVIRONMENT
Steve Langford's Senate Bill 500 is the bill that made the City of Atlanta pay fines for polluting the 
Chattahoochee--and finally got the city moving toward a solution to the persistent problems of 
Atlanta's water and sewer systems. Why does it matter?  Each time it rains more than 1/10 inch, 
Atlanta sewers overflow into the Chattahoochee.  Of course, if you live downstream of Atlanta, you 
already knew that.

HE IS PRO-TAXPAYER
Steve Langford introduced a bill in the 1998 General Assembly that would give you a rebate when 
the state has a surplus (if you owed $1,000 in Georgia income taxes last year, you would have 
gotten a $100 rebate on your taxes).  No surplus?  No rebate.  Makes sense, doesn't it?
