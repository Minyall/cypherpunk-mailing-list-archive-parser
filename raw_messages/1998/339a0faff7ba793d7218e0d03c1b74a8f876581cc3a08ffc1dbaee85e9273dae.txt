What I was originaly looking to discuss was the impact of the injection of a
globaly available, economical, and effective replacement of petroleum
products on the international relationships. In particular the impact on
places like Isreal, Iran, US, etc. The only real relevance this has to
cypherpunks is from the economics side (why I've been trying to stay on
topic with the economics comments in parens) and how such a shift of
economic and industrial capabilites out of centralized and nationaly
controlled geographies might impact these same countries ability to remain
stable and the consequences of such.

Take Kuwait for example, the impact there would be devistating. And like a
domino effect (or want of a nail...) the repurcussions can be imagined to
run up the food chain. It is related, though not directly, to an issue that
I was engaged in several days ago about Gibson and the relationships of
governments, individuals, large companies, technology development, etc.
