The announcement would be a lot better if foreigners were "permitted"
strong disk
encryption; or if foreigners were "permitted" the high grade anonymity that
packet routing can provide.  

Do you think the US would allow strong crypto WebTV for foreigners if the
foreigners had secure links to an equivalent, independent, foreign WebTV
service whose assets were not readily seized, whose techs were not easily
made into Agents, whose officers were not readily kidnappable by the USDoJ,
etc.

Just think of the cookie recipes the infidels would be circulating..

I really doubt Osama subscribes to WebTV.  :-)
