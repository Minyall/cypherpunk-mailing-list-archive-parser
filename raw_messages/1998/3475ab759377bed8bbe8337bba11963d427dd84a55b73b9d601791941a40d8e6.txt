And don't forget Somalia. In Somalia the U.S. occupying forces not only
suppressed newspapers critical of the U.S., they also led the disarmament
of the civilian population.

(This was verified, and I saw CNN reports of journalists following the U.S.
teams going farm to farm, hut to hut, collecting the AKs and SKS rifles the
peasants had. There were then, predictably, reports that the peasants were
now finding themselves easy pickings for roving looters. The U.S. clucked
and called these looters "agents of Warlord Aidid." Whatever, the effects
of disarming people are predictable. Apparently the First and Second and
Fourth Amendments are good enough for us, even if honored less and less,
but not OK for ragheads and dirtballs.)

This is why I cheered to see the U.S. gets its tail kicked in Somalia and
have to retreat in disgrace. Alas, the U.S. planners just looked for
another war, one we could "win," and they found a bombed out Bosnia to be
the perfect place to "restore our dignity."
