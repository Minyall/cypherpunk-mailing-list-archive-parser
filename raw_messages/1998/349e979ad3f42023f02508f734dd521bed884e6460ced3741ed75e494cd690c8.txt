November 12th, 1998 the Toronto Board of Health announces they want to
ban private 
owner ship of snakes, turtles, any and all exotic pets.

Reaction of pet owners was immediate. In this city of just under 3
Million people, most said they would not abide by the law and hide their
beloved pets.

Where is Allan Rock when they need him?  Allan is a resident of Toronto,
surely he will leap to their aid and criminalize the ownership of
turtles?  Surely he knows Aunt Annie well enough to ask her to do it for
him?

[NOTE by the forwarder: the following paragraphs are a parody of bill C-68, 
the new firearms control bill.  jfa.]

But first, let's licence them. Register each, and the owners licenced.
Then, we will know where these dangerous critters are, just in case
later someone decides to hide a few. Where to put the sticker with the
unique number will pose a problem.

Later, we can ban them with impunity. The police can use the full force
of the Criminal Code to enter and search for turtles and spiders at
will.

OK, Saskatchewan, this is your time to line up at the trough for jobs as
Mirimachi did.

We will need a registry office, with 300 employee's, high tech and
trained bilingual people. Quebec does not need it, they are getting the
RCMP training jobs.

Hey, wait, maybe PEI wants it?
