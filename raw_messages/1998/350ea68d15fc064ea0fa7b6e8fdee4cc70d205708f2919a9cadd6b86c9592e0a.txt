Well, first you inform the refueler of your intention and wait for
clearance. You'll be cleared for either the left or the right hose. Pull
in behind and deploy your refueling probe if your aircraft has one. Ease
it into the basket and hold the aircraft steady until refueling is
complete. 

Another option is to go for a swim inside the refueling tank. You'll join
your ancestors quickly.
