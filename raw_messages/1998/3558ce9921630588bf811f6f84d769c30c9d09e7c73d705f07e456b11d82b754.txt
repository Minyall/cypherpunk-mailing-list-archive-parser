If you would, that would be interesting.  The patent info on their web
site includes:

	Method for secure timestamping of digital documents.
	U.S. Patent No. 5,136,647, issued August 4, 1992.
	U.S. Patent Re. 34,954, reissued May 30, 1995.

	The initial patent issue covers a variety of fundamental
	technology and algorithmic components of digital
	timestamping. More specifically, the claims cover:

	* Any use of an outside party's digital signature to timestamp
	  a document.
	* The "hash-and-sign" method in which the outside party receives
	  the one-way hash of the document to be timestamped.

I distrust software patents, but even that aside, these sound really
broad to me.  More info at <http://www.surety.com/patent_overview.html>.
