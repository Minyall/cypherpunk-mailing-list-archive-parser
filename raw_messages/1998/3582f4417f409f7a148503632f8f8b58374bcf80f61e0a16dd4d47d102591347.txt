Orlin  http://www.aci.net/kalliste/ and, of       
course,http://www.aci.net/kalliste/bw1.htm

I got a big kick reading http://www.jya.com/tristrata.htm

Especially,

  While a one-time pad is, in fact, theoretically unbreakable when
used   properly, the details of using it properly make it entirely
unusable    in any modern commercial or military setting. 

And 

  This kind of system was used for the U.S.-Soviet teletype "hot line"  
and it is occasionally used for paper ciphers and spies, but that's   
it.

Codes and Cryptography by Dominic Welsh references on page 126 Sandia's
Gus Simmons as the source of the above.

  (And if users can exchange these keys, why can't they just
exchange     the messages?)

I think the reason is that the users want to exchange keys for messages
to be sent at a later time, perhaps electronically.

But we have to stick to the position.

Does the algorithm pass the Black and White test or not?  No buts.

Let's all hope for settlement of this UNFORTUNATE matter before it
gets WORSE.
