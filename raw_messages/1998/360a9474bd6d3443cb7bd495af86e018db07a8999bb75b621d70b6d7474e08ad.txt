Does anyone know of any bank with software or a web page that lets you
give them wire-transfer instructions from over the internet?

How about a bank that lets you see where a wire transfer came from on the
web page interface?  I think dollarbank.com just says "incoming wire". 

How about a bank on the Internet that will accept instructions to write
and mail a check drawn on your account to any random person at any
address? 

Such things would make it really easy for random little guys to make
their own currency using e-commerce software.
