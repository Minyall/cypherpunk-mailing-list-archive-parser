Forget the implementation language/platform bigotry.

The substantive issue is, Tell us what it is designed
to do *precisely*, and then tell us how it does it.
If it is claimed to be a "stream cipher" then it should do 
certain things, e.g., produce incompressible data
from an input stream consisting of identical symbols.
Argue with logic, don't make us read your code.
