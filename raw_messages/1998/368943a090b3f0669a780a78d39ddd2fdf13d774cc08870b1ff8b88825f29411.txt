Well, try logging in as "ken", and I think the password was "nih" :-)
(At least when I was starting my Unix career, it was still common
to have logins "ken" and "dmr" around as a courtesy, though eventually
computer security changed that practice.)

Also, mixing up DEC and Unix has long tradition; back in 1979,
there was an article in one of the Oakland or SF papers about
"Hackers at Berkeley" cracking security on "the Unix, a computer 
made by DEC", which was really about abusing answerback on VT100s.
