I'm trying to find out what airline flight someone is taking. I have a name
and know the general travel plans and likely date. How can I find out the
airline, flight number, and seat number? This is somewhat urgent. (You have
my assurance that the purpose is legit.)

If anyone has any ideas, I'd appreciate the help.

Thanks,

Declan
