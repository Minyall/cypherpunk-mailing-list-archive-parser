You should read Cypherpunks more regularly. This is what I posted in the
past:

Quick PGP 6 eval
===============

Long desired features:
o Designated revokers (If you are incapacitated/incarcerated).
o Secret shared keys (A must for corporate root keys).

Gimmick:
o You can attach a photo to your key.  

Still not there:
o Ability to revoke individual user ID's on a key.

-- Lucky Green <shamrock@cypherpunks.to> PGP v5 encrypted email preferred.
