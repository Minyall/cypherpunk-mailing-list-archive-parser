Lotus produced a "backgrounder" called "Differential Workfactor Cryptography"
when they first promulgated the 64/40 stuff.  It says (in part):

	We do that by encrypting 24 of the 64 bits under a public RSA key
	provided by the U.S. government and binding the encrypted partial
	key to the encrypted data.

I haven't seen the USG RSA key -- if it's 512 bits, that would be a humorous
next factoring target.
