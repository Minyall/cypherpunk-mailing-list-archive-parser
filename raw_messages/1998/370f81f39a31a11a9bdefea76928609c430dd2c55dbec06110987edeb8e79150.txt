Huh? Well Goodness Fuck, Does this mean I am notorious as well?

I hope they don't suppoena me from my duty station. I don't archive nothing
but Jack and Schidt, and the meatspace location would really suprise them.
Plus, the entanglement of me getting the network logs- and other things
that would be on those logs- from the ship and everything, my mind boggles
at the "intelligence" that would blindly pursue.... and the authority that
thinks it could make it so..... right hand and left hand of the same gov't.
Fascinating, in its own way.

Then again, wouldn't it be a 5th, or 12th, or 20th level move, to be
planned out in advance?
