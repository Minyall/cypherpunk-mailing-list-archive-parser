CTIA's Daily News From WOW-COM was not circulated yesterday and today because
of a wireline telephone system failure that is disrupting service to the
Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association building in Washington, D.C. 
We regret the inconvenience this may have caused you and look forward to
resuming the Daily News service as soon as possible.
