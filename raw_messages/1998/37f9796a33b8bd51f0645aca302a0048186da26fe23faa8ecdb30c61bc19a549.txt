The UK Sunday Times on the Internet had a story yesterday on
the rising Echelon furor in Europe, "Spy Station F83."

   http://www.sunday-times.co.uk (see Focus feature)

If you don't want to register we've mirrored the piece:

   http://jya.com/nsa-f83.htm

It reviews the rapidly-growing NSA operation at Menwith Hill and 
Bad Aibling, with some recent information not covered in earlier 
reports.

Several European pols -- German, French, Italian, et al -- are 
calling for investigations of alleged economic spying by NSA.

NSA denies all, the writers say, except the Agency claims it's the 
best in the world at what it's capable of but not doing.
