Perhaps LANL felt it needed to analyze what was on your computer? To see if
you were an Iraqi or Albanian or Quebecois spy attempting to learn atomic
secrets?

(LANL for those of you mysitified by this is Los Alamos National
Laboratory, of course. A beautiful place, high in the Jemez mountains of
New Mexico. As nuclear weapons work has been declinining, they've been
casting about for a new mission to justify government pork being sent their
way. One of their new interests is in hacking, intrusion, and "open
sources.")
