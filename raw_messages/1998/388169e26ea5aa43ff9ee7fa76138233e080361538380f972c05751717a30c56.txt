Dear Joe Cypherpunks:

Thank you for establishing an ACM account.  To complete
the process, you must return to Step 3 and verify your account.
You will find your account verification code listed at the end
of this message.  The code is case sensitive, and does not
contain any digits.

Select the "Continue to Step 3" button from the "Create an
Account" page at <http://www.acm.org/account/create.html>.

Do not repeat Steps 1 and 2. (See note below.)

Enter your username, password and verification code into
the appropriate fields and activate the "Verify Account"
button.

         Username: cypherpunks@toad.com
Verification Code: AFGKE   

If you have any questions or comments please contact
webmaster@acm.org.

Sincerely,
The ACM Webmaster


Note: if you repeat steps 1 and 2, your old account is
deleted and the verification code associated with it
will not be valid.  A new code is created and sent.
You must use the new code to verify your account.
