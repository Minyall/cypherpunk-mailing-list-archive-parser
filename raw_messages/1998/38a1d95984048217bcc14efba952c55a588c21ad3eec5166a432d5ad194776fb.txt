Before others point this out, there are certain types of "public safety"
laws about what one can research or do. Laws about explosives, dangerous
chemicals, and pathogens.

(The "ban on recombinant DNA research," following the Asilomar Conference
in 1975, was a voluntary ban, and thus not a ban in the sense I am using
here. And it last only a couple of years, until more could be learned about
the potential danges of recombinant DNA work.)

Please respond to my main points, if you respond at all, not to these side
points.
