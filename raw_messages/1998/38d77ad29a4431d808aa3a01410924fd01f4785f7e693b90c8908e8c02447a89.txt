James Glave's Wired News article at
	http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/10605.html
is nice, especially the quote from Peter Neumann about how this
may be a con game by Janet Reno to get more budget.  After all,
the Feds has been doing computer security for a while, though
not with the expertise of the NSA.  So if they're so hot,
why do they keep getting cracked so badly, and on such critical stuff
as payroll data, which in the government is almost certain to include SSNs?
There's already a National Computer Security Center - she could
ask them for help, rather than starting a competing one.
