Hello? This is an old topic, but what the heck...

There is a concept cypherpunks have called "Blacknet", which is an
organisation that sells profiles of prospective employees based on
their public comments on the Internet.

This allows employers to filter out undesirables who might or might
not have outgrown their rebellious youth. (You can never be too safe!) 

Now, there are laws making discrimination illegal. But it's hard to *prove*
that an employer based its decision on BlackNet files, isn't it....

The cypherpunk philosophy is to rely on technology to solve the problem, rather
than rely on the government (or anyone else). Cypherpunks write code.
