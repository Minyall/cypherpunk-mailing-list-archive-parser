>From the EFF Web site:

   "Cracking DES" has been published only in print because 
   US export controls on encryption make it a crime to
   publish such information on the Internet, but the book is 
   designed to be easy to scan into computers.

John Gilmore has written that he is unable to provide
the digitized text of the book sitting on his desk due to
export controls, and that Chapter 4 of the book explains
what EFF expects to happen. EFF will link to an offshore 
URL as soon as the volume has been scanned and
posted.

We'll commence scanning the book as soon as it arrives
here next week and will provide the exportable parts to 
those working on the US-forbidden.
