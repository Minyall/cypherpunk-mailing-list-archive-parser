The SSLeay license is not a BSD-style license.  The BSD license is not
a typical non-copyleft free license; it has a particular problem.  For
an explanation, see http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html.

If you want to release a program as non-copylefted free software,
please use the X11 license, not the BSD license.  The X11 license is
the best of these licenses.
