Not directly as an added charge.  But they do indeed pass it on.
The card associations won't let them directly charge an added amount for
using a credit card, because that would remind consumers that they're
paying for the privlidge.. and that might discourage them from
using plastic.  But it's ok for the merchant to offer 'discounts' for
buyers who use cash instead of credit cards.  That 'discount'
is the real price of the goods with the credit-card surcharge
subtracted.  Often that's 3-4%, sometimes as low as 1.2%.

It still costs you the credit fee, hidden inside the purchase price.
Visa and MasterCard don't have massive staffs and huge office
buildings because they're dumb.
