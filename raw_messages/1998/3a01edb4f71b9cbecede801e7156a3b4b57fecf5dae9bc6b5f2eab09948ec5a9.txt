In yet another painful blow against US export regulations, the
international Mozilla Crypto Group replaced the crypto code that US
regulations forced Netscape to remove before publication of the Mozilla
source. 

It took the group all of 15 hours to do so. This should make for a nice 
tidbit to be used in future depositions or testimony.
