> Do We Worry Too Much About Protecting IP?
> 
>    --> By Scott McNealy 
>    
>    It seems as if everyone's always worried about intellectual property,
>    or IP. We worry about its proprietary nature and how to protect it.
>    But let's take a different angle on IP and also intellectual capital
>    inside a company, because I think we all worry way too much about
>    protecting it.
>    
>    IP has the shelf life of a banana. It just doesn't last, yet we're all
>    worried about protecting it, hiding it, securing it, storing it in a
>    vault. As a result, we absolutely prevent our competitors from getting
>    ahold of it, but we also prevent our employees from getting ahold of
>    it. We prevent our customers - and our suppliers and our partners -
>    from getting access to it. As a result, by the time the people who
>    need access to it get that access, it's so old that it is effectively
>    a banana we wouldn't want to eat.
