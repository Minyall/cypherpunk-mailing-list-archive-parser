In the Vancouver BC area they are trying to raise the price and the 
new standard is CAN$0.549 per litre, or US$1.37 per US gallon.  
Not difficult to find CAN$0.454/l or US$1.14/g.  For the last few 
weeks you could find CAN$0.399/l or US$1.00/g.  I often go to 
Blaine WA and the lowest available there is US$1.059.  Gas in 
Seattle WA is at least US$1.199.

Have you ever tried using this argument on a Vegetarian?  I have 
and they squirm in all directions attempting to rationalize their 
irrational position.  Basically some living things are more living than 
others.  Sort of reminds you of some politicians where it is obvious 
from their actions that some people are more equal than other 
people.
