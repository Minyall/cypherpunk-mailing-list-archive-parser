Yesterday we published a special issue of Stuffed and SEVEN
times more  readers than usual  visited the site.  This has
echoed what  you've been telling us in your emails,  so now
STUFFED is renamed to HOT STUFFED,  and we are bringing you
just the features  and pics you asked for.  Later this week
we'll  also release  a great new interface  that will down-
load our  pages 5-10  times faster.  We listen  to what you
you say and strive  to make STUFFED exactly the publication
you want!  Check out today's  great changes  and new stuff!
