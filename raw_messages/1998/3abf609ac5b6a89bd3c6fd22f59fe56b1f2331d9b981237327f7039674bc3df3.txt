So my wife hands me a deadtree periodical, _USA today_ Aug 5 98.

Secion D, cover: "A maverick cracks the code" with a big pic
of Gilmore, description of the DES scam, Jeffersonian
less gov't is more comment, and typical pop-media playup
of his personal bio. 

[See also "Strange Brains and Genius", by Clifford Pickover, 
for more bios :-]

The point: two or three column-feet(!) in a lowbrow high-volume rag.  Mentions
this list, too.

Not bad advertising for under $3e5 guys....
