	Could it be that certain large players (say, the U.K, U.S. Soviet
Union &etc) have a vested interest in cheap oil as long as possible, so
they do things (like create the state of israel, and give it lots of
economic aid) to destablize the region, keep the people of that area at
each others throats &etc. so that OPEC can't agree to control prices...

	Nah, I'm just paranoid.
