You are very welcome.

On the subject of junk e-mail: I've made an effort to place myself and
certain other addresses on the spammers' removal lists. This may be why
I get a lot less junk e-mail that apparently most people who post to
Usenet.

These days, I get about 2 or 3 junk e-mails; they are usually sent from
ibm.net or worldcom.att.net or erathlink or netcom; never aol or juno
(although they may be forged to look this way). I typically forward them
with the headers and without any comments to abuse@originating ISP, and
am typically notified within a day that the account has been terminated.

(Unlike the assholes from news.admin.net-abuse.* I have better things to
do than to keep track of my kill count, but it must be close to a hundred
since I started doing this last summer.)
