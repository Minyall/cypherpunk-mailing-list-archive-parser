This is a follow-up to the IRS Jim Bell spam last year, the IRS
troll on CNN recently and other provocations.

Anybody get IRS or other spam/troll about CJ? If so, we'd like 
to see the message with full headers (ID omitted if you
like). Post here or send privately. Anon okay, probably
best. We'll share what we get.

If PGP preferred use the latest PK on the servers for 
<jya@pipeline.com>, or any of the older ones.
