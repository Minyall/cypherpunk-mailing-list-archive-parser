Anyone figured out how to get Amazon's Group-discount cookie to set to

Incidentally, I edit my file something between daily and weekly, in
the hopes of generating bizare and worthless data for them.  I also
spend time clicking random links while on the phone to help fill my
cookie file with junk.
