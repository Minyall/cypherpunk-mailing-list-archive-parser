 Make 6 Figure Income Working In Your Pajamas !!

Each day I get out of bed, brush my teeth and walk into 
the next room to begin my work day..... Still in my PJs! 

And who am I working with, you ask. 
  
Well, my strategic partners are major corporations like:

   Netscape
   UUNet
   Oracle
   Sun Microsystems
   Worldcom (soon to be the 2nd largest phone 
             company after merging with MCI)
   Sprint Cellular
       ....Incredible names in the communications industry!!

The products and services from these corporations, which include Internet 
services, telecommunications services and unified messaging services, are 
targeted to the consumer, small office and home office (SOHO) markets.  
And there is even more coming in the next few months!

And NO, it does not cost the king's ransom to sign up.   How about $25?!!!
