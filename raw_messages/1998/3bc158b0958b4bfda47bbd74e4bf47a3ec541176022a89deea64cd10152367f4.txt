This is all true. However, the manner in which you state it sounds
very much like a deliberate attempt to trash Microsoft and NT.

The fact is that the identical arguments could be made toward any of
the standard Unix-like and all other popular operating systems. Linux,
*BSD, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX, et al.--even where the vendors have a 
`trusted' version--are all susceptible to the same attacks. Hence, by 
your reasoning, one would have to say that the architectures of every 
one of these operating systems do not offer `even the illusion of 
security'.
