It's funny, some of the mails sent by some mailers are being referred by
some as a troll. WHY?


BTW, could it happen that a mail bomb (I do not know the exact term) exist
in our system without us knowing it? How could it be removed? Coz it
appeared that some mailers are accused of sending spam mails when in truth
they didn't. (I think my sys adms are not fixing it).

It's funny, I have always been a good 
	listener who understood and cared
		someones secrets, but to my dismay 
			I have never been understood.
