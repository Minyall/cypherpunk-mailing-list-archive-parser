We offer Amnesty International's devastating critique
of US human rights violations, due to be released
in hardcopy tomorrow:

It recounts in voluminous, documented, gruesome detail 
what American justice is truly like in prisons, jails, precinct 
houses, on the highways and in the streets.

After this it's going to difficult for the US to preach human 
rights violations to other countries.
