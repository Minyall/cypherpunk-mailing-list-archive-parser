> Atheism means that one believes that there is no God.

You trying to claim atheism is a religion itself is like the christians
always claiming non-christians are satin worshippers. Forget about the
origination of the word, in today's reality most atheists simply forgo
religion completely.

There is no reason to think that a god does exist, so why would one even
need to think about or believe in the negative.

Yes, beliefs based on valid reason, empiricism and science are not
religious, the generally follow the path from conjecture to theory to
fact. You may hold lots of personal conjecture that do qualify as
beliefs but are not religious in nature, they are not exempt from
empirical evidence and the laws of thermodynamics. Beliefs based on
faith and mysticism are religious. Religion is irrational.

Thank you.

Perhaps in Bible-belt Texas, not around here (not in the city anyway).
