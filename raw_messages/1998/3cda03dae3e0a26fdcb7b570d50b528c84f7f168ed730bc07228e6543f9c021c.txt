Yes - I doubt if Lotus Notes has the ability to distinguish between
messages containing ASCII for "FUD" in the workfactor reduction field and
those containing 24 genuine bits of the key in question.  It's probably

As I recall, the LEAF field in Clipper suffered from a similar ability
to be disabled at the user's pleasure.
