531-539 ...Washington
according to http://www.ssa.gov/foia/stateweb.html

BTW - When you look at http://www.ssa.gov/foia/oct98hg.htm
The last two digit group issued for 539 is "39".  And according to
http://www.ssa.gov/foia/ssnweb.html the numbers are not issued in sequence,
but according to an strange method.  The early odds, then the evens, then
the rest of the odd number groups.  Just in case anyone wants to understand
how to detect bogus numbers.
