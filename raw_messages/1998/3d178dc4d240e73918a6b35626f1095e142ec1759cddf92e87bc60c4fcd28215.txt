I find it exceptionally unlikely that many people are participating in
this. Whomever called the thing was not thinking very clearly. You
need at least several weeks notice for such a thing to work, and the
two or three days notice (at most) that was given was way too small. A
strike of this nature might work, but only if someone with political
sense were organizing it.
