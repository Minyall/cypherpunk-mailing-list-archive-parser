The NYT today has a long piece on phone hackers,
"The Good. The Bad. The Geeks." With focus on a 
a few in New York City: Mantis, Wicked, Bell Boy,
Vertigo, et al.

Mantis admits working with LEAs in catching pedophiles
and phreakers (note link) who do not abide the "Hacker 
Ethic" of doing no harm, only "helping society" by exposing 
security weaknesses. 

Not all Feds and phreakers agree that pedophobic Feds 
and teeny-cute phreaks help society, although the pedophilic 
Agency allegedly abusing the adorable phreaker for its 
come-on entrapment had "no comment" to its online 
childlove racketeering and profiteering, sort of like the
NYT's art spiegel comic today.
