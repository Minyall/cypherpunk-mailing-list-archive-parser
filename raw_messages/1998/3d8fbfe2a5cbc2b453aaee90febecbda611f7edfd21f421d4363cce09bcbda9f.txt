I haven't checked on them in the last few months, but "Electric
Communities" (www.communities.com) was doing some interesting work on
adding security and market mechanism extensions to Java, in a superset

Many Cypherpunk list members, past and present  worked on aspects of this,
including Chip Morningstar (one of the founders), Doug Barnes, Norm Hardy,
Bill Frantz, Mark Miller, etc. They can speak up and say more.
