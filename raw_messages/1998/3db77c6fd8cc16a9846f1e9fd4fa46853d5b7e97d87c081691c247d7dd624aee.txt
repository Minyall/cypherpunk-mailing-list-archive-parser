Surprisingly enough NT4.0 has not received the C2 rating, although I could
have sworn I have seen remarks about Nt4.0 and C2 certification on a
Microsoft page. According to WIRED, NT 4.0 is undergoing testing, and will
supposedly be certified in Oct.

Apparently the gov't isn't too happy with the way MS is bluring the edges
of C2 certification of their products [Which they are buying].
