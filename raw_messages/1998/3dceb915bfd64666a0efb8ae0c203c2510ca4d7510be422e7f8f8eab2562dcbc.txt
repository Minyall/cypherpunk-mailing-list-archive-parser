Yes, statistical purposes only. Like the way the Census data are used for
statistical purposes only...except when used to round up those with
Japanese-sounding names.

(Pity in 1940 they weren't demanding that "race" be specified, as they now
do. Would've made finding all the Matsuis and Toyotas a bit easier.)

Here in California we have had computerized checks for many years, and now
the Dealer's Record of Sale (DROS) is almost always transmitted
electronically to the state capital. (One dealer said California will soon
"phase out" paper-based forms, and even small dealers will have to get
computerized.)

The effect is that a data base of gun owners is growing. "Guns: Negative"
and "Guns: Positive" are heard over police scanners (an illegal act, to
listen) as units roll up to residences. They check with the central data
base. Eric Blair is spinning.
