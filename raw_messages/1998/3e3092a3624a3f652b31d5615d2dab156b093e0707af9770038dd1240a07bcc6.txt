Trei, Peter enscribed thusly:
> Your question is too vague to get any kind of simple answer.

	I thought her question was pretty specific and the simple answer
is yes.  She asked if anyone had any opinions.  I might have responded that
asking an opinionated bunch like cypherpunks if any of them have opinions
must have been a retorical question.

	I think we all have opinions on regulating the internet.  I
don't think the simple answer is what she WANTED though...  :-)

	Answering the question she ASKED is REAL SIMPLE.  Just like the
joke about Microsoft support...  The answer is 100% correct and completely
useless.  :-)
