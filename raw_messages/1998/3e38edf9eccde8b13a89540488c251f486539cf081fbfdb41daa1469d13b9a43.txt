Woops. Corrected version:

"IF it is often not recognized that general and equal law
provide the most effective protection against infringement
of individual liberty, this is due mainly to the habit of
tacitly exempting the state and its agents from them and
of assuming that the government has the power to grant
exemptions to individuals."

etc...
