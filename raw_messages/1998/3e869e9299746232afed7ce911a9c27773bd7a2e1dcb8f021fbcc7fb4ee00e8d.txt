I think this is wrong. It claims that the problem
in IDEA comes from the bias of the multiplication
operation... but the multiply in IDEA is over the
integers modulo 65537, with the 0 value
representing 65536, not 0...  this is in fact an
unbiased operation. However I have not attempted
to verify the rest of the logic.
