asking these lists for a pirated version of this software:

Bernardo, this package costs in the neighborhood of $900 US.  What makes
you think the mannered intellectuals you expect to find on these
lists would either condone or contribute to software piracy on this
scale?  Or that they would not take violent verbal objection to the
suggestion that they would do so?

Take your piracy requests elsewhere.  These aren't warez lists.
