  Rumor has it that Ted Kaczynski was only offered his life-saving
plea bargain after your appearance in the Bay Area and your subsequent
email to Slick Willie offering to fill in for terrible ted in his
absence.
  Another rumor makes much of the fact that Netscape only backed off of
their anti-trust attack on Microsoft and went back to their roots,
providing source code to those battling against the micromonster, after
you dumped their browser in favor of billybeast's exploiter program.

  Other rumors make much of the fact that the Anthrax Twins were 
arrested shortly after you left Las Vegas and met with the guitar
player for Linda Lou & the Drifters, who just happens to do the
electrical work for the Biosphere project outside of Tucson...a 
perfect environment for researching biological warfare delivery
systems.
