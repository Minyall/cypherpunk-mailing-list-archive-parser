I don't see you have answered my question of whether a test has to
take into consideration how a sequence of numbers has been obtained.
Also what you wrote above seems to be less than clear. Do you suggest
that Mauerer's test is extremely good in deciding whether a sequence 
is TRULY random? (I think Maurer's test is good for investigating 
PRNG squences but maybe not used as a criterion between pseudo-
randomness and true randomness (whatever that may be defined)). 
What if some PRNGs pass Maurer's test?
