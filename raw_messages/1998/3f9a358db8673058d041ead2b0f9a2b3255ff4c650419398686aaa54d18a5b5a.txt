Agreed, however the motivations that drive people to creative or
constructive acts wouldn't change.

Agreed, but the ability to carry through on them *is* criticaly dependant
upon the social and technological infrastructure of the participants.

True, but what you are leaving out is their ability to impliment those
ideas, which most certainly depends upon the infrastructure that surrounds
them. Ideas abhor a vacuum. In such an environment it is reasonable to
assume that people would not loose their basic instincts, among them greed.
So it is clear that people would not stop having ideas, but the milieu of
those ideas would be restrictive and most probably very paranoid. If you
learned of a particular process or idea it would not be in your best
interest to pass it around. Further it would be very difficult to trust
others because there would be no consequence to them taking your idea and
using their resources (which the creator was depending on to actualize the
concepts) to create the end product themselves. Remember the prisoners
dilema here...

This is a straw man. We are discussing the issue of what would be reasonable
to expect considering human nature in an environment where there was *no*
protection of ideas and no redress of grievances through a legal system.
Intellectual anarchy if you will.
