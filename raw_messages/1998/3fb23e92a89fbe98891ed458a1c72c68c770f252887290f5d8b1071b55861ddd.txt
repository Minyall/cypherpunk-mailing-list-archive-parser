	good enough reasons if they do the trick, but I would rather
	they not impeach him; an impeachment hearing will put the
	ice pack on the market... and by the time the Senate can
	get around to finishing the deed, Clinton will have turned
	the government over to FEMA for some flim-flam excuse. better
	start getting ready to quarter the UN barbarian troops in
	your house.
