Is this not what they claimed when they sold NT to the Air Force?  Judging
by some of the Air Force software I have seen, this frightens me more than
most things.

You have a little more control over plug-ins.

But those are specific to the client.  Most Unix users know better.

I know of one, but I cannot release details yet.  (I did not discover it
and i need to wait until the non-beta version of the product is released.)
Besides, I have been told I will be killed if I reveal it before it is time.

A great deal of this blame can be placed on the WinSock spec.  The spec was
quite "loose" in many details of the implementation.  You could be
complient and still not be able to deal with much of the software out
there.  My vote for bad PC stack of the century was the one put out by Sun.
 Not even close to compatible...

Most everything involving computers tends to do that.

You can type it out in clear, short sentences and the media will still
screw it up.  If you have no clue as to what you are writing about, the
accuracy of what you write will suffer.

Multi-user NT is available now.  Citrix and NCD both have versions out now.
 (Both are based on NT 3.51.  They would have released a 4.0 product long
ago, but Microsoft wanted the product for themselves.)  The server load
seems to be about 50 users per box.   Depends on what you are running.

Assuming that they can be educated.  Better to offer them a choice.  It is
hard to say "X is bad" unless you have an alternative.
