The only problem I see with this model, re real card decks, is that the
probability for a given card to fall to the top of the shuffled pile isn't
related in any way to the number of cards in either stack in a real-world
shuffle.

It also doesn't address the problem of 'clumping' where a group of cards (ie
royal flush) stay together through the shuffling. This is the reason that
real dealers try for a 1-for-1 shuffle each time.
