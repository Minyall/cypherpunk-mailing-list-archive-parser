One way that Texas could address this issue is that the instant somebody
enters the state of Texas they are instant citizens. The downside is that
they could then vote. This leads to the potential of having persons
spin-loop through states gaining citizenship and voting. So Texas would
probably require 30 days or such, retaining the original intent of the
Constitution and the Amendments.

The founding fathers were strong believes in voting with ones feet in
regards discussion and expression of personal beliefs. The United States are
supposed to be a haven for personal freedom.
