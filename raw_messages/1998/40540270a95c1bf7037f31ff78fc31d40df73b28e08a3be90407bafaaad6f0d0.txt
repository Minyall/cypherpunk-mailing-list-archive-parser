Hi,

I talked to some RF guys about the RAFTER attack about a year ago.
Their opinion was that since modern receivers have GaAs FET mixers,
they don't leak the LO or IF out the antenna like the old fashioned
inductor based mixers did.

This should be trivial to confirm with a spectrum analyzer.
