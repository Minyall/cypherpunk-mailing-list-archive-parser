    y'al are missing the tornado: "Toto" is a small dog. rather
    territorial in fact. now, since I have literally made the 
    acquaintance of both "Toto" and his master/mistress, I shall 
    leave the reader to solve the exercise of "who is the master?"

    clue: it's not attila!

    clue: all truth can be found in "Alice in Wonderland"

	attila out...
