Dear One Nation supporter in NSW
 
We anticipate that the ABC's 7.30 Report will 
cover One Nation's discussion document on tax:  "2%EASYTAX" 
tonight.
 
We cannot guarantee how it will be presented but we are 
pleased that the ABC, unlike other Australian media, are apparently giving us 
the opportunity to present our views on why the tax should be 
considered.
 
The tax proposal has not been given a fair go by 
the media so far.
