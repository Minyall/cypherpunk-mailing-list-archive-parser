A new remailer will be up for the next two weeks.  This is an attempt to
play with and test the Win95 Reliable remailer software available at
ftp://ftp.efga.org/privacy

remailer@dragoncon.net is a Cypherpunk Type I remailer w/o Mix, which uses
RSA keys.  The operator had problems getting the later key types to work
properly.  Please send comments about the configuration and operation to
admin@dragoncon.net
