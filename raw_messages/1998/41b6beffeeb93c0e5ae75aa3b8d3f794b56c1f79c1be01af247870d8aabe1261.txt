Keep it.  If you're going for the liberal non-techie market, it's good;
if you're going for the financial market it's still ok,
and if you need to, you can publish a standard for it,
and some small Nevada corporation with a boring name can distribute a 
Crypto-Kong-compatible product with a boring name for you :-)

				Thanks!
