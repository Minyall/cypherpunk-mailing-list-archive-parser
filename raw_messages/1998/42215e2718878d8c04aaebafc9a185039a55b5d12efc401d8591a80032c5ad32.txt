Unix has been ported to memory only systems including the Palm OS (using
virtual drives) but you can't do much with it at this point.

"The Linux/Microcontroller project is a port of the Linux 2.0 to systems
without a Memory Management Unit. At present, only Motorola MC68000
derivatives are supported. The first target system to sucessfully boot is
the 3Com PalmPilot with a TRG SuperPilot Board and a custom boot loader
they put together specifically for the Linux/PalmPilot port. Thanks guys!"
