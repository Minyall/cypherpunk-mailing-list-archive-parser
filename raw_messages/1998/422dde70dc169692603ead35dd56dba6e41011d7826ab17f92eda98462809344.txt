FYI,

NPR's Talk of the Nation is having an hour-long debate on crypto policy
this afternoon with Undersecretary of Commerce William Reinsch, RSA's Lynn
McNulty and myself. A good portion of the show is dedicated to callers so
if you have any export control questions, this is the time to ask....
