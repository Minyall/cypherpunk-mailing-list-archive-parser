True, but unlike these other guys they haven't been able to de-crypt the
data and use it against him, and they have denied him access to retrieve
files that supposedly prove his innocence, definitely making the big boys
look more than a tad oppressive. Add onto this the physical abuse that is
supposed to have occurred and it becomes to be seen as an issue irrespective
of his crimes.

I would say that in Mitnick's case the use of crypto has worked to his
long-term advantage.
