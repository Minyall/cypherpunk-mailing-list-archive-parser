It's only weird if you assume the authors have a clue...
Depending on the overall context, telco software companies and their
customers may find this section interesting as well.

If they were thinking at all when they wrote this, they were probable concerned
about products that let people ship exportable binaries and patchtools
that let users recover the source code to undo the limitations.

But as you say, general purpose tools work fine.  The special purpose
tools I've seen have been the ones that patch the binaries of Netscape
40-bit versions to reenable 128-bit capability, and they just use binary.

				Thanks!
