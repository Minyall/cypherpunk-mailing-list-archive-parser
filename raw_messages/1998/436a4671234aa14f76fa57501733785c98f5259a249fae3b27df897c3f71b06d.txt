I am impressed, this thing follows the laws of California, mighty
impressive.  Both a 1-800 number to call, an email address of a real
person and an automated removal...  And it even had an address in it!

Spammers are starting to kinda follow laws.. if only they would follows
rules, like "SPAMMING IS BAD!" but that wont happen... 

just my $0.02 worth
