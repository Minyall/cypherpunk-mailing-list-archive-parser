I just found this posted to usenet.  Can anyone in NC verify it?

Looking through the new NC Sex Offender Registry, who did I see?
   GARY LEE BURNORE
   4201 BLAND ROAD APT J
   RALEIGH NC 27609
Offense and Conviction Information:
   Conviction Date: 03-13-1997
   NC Statute: 14-202.1 - INDECENT LIBERTY MINOR
   Sentence Imposed: PROBATION 3Y
   Court County: SANTA CLARA, CA
   
Two questions:
   1-Is this the same jerk who posts regularly to triangle.general?
   2-If so: anyone know anything else about this conviction?
 
Thanks.
