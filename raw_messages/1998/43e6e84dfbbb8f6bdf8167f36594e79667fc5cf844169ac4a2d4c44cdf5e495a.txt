The LPD (law on data protection) :
	http://193.5.216.40/ch/f/rs/235_1/index.html
	http://193.5.216.40/ch/f/rs/235_11/index.html
	(in french, italian, german only)

The LPD states that you can get a copy of your database entry printed
on paper, for a cost of max 300SFrs (about US$200), unless some special
cases which have to be specified in the law. Since the debate is based
on the fact that there is no legal text that allows swisscom to record
these informations, there is no legal text that allow them not to
communicate your informations on request. I'm not a jurist, but it
may be an interesting path to follow.

If they store the location of your phone every 3 secs, for 6 month,
this means 5'241'600 locations. Printed on 70 lines/page paper,
this means 74'880 A4 pages. Do you think they'd be happy to print
and send you 74'880 pages for 300SFrs ?

There is certain rules that allow them to postpone your request.
However, they have to tell you before. Just wondering what would
happen if 100'000 people asks for their last 6 month of positions...

Last month, I was thinking about launching a web site to inform
swiss citizen about these issues. A kind of swiss EPIC. However,
I can't do this alone.

If anybody is interested by this idea, drop me a mail.

swisscom does it. They log all the internal/external mail of their
employees...
