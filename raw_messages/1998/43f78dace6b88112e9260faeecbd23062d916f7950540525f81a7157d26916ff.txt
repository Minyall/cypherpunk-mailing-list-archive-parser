I think this ought to be nipped in the bud right now if not true.
I've heard rumors on this list about algorithms but attributing it to
someone at Sandia is pretty substantial however I think DV's claim
above sounds totally bogus. if anyone else can comment please do.
I don't so much want to know whether he has discovered an algorithm
at this point, only whether someone at Sandia claims to have
discovered a fast factoring algorithm. after that-- well, what
exactly is "fast"?
