Indeed.. what we need is for someone to testify to the court about
natural and computer language, and maybe some relevent material from
information theory. 

Pseudo-code from any computer programming textbook would be helpful
in making this point too.

What about English in a voice recognition system? In this case, English
can actually perform functions too, just as C does.
