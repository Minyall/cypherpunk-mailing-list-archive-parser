If you are running Red Hat Linux and want the Cryptographic File System (also
available for most BSD-derived Unix systems and most current Linux releases),
go to http://www.replay.com/redhat/cfs.html                               

If you are running Linux 2.0.X and want the Transparent Cryptographic File
System (improves on Matt Blaze's CFS, they say), go to           
http://vales.uni.net/tcfs/
