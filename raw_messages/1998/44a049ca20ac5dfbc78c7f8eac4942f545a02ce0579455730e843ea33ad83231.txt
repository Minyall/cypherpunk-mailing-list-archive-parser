I am having problems with PGP 5i for solaris.

I am aware of http://www.pgpi.com/bugs/bugs50i.shtml

I have tried setting HAVE64 to 0 and the 
*** src/lib/pgp/include/pgpUsuals.h~    Sat Aug  9 22:44:58 1997
--- src/lib/pgp/include/pgpUsuals.h     Tue Aug 12 16:57:16 1997

patch but neither solve my problem.

I get "Received signal 10." after entering my pass phrase when
trying to decrypt a message encoded to my PK.

Has anyone got it to work?
