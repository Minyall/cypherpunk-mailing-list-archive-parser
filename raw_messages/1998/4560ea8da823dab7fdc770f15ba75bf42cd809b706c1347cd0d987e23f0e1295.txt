Did not Clinton say publicly that he did not consider oral sex "sexual
relations" in some statement recently?

[mailto:owner-cypherpunks@cyberpass.net]On Behalf Of Declan McCullagh
Clinton said this morning:

>>>>
 I want you to listen to me.  I'm
going to say this again.  I did not have sexual relations with that
woman, Miss Lewinsky.  I never told anybody to lie, not a single time
-- never.  These allegations are false.
<<<<

>>>>The question then becomes, of course, what does "sexual relations" mean?

Is it oral sex?
