I was talking to Hugh yesterday, and he asked if I'd heard the big news
- no, not Clinton's sex scandal, the important news, about the
Netscape browser source code being freed :-)
(This was before the news on the Unabomber confession broke.)

If the Democrats think Clinton's going down anyway, they're probably
better off having him resign now and give Gore a couple years in office,
since he'll probably be re-elected if the economy stays strong (probable)
and if the Republicans don't come up with a useful candidate (probable);
if he has to be Vice-Clinton for two more years, he's got minimal chance
of election even if the Republicans come out with another bozo,
because Gore will be more tainted and still just waterboy.

Yeah - especially since President Gore would have to start off by
Doing Something to get some positive momentum, and it would probably
be doing something bad to the Internet.
				Thanks!
