Hey 'Nobody' (tcmay@got.net (Tim May)), you may as well stop sending me all
your junk mail.  Since you've resorted to attempting to get me kicked off of
AOL for responding to individual pieces of it (Cypherpunks, that's a lie.  He
did that attempt in an attempt to get my website kicked off of AOL), I'm
simply deleting everything that comes in from all the anon. remailing services
without reading it.

If you don't have enough guts to put a return address on your mail, obviously,
you aren't worth reading.

Stan,
Stan and the Sequencers
