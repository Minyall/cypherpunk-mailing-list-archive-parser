I think you're going  to be disappointed if you go there;
the pgp web page has been swallowed by nai's, & download
leads you to the new McAfee store, which is surely a nominee
for "web pages that suck"(tm).  No free downloads.  There may 
be something under one of the evaluation pages, but frankly
the whole site turned me off & I didn't care to look so.  It's hard
to find any mention of pgp at all, actually.
