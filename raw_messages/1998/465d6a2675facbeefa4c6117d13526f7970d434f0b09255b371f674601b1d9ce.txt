I dont believe he is saying source is not available because it is.  In
book form, currently getting scanned in europe somehwere where the
Wersaanar(i dont care i misspelt it) was not signed

See above, however, Scram disk has been around more, and it's source
is available

Agreed, thats why in PGP's case source is released.

Actually in theory there is, people can steal code, use progs without
paying etcetera. (the latter is available through "juarez" though)

McAfee does not exist, neither does PGP Inc, in a merger of those two and
Network General, they formed Network Associates.  Later NetAss purchased
TIS, for their firewall mind you, and they were members of KRAP .  so NAI
was officially brough in.
