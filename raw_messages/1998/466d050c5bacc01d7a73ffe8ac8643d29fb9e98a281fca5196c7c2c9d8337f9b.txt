I find that religion is one of the most detrimental forces to the
internet.  I believe that the internet is a very real chance to assert
self-rule.  A religious government would not allow that.  I might
worship false idols or something.  If government does start to favor
religious morals I hope it is voodoo!  That would at least add some
entertainment :)
