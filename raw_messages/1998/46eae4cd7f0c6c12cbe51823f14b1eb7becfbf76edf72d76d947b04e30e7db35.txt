I don't know if this is the "module" form of the answer you want:

http://www.replay.com/
 
    Download Netscape Communicator 4.04 with 128 bits SSL today on: 
           ftp.replay.com 
    Replay Associates distributes this software
    so you can safely conduct your E-commerce

How about moving this list to encrypt its transmissions in
the recipient's public keys, just to begin encrypting Net traffic?

Obviously not to hide what is being said, but simply to start
moving communications into the encrypted realm.

That way, we'll build up the software tools for handling this,
and try to get other lists to do the same.

Maybe encourage all pro-crypto people to use it for all email to as
many other people they talk with as possible. (Adopt two others...)

Heh: a white-list to allow only encrypted messages through.

Encourage Senators to set up public keys.

In general, try to get the general flow of traffic encrypted,
even if PGP is "mundane" these days.

Solving the human factors problem of getting its use wide-spread
is _not_ a mundane problem. Encryption ain't gonna be that useful
if only a few in-the-know use it.
