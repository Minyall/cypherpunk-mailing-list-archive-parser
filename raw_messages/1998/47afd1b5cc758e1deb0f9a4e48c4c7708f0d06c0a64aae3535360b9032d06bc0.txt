If you can get hold of the older, analog, 'transportable' cell phones (like
Motorola used to make) which have an antenna connector, its relatively easy
to spoof the cell ranging system.  Just connect a directional antenna
(<$75) to the port (corner reflectors which have excellent front-to-back
ratios are particularly good).  You should easily be able to fool their
signal strength based equipment into thinking your in an adjacent cell.  If
you can find high ground so much the better.

Universal, an early U.S. analog cellular mfg. built this sort of unit in
the early '90s.  It was an idea ahead of its time.

Yhis is a great cypherpunk service.  Allow our fellows to make free local,
VoIP, calls from our PC/PSTN links.
