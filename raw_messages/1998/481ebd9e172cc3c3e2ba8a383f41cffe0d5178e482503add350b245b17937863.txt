Sure, but does that mean the MS platform was less suitable than Unix, or
their MS platform programmers were inferior to their Unix counterparts.
I believe Netscape outsourced the Unix development, at least initially.
I would blame insufficient SQA at Netscape, and from what I've heard
that claim is justified.
