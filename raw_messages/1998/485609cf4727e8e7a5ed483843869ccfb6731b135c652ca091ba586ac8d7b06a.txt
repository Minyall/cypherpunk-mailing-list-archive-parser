In the early 1980's I started trying this approach.  I did the
back-of-the-envelope estimate and realized it was too big, but
I thought it worth trying, since if there were a back door in
DES it might manifest itself by a massive collapse in the complexity
of these expressions.  I didn't get far enough into it to decide one
way or the other, since I didn't have a good tool for reducing the
expressions to minimal form.
