Quote:

   SUMMARY: This interim rule amends the Export Administration 
   Regulations (EAR) by clarifying controls on the export and reexport 
   of encryption items (EI) controlled for ``EI'' reasons on the 
   Commerce Control List. This rule incorporates public comments 
   on an interim rule published in the Federal Register on December 
   30, 1996, and implements new licensing policies for general 
   purpose non-recoverable non-voice encryption commodities or 
   software of any key length for distribution to banks and financial 
   institutions in specified countries.
