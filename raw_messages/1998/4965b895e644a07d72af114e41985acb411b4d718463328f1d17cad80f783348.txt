NYT Magazine, June 14, 1998:

PREPARE YE 

This will make for a gloomy five days, but from June 29 to 
July 3 disaster experts from all over will convene in 
Russellville, Ark., to talk about "Principles and Practice 
of Disaster Relief and Recovery." 

Sessions cover: How to create an emergency mass mortuary, 
toxic-waste cleanups and dealing with nuclear meltdown. 

Vernie R. Fountain, of the Fountain National Academy of 
Professional Embalming Skills in Springfield, Mo., will 
discuss "identification of the dead" after natural and 
man-made disasters. 

Natural disasters have killed 181 people this year in the 
United States; there have been more than 600 tornadoes. 

Are we in jinxed times? "It's been a pretty good year so 
far, not a lot of terrorism," says Matthew Blais, a 
nuclear-terrorism expert. "But there are a lot of crazy 
people out there, saving up for the big one. You never 
know when."
