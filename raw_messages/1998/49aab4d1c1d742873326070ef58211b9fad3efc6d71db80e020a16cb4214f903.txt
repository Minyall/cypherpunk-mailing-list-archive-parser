Those of us outside of the Microsoft Marketing Machine have a different
opinion.  Frankly, I do not want to make Bill Gates's latest advertising
gimmick any more 'efficient' nor do I want to be his 'potential customer'.
I have had just about enough crap from Microsoft, which is why I deleted
JunkOS version 95, and use Linux instead.

When I open up my email and find twenty pieces of spam, like most people
I start hitting the delete key.  Last week I got a call from a friend...
"Didn't you get my email?"  "uh... no..."
