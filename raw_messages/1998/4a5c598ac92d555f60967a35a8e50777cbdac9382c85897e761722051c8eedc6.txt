I would like to know the information my browser makes available to web sites. I use both Netscape and Internet Explorer.

Obviously web sites can determine my IP address for any given session; they can also look at cookies left by themselves and other sites.

Can anyone point me to where I can learn exactly what other information is made available (browser version?, OS version?, system name?, user name?, etc.)?

Thanks in advance.
