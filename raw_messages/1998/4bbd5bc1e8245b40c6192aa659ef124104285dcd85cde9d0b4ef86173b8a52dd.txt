Those prices are a lot better than the last X.25 spec I priced.  My local
paper says that 1 Swiss Franc is worth about 66 US cents ($0.66).  That is
about the same exchange rate as when I was in Switzerland last summer.  As
one of the world's more stable currencies, I would indeed consider the
Swiss Franc to be "real money".
