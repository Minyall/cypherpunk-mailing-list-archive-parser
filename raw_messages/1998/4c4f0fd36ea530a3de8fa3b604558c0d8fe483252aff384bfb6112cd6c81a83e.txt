I've just started a crypto newsletter: CRYPTO-GRAM is a free monthly 
email  newsletter on cryptography from Bruce Schneier (author of 
Applied Cryptography, inventor of Blowfish, general crypto pundit 
and occasional crypto curmudgeon).

You can subscribe to CRYPTO-GRAM:

	on the WWW, at http://www.counterpane.com/crypto-gram.html

	by sending e-mail to crypto-gram-subscribe@chaparraltree.com

In the May issue:

	The Secret Story of Non-Secret Encryption.  The story
	behind the British claim that they invented public-key
	cryptography first.

	Advanced Encryption Standard.  How the government
	is replacing DES.

In the June issue:

	Side Channel Attacks.  What's the big idea behind the
	recent press announcements about breaking smart
	cards by analyzing the power line?

	Risks of Key Recovery, Key Escrow, etc.  Why
	implementing a FBI-style key recovery scheme will
	do more to hurt national security than simply letting
	people communicate.

Other regular features include:

	News.  Links to the interesting crypto stories.

	War Stories.  There are security lessons to learn
	from all over, not just from computer geeks.

	Resources.  Summaries of the good Web resources
	on privacy, security, and encryption.

We understand and respect your right to privacy.  You are

interest in the areas of privacy, security and encryption. 
You should also know that we would not sell, rent or share 
our mailing list should you decide to subscribe. Our goal

trust with our subscribers.  The members of this list are
