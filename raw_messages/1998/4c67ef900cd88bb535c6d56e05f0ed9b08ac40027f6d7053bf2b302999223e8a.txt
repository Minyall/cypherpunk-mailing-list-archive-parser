Over 4000 US doctors have proved: Email filters REDUCE YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE.

It WORKS!!!!!

Get procmail ***NOW*** from

  ftp://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/pub/packages/procmail/procmail.tar.gz

and read the files named README, INSTALL and FAQ.

It is COMPLETELY FREE OF CHARGE!!!!

SATISFACTION ***GUARANTEED***
