     That makes two rude replies in a row in response to polite
messages.  I'll give anyone the benefit of one bad hair day, but
further discussion with you is obviously a waste of time.  I do thank
you for demonstrating that "transcendence" is not a null concept,
however.  You are without a doubt a transcendent asshole.

     I retire from this discussion and yield the floor to you,
Mr. Choate.  It is only fitting, seeing as you've gone to such trouble
to deposit that large pile of fecal matter in the middle of it.

Regards,
