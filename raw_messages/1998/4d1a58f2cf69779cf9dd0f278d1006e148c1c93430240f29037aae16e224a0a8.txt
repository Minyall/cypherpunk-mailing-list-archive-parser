Every version of SAFE includes crypto-in-a-crime as a key component. The
thinking of its drafters and backers like Reps. Goodlatte, Eschoo,
Lofgren, CDT, and some corporate lobbyists is that it would be too
politically controversial to pass Congress without it.

There is, offically, a proposal on the table to limit speech within the
U.S. by restricting sale, manufacture, distribution, import of non-GAK'd
crypto. A House committee approved that one year ago.
