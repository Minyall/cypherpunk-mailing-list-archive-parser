The Mafia has had two primary characteristics:

a) the use of force
b) trade in elicit and prohibited goods and services

Unless you can claim a reference to a Mafia at some time and place that
had neither characteristics and a market which they monopolized which
lacked any other intervention, then this all is utterly irrelevant to
the discussion at hand.
