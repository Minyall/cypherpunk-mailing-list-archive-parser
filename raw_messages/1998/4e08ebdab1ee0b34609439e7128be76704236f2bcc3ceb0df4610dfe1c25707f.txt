Twofish, the block cipher we have submitted to NIST's AES competition, is on the web.  Please see

	http://www.counterpane.com/twofish.html

for details, including description, analysis, source code, and test vectors.

Other AES submissions will presumably be made public as the weeks progress, although NIST will not publish the submissions until the August meeting.  See the NIST website at

	http://csrc.nist.gov/encryption/aes/aes_home.htm

for more details.
