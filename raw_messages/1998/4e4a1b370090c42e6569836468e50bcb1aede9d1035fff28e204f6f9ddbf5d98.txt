It could be done if the remailer software is rewritten.  When you send a
message, include instructions for the last remailer to write a message to
either usenet or a web page on the same net as the remailer with a sender
selected id.  Have these pooled and posted every day/week, etc...

If your mail bounces it you'll know by reading a page off a server, or a
message off usenet... 


i.e. for the last one in the chain
::Request bounce "xyzzy12345"

Dont post anything other than the bounce strings to the world.  (i.e.
don't post the intended recipient's name, etc...)
