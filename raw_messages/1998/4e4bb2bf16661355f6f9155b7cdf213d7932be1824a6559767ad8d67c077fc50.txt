Indirectly, I am already being charged a tax for internet service:   this month AT&T added
a "Universal Connectivity Charge" for a "Universal Service Fund" which "not only helps
provide affordable phone service but also gives schools and libraries access to the
internet."

It's only $1.88 right now, just a wedge . . .
