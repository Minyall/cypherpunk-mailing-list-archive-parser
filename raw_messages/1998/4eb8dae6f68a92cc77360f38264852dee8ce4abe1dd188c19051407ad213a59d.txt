We offer the U.S. District Court's decision in Idaho v. Horiuchi 
to dismiss state charges against the FBI sniper/killer of Vicki 
Weaver.

Grim reading of succinct description of the killing and gun
battle, and how the feds carefully protect their own from 
harm for punishing those foolish to challenge national might. 

The judge wisely notes his decision does not preclude
the possibility that other, federal, charges may be brought 
against Horiuchi and his supervisors. Some chance.
