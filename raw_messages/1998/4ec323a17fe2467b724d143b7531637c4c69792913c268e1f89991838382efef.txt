Now that the terrified US Army has axed its Web sites, and 
NSA and several other mil sites seem inaccessible and
"temporarily unavailable" this morning, could this portend
a dual-use of the Internet, a closed one for porkbarrell mil and
secret gov sweethearts and a sappy infotainment one for civilians 
to gameboy infofoolery?

That would be a tri-power-gov implementation of dual-use 
terror-scare to hide perkbellied privileges of natsec obsession.
