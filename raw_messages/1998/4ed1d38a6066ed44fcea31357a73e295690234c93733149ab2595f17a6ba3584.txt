COMING IN ON A WING AND DISPAIR  (29 April 1998)

        Pilots are leaving the Air Force like fleas jumping off a dead 
dog. If
this exodus in blue doesn't stop, there won't be anyone left to fly the
existing megabuck fleet of aircraft or the trillion dollar fleet of
space-age new fighters the Air Force wants for the 21st century.

        Without pilots it's going to be even harder to justify all these 
costly
new silver bullets when a congressperson or two without bases or flying
machine plants back home comes asking, "Who needs these suckers when
missiles, robots, bugs and germs, and 16-year-old hackers will be the
weapons of the future?"
