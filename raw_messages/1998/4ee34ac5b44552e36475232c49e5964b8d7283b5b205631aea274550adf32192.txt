Hello Adult Webmaster,

It's one thing to get a surfer to visit your site once.  But that's not
where the money is.  You have to find a way to get your visitors to come
back again and again.  Build a clientelle.

We have found that the sites that offer "of the day" pics are the most
successful in building a loyal following.  Changing pictures everyday,
though, can be tedious and expensive.  So, to help you build your site,
we are offering FREE CONTENT!

SextraCash has just introduced a new way to bring surfers back to your
site EVERYDAY.

Introducing the DAILY SEXPACK.

Everyday, a new free pic will be posted to six different categories.
All six pics are updated daily. Your surfers will come back everyday
to see the new "of the day" pics.  Best of all, it's TOTALLY FREE TO YOU.
It is not often that you will receive an offer that is truly a win/win
proposition.  Most free content providers have a hidden agenda.
Either they want to keep all of the money generated by the banners,
or make you post something about them in a prime location on your site.
That is not what I am offering.  You get to keep all of the banner money,
and I don't require a reciprocal link of any kind.  Check it out.
