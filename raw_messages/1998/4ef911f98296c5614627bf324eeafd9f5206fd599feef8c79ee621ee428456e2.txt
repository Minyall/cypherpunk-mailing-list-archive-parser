Try pantheism. If one fundamentaly believes that god does not exist, which
clearly involves faith, then yes it is a religion. A religion is a belief
system that provides a relationship between the individual and the totality
of all else (the cosmos if you'll allow me).

By your view an agnostic can't be religion since it is the recognition of
a *lack* of faith, clearly something you require to be religous. An atheist
says that god could exist but doesn't - clearly an act of faith.

There are fundamentaly two types of religions, those that recognize some for
of transcendance and those that don't. Quibbling over what is the 'correct'
form of transcendence is as irrelevant as arguing over the 'correct'
religion.

In either case the same failure to understand human psychology is committed.
In short it is the axiomatic assumption that there *is* a single anything
that will satisfy everyone.

What do you mean by 'spiritual'? Are you refering to a ghost-in-the-machine
either at the individual or cosmological level? Whether one believes that
mystical element is external (which if you understood God would clearly be
seen to be a non sequitar with the rest of your argument) or internal is 
irrelevant.
