A friend of mine sent me the following:

We are in the process of testing the new piece of software we designed:


> AGGRESSION TESTING: If this doesn't work, I'm gonna kill somebody.
> 
> COMPRESSION TESTING:  []
> 
> CONFESSION TESTING: Okay, Okay, I did program that bug.
> 
> CONGRESSIONAL TESTING:  Are you now, or have you ever been a bug?
> 
> DEPRESSION TESTING: If this doesn't work, I'm gonna kill myself.
> 
> EGRESSION TESTING: Uh-oh, a bug... I'm outta here.
> 
> DIGRESSION TESTING: Well, it works, but can I tell you about my truck...
> 
> EXPRESSION TESTING: #@%^&*!!!, a bug.
> 
> OBSESSION TESTING: I'll find this bug if it's the last thing I do.
> 
> OPPRESSION TESTING:  Test this now!
> 
> POISSON TESTING:  Alors!  Regardez le poisson!
> 
> REPRESSION TESTING: It's not a bug, it's a feature.
> 
> SECESSION TESTING: The bug is dead!  Long live the bug!
> 
> SUGGESTION TESTING: Well, it works but wouldn't it be better if...
