Trying to make sense of the various applications of crypto,
I came up with an illustration of their 'dependancies' at
	http://rattler.otc.net/crypto/mydocs/taxonomy.gif
This picture illustrates topics that you should learn
before others.

For instance, digital watermarking depends on steganography
and message-authentication codes.  Anonymity requires
understanding traffic mixing and practical encryption; practical
encryption requires understanding public and secret key encryption.

FWIW.  Comments welcome.
