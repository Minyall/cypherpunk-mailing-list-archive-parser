The morons in congress responded to intercepts of cellphones.  Because
Newt was scanned.  Response: outlaw *cellphones*... which are 
themselves typically programmable as scanners of cell freqs.  And scanners
and programmable RF receivers.

Someone should pick up a congresscritter's monitor (a la van Eyk), then let
them 
make fools of themselves banning television receivers... as video tempest
receiving gear...

[NB: since television Ch 83 overlaps with a cell-phone channel, TVs are
already illegal
under this law, no?  Selling an old analog b/w TV is now punishable by 1/2
million fine... ]

Are they going to ban IR lasers since they can be used to listen to window
vibration?

Remember Tacitus.
