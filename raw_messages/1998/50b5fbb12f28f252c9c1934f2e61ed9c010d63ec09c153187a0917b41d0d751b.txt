One question I'd like asked is whether the US Gov will approve 56-bit RC-4
for export on the same terms as 56-bit DES. That would allow export
versions of web browsers to be upgraded painlessly, making international
e-commerce 64 thousand times more secure than existing 40-bit browsers.
(56-bit DES browsers would require every merchant to upgrade their SSL
servers and introduce a lot of unneeded complexity.)
