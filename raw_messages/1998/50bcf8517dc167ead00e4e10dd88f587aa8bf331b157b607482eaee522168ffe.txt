Nice to see D'Jinn jumping in ...

Here in the Peoples Republik ov NJ, the DL's have no magstrips.  But, 
being that it is NJ, they're probably not far away.  An interesting point
is that, when I moved (intrastate), the MVS sent a decal with the new
address to stick on the back.  No re-issue necessary, which is good, since
most bars/liquor stores will not accept licenses marked DUP.  But, they
will accept passports.

Also interesting is that PA has recently (within the past 2-4 years) been
issuing DL's with the driver's SSN.
