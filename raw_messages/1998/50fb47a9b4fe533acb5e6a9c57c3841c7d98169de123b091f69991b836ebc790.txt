Sounds like you are describing something which is a variant of an
interlock protocol.  The idea of an interlock protocol is that you
send out first a hash of what you are intending to publish.

The MITM has a problem in deciding what to publish, because they have
to publish _a_ hash, but they don't know what it should be of.
