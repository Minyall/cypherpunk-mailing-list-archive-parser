Well... The answer is that there is much less washing needed for
survival than it is needed for day to day civilized American life.

For instance, I change my shirts every day. If shit hits the fan,
you can wear a shirt for two weeks. Similar story is with other
clothes.

Come one, you can set up big latrines outside houses.

Well, yeah, of course. With pasta, you can make soup and eat the
water, too.

Well, yes, but still you need no more than 3 gallons of water,
which was my main contention.

It is entorely possible to live a decent life off of 3 gallons of
water per day. I am speaking out of my experience.

There is no problem with a properly set up outside toilet. 

There is a problem with eating unwashed food AND dirty hands.

To set up a toilet, dig a hole about 3-4 feet deep, fortify it
somewhat so that it would not cave in (for most soils fortification is
unnecessary). Then, build something above the hole so that people would
not be embarrassed to go there.

That's IT. Our country house in Russia used this system, it is reasonably
safe, etc. The whole neighborhood of houses used this system, as did
millions of other Russians. It _is_ safe. (Our apartment in Moscow had
a regular flush toilet bathroom).

No, they were pretty nice. Not all of them agreed, but they had a
sensible discussion.
