One very easy test is to compress the produced random number binary files
with various compression algorithms or programs. If the data is truly 
random, it should not be possible to achieve any compression. At least
not if you include the compression program data size in the calculation.

Well, I'm not sure whether this is such a good practical test or not.(?)
