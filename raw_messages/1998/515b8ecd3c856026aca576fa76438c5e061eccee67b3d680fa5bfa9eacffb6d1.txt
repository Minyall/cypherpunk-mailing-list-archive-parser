Read the 10th again you don't understand what it is saying. 

It *specificaly* says that unless the Constitution assigns it to the feds
*or* prohibits it then the states are *exactly* the ones that are able to do
what Congress is prohibited from doing. The states are limited by their
own consititions which are guaranteed to be representative in nature.

The states absolutely have the right to regulate gun laws (as in the Texas
constitution) provided they don't infringe (what part of shall not do you
not understand) on the actual possession. Licenses and background checks
at the state level are absolutely constitutional.

State regulation on speech, press, etc. are also completely constitutional
as well. And is where such regulation should take place. If you don't like
your states laws move to one you do like.

That's what it means to live in a democracy, freedom of choice - not
homogeneity (on this point ol' Alex was wrong, wrong, wrong).
