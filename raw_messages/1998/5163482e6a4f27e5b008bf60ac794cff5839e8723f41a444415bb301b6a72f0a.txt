I've never heard this anywhere else but I was browsing www.infowar.com and I saw this quote

Question the priorities 
Private sector intellectual property deserves pride of place 
Data integrity and system survivability are the priorities 
Unencumbered encryption is vital for national competitiveness 
Protecting all private sector data is more important than a marginal enhancement to our government's ability to catch criminals and terrorists 
****PGP is not good enough-"exported PGP" has Soviet back doors 
Lotus reported to have given away half the key to NSA-Swedes are pissed 
  
Does anyone have info on this?  I assume that since the source code for PGP is publicly available someone would have questioned this already...
