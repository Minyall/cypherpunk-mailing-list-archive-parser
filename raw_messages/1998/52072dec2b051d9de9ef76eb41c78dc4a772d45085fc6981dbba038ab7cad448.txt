I was recently informed from sorces who choose to remain annomous about a viri
that uses macafe's update tool to detect when it is found then it modifys its
code and forms a new strain of the virus this pattern continues although it
has only been tested through a clone of macafees server to 100 mutations it
looks like it could be a big problem I will inform you of any more information
i learn about it 

but for now    "THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE"
