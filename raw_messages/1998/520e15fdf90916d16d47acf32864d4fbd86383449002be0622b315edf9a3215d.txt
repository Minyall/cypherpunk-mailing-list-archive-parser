Going and doing stuff is an Executive Branch function;
enforcing laws is an Executive Branch function.
Issuing the warrant allowing the police to go search or arrest
someone is a judicial function, and is generally done on request
by the police or prosecutors.  In the case of early-60s New York,
of course, it simply wasn't bothered with.  :-)

I'm not familiar with the case - got a pointer?
