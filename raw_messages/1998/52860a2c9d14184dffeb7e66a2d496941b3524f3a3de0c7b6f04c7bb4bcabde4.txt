As I recall, this thread is about customs officials booting your laptop
from *their* floppy and scanning your hard drive.  I suggest two
practical solutions to avoid this incursion:

1) Leave the floppy drive at home ;-) Many PCs have swapable floppy/
CD-ROM bays. I've learned to live without my floppy (others may not have
that option.)

2) If you can't leave your floppy at home, carry your sensitive data on 
a PCMCIA Type-II Hard Drive. Kingston sells one sporting 500MB 
of capacity. Pop it out and put it as far away from the laptop as you
can. Inside your other luggage somewhere.
