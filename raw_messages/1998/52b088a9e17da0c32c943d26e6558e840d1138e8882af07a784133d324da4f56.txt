My earlier post was slightly overstated.  Phil Karn has testified before
Congress numerous times about his legal challenge and has consistently
pushed these issues in the legislature.  

My testimony will be the first time any of the attorneys involved have been
asked to discuss the constitutional problems with the cryptography
restrinctions.

My apologies to Phil.

Cindy
