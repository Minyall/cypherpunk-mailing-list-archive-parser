That's disgusting.

   o Capacity for up to 512 simultaneous call content intercepts on a single call basis 
   o Capability to incorporate FBI "punchlist" items
   o Supports Lawfully Authorized Electronic Surveillance (LAES) delivery features 
   o Delivers intercepted call content and call identifying in formation simultaneously to
     five authorized law enforcement agency collection systems
