I was just wondering if anyone would be interested in discussing
cryptography, personal privacy, security protocols, digital signatures,
anonymous remailers, digital cash, crypto anarchy...?  No?  OK, then we
can go back to spam, Microsoft bashing, calling each other "idiots" and
"chickens," and forwarding News of the Weird for no obvious reason.
