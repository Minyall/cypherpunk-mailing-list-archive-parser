Briefcase-sized EMP - fun idea but I don't know how to make it workable.
HV generator on the end of a stick - not too tough.
High power LASER to burn out CCDs - buy anonymously, nice, works from
a
safe distance.
What's needed are moles to leak detailed info on systems as they're
planned and installed. Then it would be easy to determine the weak
points. If each camera had to be guarded there would be a *huge* problem
just keeping the systems alive.
 
Low tech:
Paintball guns, doped with fluoric acid to etch the lens.  Works
well on speed cameras.
