In spite of their <numerous?> shortcomings, many of today's politicians
in both parties seem to be fairly pragmatic, 'middle of the road' types.
If the only people who can pass muster under the emerging standards are
religous fundamentalists then we will have a Bill of Rights under attack
problem that is another order of magnitude greater than we have right

some of the fundamentalists I've known are not very tolerant.
