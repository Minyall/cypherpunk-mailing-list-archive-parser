	Thanks for the info.  Maybe some merry band of pranksters
	would be willing to sneak into this guy's house and install
	an obvious-looking mock camera over his shower head?  I mean,
	just in case he's a child molester and all.

	Maybe once we're done legislating the internet, we can
	legislate the topolology of Euclidean space, so that every
	point is within earshot of a mike and eyeshot of a camera.
	After all, those evil child molesting evil bad evil people
	might take to doing evil stuff in their basement, or the
	nearby woods!
