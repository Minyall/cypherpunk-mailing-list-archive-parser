WARNING TO PARENTS:

A form of tattoo called "Blue Star" is being sold to school children.

It is a small piece of paper containing a blue star. They are the size of a
pencil eraser and each star contains traces of Lysergic Acid Deithylamide
(LSD).

The drug is absorbed through the skin simply by handling the paper. They
are also brightly colored paper tattoos resembling postage stamps that
have the pictures of the following on them:
              Superman       Mickey Mouse         Butterflies
              Clowns         Disney Characters    Bart Simpson

Each one is wrapped in foil.  This is a new way of selling LSD by appealing
to young children.  These are laced with drugs.  If your child gets any of
the above, do not handle them. These are known to react quickly and
some are laced with strychnine, which may cause irreversible brain damage in
some cases. The drug is addictive and, in the quantities contained in the
above items, can cause children to become additcts.

Please feel free to distribute this article within your community and work
place.
