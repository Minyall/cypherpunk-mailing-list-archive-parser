The same thing occurs in my hometown of 10,000 people. When the
local cops get caught performing criminal actions, the city buys
their way out of a lawsuit, with a non-disclosure agreement being
signed, and the illegal activity continues, as before.
No one knows? Bullshit. Even the local barhounds know. Don't tell
me the judges and prosecuters are clueless.

There are criminals with guns and badges, and criminals without
guns and badges.
I am in favor of the government exercising their power to enforce
the death penalty. I am equally in favor of the individual citizen
doing the same.
