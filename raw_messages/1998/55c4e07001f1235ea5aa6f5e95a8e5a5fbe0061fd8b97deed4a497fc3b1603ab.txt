Right.  Considering the scum that have drifted on here from AOL, I'd say
there's a distinct pattern.  As an EX-AOL user I can attest to the fact that
AOL is prime grade USRDA shit.  At the time I got nothing but busy signals and
crashes, when I logged back in, I was told I was already logged on and had to
call the customer unsupport people to get credit for my hours used by a ghost
connection.  Further, in the last few weeks I had my account, I received
hundreds of spams, the "You've Got Mail" soundbite caused me to twitch every
time I heard it.

Paying $20/month for shit service with a shit browser and shit connectivity
isn't my idea of a good ISP.  A few weeks after, I found a local ISP that gave
me a shell account for $10/month and I got no busy signals and no bullshit
software and no craploads of downloads of images ("artwork") or fifty ads
popping in my face upon connecting.

So yeah, maybe there are "smart" people on AOL, but they're clueless when it
comes to ISP since they're using the worst of the worst.

I don't speak for that "nobody" but I will speak for myself and will speak from
PERSONAL experience.  Aol is shit.  Anyone who is stupid enough to put up with
shit service is either masochistic or isn't aware they're getting shit service,
no matter how intelligent they may otherwise be.  besides, from the cluless
fuckwads that have indeed drifted here, I'd sooner hug the hotmail users, even
the single celled one who spews about Misty than see an AOL luser's email
address in a post!

If you're so smart, find a local ISP who will give you better service and costs
less.  Shit, if you insist on paying $20/month and $5 hour, tell you what,
switch to a cheaper ISP and send me the extra $5/hour you are now wasting, I
sure could use the money!

Just my $0.02 worth of flames.
