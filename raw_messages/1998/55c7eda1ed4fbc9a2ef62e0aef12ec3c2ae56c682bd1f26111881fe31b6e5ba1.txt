BUT, even the fastest electronics cannot respond fast enough to the initial
spike, if that spike is too high in the first place (if your incoming power
lines get hit by lightning, for instance), it's already too late.  My
suggestion, don't trust a UPS to eliminate spikes, get it if you anticipate a
need for back-up power to shut down your system in case of black-out (and
screw the surge protectors, trust the filtering in your power supply to do
that for you.)
