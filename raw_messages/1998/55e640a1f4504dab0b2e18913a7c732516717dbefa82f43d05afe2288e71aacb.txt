My bad _what_? The fragment "My bad" is nonsense.

Nonsense. Many of us use our "real names" on the Internet, right here on
this non-business list. In fact, real names outnumber nyms by probably
10-1. Ditto for most of the Usenet and most mailing lists. Chat rooms may
be a different story...I wouldn't know about them.

No, BBBs (not "BBS's") did _not_ come first. I had an ARPANet account in
1973 or so, long before any meaningful BBSs were available. (And the
ARPANet goes back to 1967-8 or so.)

Nitwit.
