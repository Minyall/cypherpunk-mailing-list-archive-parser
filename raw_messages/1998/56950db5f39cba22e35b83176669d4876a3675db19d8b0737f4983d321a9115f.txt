Turn on the television. All of the networks and news stations are mirroring
it. The ones I've tried, cnn.com, foxnews.com, etc., are also swamped.
However, the talking heads--no pun intended--are all reading the sordid
details about Clinton's cigar being inserted into Monica's vagina, about
how Clinton talked with Congressional leaders while Monica was giving him a
blowjob, and how Clinton suborned perjury and tampered with evidence....

"The guy is going down...in more ways than one."

BTW, I had heard Matt Drudge on the cigar issue before Declan visited a few
weeks ago. I was able to "break" this story to Declan, no mean feat.
