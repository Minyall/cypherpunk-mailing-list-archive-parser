I think setting up mirror sites of crypto archives 
across the world is a great idea.  However, I also 
think we need to focus on getting more and more 
people to use crypto.  I would guess that the vast 
majority of computer users worldwide see no use 
for encryption in their day-to-day lives -- and 
even those that do don't also use it.

If everybody in the world is using encryption, it 
is going to be extremely difficult for "democratic" 
governments to tell them they can't use it any more.

Unfortunately, it's easy for governments to blame 
crypto for terrorism and a host of other crimes, 
simply because the average citizen doesn't understand 
the concept of an "electronic envelope".
