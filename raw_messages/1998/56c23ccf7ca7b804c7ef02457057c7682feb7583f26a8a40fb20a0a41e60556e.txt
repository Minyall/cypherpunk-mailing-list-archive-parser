what they are talking about is *every* VCR, TapeRecorded, ...ect will not
record data that has this security feature without a proper record code.
(keep hold of the old VCR's and Tape Players). Even though the data is
decrypted to be viewed you will still have a stego data channel that will
tell these recording devices to to record.

Will this prevent the professional bootleger from making copies? No. The
finanical incentives for working around these security measures are there
(bootleging is a multi-billion dollor business). What this will do is
prevent you from recording songs off a CD to play on a tape in your car or
prevent you from recording that movie you just watched on PPV.

>   Escpecially regarding computers, this won't work.

Well I have gone over this in previous posts that right's management
woun't work against the bootlegers as at some time you have to display the
raw data to the user. what it will to is make things that much harder for
the average user.
