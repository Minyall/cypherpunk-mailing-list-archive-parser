Lordgrey asks for a BXA URL:

BXA info on the new crypto policy:

   http://www.bxa.doc.gov/whatsnew.htm

   http://207.96.11.93/Encryption/Default.htm

The only info there not issued by the White House is a list
of the 45 countries who get favorable treatment.

CDT says the implementation regs are due to be issued by
BXA sometime in October, and to watch out: "the devil is in 
the details."

In the meantime the 11 corporations who announced support
for the new policy will continue hemming, hawing and heeding
threat of license delay:

Here they are:

Ascend, Cisco Systems, 3Com, Hewlett-Packard Company, 
Intel, Netscape Communications, Network Associates, Novell, 
RedCreek Communications, Secure Computing, Sun 
Microsystems.

One bit of sunshine, though, is Germany has announced that it
will lead a Euro attack on US crypto export limits because they
harm economic security:
