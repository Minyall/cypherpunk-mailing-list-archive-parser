Nope, not coined from the movie.

Just the reverse.

Highway cops were called "smokies" (or "smokeys") when I was growing up in
Virginia in the 60s, long before the movie.

I haven't checked the derivation, but had always assumed it came from the
Smokey the Bear figure, who wore a tall, broad-brimmed hat (also known as a
campaign hat). The hat worn by many state highway patrols. Ergo, "smokeys."

(I used to see the _real_ Smokey the Bear at the Washington Zoo. I think he
died of old age in the 1970s.)
