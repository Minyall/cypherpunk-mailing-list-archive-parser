That's a rationale for doing TEMPEST scanning I hadn't thought of. Since it
is time consuming and takes special training (which means higher personel
budgets that don't amortise over time like hardware) to operate a floppy
scanner and interpet the results there are budget forces involved.

A box with a flat top and a funny looking cage on top that a agent could 
use thusly:

"Sir would you please place your laptop on the tray and turn it on?..."

It becomes possible to scan for sureptitous clock devices (their tick, tick,
tick in the EM), mod'ed hardware, and software.

Follow this with a gas spectrograph and a x-ray and you'd have the vast
majority of bases covered.

Since most countries require production equivalent models to undergo testing
(eg FCC EM emissions) it wouldn't be that much of a budget increase on that
end either.
