I'm sorry but I must be missing something here ...

Why not just use products that have strong crypto without GAK? What is the
point of using this weak junk when one does not have to??

- -- 

http://www.pgpi.com   -- Strong secure e-mail encryption
http://www.opera.com  -- Opera web browser with strong crypto & no back doors
http://www.apache.org -- Most popular Http server on the Internet
http://www.ssleay.org -- Free strong SSL library that can be used with the Apache server.


Then we have the usauly suspects:

http://www.jya.com/nscp-foia.htm -- Netscape's GAK plans.
http://www.kra.org               -- KRAP gang.
