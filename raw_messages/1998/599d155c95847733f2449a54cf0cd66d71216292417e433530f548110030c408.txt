The governor of Arkans(redneck)as(sholes) has stepped forward to
lay responsibility for the latest school massacre tragedy squarely
on the shoulders of those elements of the entertainment media who
have not thus far been implicated in the political shennanigans and
illegal drug deals perpretrated by the former governor of Arkansas,
who is currenly dipping his dick in those entering the Whitehouse
through the 'Ladies Only' entrance.

  It seems that responibility for the massacre lies in the current
social acceptance of the licentious violence being spammed upon the
public by the immoral profitmongers of the entertainment industry.
  This is in marked contrast to the current social acceptance of the
licentious violence being spammed upon the public by the moral
profitmongers of the Biblically-based religion industry.

  It is obvious that new laws will have to be passed to protect the
children exposed to the sex and violence contained in the Christian
Bible from being further influenced by corresponding material in the
secular sector of society.
