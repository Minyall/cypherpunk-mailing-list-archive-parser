With the current prices on AK clones being around $400, I expect that
their domestic manufacture will become profitable. In fact, as someone
else has noted, any toy maker would be able to produce all parts of the
AKs, with the possible exception of barrels.

Judging by their construction, there is not a lot of costs and they
should be a lot cheaper than AR-15s (against which I have almost nothing).

So, the question is, it is realistic to expect that AK s will be
manufactured here? Will the control freaks be able to stop it?
