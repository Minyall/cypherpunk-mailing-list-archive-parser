To add to this, the spam blocking technology is widely available and can be
used by anyone with half brain. My spam filters make me spend no more than 
a minute or so a day on quickly reviewing and deleting spams.

I do it by saving all messages that are likely to be spam to a separate
folder. A quick browse through subject lines of these messages is enough
to delete them really quickly.

In the future such spam detection is going to become a lot harder. Perhaps
a system where the first time sender pays a refundable digital fee to
the reader will become necessary.
