You should probably look for native freeware, no?
Otherwise look in various win archives.

I have not yet done systematic experiments looking at, e.g., entropy in
less-than
full-amplitude noise, or intentionally filtering out various pieces
of spectrum.  The tables in RFC 1750 show that 8 bits is reasonable.

Interestingly, the parity of a $10 10year old Radio shack monophonic
FM radio, UNSHIELDED, in a digitally-noisy environment, sampled 
at 44Khz and 16 bits, passed Diehard.  

NB: Consumer computainment devices will include FM/TV receivers very shortly.
Less of a rat's nest in back of the machine.

I always thought listening to static was a suspicious activity.

A CDROM burner is $350.  "Entropy.  Its not just for ambassadors anymore."
