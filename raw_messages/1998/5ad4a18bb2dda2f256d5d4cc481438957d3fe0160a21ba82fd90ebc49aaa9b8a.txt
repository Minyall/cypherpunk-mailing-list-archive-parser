Hi folk!

Anybody knows how to use Buttsniffer?
I can listen to ethernet frames in our network, but after a few minutes
I`ve got a huge File with over 50MB...
I read that there is an option to listen only to POP3 password and
so funny things...

At the moment I listen the network with the options :
buttsniff -d 0002 pws.txt e

Please mail me directly!!!

ThanX (and Sorry for my fucKKK English!!!)
