Actually, I think much too much is being made of utterly _tiny_ percentage
moves in the stock market. The "Big Crash" a couple of weeks ago was the
"second largest point loss in the the history of the Dow Jones Industrial
Average."

Ah, but it was only #58 in terms of percentage.

And so on. The "rocking back and forth" is well within historical
standards. In fact, it's much less than we've seen at other times in the
past 25 years.
