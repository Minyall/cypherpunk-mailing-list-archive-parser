To amplify the earlier NY Times report on the July 17
passage of the Krug amendment to the WIPO copyright act, 
which once banned encryption analysis, Reuters today says:

  The committee also approved an amendment allowing 
  cryptography researchers to crack anti-piracy safeguards 
  as part of their work. And an amendment was added 
  allowing Internet users to disable such measures to 
  prevent the collection of personal information.
