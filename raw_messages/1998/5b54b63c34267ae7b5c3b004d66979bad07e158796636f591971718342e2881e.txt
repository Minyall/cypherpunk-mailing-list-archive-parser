This reminds me of the self-righteous political leaders of India 
who enforced 47% reservations for Schedule Cast/Tribe groups 
in all government subsidized institutions couple of years back. 
And, it all starts with the same fallacious interpretation of 
"equal opportunity".  

Whatever your political philosophy might be you won't like
to see a doctor who is likely to kill you with an overdose of 
codeine. Or would you? 

Best,
