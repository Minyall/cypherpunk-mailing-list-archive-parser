I guess those high school students aren't the only ones with no clear
idea of the way the world works.  While salt water does not ordinarily
explode, in this case salt water is the ultimate product -- but massive
heat released when acids and bases join and recombine to produce salts
(in this case table salt) and water.

while some do feel (especially on this list) that the ends justify the
means -- this is one means that definitely does not go along with that
"rule".

PHM.
