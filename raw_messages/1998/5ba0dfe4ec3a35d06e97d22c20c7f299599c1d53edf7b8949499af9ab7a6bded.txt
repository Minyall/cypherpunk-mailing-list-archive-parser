Guys

I just read a printed copy I made of 

 Crypto AG: The NSA's Trojan Whore?

 http://caq.com/CAQ/caq63/caq63madsen.html

starting at http://www.aci.net/kalliste/

fairly carefully.

I seized upon Madsen's statements,

1 the random encryption key could be automatically and 
  clandestinely transmitted with the enciphered message.

2 they may also have been tipped off by Stasi files of the 
  ex-East German regime that found their way to Iran

Try MfS agents who went to work for Iran after the Cold War.

Then there was the postcard from Tel Aviv I received at 
Sandia labs which followed-up a yellow piece of paper sent
by snail mail asking numbered detailed question about work 
I was doing at Sandia.

I responded back to the postcard, by postcard of course, 

               "Know any sayanim?"

No response. 

It doesn't take at rocket scientist to figure that one out.

Let's all hope for settlement of this unfortunate matter so that
we can all move on to more constructive projects.

Best
bill
