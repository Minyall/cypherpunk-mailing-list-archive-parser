In addition to the converstaion, MS says:
Microsoft has opted not to include certain components of Windows NT in the
evaluation process, not because they would not pass the evaluation, but to
save time by reducing the load on the NSA. Additionally, the
MS-DOS/Windows on Windows (WOW) system may be treated as a Win32
application and would therefore not need to be evaluated as part of the
Trusted Computer Base (TCB). Networking on NT may not have to go
through the "Red Book," or "Trusted Network Interpretation." It may be
enough to consider networking to be another subsystem, and therefore only
the Orange Book would apply. New or modified components and other hardware
platforms can go through a "RAMP" process to be included in the evaluation
at a later time.
