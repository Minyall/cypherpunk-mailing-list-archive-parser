All browsers have the 128 bits encryption inthem, but in the
non-US version it can only enabled by a 'special cert'. Banks
are the only institutions that are currently allowed to recieve
such an cert.

This is also why fortify.net works as it does, anyways,
we also offer 128 bit versions of the popular browsers *g*
