Given that the cheapo radio was 10 cm from a 21" monitor, I don't think
you need to invoke noise-driven resonances in the humble radio.

I was/am interested in robust methods that don't depend on 
exquisite analog equalization, etc.  

Zero crossings are analogs (pun intended) of 
RFC1750's #2 method (via Shannon):

map 01 -> 1 
map 10 -> 0
00, 11 are no-ops.  

Note that for a digital signal you are detecting level-changes.  (Vdd/2
changes?)


Waiting for zero crossing will give you perfect 0:1 ratio,
but you may have to wait arbitrarily long (but will almost
certainly not, in the formal sense ---there's a decaying exponential
in there).
