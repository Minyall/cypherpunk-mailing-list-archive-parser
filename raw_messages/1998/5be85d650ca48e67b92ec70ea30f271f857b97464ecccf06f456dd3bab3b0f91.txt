    This is a really difficult issue.

And how.  

How does this interact with phones whose
access (telephone) number is non-unique?
Could where I am calling from be divorced
from what instrument I am using to call?
Is there a parallel between smearing the
signal over a spectrum of radio frequencies
and smearing the identifying information
over a spectrum of numbers? Could calls
to 911 carry no phone number but just
"here I am" information -- a panic button
function, in other words?

I imagine I sound like someone calling in
to an ASK THE EXPERTS radio show...
