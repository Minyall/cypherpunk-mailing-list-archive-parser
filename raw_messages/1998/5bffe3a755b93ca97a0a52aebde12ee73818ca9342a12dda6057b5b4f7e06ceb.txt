Hello Mac User,
	Our records indicate that you 
downloaded a 
free 30-day trial of GoLive CyberStudio 2 from 
our web 
site. Your 30-day trial evaluation period has 
expired. 
Purchasing the full copy of the software now will 
allow you

sites.  I can also include the new "CyberStudio 2" 
book 
by Peach Pit Press (an $18.95 value) for free.  I'll 
need for 
you to contact me within 30 days so that I may 
facilitate

	Since your download, we are proud to 
announce that GLCS2 won the prestigious Eddy 
Award 
for Best Web Development Software at 
MacWorld this
