It occurs to me that an interesting use for the eff des cracker would
be the following: since the government asserts that DES is safe, then
a DES encrypted archive of crypto code should be exportable.  So the
next time someone feels the need to export something that is currently
not exportable, simply encrypt it, along with some plaintext, with
DES, trash the key, export it, and send the plaintext and the
encrypted plaintext to the EFF...

This is not a practical use, but it would make an interesting test 
case in court.
