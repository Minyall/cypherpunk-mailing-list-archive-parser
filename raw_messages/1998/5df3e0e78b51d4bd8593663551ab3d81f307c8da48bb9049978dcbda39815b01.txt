While I agree that TV is a brain-sucking void, banning any
form of dissemination of information is a Bad Thing and
a sign of serious government oppression.


First the came for the TV sets, and I didn't say anything because
TV is merely bread and circuses for the masses.

Then they came for my radio, and I didn't complain because
I can't get Rush very good anyhow.

Then they came for the newspaper, and that really pissed me off, so
I wanted to protest.  I wanted my protest to get a lot of exposure, so
I went to call the TV and radio stations but they don't exist any more.

I'd rather be dealing with Hillary than the Talliban.
