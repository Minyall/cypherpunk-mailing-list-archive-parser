Hey, guys,

Someone here already said it, but nobody else got it, so I'll repeat it:
SSB, or Single Sideband. It's commercial ham radio, if you will, and all
the ships use it. I expect that you can shove anything down an SSB set that
you want, including encrypted traffic.

Ham radio is a government nerd subsidy, and as such, doesn't do much but
make more government funded/sactioned/approved/whatever nerds. :-).

SSB would do just fine. It's an international standard, after all, and
probably not under the control of any one government, even.e

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
