  this can work two ways... especially if the people you're trying
to work are not paying attention

  a friend of mine recently had his state license renewed.  i think
they have the procedure for doing fingerprints down pretty much so they
are inescapable if you want a new D/L, buuut...

  one of the things they make you sign at the bottom of the form is
an agreement that starts out "I agree to...".  my friend ran the form
through a scanner, changed "agree" to "disagree" and printed out his
own version of the form.  he handed it in and naturally the pencil-
pushers never gave it a second glance
