The NYT has a fairly good OpEd on encryption today,
written by a novelist, who makes a good case for 
the citizen's need for the privacy protection, now that
there are a zillion ways computers pry into private
affairs.

For those outside the US: NYT today began its free 
worldwide online service, so the whole world can log 
on to its prying computers. (Non-USes heretofore 
had to pay for privacy loss.) It claims to have 4 million 
daily online consumers and is happy to run an advertiser 
drivern operation to suck in millions more around the 
planet.

Take note, Slate.
