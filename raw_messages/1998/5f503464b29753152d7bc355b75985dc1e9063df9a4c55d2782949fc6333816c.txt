They're _all_ animated blinking things.  Ugly.
Some of them have good content, but there need to be
static non-animated regular GIFs.
Aside from the aesthetic issues, there are probably still browsers
that don't support them, and certainly anything printed on
dead trees or other static media won't display the animation.
