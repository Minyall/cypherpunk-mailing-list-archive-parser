A more interesting question is whether anonymous remailers will need to
register.  I suspect that there will be a challenge to this law that will
lead judges to define what an ISP is.  That definition will problably be
something like:

	Any service that allows users to connect to, send, or receive
information to/from other sites or any site acting as a conduit for users
to communicate with others.

Already, companies like Newscene and Newsguy (usenet only services) believe
that they will need to register, though they aren't technically ISPs, as
most people would think of them.

Is an anymous remailer needs to register, what will the implications be?
