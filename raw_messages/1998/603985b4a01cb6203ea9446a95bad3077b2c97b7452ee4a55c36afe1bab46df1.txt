Ever played Mornington Crescent?  Try the same thing with e-mail.  The idea
is that only those in the game know "the rules".  These rules can change at
any time in any way and all "real players" can tell about the new "rules"
and adjust accordingly.

The idea would be to exchange nothing while make it appear to be exchanging
information of real importance.  OK so this will be just like any managment
memo but you must get my drift.

Hack together a proggy to "encrypt" a message but really just generates
garbage, just like politicians.  Leave patterns in it so it looks real.
