That's inaccurate. The Mafia pre-dated the US by several hundred years if
not more (depends on how one wants to choose the bloodline). Most
definitely they predated the bans on alcohol.

As to the coke market, In S. America it has been around for quite a while as
well. The chemical has been used medicinaly for hundreds of years until just
recently.
