Hi Twisted Tunes fans!

Just a short note to let you know there are brand new Twisted Tunes in the
Jukebox at http://www.twistedtunes.com  We are stepping up our production
schedule for '99, so we'll let you know as new songs are added.

If you want to give someone that TWISTED CHRISTMAS gift, our online store
is
stocked with all titles and we ship daily. Go to
http://www.twistedtunes.com/order to pick up a cool stocking stuffer.

As always, thanks for your support...

Bob Rivers

PS. This is really me. I wrote this e-mail. Not a form letter. Honest.
What
do I got to do to prove it to you?
