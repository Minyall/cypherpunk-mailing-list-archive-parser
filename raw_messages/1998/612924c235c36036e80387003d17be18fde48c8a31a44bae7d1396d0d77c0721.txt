   Some time ago I heard about Lucky Green's then-immature scheme for 
anonymous email boxes, whereby a user can receive email and even a 
traffic analysis attacker is unable to glean information about who 
received what when.  I forget exactly what ve called vis method...




   Is there a paper available anyplace?

   Has the scheme been validated mathematically?

   Has it been implemented?
