>From Jim Choate:

: Now in a free-market, by definition, there is no law. What then is the

: profit? If this includes lying, denying consumers information, etc. what
: harm is done, they have fulfilled their responsibility to their shareholders
: (potentialy quite lucratively) and broken no law. Within this environment it

: *all* competition. And since there is no law other than the measure of profit
: all can be justified.

There might be no Law.   But there would still be Reality  -  and for some people, this is *much*
harder to deal with.

If customers sit around like lumps on a log depending upon the kindness of strangers, well they're
not doing themselves any favors.  But such a person is not a customer.  They are an invalid (or will
be, eventually).

In a free-market economy, everybody - not only corporations, not only customers - have to be
rational about what they're doing.   Everybody has to "be on their toes", alert to what truly is in
their interest, and prevent themselves from accepting, from supporting, self-defeating offers from
Trojans bearing spam.   You learn or you die, just like in the movies.
