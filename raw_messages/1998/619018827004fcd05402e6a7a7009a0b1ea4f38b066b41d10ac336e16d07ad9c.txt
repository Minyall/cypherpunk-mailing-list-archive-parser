It just goes to show Ross Perot was half right ;)  It wasn't coming from
Mexico because of NAFTA; it was coming (heheh he said coming, Beavis!) from
Clinton's bimbos in action!  Maybe he could sell the videotapes, and apply
the proceeds to reducing the deficit...X-rated stuff is a growth industry
lately.

Hmmm...Boinker And The Tree-Man...sounds like one of those sucky late-'60s
folk rock groups...or else a really bad Saturday morning catroon...ummm
cartoon.  It's late and my rationality module keeps throwing this really
odd GPF...
