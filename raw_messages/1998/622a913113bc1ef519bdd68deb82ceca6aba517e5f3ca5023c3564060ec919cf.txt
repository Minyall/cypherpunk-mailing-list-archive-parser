Virginia's governor, James Gilmore III, has appointed a commission on
internet technology to recommend policies on guiding internet business
and protecting internet users. Guidelines are touted by state officials
as being the first in the nation to *protect* residents. Ratification of
the recommendations is scheduled to take place at the College of William
and Mary on wednesday, Dec. 2, 1998.
