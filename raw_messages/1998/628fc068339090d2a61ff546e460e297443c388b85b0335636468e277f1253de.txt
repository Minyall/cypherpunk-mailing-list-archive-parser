Would any of the members of the NAS CRISIS panel know 
if keystroke surveillance one of the technologies proposed
for the FBI as an alternative to GAK? 

Could this technology to be covertly placed in all keyboards 
for activation say, by remote control, or via a program/device 
on the Internet?

Recall the various proposals for putting hardware encryption 
in keyboards, with the possibility of covert GAK.
