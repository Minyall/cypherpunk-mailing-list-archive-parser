Radio waves scatter...they don't just travel in pure line of sight. And
even if they travelled only in line of sight, the reflections from inside
the box and then into the room and then off surfaces....

Microwave ovens work by having the waves bounce around inside a box. Any
significant hole or crack (up to roughly half the wavelength) would let the
waves out.

An open top box will not work.

Unlikely to prevent someone from figuring out what the real signal is. It's
very difficult, generally, to hide a signal with another signal. Noise
won't work, because noise can be filtered or autocorrelated out. A "spoof"
signal can be corrected for.

And we are talking about 100 dB sorts of suppression. Mere factors of a few
with fake signals and noise are meaningless on this scale.
