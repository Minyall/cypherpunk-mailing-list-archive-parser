Good point!  Ever wonder why a decreasing commodity non-
renewable resource is becoming cheaper as the known reserves 
become smaller?  

Maybe they want to sell it all before it becomes obsolete and 
maximize their income from that resource.

Within the oil business I have heard this mentioned in regards to 
natural gas.
