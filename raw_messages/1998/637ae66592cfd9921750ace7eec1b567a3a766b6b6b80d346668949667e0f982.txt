I remember someone wrote of the case where the attacker got the
file with the millions of passwords. Then if he also knows the
'mathematical magic' he could presumably do offline work. So I
suppose that the 'mathematical magic' has to be kept secret, which 
would work against the generally accepted crypto principles.
