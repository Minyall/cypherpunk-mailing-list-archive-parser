Libertarians:

Whatever the extent of Y2K related problems that actually develops, there is one
thing for certain: The private sector will be up and running smoothly before much
of the government sector.  Y2K will be a fantastic opportunity to promote and
achieve privatization. So let's start planning for taking advantage of that
opportunity and stop arguing about how bad it will or will not be.

Somebody want to start the "Y2K Privatization Coalition"??
