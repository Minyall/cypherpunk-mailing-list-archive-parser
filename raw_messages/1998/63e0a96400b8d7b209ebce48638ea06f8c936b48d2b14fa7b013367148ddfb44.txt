The heathen custom of percolating coffee leads to mental degeneracy
and sexual perversion.  When the water passing through the grinds is
not boiling, many essential chemicals remain in the grinds.  The
only civilized way to make coffee is to boil the grinds in the water
for a few minutes.  Try it, you'll discover that it tastes completely
differently from the percolated swill.
