*** Swedish police weed out hackers

2 young Swedish hackers who turned a Swedish county's home page into
an advertisement for pornography and marijuana and broke into the
U.S. space agency's computer system have been tracked down, local
media reported. After a yearlong hunt, police in Umea in northern
Sweden finally traced the 2 youths, aged 18 and 15, and seized their
computers, the newspaper Vasterbottens Folkblad said Wednesday.
Police were quoted as saying no charges would be laid because no
economic crime had been committed. See
