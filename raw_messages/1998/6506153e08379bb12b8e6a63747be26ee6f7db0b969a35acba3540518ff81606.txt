I looked at the orange book at NOT the Orange Book -
http://www.jya.com/ntob.htm

NSA employee Tom White http://jya.com/nsasuit.txt got me a copy of I was
told was
THE NSA orange book for Sandia's implementation of the NSA Benincasa 
nss/uso authentication algorithm..

The report I saw was concerned about implementation of cryptographic
units.

Things like shielding, power filtering, red-black boundaries, shift
register 
compromising signals, some software guidelines,....  The soft-cover
report was mostly 
hardware-oriented.

What I see at jya.com is not the orange book Sandia was given.
