The originating IP for this hotmail posting is lpwa.com, the Lucent
Personalized Web Assistant.  Ken Williams had posted a URL last week
which described how to send anonymous mail using lpwa as a proxy to
the hotmail service:

This is easy to do and provides moderate levels of anonymity.  You set
lpwa.com as your proxy in the browser settings, and then set up your
hotmail account and send the mail.  Maybe Jim Finder was just testing
the idea.

Blaze has attracted one or two cranks who try to harrass him, and this
may be another attempt to make some trouble for him.
