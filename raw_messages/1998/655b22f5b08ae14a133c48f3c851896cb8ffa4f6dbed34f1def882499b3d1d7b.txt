What Fun! Just today, I got a summons for jury duty...

Is there a "do not summon" list? Synchronistic minds want to know.

Frankly, I wonder if most people who vote aren't just moving all the time.
I've lived in the same place 11 years, and my Jury summons comes every
three years, just like clockwork.

Cheers,
