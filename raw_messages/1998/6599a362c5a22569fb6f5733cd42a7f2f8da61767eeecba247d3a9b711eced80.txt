I think that the gunpowder taggants are not as bad as it seems at first
sight. EVen if all gunpowders are sold with taggants, and if there is
enough people wishing to defeat them, they can simply organize gunpowder
mixing parties at gun shows. After several such parties, the taggants
might become completely useless.
