Someone on the OpenPGP list was asking for an asignment for an algorithm
id in the OpenPGP RFC for Misty1 (from Japan whoda thought <g>). I made my
post about snake-oil and got chastised by hal@pgp.com as he seems to think
it's a respectable algorithm:

I wonder if something isn't getting lost in the translation. He most
definatly has not mastered the English language. I remember when I first
was learning Hebrew and the number of faux pas I made. :)
