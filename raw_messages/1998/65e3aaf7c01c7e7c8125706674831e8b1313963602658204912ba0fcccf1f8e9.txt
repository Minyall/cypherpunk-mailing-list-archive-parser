Summary:  Digimarc and Live Picture, Inc., team up to offer watermarking
	  services.  

|| ``Until very recently, the creative community was extremely skeptical of 
|| licensing and marketing their work over the Web, which they viewed as an 
|| absolute free-for-all,'' said Doug Dawirs, director of online services at 
|| The Workbook. ``Now these same people and companies are jumping in with 
|| both feet.''

I hope no content creators mistakenly think that this is electronic
content protection (possibly, one can say an aid to detect _unintentional_
illicit use, but not intentional theft), or else there will be a 
free-for-all of a legal kind a little further down the road.

I also wonder about the proposed batch processing option, embedding
the same watermark into multiple images.  I can see a number of
security problems here, especially if Live Picture can not (likely)
keep track of all the images marked by them.
