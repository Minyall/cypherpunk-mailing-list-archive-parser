Had DEC not been bought this is exactly (IMO) what would have happened.

Unless my info is seriously off DEC is already shipping 500MHz Alpha's and
has 1GHz chips in test. DEC historicaly has been way ahead of Intel (say a
year or so which in this business is a lot) and I don't see any reason to
suspect that to stop. A comparison of base technology between Intel and DEC
leads me to believe DEC is ahead a good margin. Intel won because of the
price (DEC has historicaly been very expensive) and support of MS and IBM.
(remember, nobody ever lost their job for buying IBM)

The only question I have is whether MS will continue to produce a HAL for
WinNT 5.0 or whatever they call it. That could put a serious crimp in
Compaq/DEC and would most definitely spawn a new round of lawsuites.

Had you realized that when we break the 1GHz barrier it won't be safe to
operate these machines without the cover on them? It'd be like breaking the
inter-lock on your microwave.
