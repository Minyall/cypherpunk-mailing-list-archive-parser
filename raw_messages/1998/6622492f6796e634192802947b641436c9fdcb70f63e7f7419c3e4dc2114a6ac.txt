Sometime ago there was a post to the list which made more sense than
all of the other finger-pointing posts, combined, which have proclaimed
this-or-that entity to be a tentacle/testicle of one or another of the
list members.
The post was by someone claiming to be the "only" real member of the
cypherpunks list. It told how he had, being a lonely loser whom no one
would communicate with, started the cypherpunks mailing list and posted
to it under several personas, hoping to generate interest and have other
people join the list. It seems that his efforts began to escalate and
take on a life of their own, and he eventually had developed all of the
personas that currently existed on the list, and that no one else had
ever actually joined the list, at all.
