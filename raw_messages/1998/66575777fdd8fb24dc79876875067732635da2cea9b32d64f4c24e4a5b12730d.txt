Where do these private access servers get/send their traffic ultimately?

So we have lots of little groups of remailers that are hidden from public
view by a 'ring' of public remailers (required if we want the general public
to access them)? By what mechanism do I as a 'secret' remailer let others
know about my existance and hence willingness to carry traffic? By what
mechanism is my trustworthyness to be judged for this secret duty?

Doesn't the remailer have to know who to ask to have a reasonable shot at
getting the pieces? Isn't the list of sources going to have to be publicly
accessible? Doesn't this also increase the bandwidth problem? Considering
the scale required to impliment this, where is the monetary pay off for
these secret remailers?

At least one current potential for income is the indipendant key server.
Charge some amount to keep the keys for a year and charge per access by
remailers since they would be commercial enterprises. If the cost were
pennies per access you could even access the casual individual user who
wants to pull a key (though I personaly would like to see this cost be born
by the key server operator).
