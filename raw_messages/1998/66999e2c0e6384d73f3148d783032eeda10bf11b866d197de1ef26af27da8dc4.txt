A note to Cypherpunks:

Today I was sent a missive ostensibly from Mr. Toto.

Following are the particulars:

For health reasons I removed myself from the list several months 
ago; now it appears the errors of my youth have returned to haunt 
me.

I had assumed either the RCMP, CIA, FBI, KGB, ASPCA, or some 
other local authority had plucked Toto from the Web.

Alas, this latest message, SAHMD -- Prologue 8/0, indicates the 
torment continues unless, of course, it is a forgery. But then, 
Mr. T. has been known to forge messages he has signed and send 
them direct with screwed up Anon: headers.

This must stop. Whom should I contact to complain about such 
harrassment?

My head is hurting again for the first time in months.

Alec
