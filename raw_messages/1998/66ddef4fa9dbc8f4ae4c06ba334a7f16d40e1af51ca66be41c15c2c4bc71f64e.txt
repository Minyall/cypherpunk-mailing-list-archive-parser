    point duly noted.  however, TV as a degenerative (self eating 
    watermelon) force is an option --which I took by refusing it
    the privilege of its one eyed stare. never owned one as the
    fraction of worthwhile programming is overwhelmed by mind-fuck.

    by all means. Hillary is an unprincipled, amoral automan who
    expects her comforts.  

    the Talliban/Taleban/or_however_whichever_network_spells_it is
    religious fanaticism; no worse than the Catholic Inquisition I
    would expect, but that's not saying much.

    Hillary can be beaten back into her cage...  Taleban fanaticism
    ends only with their death(s).

    There is no safety this side of the grave.  Never was; never will be.
