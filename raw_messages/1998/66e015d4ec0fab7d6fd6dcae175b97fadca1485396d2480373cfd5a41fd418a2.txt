Well... a Leo Szilard web site ( How do you say it? Say sil'-ahrd.)
has an article where he is interviewed titled

_Leo Szilard, Interview: President Truman Did Not Understand_

http://www.peak.org/~danneng/decision/usnews.html

"After all, Japan was suing for peace."

"Today I would say that the confusion arose from considering the fake 
alternatives of either having to invade Japan or of having to use the
bomb against her cities."


I admit I only followed a link from Home Page of J. Orlin Grabbe 
titled...

_Target Committee Meeting, Los Alamos, May 10-11, 1945_

to get to that particular story. 


Of more particular interest to myself is the shipment of 65% uranium
oxide,
sent from the Belgian Congo, in 1939-40. 1250 tons were sent to 
Staten Island, NY, by Edward Sengier of Union Miniere, to prevent the
Axis powers from obtaining it. p 852.

It is a _good_ book. I enjoyed it.
