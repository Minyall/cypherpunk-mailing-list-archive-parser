SSB modulation hardly counts as encryption. (?!)
CFR 47 <http://www.fcc.gov/oet/info/rules/> says:

97.113 Prohibited transmissions.

(a) No amateur station shall transmit:

  (1) Communications specifically prohibited elsewhere in this part;

  (2) Communications for hire or for material compensation...

  (3) Communications in which the station licensee or control operator
  has a pecuniary interest...

  (4) Music using a phone emission except as specifically provided
  elsewhere in this section; communications intended to facilitate a
  criminal act; messages in codes or ciphers intended to obscure the
  meaning thereof, except as otherwise provided herein; obscene or
  indecent words or language; or false or deceptive messages, signals
  or identification;

  (5) Communications...which could reasonably be furnished
  alternatively through other radio services.

[snip]

97.117 International communications. 

Transmissions to a different country, where permitted, shall be made
in plain language and shall be limited to messages of a technical
nature relating to tests, and, to remarks of a personal character for
which, by reason of their unimportance, recourse to the public
telecommunications service is not justified.
