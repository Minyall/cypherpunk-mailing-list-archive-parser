Hi,

Doesn't the FCC have to test the RF emissions of all laptops as well as
monitors for sale as Class A and Class B in the US? Shouldn't that material
be available? I searched the main site, www.fcc.gov, but didn't find
anything regarding this. I sent a request for instructions on how to obtain
the emissions test results on computer monitors and laptops for commercial
and non-commercial use, foia@fcc.gov.

If anyone actualy knows of the location I would be much obliged if you would
pass it along.
