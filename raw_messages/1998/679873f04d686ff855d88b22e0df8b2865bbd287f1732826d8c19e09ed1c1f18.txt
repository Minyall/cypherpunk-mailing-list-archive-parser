EIR is one of the mouthpieces for the Lyndon Larouche cult.
I ran across them in an airport recently, and was surprised to find
they're now strongly behind Bill Clinton; I'd thought that a few
years ago they were accusing him of being a tool of the
Tri-Lateral Commission, though perhaps it was some other group
of anti-TriLateralists.
