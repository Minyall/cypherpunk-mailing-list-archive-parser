* According to a report in the Washington Post in November, armed
robbers in the large Nigerian trading city of Onitsha are so bold, and
the police so outmanned, that they often notify the victims in advance
that they will be coming to rob them, to encourage the residents to be
away from the house at the time.  A few days after the police
announced a crackdown, one gang of 50 armed robbers cordoned off
a street and looted every apartment building on the block.
