     Check the archives!  (I really enjoyed typing that.)  A few
months ago in a thread initiated by, I believe, Dr. Hun, I suggested
that the best way for the government to break the alleged Microsoft
monopoly would be to stop buying their products.

     Given that free alternatives are available, our tax dollars
shouldn't be wasted on expensive software.  The fact that the free
software is technically superior is icing on the cake.
