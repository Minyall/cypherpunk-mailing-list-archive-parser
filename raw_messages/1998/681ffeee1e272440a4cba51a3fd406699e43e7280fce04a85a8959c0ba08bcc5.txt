Federal Computer Week <www.fcw.com> of April 6
lists an article by Heather Harreld, "An NSA report 
details the risks of encryption technology," which is not
available online. 

So far Ms. Harreld has not responded to a request
for a copy, so if someone has a hardcopy we'd be 
grateful for a fax:
