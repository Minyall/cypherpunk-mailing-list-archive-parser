One other possibility is to encrypt with plaintext block chaining, then
superencrypt it PBC in reverse order, starting with the last block first.
An attacker would thus have to decrypt the entire message before knowing
whether the key was correct or not.

Only if the cryptanalyst knows that the decryption of the last one was
correct, which shouldn't be possible without also decrypting all the other
layers.
