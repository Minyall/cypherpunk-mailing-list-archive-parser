I'm now watching the FBI's news conference about this event. Very few
details, lots of scary stuff about deadly biological viruses....par for the
course.

The FBI guy cites the help of "Dougwood Proving Grounds." Er, I think he
means Dugway, but he's just a flack.

He mentioned that the raids were launched "hours" after an informant gave
them information. Ah, but how in this bureaucratic age did they get the
support from Nellis AFB, the U.S. Army, a team from Quantico, and half a
dozen other police and military agencies?

And the Army's involvement (Army and Air Force personnel) would seem to
violate Posse Comitatus (the law forbidding military involvement in
domestic police enforcement).

Still looks like a canned event to drum up support for Operation Wag the Dog.

(Consider that one of the arrestees was charged two years ago with some
crime related to having precursor chemicals which could be used in making
bubonic plague. He was on probabation, and probably his movements were
being tracked. Perfect for "rounding up the usual suspects.")

So far the seized materials are "unidentified." It'll be real funny, and
tragic, if nothing is found.

(Ah, a reporter just asked, "You've had these suspects under surveillance
for quite some time....")

But I suspect the Feds will _plant_ something incriminating even if nothing
is actually found. Like throwdown guns planted on perps in shootings,
throwdown vials will be used. (Dugway Proving Grounds was involved, and is
just one of many sources of anthrax.)

It's truly indicative of our Orwellian state that the USG is ranting about
"weapons of mass destruction" when the USG maintains massive chemical,
biological, and nuclear stockpiles.

(Or are Fort Detrick and Dugway  and the VX stockpiles near Hanford just
"baby milk factories"? :-) )

Wanna bet they also bring crypto in this media circus?
