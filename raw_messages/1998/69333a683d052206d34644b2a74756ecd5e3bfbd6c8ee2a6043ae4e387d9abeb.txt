	I really think the XOR weaknesses deserve as much publicity 
	as possible, because they are IMHO the simplest to exploit,
	and the result of the dumbest mistakes.

	So far we have three:  40-bit RC4 uses the same key with every 
	session (!!), the client and server seems to encrypt with the same
	key stream going both ways (!!!), and then this resequencing
	attack.

	Are all three of these fixed?  The certainly aren't 
	"theoretical."
