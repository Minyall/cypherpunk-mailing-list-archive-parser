I've been too amused by the proceedings to comment on it.

The more important silence is about the instant sentencing of the
Unabomber compared to Jim Bell's sentencing.  What _is_ happening with
Jim?

I saw that.  There are rumors floating about that they have the goods
on Gore too, his hands are certainly as dirty as Slick Willie's.  I'd
like to see both of those rat bastards disgraced.  After all the
vitriol Klinton & Algore have thrown at the '80s and Republicans
their Karma demands they be succeeded by Newt Gengrich (and live to
see it).
