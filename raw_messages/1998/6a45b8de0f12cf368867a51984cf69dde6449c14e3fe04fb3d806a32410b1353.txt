	I dunno.  I guess the best way to answer those calls in the public
arena is to let people know that crypto is useful stuff that everyone will
need as transactions move online.  The shady argument that crypto &
anonymity can facilitate crime is merely an attempt to associate the two,
to give the public the impression that this crypto stuff is up there with
assault weapons and C4, something which can and should be controlled,
while not really affect law-abiding citizens. 

	I advise crypto proponents to halt any analogy-making to 
firearms, for this reason.  Nothing against guns, of course; but to gain 
acceptance crypto cannot be dropped in the same conceptual bin as guns.
