John!  You can't do that!  That's putting bomb-making information
on the Internet!  It's safe to have it in government hearing documents,
where only technically incompetent Congresscritters will read it,
but by letting the public know, you're facilitating right-wing 
conspiracies and anarchists and terrorists and teenage kids
and all those other dangerous people getting access to weapons
of low-mass destruction!

On a slightly more serious note, I'm surprised from the
excerpts of the description that the $500 of parts would
generate enough joules of electrical energy induced into
sensitive parts of computer equipment in some reasonable range
to do a lot of damage.
				Thanks!
