Sorry, yes I am up-playing, for the sake of humor. No, I'm not a
consultant, Yes I desire to earn money, and the real problem (as I see it)
isn't with the hardware or software, it is with what people will do.
Regardless of anything relevant or irrelevant, what the sheeple think can
happen, what they see happen, what really does happen and how some of them
will over-react to it. 

All the Gov't's making plans for martial law is an enormous alarm going off
in my head,,,,
