A foolish idea, that little "strike." Something out of the lefty sixties.
Grape boycotts and all that nonsense.

Clearly the Wassenaar folks will be so influenced by a few thousands
computer users withdrawing from the Net for one frigging day that they will
rethink their Orwellian plans and will admit their crimes in an orgy of
self-criticism.

Give me a fucking break.

The _only_ motivation was to induce journalists to give the think a few
column inches, if even that. "Hundreds of geeks cut their noses off to
spite their faces...details on page 75."

Exporting PGP within minutes of its release...now _that's_ a meaningful
action! (And one which Cypherpunks continue to be good at.)

Let's leave the "National Solidarity Against Racist Policies" crapola to
the lefties.
