Company policy and federal law are two different things. A company should
be able to set their policy to whatever they want, don't like it don't
work there.

Also please explain exactly what "violent stuff" you are in reference to
and how it is "clear cut".

1st off the whole notion of "hostile environment" is bunk. It is a loosely
undefined term to mean anything the PC crowd wants it to. If you do or say
anything that might "offend" a PCer then you have a "hostile workplace".
As I said in previous posts you do not have a right to not be offended not
only that but thanks to the 1st Amendment I have the right to offend you.

One should be very carefull of this whole notion of protecting people from
being offended. Not only does it erode the rights protected under the
Constitution but it can very easily be turned against those who are
promoting it. Political tides are turning and the country as a whole is
getting fed up with the PC crowd. I can see lawsuits in the not to distant
future against the Pcer for creating a "hostile workplace" by pushing
their PC dogma.
