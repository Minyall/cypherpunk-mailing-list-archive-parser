	What exactly did that log say?

oops.netscape.com - - [15/Feb/1998:13:55:53 +0200] "GET /sekrit/tracilords.gif"

	Doesn't clearly show anything.  Theres IPspoofing.  Theres log
spoofing.  There's being forwarded the message by a buddy (or someone
avoiding the entrapment by forwarding the mail (anonymously) to
cypherpunks, thus getting hundreds of people who are totally
uninvolved to see it.
