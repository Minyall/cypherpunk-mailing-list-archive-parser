Thanks to everyone who responded to me on the AES
archive. Most people pointed me to the counterpane.com
web site, which is very nice and well done, and answers
most of my questions. Unfortunately, though, Counterpane
itself is one of the candidates, so the site may not
exactly be unbiased. Is there any site with a similar scope
being run by a disinterested party?

Thanks again!
