	In the US there is not yet a ban on exchange of information
because of the potential first amendment issues, but there are (and have
been since the late 1980s)  felony level bans with $500,000 fines for
each incident  on the manufacture, assembly, modification, import,
export, sale and distribution of any device or equipment primarily of
assistance in the unauthorized decryption of satellite cable programming
or direct to home satellite.

	And unauthorized interception of radio signals including satellite
video transmissions that are scrambled or encrypted can be prosecuted
under current law as a felony.
