Dear Internet User,

The holiday season will soon be upon us. Will you be making your list and checking it twice online?    We're curious about what role, if any, the Internet will play in your holiday plans this year.  Share your opinions with us and you could win a free Talking Tommy (from hit Rugrats' TV Show) or Talking Teletubby toy (from popular PBS show).

To join in the holiday fun, go to the survey at:

http://www.survey.com/holshopsur.html

Be sure to include your email address at the end of the survey so we can enter your name in the drawing.  It is not required that any information be provided other than your email address for you to be entered into the drawing.  A complete list of contest rules is attached to the survey.

We will be happy to let you know when the results are ready.

Happy Holidays and good luck on the drawing!
