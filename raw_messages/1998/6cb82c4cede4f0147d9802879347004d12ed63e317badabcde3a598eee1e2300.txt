The Senseless Violence Faction of the Army of Dog has awarded 
Hero of the Revolution medals to the two little warriors in
Jonesboro who had the common sense to arm themselves with the
same types of MeatSpace weaponry used by the Dangerous Armed
Thugs who enforce the unconstitutional laws making the common
citizen a state-owned piece of property from the moment they
are stamped with their SSN at birth.

Delivery-room physicians no longer slap the newborn on the
butt with their hand, they now stamp it with a government
issued bar-code branding device.

Persona Abortion is murder, and the ringleaders and soldiers
working in government-funded Persona Abortion clinics are
guilty of WhoreCrimes under the rules and guidelines of the 
Mongeritaville Organized Government Crimes Commission.
Army of Dog martyrs who die of renal bleeding from blowing 
a Ryder rental truck axle out their asshole, while farting in 
the face of their oppressors, go to the CoalDust Saloon in
Bienfait, Saskatchwan, after they 'pass on' (pun intended),
and get to drink scotch and Pilsner beer for Eternity.
