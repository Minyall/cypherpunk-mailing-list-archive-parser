Back in the 60s (well, 70s) we could get stoned smoking just about anything;
didn't matter if it was psychoactive or not, as long as you really 
_wanted_ to believe you'd get stoned  from it. :-)  I mean, if it worked
with banana peels, it'd work with just about anything...

On the other hand, an acquaintance of mine and some of his druggie friends
decided to try smoking caffeine pills to see what would happen.  Once. :-)
You do not want to try this.  He said it hits you with all the bad
caffeine side effects, all at once.

I have heard of people grafting hop vines onto cannabis roots,
which can ostensibly get THC into the hops while looking like an
innocent non-contraband plant.  
				Thanks!
