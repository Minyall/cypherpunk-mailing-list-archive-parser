The FCC has issued a ruling that will require all cellular telephone
carriers to provide location information on all 911 calls. By the year
2001, this location information is to provide 125 metres of accuracy 67%
of the time.

Helping emergency services locate 911 callers is a great excuse for 
installing  a cellular location system. Even better than the excuses they 
gave for eavesdropping-ready digital switches and limits on encryption.
