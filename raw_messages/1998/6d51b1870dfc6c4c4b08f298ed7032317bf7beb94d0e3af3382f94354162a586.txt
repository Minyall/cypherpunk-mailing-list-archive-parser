The Anarchist Cookbook, by William Powell, is a 160 page book, originally 
published in 1971 by Lyle Stuart. It is currently published by
Barricade Books under ISBN 0-9623032-0-8. The "true/original" Anarchist 
Cookbook is generally not available on-line, although there are plenty of 
knock offs. BTW- the Anarchist Cookbook is full of errors and outright 
bullshit, and if you try to make explosives by following its instructions 
you will probably end up known as "lefty."  For example, the book 
explains how to make the drug "bananadine", although there is no such 
drug; the "banandine" rumor was started as a joke at Berkely back in the 
late '60's, and it appears that Powell must have taken it seriously. 
Consider the chemistry to be equally suspect.
