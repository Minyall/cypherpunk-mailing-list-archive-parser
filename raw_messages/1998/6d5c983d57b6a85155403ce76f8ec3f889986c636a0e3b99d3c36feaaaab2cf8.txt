Uhm.. this service used to exist.. I dont know what the email addy
was though :( 

Another solution is to find a school that has a publicly usable lynx
account. Lynx is a text-based browser for Unix, and is fully usable
from a telnet session. Lynx is a nice browser. I use it all the time
on my local machine in an xterm. Yeah, I could fire up netscape ..
but lynx is better. :)

Try telneting to:

sailor.lib.md.us       login: guest
trfn.clpgh.org         login: trfn 
bob.bob.bofh.org       login: supply your email address
public.sunsite.unc.edu login: lynx
lynx.cc.ukans.edu      login: lynx

Be nice to these machines.
