Has anyone hacked WebTV to enable a terminal to connect to a plain vanilla
ISP (or better yet a local ethernet) or is it inexorably tied to their
network of proxy servers? I get the impression that like a Newton or any
other graphically limited device a WebTV browser would have to be aided by
a proxy server that translates the content to more amenable form before it
can take a crack at it. If it were possible to divorce it from their
service it might be a nifty device for less than $100. This would become
especially appealing if 128 bit crypto were thrown into the bargain.
