Carl Ellison talks about his strategy for chaining several ciphers.

I'm surprised more emphasis isn't given to doing this. For example, suppose
one chains 3DES, Blowfish, MISTY, IDEA, and GHOST together (I haven't
checked Schneier on these, but you all presumably get the idea). Then if
any one of these ciphers is shown to be weak, the overall chain remains
strong. The overall chain is as strong as its strongest link, not its
weakest link.

I don't think 3DES is weak, but chaining-in additional ciphers can't hurt.
(Just a minor slowdown in encipherment speed, presumably not important for
some critical uses.)
