 i   got a mail message delivered by the friendly old postal service, from
Toto.  he says he has been elected Santa Calus (aka Santa Loco) of Yucca
South CellBlock, at FCI-Tuscon but 'Santa is in The Hole (TM).'

 he is or at least was sharing a cell with a skinhead called 'reaper.' but
reaper has 'great reading material' - such as GQ magaazine - so it's 'not
as grim as it might seem.'
 
 he says he has come down with a skin condition that is still untreated by
the prison authorities.  his toto-eque notes to the prison staff on
'inmate request' forms don't seem to be helping.

  that's all.
