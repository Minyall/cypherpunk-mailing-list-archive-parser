Toh,
     Thank you for bringing this up for our attention. First of all, let me
assure you that the undocumented access level for the LANplex/Corebuilder
products are purely for support reasons then anything else. We have many
cases where customers will forget their passwords or userids and find
themselves in a spot as they could not get in to the console. This is the
only way we can help them to recover from this situation without losing
their entire configuration. As far as I know, many vendors also have some
kind of special access methods to assist their customer under such
circumstances.These special access methods are for 3 Com support persons
only and are revealed to customers under very special circumstances.
Because the CoreBuilders/LanPlex are typically deployed at the core of a
network, the config for these equipment is typically complex and very
important to the customers. As such, these method can safe the customer a
lot of time and inconvenience by recovering their proper access to the
equipment. If we have to set these equipment to factory default every time
a customer lose his/her password, we will be in a lot of trouble.

As for the stackables, I believe we do not have this access method. That's
because these equipment is plug n play and do not have many parameters to
reconfigure. In the event, a customer loses his/her password, we can just
set everything back to factory default.
