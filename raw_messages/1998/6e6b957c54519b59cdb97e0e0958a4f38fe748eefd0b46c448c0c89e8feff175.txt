We have purchased several Alpha based clone computers in the last 4 months
that are all 533MHz machines.  There is also available a 566MHz, a 600MHz,
and an 800MHz, but for our applications the price is prohibitive.

These are clone machines using a DEC Alpha motherboard and CPU.  Very nice
boxes :-)
