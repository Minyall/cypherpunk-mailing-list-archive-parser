How does one pass laws to regulate something that doesn't exist yet?

Are there any discussions about this dichotomy and how it came to pass?
Something that asks the question of why they chose such widely seperate
approaches? I would personaly guess the British have gotten a little
paranoid they're set for pay-back-time since their empire's been crumbling
for 200 years. I'm much less familiar with Dannish history (post-WWII) and
how they developed this respect for Big Brother and its potential.
