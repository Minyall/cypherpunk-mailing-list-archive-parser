My guess is this:
  if it has the name of a US citizen in the copyright
notice, it will be assumed to have been made in the
US. if the morons even go after you. you still may have
a plausable excuse if ever taken to court.
after all, you "exported" youself, which is a perfectly
legal thing to take out of the country, and "yourself"
accidentally spewed a copy of something that couldn't
cross the border.
I don't think anybody has tried this and been challenged.
then again, a lot of us don't have the opportunity.
It's easier to ask forgivness than permission...
Another easier excuse would be to publish it freely in
hardcopy form, and just "happen" to have somebody end up
"typing" in your source code abroad, making a legit
international copy...
