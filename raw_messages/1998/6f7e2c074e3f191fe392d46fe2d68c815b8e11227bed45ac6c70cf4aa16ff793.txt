Hmm this is a very good point which may explain the limited use of PGP
on this list anyway.

I also wonder whether the low uptake of PGP is more due to it being too
hard to use between different mailers and too hard to use generally for
the nontechnical.

SMIME of course despite bad cypherpunk karma is easy and maybe even 
works between mailers.
