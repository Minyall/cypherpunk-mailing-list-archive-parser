Actualy a standard cassette tape has 4 tracks grouped in pairs. Each pair is
given one of the channel. The audio that comes in is mixed with a bias
signal (using a summing amp) and then laid down on the tape.

Huh? I have been involved in audio recording for over 20 years, acted as
rodies for a host of bands (some of which actualy made records - but alas no
money) and I must admit that the above sentences don't make any sense to me
at all. Can you possible reword them?

What magnets? 'paramter of the recording process'? 'forward-correct error'?
'interpreted in the future'?

If your heads are magnetised you really should de-gauss them. They'll erase
your tapes eventualy...

No, to do that I use a C-band hooked to a alt-az mount and a digital modem.
I'll probably just make a normal Newtonian and hood a CCD camera to it and
feed my Video Toaster to digitize and enhance the images. I am particular
inchanged by the Moon. I can look at it for extended periods. I was
enchanted by it when Men stepped onto it for the first time. I very much
hope that we (as a race) go back to stay...

I talked to BMC Software today. Looks like I'll probably go to work for them
supporting their suite of database products. I should know tomorrow if they
want to do the final interview which means I'll go to work for them on
Monday.

Uh, ok.
