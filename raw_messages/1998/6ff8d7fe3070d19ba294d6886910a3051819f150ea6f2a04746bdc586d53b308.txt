Speaking of SETI, their current intent is to do a distributed
computation spread across thousands of computers, similar to some of the
keycracking efforts.  Details at http://www.bigscience.com ;
the Recent News section says they're currently trying to figure
out about funding.  Meanwhile, there's www.mersenne.org for
factoring big prime numbers.
