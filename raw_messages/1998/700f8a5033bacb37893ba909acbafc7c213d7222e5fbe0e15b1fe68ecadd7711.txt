There's a story in the Dec. 30, 1998 Washington Post about how US intelligence acquires foreign weapons technology. Specific mention is made about trading US Stinger missile know-how to China for whatever. My guess is the government's trying to set the stage to shift blame away from CIA for leaking antiaircraft missile technology, 1000 Stingers in the hands of Afghan rebels notwithstanding, and the aircraft disasters to come.

A Pakastani lecturer on NPR radio today (didn't catch his name) stated that one 'fallout' from the recent cruise missle attack of Ben Ladin's suspected Afgani lairs was a failed cruiser which landed in perfect working order in Pakastan. The Pakastanis consider this one of Allah's best recent gifts and their scientists are busy reverse engineering the bird.
