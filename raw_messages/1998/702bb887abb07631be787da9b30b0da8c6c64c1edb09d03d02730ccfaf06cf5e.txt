Your local church is a member of a larger international collective that does
in fact use coercion in one form or another.

Consider the consequences of abortion for a Catholic (true believer). Tell
that to the various hospices and clinics that have been blown to kingdom
come...

Coercion is a much broader stroke than a simple assault. It can include real
and imagined consequences to alter or limit the behaviour of others.
