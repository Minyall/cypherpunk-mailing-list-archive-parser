Note that although it's clear that this is only for proposing amendments, our
history leaves some doubt that's what would actually happen.  The current
constitution came ouf of a constitutional convention called under the Articles 
of Confederation to discuss amendments, but was finally enacted under
procedures *it* specified, not the procedures specified in the Articles.

Historically, Congress has always specified, at the time it proposes the
amendments.  I believe all but the repeal of prohibition were handled using
the legislature method.
