There are several such companies outside the US that I can think of.

Sure. A LAM would not happen at any of the above companies. But there are
several non-US ISP's and other outfits with triple fiber to the backbone
that could set this up. [You know who I am talking about, lurkers. :-) How
about it]?

That setup would work even better if operated by a major ISP. If you run
10% of a country's (and be it a small country) IP traffic through a LAM,
the computations an attacker has to perform become complex to the point of
being intractable. Especially if the ISP runs dial-up. [Lurkers, your
thoughs please]?

Of course we won't see such sites until somebody writes the
software.

Cypherpunks write code,
