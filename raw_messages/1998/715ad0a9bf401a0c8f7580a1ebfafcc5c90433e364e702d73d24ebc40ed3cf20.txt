False.  You are never required to talk to a peace officer, Fed, or
investigator unless you want to.  They can arrest you of course (with
probable cause ha ha).  Even then, you still don't have to talk to them.
In criminal cases you *never* have to talk to anyone.

The agencies have no criminal adjudicatory power (aside from a few odd
circumstances).  They can seize property of course (if you have it where it
can be seized) but they (mostly) can't lock you up.

Lawyers aren't mandatory.  Colin Ferguson defended himself on nine murder
