The web site is pretty sparse. No wonder I couldn't find them before - I
was looking for "Starion" a while back. I'll call them next week -
they're practically local. What's the approximate price?

I have another question for you:

I thought I was a real whiz kid a few years back when I figured out that
by using an agreed upon startup key then using a "random" public/private
key pair generated by the SW, two voice stations could exchange a
"random" session key. With thumbscrews and the rack you could not get
the session key. Even the dreaded rubber hose would fail. The startup
key protected the PK. The ultimate security was as good as the PK
portion. The conversation was practically pre-shredded.

I was bummed when I discovered this had already been patented and was
called EKE.

Does the Starium phone accomplish this effect?

Mike
