I put this wafer in my junkbuster-configfile and disabled all other cookies,
and NYTimes let me in without asking for a password, but after I read a few
articles, the site started behaving strangely, where the server would seem
to hang on certain pages, taking forever to send the html.

Interesting though.  Maybe we should hold a cypherpunks 'potluck' where
everyone trades cookies.  :)
