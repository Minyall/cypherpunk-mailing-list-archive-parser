There are two informative documents available from GEMPLUS (France)
as part of their development kit for their GPK4000 smartcard.

   1. GPK4000 Application Notes (for public key applications)
	Banking, Personal Identification, Internet Transactions 
   2. Electronic Purse Architecture for MPCOS-EMV
	(for DES and 3-DES applications)

Unfortunately, it the kit costs more than US$4k.

Any chance some kind soul could forward a copy of these documents?
If so, email me directly to make arrangements.
