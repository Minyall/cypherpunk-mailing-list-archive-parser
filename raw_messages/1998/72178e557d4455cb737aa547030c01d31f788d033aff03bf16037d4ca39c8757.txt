This still doesn't explain why you think you need 100 accounts on the
same ISP.  All an account is is a login/password pair.  wtf do you use
100 *different* accounts for?  Email bombing?  Some kinda sick means of
avoiding spam mail from posting on Usenet? *rototflmao*

I suppose that if your ISP has 100 computers on its internal network,
and your login works on each one of them, you could say, technically,
that you have 100 accounts.  Of course, since your ISP is probably
running Solaris, that's a somewhat silly thing to say, as it is likely
that the /etc/passwd (or equivalent) file is NFS mounted over the whole
network, and your home directories are almost certainly NFS mounted from
a constant HD (located somewhere in the depths of the network), from
machine to machine.

Hell, I worked at Sun over the summer.  *I* had an account there, and
could login to any of the several hundred machines we had on our subnet
of SWAN.  Does that mean that I should go around saying "Yeah, I have
like, 500 shell accounts where *I* work, which proves I'm a VSC (Very
Smart Cookie), or at least not an AOLuser" *lol*

Get over it kid, you've either got a single account, which exists on a
bunch of different machines, or your ISP is even more retarded than AOL.
:)
