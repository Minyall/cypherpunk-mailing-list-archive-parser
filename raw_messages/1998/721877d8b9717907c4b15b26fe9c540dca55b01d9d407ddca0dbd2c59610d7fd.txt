	Huh?

	I got my copy of NAI PGP 5.0 off of the shelf at
	CompUSA, a major retail chain (I did pay with plastic,
	but am 99.999...% certain that cash would have been
	accepted). The box *is* marked 'Not for export', but
	I don't recall seeing any other restrictions.

	Either 'anonymous' hasn't looked hard enough, or
	he/she/it's in another country.
