That's the "otherwise" rule right after the four "maps".  If the
2-digit number is divisible by 3 (like the first "36"), divide
it by 3 and count that many letters through the alphabet starting
with A.  The 12th letter (0-origin) is M, so 36 corresponds to M
and L corresponds to 33.

That particular example doesn't use the ciphertext space very efficiently:
only 41% of the available 2-digit numbers are used.  If you must use a
homophonic, I'd suggest a 100-letter pangram, which gives a reasonable
distribution of letters, full coverage of the alphabet, and some chance
of remembering the thing without carry incriminating documents.
