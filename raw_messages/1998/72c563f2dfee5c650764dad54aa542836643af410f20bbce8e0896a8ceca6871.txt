Sorry "nobody", your buddy Pat Robertson is the anti-Christ, therefore, it
ain't Bill.  And if it isn't Pat Robertson, it's your boss Rep. Newt Gingrich
("King(OfThe)Rich").  ;-)

In a message dated 98-03-23 19:11:31 EST, a real "nobody" writes:

<< "He also forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free
 andslave, to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, so
 that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, which is the
 name of the beast or the number of his name. This calls for wisdom. If
 anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it
 is man's number. His number is 666 ."    ....Revelation 13:16-18 >>

Former President Ronald Reagan (other wise known as the 'piss-test President')
bought a house with the address of 666, as I understand.

"You say you're supposed to be nice to the Episcopalians and the Presbyterians
and the Methodists and this, that, and the other thing. Nonsense. I don't have
to be nice to the spirit of the anti-Christ." (Pat Robertson - The 700 Club,
January 14, 1991)
