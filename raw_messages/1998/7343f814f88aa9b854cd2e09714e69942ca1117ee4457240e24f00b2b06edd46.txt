* In August, two cities debated plans to reduce the amount of dog
poop in municipal parks and on sidewalks.  The city of
Christchurch, New Zealand, was contemplating installing a series
of anonymous "poopcams" around town to catch dog owners who
neglect their scooping duty.  And Tel Aviv, Israel, announced that
squads of plainclothes police officers armed with cameras and
night-vision equipment were on duty around the clock
photographing violators of its ordinance.
