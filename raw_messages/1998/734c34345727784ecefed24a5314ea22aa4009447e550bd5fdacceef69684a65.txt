Remember to stay well clear of soft targets as the war with Albania, er,
Iraq starts in the next few weeks.

Yeltsin warns the U.S. publically that an attack on Iraq could have grave
consequences, perhaps even leading to another world war.

He was almost certainly _not_ threatening to use his own nukes against the
U.S.  So what was he talking about?

Maybe he and his intelligence services have a clearer idea of where some of
those 50 to 70 missing suitcase nukes have ended up. Saddam still had a lot
of money even after the Gulf War.

Mightn't he have bought some of those surplus nukes?

Plenty of time over the past couple of years to get them into major U.S.
cities. Especially cities like Washington and New York.

If Iraq's cities and palaces and such are bombed, as expected, he may put
out the order to hit the enemy where it will hurt. A timer set for an hour
and the agents are well away from the blast.

Biological agents are, I think, less likely to do widespread damage. In a
few years, perhaps, when the technology is more widely available, but for
now it looks like U.S.-class bioweapons are not yet available to so-called
terrorists.

Of course, after such an attack, though hundreds of thousands of criminals
may be disposed of in Washington, martial law and a suspension of the
Constitution can be expected. So it won't be all good news. And financial
chaos may reign if business centers are hit.

Downtown Washington is the last place I'd want to be. For multiple reasons.
