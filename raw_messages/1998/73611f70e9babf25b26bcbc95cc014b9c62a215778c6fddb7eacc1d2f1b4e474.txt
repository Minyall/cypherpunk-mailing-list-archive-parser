Another point to consider is that a company sponsoring a contest,
particularly one which involves one of its products, has a great
interest in measuring the state of existing relevant art, and almost
no interest at all in directly funding new research leading to the
destruction of its cipher.
 
Most such contests have very carefully structured rules, and prizes
that are not too large, to sample what current tools and algorithms
can do, without single-handedly funding expeditions into unexplored
territory.
 
Factoring contests are a good example of this, where you get a few
thousand dollars for breaking something slightly larger than the last
thing broken, rather than $10 million for inventing the singing and
dancing factoring algorithm of the future, and breaking the 500
decimal digit key.

Exactly.  Contests do nothing in the absence of prior academic
interest in the problem, and even then only serve to spotlight and
highlight what already exists.  Contests do not drive research, nor do
they prove ciphers secure.
 
Still, they're fun.
