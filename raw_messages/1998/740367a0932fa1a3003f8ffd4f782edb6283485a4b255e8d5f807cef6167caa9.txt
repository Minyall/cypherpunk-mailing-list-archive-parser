While I was explaining the GSP8191's features to an engineer a few weeks
back he ask whether anyone had thought of how to do secure conferencing via
analog technology. I've never seen such a device. I wonder if such a thing
is practical given the limitations of modem protocols. Certainly one could
use a specialized digital device to join the clear analog channels, but
then you have to all trust this device and that's not been compromised
(anothre MITM).
