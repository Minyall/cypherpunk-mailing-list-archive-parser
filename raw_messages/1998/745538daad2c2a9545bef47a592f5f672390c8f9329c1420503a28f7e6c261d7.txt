Yes, the one I use is PGPacket by Mark Shoulson <shoulson@cs.columbia.edu>.

It used to be available at:

	ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/crypto/pgp/utils/

It's written in perl (look for pgpacket.pl)

If the version there isn't greater than 3.0 email Mark and ask for the
latest version.  Version 3 and above can read all the pgp5 packets
also.  Really useful tool for PGP key tinkering.
