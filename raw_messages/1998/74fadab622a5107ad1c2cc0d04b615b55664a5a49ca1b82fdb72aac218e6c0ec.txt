I just went to the bank I do business with this week to open a new account.
They wanted my social security number, (which they actually already have on
record), and during a search on her handy database, the Customer Assistance
clerk informed me that there was another person in Florida using the same
number.

I don't presently have a credit card, so I'm not worried about losing any cash
at this time.    The clerk gave me a form to send to ChexSystems for a consumer
report and advice to notify the Social Security dept about it.   I don't really
want to discuss it with them.  Think it would be to my benefit to just leave it
alone?  <g> Probbly not.
