Whooey!

I'd say a number of senior people on this list are burnt
out fighting the good fight.

Did the government at least acknowledge it fucked up
in the Weaver case to the tune of $3.1 million?

Didn't the person in charge, who Freeh promoted to
second-in-command at the FBI, have his career destroyed?

Didn't the government finally back down on their
attempt to legally kill the Unabomber?

Didn't the Pentagon Papers make it out?

Isn't ECHELON documented by person after person,
including someone formerly in DOJ with top-secret
clearance?

Go for it!

It is *you* who are advocating being a "sheeple"!!!
