Whether something is "thoughtcrime" can be shades of grey,
when it involves talk of threats of violence.

Thoughtcrime: arrested for possessing or viewing certain images of sex.

1/4 shade of grey: lottery talk to terminate government workers.

1/2 shade of grey: above person also caught hassling government employees.
   (I haven't really followed the Bell case; wasn't he caught stink-bombing
    IRS offices or something?

3/4 shade of grey: a magazine accepting an ad for ~"killer for hire".

black: Vulis sending threats in my name.
