The best bit of news of the last few days is Pinochet's arrest. It
lifted my heart. Almost made up for the all 
the bad stuff the UK government has been coming out with. 
(Also it brought Thatcher out of the woodwork. Like a large segment of
the British Tory party she really is/was an authoritarian, 
paying lip-service to the Free Market for political reasons. You can
tell them by the company they keep.)
