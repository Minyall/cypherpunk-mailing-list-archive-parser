I need to convert some files stored in Motorola s-format (widely used for
input into EPROM burners) to a binary blob of data my debugger can read. I
know there is a GNU utility that supports converting to and from s-format
and a wide variety of other file formats, but a web search turned up empty.

If you know where to find such a utility for UNIX, please let me know.

Thanks,
