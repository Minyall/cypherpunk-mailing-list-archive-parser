Of course there's a free-market remedy for Microsoft; eliminate copyright. If
anyone can copy Microsoft software for free, it would be forced to compete
on real benefits rather than installed base.

This is why I have no sympathy with those who claim Microsoft is the victim
in the anti-trust suits, even though I'm opposed to such action in general; 
those whose profits depend on the 800-pound gorilla can hardly complain when 
it falls on them.
