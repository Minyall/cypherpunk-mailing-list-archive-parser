 that privacy itself was an inherent good in a hostile environment.

 But there is a higher goal.
 In an evironment of plenitude (rather than scarcity) every act can be
 purely symbiotic and in no-way parasitic.  In such an environment,
 (which we have technologically but not politically/economically) we can
 create a political/social system where there are no more fascists or
 statists.
  Then I want everyone to know everything about me.

 IMHO the only robust, sustainable solution is to eliminate all forms of
 such accounting altogether, to decouple production from stored ability to 
 get what you need/want.
