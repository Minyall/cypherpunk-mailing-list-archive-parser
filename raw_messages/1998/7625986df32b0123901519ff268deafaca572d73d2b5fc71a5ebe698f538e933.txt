Not particularly.  If the muddler wraps all lines at
N characters, then you can guess that all lines N characters long
can probably be put back together, which isn't hard,
but if it also loses any white space (e.g. trailing spaces)
then you've got exponentially many possibilities.
It may be worth trying to fix a couple of the easy ones, though.
				Thanks!
