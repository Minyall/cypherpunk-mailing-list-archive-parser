Probably because finding spare CPU cycles on thousands of machines is
easy and free, while finding the disk storage space that you mention
would be expensive, and I doubt distributed.net has the resources.
And people who do have the resources are busy doing other things with
them, or keep them at Fort Meade.

I forget because I haven't read that part of Applied Crypto in a while,
but wasn't it terabytes of storage?
