I thought this was a pretty funny takeoff of the famous Zimmermann 
Telegram.  Apparently this was already sent to the cypherpunks list,
but I just thought that since it made me laugh out loud, maybe I could
laugh out loud on the list.  :-D   --prz

>Bienfait to Toad:
>
>
Most private for PRZ's personal information and to be handed to the
>
>
Eternal Iminister in (?) England with...by a pretty private route.
>
>

>
>
  We propose to begin on the 19 April an unrestricted subliminal 
>
>
InfoWar fair. 
>
>
  We shall endeavour, in spite of this, to keep MeatSpace neutral.
>
>
In the event of this not succeeding we shall make Austin a proposal
>
>
of alliance on the following basis; make InfoWar together, smoke the
>
>
peace piple together, generous bandwidth support, and an understanding
>
>
that Austin is to reconquer their lost territory in Freedom, Liberty
>
>
and Privacy. The settlement in detail is left to you.
>
>

>
>
  You will inform the Webmaster, that is Webmaster Choate of Austin, 
>
>
of the above most privately as soon as the outbreak of war with
>
>
MeatSpace is certain, and add the suggestion that he should on his
>
>
own initiative invite 2600 to immediate adherence and at the same
>
>
time mediate between 2600 and ourselves.
>
>
  Please call the WebMaster's attention to the fact that the ruthless
>
>
employment of our sublimarines offers the prospect of compelling
>
>
BeaverSpace to peace.

Acknowledge receipt with two-word reply...
