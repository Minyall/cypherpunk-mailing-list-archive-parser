It was going along fine until I made the mistake of asking when....

I'd offered a couple of dates, nobody ever commented on them.

I can still cover Austin, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, Fort Worth, El Paso.
A single paper in each city.

I'd say do it like Thanksgiving Day or Christmas. I need 1 months warning.

It might be kind of cool to put regular ads in with various comments like the
1st Amendment, or questions regarding civil liberties, famous quotes, etc.
Just sign it,
