A point made at Senator Ashcroft's crypto hearing going 
on now, made by James J. Fotis, of the Law Enforcement 
Alliance of America, is that many local police departments 
do not want the FBI and federal agencies snooping on them, 
thus, they oppose the FBI's stance on crippled crypto.

To be sure, they may fear the feds because of local
corruption, but it's a crack in the blue wall solidarity
that the FBI has heretofore vaunted.
