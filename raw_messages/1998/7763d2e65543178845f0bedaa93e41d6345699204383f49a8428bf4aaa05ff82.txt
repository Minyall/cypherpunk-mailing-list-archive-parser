Consider it an NSA proposal to issue everyone a Universal Biometrics Card.
 
Everyone in the world.

#   Operationally, the Universal Biometrics Card serves as the cardholder's
#   identification   for   all   forms   of   transactions    and
#   interactions.    It  can  potentially  replace  all  the
#   following forms of identification and credentials:
#
#           Passport and visas
#           House and car keys
#           Driver's license and automobile registration(s)

#           Car rental discount card(s)
#           Train, bus, airplane, toll road and bridge tickets
#           Airline flight boarding pass
#           Train and bus pass and subscription card
#           WHO immunisation certificate
#           Personal telephone directory
#           Personal telephone number
#           Passwords for access to computers, data services, and networks
#           Software subscription access keys
#           Cable and satellite TV subscriptions
#           Cellular phone and personal digital assistant personal ID
#           Encryption keys for secure electronic mail, phone, and FAX
#           Electronic signature key
#
#           Cash

#   Of course, use of the Universal Biometrics
#   Card will start out as voluntary...
 
They'll say hey, you've already surrendered your biometric number
during fingerprinting for driver's licenses.
 
It will be too late.
 
The high-tech American Leviathan will be in place.
