I find very little interference in my daily life as well (except when one of
you anarcho-cooks starts dropping bombs and threatening people).

They take 40% of my income, or are you talking of France taking 60% of your
income. Disagreement over the level or specific policies for spending it do
not justify eliminating the system.

And you find that a better place to live then the US?

What is the percentage of lawyers in France to the total population?

We tried anarchy, it's called cave men. As to Wright and Goddard, they had
ample evidence in physics (that's been around what 4.5B years) to build
their expectations on. In the field of politics and social system the only
thing we have to go with is our imagination, patience, understanding, and
past practice. 5k years or a little more.

All of those say anarcho-anything systems won't work.
