What, you trying to downplay the tumult and ? that y2k will cause??? the
fearmongerers will not be happy with you. They want everyone to be begging
them for mercy, safety, deliverance from the y2k bug. 

What? you say consumers should actually test their own shit? You forgot to
mention the outside consultants who should be brought in at xyz dollars per
hour. To think that Joel and Janice Consumer might actually be able to test
their own equipment for y2k compliance. 

y2k is coming, or else!!! (read, it will be manufactured if it does not
eventualize itself).
