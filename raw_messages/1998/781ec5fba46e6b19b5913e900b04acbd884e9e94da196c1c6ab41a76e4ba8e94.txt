The closest to a noticeable change I've spotted is that the simple
anti-relaying rules (check_rcpt) are now part of the sendmail.cf by
default. (No longer do they have to be downloaded separately and hacked in
by hand.)  There are more complex anti-relaying configurations that can be
specified now, also (for permitting certain parties/domains to relay, or
to only restrict certain groups from relaying).

In other words, not much has changed.
