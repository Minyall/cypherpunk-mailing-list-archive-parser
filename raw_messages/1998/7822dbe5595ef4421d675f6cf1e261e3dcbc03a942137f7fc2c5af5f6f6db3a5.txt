While you may gleefully look forward to such a day, need I remind you that
it will be more than the Jews that go up in flames. Israel has a nice
little stockpile of weapons and are not shy about using them. Any major
attack against Israel is liable to cause the entire Middle East turned
into one large glass bowl.

More than likely Israel will make use of a pre-emptive strike before
anyone gets close to finishing their weapons let alone launching them (I
was there when Israel launched their attack against the Iraq Breeder
Reactor the French were so kind to build for them).

>Some Jews learned nothing from WWII.

Actually they learned quite a bit. They will *never* be herded into cattle
cars and shipped off to the gas chambers again. They may eventually fall
to the forces of darkness but they will do so fighting.

forces of liberation? Lets see, Jews emigrate to Trans-Jordan, *buy* land
from the arabs living there, and live peaceably. The British decide to
divide up this area between Jordan, Palestine, and Israel. The Grand Mufti
declares a "holy war" against the Jews in which the Palestinians and
several neighboring countries join. The Arabs loose, the Jews win. They
continue this war for the next 50 years with various periods of
cease-fire. Every time they loose.

What the Arabs have attempted to do is finish the job the Nazi's started.
Only the Jews are not going to go down without a fight. The continuing
conflict in the Middle East has not been a battle of liberation but a war
of ethnic cleansing and extermination against the Jews.
