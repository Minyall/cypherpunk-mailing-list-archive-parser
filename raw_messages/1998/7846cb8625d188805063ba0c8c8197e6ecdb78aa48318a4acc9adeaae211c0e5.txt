Britain is now trying to establish the infamous GCHQ protocol as the
ETSI standard for "Trusted Third Parties".  Ulrich Sandl (who
represents the German ministry of economics on crypto issues at
international conferences etc.) wrote on the Krypto mailing list that
the German and other delegations have protested in the last minute.
The German standards proposal does not contain key escrow.
