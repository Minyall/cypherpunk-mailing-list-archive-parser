  the American public was informed, and snowed under by the Clintons
  together on TV; unfortunately, the stories very true.  and, it 
  should have been abundantly clear that Hillary, and her far left 
  agenda, was driving the car.
  
  I "like" Clinton for one thing only: he _is_ a made for TV
  President who _could_ project an image to the world which would
  make Americans proud to be Americans.  unfortunately, he never
  graduated from the sandbox" "...it's mine... it's all mine...."
  
  I will grudgingly give Bill credit for accepting the clarion call 
  for him to reign in Hillary, after the health care package she
  shepherded by fascist means, and the largest tax increase in 
  some time; to be a Centrist --too bad it took Newt Gingrich and
  friends to deliver the message.
  
  however, my premise, which you did not include underneath the 
  said by (in fact, the mail [mis]quoting potential places some of
  our more vociferous philosopher kings in jeopardy), is that for
  whatever reason, Clinton was born without, or destroyed enroute,
  any sense of morality --Bill is, and has been, the man who must
  honestly believe he has the right to play the game without rules.
  
  Hillary is unquestionably obsessed not only with power, but 
  revenge for her enemies.  
  
  well, the process goes on; Starr is back to working on White-
  watergate, Fostergate, Travelgate, FBIgate, and a few more 
  "?-gates" --the primary focus probably on Hillary.
  
  and, as much as I think the two of them are scurrilous pests 
  which should be dealt with by Terminix, I don't like the process;
  does America have any pride? not much, and hanging Hillary or 
  Bill will leave America just that much poorer.

  correct; and I was one complainer, and part of the group which 
  started coderpunks.   but, cypherpunks, and the arguments and 
  discourses, is an excellent diversion --with the exception of the 
  often one-sided "arbitration and adjudication" of opinion.

  anyone who can follow the threads of cypherpunks continuously
  has too much time on their hands; I can only afford the luxury
  of the occasional hit and run.
