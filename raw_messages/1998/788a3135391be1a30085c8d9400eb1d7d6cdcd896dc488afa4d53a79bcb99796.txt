Whoops. Wrong subject. You were talking about the strike against
the Wassenaar agreement. 

Not the Iraqis... :) Duh, duh! Too much TV. I am sorry. :)

Well, here's my idea on how to fight the Wassenaar agreement:

I think the best method to fight the WA is with education.
Educate people. Help them use PGP with their applications.

Help integrate PGP into e-mail programs, make it's use easy.

I for one would like sendmail integrated with PGP. For example:
sendmail asks receiving server if it has PGP, and please give 
your public key, I have mail for you.. Then send the e-mail 
encrypted, while the receiving sendmail decrypts it and delivers
forwards. This is not very effective, but it would help some.

Also, you could have your sendmail enforce the PGP option that
no unsecure servers or forwardings would be considered acceptable,
and the e-mail should be returned if such were encountered.

This would eliminate at least *some* of the e-mail spooks there.
I realize it is no not very good, but it is better than nothing 
at all.
