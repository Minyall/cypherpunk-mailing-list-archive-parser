Printed ads are sometimes not archived as widely as news articles, due
to the cost of reproduction, distribution and storage.

The same is true, though, of personals and other types of throwaways.

One possibility is to buy an ad on the NYT Front Page which is often sent
as an image around the world separately from the full paper, and on which 
one can buy a tiny ad for about $800 for two lines of text 32 characters long 
(ID must be included). That's the rate for a one-timer.

Adam, could you reduce the requisite gob to fit 64 characters? Each extra
line runs about $300.

However, bear in mind that a news article is cheaper and will be archived
for eternity (until Asteroid Endall); cheaper, that is, if you can pukedrunk a 
reviler.
