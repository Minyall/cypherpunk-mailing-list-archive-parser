I have received some negative feedback about the name 
"Crypto Kong".

Two people have complained that it is unprofessional 
sounding. 

This is not necessarily grounds for alarm.  One reason the 
name irritates people is that it sticks in the mind like a 
bad song, which was of course an important reason for 
choosing it.   No one is likely to  say "Hey, I saw this plug 
for some digital signing tool, but I can't remember the
name."

On the other hand ...

What do you think?
