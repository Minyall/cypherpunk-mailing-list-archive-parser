just installed the cryptfs patch for linux (from ftp://ftp.csua.berkeley.edu/
pub/cypherpunks/filesystems/linux/) which works nicely on 2.0.35 if you
mangle along the .rej files. it can use any offset
you want and also stego your fs if you like ... oh! wrong os for you?
then again you could certainly astonish your average customs officer
with it ... them probably not expecting your linux to use a ms file
for storage :-)
