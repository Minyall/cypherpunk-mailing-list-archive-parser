There is one thing that comes to mind that was just a topic covered on
this
list and that is the use of cellular/wireless/RF/ham for connections to
said machines.

Obviously, this would make seizure more difficult (and perhaps increase
the
likelyhood of prior warning, if for example, cellular service was
suddenly
cut off).

I am currently studying some parallels between the established FCC
tolerance
of ham radio self-regulation vis-a-vis anonymous remailers.  I haven't
yet
drawn up my opinions, as they are still being formed.  I think that this
might be one avenue to look down as there is obviously a type of legal
precident in what is allowed/tolerated under obvious FCC jursidiction,
whereas the jurisdiction over IP is obviously still ambiguous.
