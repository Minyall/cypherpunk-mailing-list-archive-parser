    I have just been notified that chaffing and winnowing does, indeed,
violate the export regulations. You can read them for yourself at
http://www.bxa.doc.gov/Encryption/encreg.htm, but here are a few parts


a. Designed or modified to use ``cryptography'' employing digital techniques
to ensure ``information security'';
b. Designed or modified to perform cryptanalytic functions;
c. Designed or modified to use ``cryptography'' employing analog techniques
to ensure ``information security'';
...
Note: 5A002 does not control the following:
b. Equipment containing ``fixed'' data compression or coding techniques;
...
g. Data authentication equipment that calculates a Message
Authentication Code (MAC) or similar result to ensure no alteration of
text has taken place, or to authenticate users, but does not allow for
encryption of data, text or other media other than that needed for the
authentication;

    So it seems 5A002.a  and 5A002.g cover such encryption technologies as
chaffing and winnowing. Interestingly enough, 5A002.b allows such functions
as the package transform (keyless coding), even though it uses encryption
algorithms.
