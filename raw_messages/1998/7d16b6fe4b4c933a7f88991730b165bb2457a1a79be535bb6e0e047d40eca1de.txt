It appears is light of today's announcement
<http://info.ic.gc.ca/cmb/welcomeic.nsf/558d636590992942852564880052155b/85256613004a2e1785256690004c70fb?OpenDocument>
by John Manley, Minister of Industry, that domestic cryptography will
bloom, but the export of Canadian crypto is not yet clear. I suspect the
Wassenaar negotiations will determine whether the free export of "public
domain" and mass market software will continue for Canadians. As an
exporter, I hope so.
