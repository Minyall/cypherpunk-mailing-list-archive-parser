http://www.newsmait.com  has a section called the 
"Newspaper Intelligence Page", which has anonymized comments from 
newspaper reporters about what their (current or former) newspaper
working environments are like.  Aside from the usual issues
that any site for griping about work offers, this site provides
a lot of insight into the media business  - how much freedom do
writers have, what kinds of topics get squashed, what the biases
of the editors and management are like.  The folks who run the site
have some obvious concerns about lawsuits.

Looks like a good candidate for a Blacknet-style web site...

				Thanks!
