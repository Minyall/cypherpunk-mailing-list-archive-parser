Hmmm... IMHO, it just means that you can't rely on statistic tests
alone in order to measure entropy content. In fact, you can't measure it at
all: you can only set upper bounds, but, sadly, no lower bounds.
Remember: also pi's digits would pass DIEHARD, and an external attacker
could well inject such kind of EMI into an unshielded receiver.
