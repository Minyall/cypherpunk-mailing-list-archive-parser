>Folks,
>
>A Happy New Year to you all!  1998 should be quite exciting and hectic for
>all of us involved in the AES development effort.
>
>Here is the latest news regarding AES.  I have just posted Known Answer
>Test and Monte Carlo Test documentation on our AES home page.  The actual
>link is:  <http://csrc.nist.gov/encryption/aes/katmct/katmct.htm>.
>
>Information on the API should be made available within several weeks - we
>are actively and diligently working on that.  When that information is
>posted, I will send you a notification message similar to this one.
>
>In addition, we will soon have a survey for you which will be used to
>expedite the exportability of AES analysis packages (which will be made
>available when we announce the "complete and proper" submissions later this
>summer).  More information to follow soon.
>
>As with past messages, this is being sent to all persons who have expressed
>an interest in the AES development effort (one way or another) within the
>last year. 
>
>Kindest regards,
>Jim
