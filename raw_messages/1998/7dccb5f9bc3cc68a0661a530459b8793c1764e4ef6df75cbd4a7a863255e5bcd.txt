A prime is defined as *ANY* number (note the definition doesn't mention
sign or magnitude nor does it exclude any numbers a priori) that has no
multiplicative factors other than itself and 1.

1 * 1 = 1 so it is clearly prime.

Now, if a particular branch of number theory wants to extend it and make it
only numbers >=2 that is fine, I'm not working in that branch anyway.
