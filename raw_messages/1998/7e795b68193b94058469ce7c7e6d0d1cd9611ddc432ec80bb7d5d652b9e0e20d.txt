I did understand the above, but thanks anyway Eric. What I still do not
understand though is what happens between the water and ammonium nitrate
that consumes so much energy. 

I mean, okay, you need to spend energy to mix these two things. Then,
logically, they should not "want" to mix, right? But empirically,
ammonuim nitrate literally sucks water vapors from the air. How come?
