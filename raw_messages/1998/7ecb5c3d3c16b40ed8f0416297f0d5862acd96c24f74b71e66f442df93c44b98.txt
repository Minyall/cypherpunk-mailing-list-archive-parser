This sounds like a real interesting scam.  Graphic files on servers are
already compressed.  Have they found some way to compress already
compressed files?  And if it does not require special software at the
client end, then they must be decompressing it before sending the file.

Or maybe they just convert all the images to low quality jpegs.

This has "Idea from Marketing" written all over it.
