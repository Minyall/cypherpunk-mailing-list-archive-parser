Observe: --begin pasted text--

Amendment I
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech,
or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to
petition the Government for a redress of grievances.


Amendment II
A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,
the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. 

--end pasted text--

While the 2nd does say "well regulated", it should also be pointed out that
the 1st does not say "right OF THE PEOPLE", except in the freedom of
assembly clause.
