We have a good story in this week's Time that talks about how the ski
resort had repeatedly asked the Kennedys to knock it off. Including the
night before the accident. Even on the "fateful" afternoon, the ski patrol
had told the Kennedys -- the last on the slopes -- it was time to quit.
"Nevertheless, 36 members of the Kennedy party prepared to play."
