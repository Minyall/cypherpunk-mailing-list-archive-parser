Sorry, but this is nonsense.

Crypto can and has been used just like any other weapon. The freedom
fighters in Burma who use PGP to communicate securely and to plan bombings
against their oppressors...how can this be said to be "only defensive"?

I've said this many times, so I won't spend more time here. All "defensive"
weapons have "offensive" uses. Even shields, even armor, even crypto.

To think otherwise is to show no awareness of history.
