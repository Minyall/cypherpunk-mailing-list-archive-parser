If you have Microsoft Word (6.0 or later), and have a thesaurus
installed, do the following:

1) Open a new, blank document.
2) Type in the words: I'd like to see Bill Clinton resign.
3) Highlight the entire sentence.
4) Click on the tools menu and select thesaurus (tools, language,
   thesaurus)

Look what is immediately highlighted in the selection box.
