To my knowledge (and the rather credible statements of several 3Com
representatives), there are:

No undocumented accesses to SS 1000, 1100, 3000,3300.
There is one documented access to the CB7000, but that can easily be
removed (i.e. -> login in with the magic username and change the password).
We did that at our site, as we never ever forgot a password to our
equipment (yet).

So, what's the hype, the "backdoor" is only for clueless users, not serious
companies with a security policy.
