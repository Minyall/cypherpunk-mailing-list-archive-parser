I spoke at the Electronic Payments Forum here in Boston today, and,
tomorrow, the keynote for tomorrow's lunch is Ira Magaziner.

(BTW, Bill was speaking tonight at the same hotel the conference is in,
probably a bilderberger conspiracy thing, and, when I got out, there was
about a thousand protesters, about 80/20 against, complete with one guy
dressed as a giant cigar, shades of Butt Man?, and a couple of women with
big brunette hair and blue dresses on. With pearl necklaces, of course...)

Anyway, In light of more recent crypto-shenanigans from Billary, and the
fact that this thing's a small crowd, I figured I'd ask if anyone on these
lists had a question they wanted me to ask him.

One I want to ask, right off the top of my head is, "Given your recent
successes in regulating foreign cryptography, what's your timetable for
regulating domestic cryptography?"

;-).

(To the extent that they already *do*, or not, I'll leave as an exercise
for the reader...)

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
