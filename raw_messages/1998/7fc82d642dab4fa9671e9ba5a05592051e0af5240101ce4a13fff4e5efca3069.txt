Art Bell, the popular host of the late-night
radio show "Coast To Coast AM" is turning
off his microphone indefinitely. 

In Bell's Tuesday morning show he told
listeners, "... a threatening terrible event
tell you about. Because of that event,
and a succession of other events, what
you're listening to right now, is my final
broadcast on the air."
