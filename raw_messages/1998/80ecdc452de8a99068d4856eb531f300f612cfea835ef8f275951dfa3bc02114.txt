Terry,

Good points.  But...

1.  Registration brings money, doesn't mean Bob should just blindly make
changes.  I'm sure that's not what you meant, but I had to say that.
2.  However, on the other token, if a nonregistered user makes suggestions
nicely, his suggestion should be debated (as we are doing here) and
considered by Bob.
