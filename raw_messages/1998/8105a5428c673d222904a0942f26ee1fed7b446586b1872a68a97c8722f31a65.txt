Well, linear analog filters are reversible, so, by themselves, they neither
destroy nor create information. In practice they may add some noise of their
own, drowning the original signal, but in our case this is good, not bad :-)

The relationship between entropy and reversibility is a deep one, of course.
That's also why reversible computing can, among other things, reduce the
power consumption without any theoretical limit.
