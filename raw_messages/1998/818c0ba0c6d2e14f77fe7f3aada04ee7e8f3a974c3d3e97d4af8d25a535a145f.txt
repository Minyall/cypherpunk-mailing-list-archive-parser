Hello, 

Sorry for any cross-posting.
Just thought this group would be interested in this new s/w.
The most startling thing about it is the price Rs. 1,650. (approx US$
40) per copy ...

I'll be at the Bangalore IT fair morrow, and will try to give a first
hand update of this stuff after meeting with the reps.

            Indian firm unveils 448-bit encryption
            package 
	    It is called EMD Armor -- an award-winning
            encryption software package using a powerful 448-bit key,
            developed by an Indian company. It beats the United
States 	    at its
            own game, for, even today, US companies are not allowed to
            export encryption software that uses keys higher than
128             bits.

	    EMD Armor, which is used to secure your personal computer,
            also goes by the name of Sigma 2000. It has picked up the
            Editors Choice award. The product range covers security for
            PCs, e-mail, networks. `Our product combines the highest key
            strength, fast encryption speed (60 MB per minute), and 	   
online
            encryption. That means non-encyrpted data is never stored on
            your hard disk. Anything that is there is
encrypted. 	                Complete  security,'' says Kundu.

	    K. Kundu, Signitron India Director, an IIT Kharagpur alumni,
            told The Times of India that the key algorithm they
have 	    used is
            `Blowfish', developed by cryptography guru Bruce Schneir.
