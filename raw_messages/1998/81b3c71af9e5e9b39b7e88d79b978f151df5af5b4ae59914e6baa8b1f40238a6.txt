well, the first amendment is what I expected to be used...
unfortunately, the phrase "...wall of separation between church and
state" is not taken from the first amendment.  It is taken from a letter
written by Thomas Jefferson...  and the meaning is not that church
shouldn't have an effect on the state.  The state CAN support one
religion over another.  In context, the phrase simply explains that the
government can't make laws that RESTRICT religious practice or doctrinal
issues.  The state CAN make laws that encourage the practice of any one
particular religion, as long as the laws do not RESTRICT the PRACTICE of
other religions.  Making people uncomfortable isn't a constitutional
reason to overturn a law.

btw, notice the wording in the first amendment...it only restricts gov't
restrictions on religion.
