He mentioned in the original message that he wanted to run a service like
anon.penet.fi .. 

penet set up an anonymous box, that is .. you can remail a letter through
penet and it would assign a unique anonymous addy for you, and then
replies and email to that anonymous addy would get forwarded to you.

This would require disk space.
