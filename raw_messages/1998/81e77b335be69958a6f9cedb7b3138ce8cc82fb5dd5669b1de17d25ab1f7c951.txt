>From a new report:

"Cybercrime, Cyberterrrorism, Cyberwarfare"

Tomorrow's frontline commanders will be drawn from 
the ranks of computer wizards. The sandal culture is 
challenging the wingtips. The National Security Agency's 
(NSA) new electronic sheriff, responsible for protecting 
NSA's ground stations, is a 23-year-old GS-14. In the 
civilian sector, "techies" have moved into senior 
management positions.
