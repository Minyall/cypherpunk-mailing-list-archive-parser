We're still getting clueless people forwarding us email virus hoaxes.
Pen-Pal, Buddy Frogs, Good Times, whatever.

And I just realised who has to be responsible!  Who has a motive for this
"crime"?  These things do no-one any real harm, they just take up
bandwidth.  Networks get saturated and maybe we have to buy more kit. It
must be the router manufacturers. Maybe there is a secret team at Cisco or
IBM generating new  hoaxes  to keep the email market growing.
