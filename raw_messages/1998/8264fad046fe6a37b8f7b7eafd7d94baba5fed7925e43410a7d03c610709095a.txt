I second that, it is strange how easily it is to bait supposedly 
libertarian list members into saying statist things about "consumer 
protection laws" and other such examples of state force and coercion 
over businesses. 

I do not go out, but a piece of software, then "demand" that I am 
given the source code and an explanation of why each line was written 
in the particular way it appears, of course this is all an aside to 
the real point that people should know better than to try to 
"protect" children from speech they don`t like.
