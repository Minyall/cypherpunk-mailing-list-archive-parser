4.  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

This document was produced based on the combined efforts of the protocol
subcommittee of the Key Recovery Alliance.


Why am I not surprised?

I hope the IETF will not accept the implementation of *any* GAK proposals
into the RFC's. If these people want to force Big Brother on us they
should not have the benefit of the IETF to do so.

I plan on writting to the Security Group at the IETF on this. Hopefully it
will not be accepted for consideration. I would like to see the IETF have
a blanket policy automatically rejecting any GAK proposals but that might
be too much to ask.
