When Jim Choate writes about something that I know about, he is usually
wrong.  Look at the hash he made of quantum mechanics recently.  And don't
get me started on his blunders regarding cryptography.

So when he writes about something I don't know about, like the EM
emissions of video tubes, I tend to assume the same thing.  He's probably
all messed up.

Anybody else have the same experience?

And how about his countless off-topic posts, forwarding all kinds of
pointless crap?  Is anyone else sick of that, too?
