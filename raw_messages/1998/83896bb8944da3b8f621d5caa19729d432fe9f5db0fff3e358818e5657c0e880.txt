	I'm not sure what you're trying to say with this notation.

	Well, if by '/' you mean integer division with truncation
	(a la most programming languages,) then consider that
	
		 9 = 49/5 and
		12 = 49/(49%5=4) 

	And so gcd(a,d) != 1.  

	This is my best guess as to what you're trying to say, since
	in number-theoretic notation these two statements don't make
	much sense:  division is not closed on the integers, and 
	(b mod c) is not a single integer, but an equivalence class.
