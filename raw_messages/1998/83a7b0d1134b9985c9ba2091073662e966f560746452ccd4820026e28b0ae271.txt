Do you have proof that Gauss did that?  This sounds like another one of
those urban legends the envious sheeple like to invent about celebrities,
like the claim that Leonrado da Vinci was a cocksucker.

You're citing janos Bolyai, who claimed exactly that.  Unfortunately, the
poor chap went insane.

You're confused, Jim.  Farkas Bolyai (the father) never claimed to have
invented non-euclidean geometry. He published a math textbook in 1829,
with an appendix credited to his son, Janos, which contained the results
published by Lobachevsky in 1829.  He's lucky we're not accusing him
of plagiarism.

Because if you tried to do that, you would again expose your ignorance,
as you did when you tried arguing about Soviet-Japanese skirmishes in the
1930s.

Coward.
