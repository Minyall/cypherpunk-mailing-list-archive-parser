Jesus Christ on a stick. Take a fucking chill pill Adam.

That 'you' is the literary you, not you personaly. You (not the literary
you) should seriously consider counseling. Talk about hair-triggered.

If anybody is guilty of demanding people do it 'their way' it's you.

You really need to better understand this inability of yours to seperate
your self-worth as an individual from the ideas you espouse and supposedly
put out for public dialog.

Everybody has stupid idea, if you can't admit that then there's a problem
more serious than having stupid ideas. Everybody makes mistakes everyday,
and if you seriously think you don't then you have found your first mistake
today.
