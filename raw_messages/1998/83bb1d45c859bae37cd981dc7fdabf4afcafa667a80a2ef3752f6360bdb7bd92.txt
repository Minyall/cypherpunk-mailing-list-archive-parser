1 - Anonymity is technically feasable.

2 - This requirement is a legal necessity.  Otherwise, the organization
    may be seen as advocating murder.

Obviously, if the "Death Pool" was fully anonymous, there would be
no way to tell if the winner had contributed in any way to the death.

Thus, I think we may be well on our way to Assasination Politics.
