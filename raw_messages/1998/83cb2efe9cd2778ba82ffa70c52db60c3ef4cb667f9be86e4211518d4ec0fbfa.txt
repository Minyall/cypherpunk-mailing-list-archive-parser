MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Oct. 5 /PRNewswire/ -- Microsoft Corp.'s (Nasdaq:
MSFT - news) WebTV Networks today announced it is the first U.S. company to
obtain government approval to export nonkey recovery-based 128-bit-strength
encryption for general commercial use. WebTV Networks pioneered low-cost
access to the Internet, e-mail, financial services and electronic shopping
through a television set and a standard phone line. 

The WebTV(TM) Network service, combined with the WebTV-based Internet
terminals and receivers, is the first communications system permitted by
the U.S. government to provide strong encryption for general use by
non-U.S. citizens in Japan and the United Kingdom. Such strong encryption
allows Japanese and United Kingdom subscribers of WebTV to communicate
through the WebTV Network (both within national borders and
internationally) without fear of interception by unauthorized parties.
