Well call me a cynic but in reading section #3 I take that as to mean
access without the help or cooperation of the person(s) who did the
encryption.

If they are willing to rely on the Constitution then why push for new, and
as you mentioned, unneeded legislation?

I think the rest of this is just window dressing for organizations like
the EFF, et al who are just bursting to make a deal.


I smell a lawyer in the woodpile.
