The information contained in

http://www.research.att.com/~smb/nsam-160/pal.html

appears from my knowledge accurate.

One must consider possible malfunction when

  With the CAT B, it is also possible to check the code, relock the
  weapon, or rekey it. 

and

 limited-try feature disables the bomb if too many incorrect keys are
 entered. Most references omit the CAT C. It may just be a later model   
of the CAT B. 

The new keys loaded were occasionally not the ones intended to be
loaded.  

Back to Pantex for disassembly was the fix.

The bubble memory of the T1563 was one of the problems
in rekeying reliability,  I was told..

Bugs in the about 112,000 lines of rca 1802 assembler code was also a 
problem.

Kent Parsons asked me to look at the code and make a recommendation
about what to do.

Later
