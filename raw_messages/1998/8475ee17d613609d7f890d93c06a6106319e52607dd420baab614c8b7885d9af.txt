Yes, but what do they do for customers of *other* banks? They *charge* them
for it. Which is exactly what any underwriter should do to put money onto
the net. There is no difference between an underwriter of digital cash and
a provider of a third-party cash machine, be it at a bank other than your
own, or, more equivalent, those private ATM machines you see all over the
place now.

Well, certainly no more than Otto Lillienthal was... :-).

 By making it so cheap for them to use that it becomes ubiquitous? ;-).

Big pile of "ifs" there. I expect that all you really need are other
digital bearer assets which provide a better return than cash. :-).

Okay. Since the actual, financial definition of seignorage is in fact the
difference between what money's worth and what it costs to produce it,
you're probably right. :-). Nonetheless, income on seignorage is miniscule
to other income that the Fed makes, and that's a fact. Greenspan has gone
on record (see the Forbes article) as saying that it would be no skin off
his nose if the Fed never saw any of it.

Well, yeah, to the extent that the cost structure is somewhat :-)
different. Unique, non-replicable money-bits *are* easier to print and
control than paper ones after all. Some people say three orders of
magnitude cheaper. ;-).

Agreed, and he's said as much, like I've said. Controlling the money
supply's more what Greenspan's interested in, and, frankly, given the
amount of eurodollars (the "other" e$ :-)) held in dollar-denominated
accounts in foriegn banks, it's probably safe to say that that's going to
be more of a problem for him as time goes on. And, of course, the physical
cash sitting in some Russian mattresses is, well, seignorage.

Cheers
