Has there been any indication that the EFF would not support or help someone
being persecuted for crypto-export disobedience? I wouldn't rely on such
charity, nor is charity ever obligatory (that's socialism), but what reason
do you have to discount it?

The essence of civil disobedience is many many individual targets, not one
organization.

Fine, if that is the source if your righteousness, I will put one up 1Q99. I
won't even play the my network is bigger than your network pissing match,
but I will put my money where my mouth is if you think hosting a list node
is that big of a deal.

I'm am not critical of any contribution, but I will be critical of someone
chastising others contributions simply because they would do it differently.
A call to arms to protect liberty is not a draft. If you don't want a gun,
then don't take it, I won't even call you a Tory.
