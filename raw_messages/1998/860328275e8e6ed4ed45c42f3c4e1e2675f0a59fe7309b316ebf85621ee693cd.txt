After 6 weeks of number crunching, I've finally produced a new set of
bitslice DES S-boxes using non-standard logic gates.

Numbers are as follows -

	S1  S2  S3  S4  S5  S6  S7  S8   Avg
	56  50  53  39  56  53  51  50   51

Details at http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/~mkwan/bitslice

There won't be any more improvements in the foreseeable future, since
I've run out of ideas.

Feel free to use this code in the RSA DES II challenge, but remember to
give credit where it's due.
