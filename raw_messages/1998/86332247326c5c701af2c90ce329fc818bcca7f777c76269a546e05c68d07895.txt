It's people like Lt that give AOL a bad name... I am sorry to say I am a part
of it, but I just keep it because I don't feel like switching... ah well.

At least they have TCP/IP protocols now with Win 95
ex: Hiroshima 45, Tsjernobyl 86, Windows 95 

(Please, correct my spelling if I misspelled Tsjernobyl)

Anyway, Lt... get real, this is Cypherpunks, not travel.
