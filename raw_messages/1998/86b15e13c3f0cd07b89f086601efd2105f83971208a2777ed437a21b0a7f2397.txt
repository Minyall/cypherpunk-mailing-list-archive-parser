Naw... But I hereby nominate the green iguana to be the official mascot of
the cypherpunk crypto-refugee community on Anguilla.

I can see it on the "alternative" FC99 shirt now. A bunch of iguanas, (at
least one in black BDUs :-)), on a raft of (tamper resistant)
cryptoaccellerator and DES-cracker parts, styrofoam, and Stronghold and Red
Hat boxes, all with a silhouette of Anguilla looming in the background.
Maybe with Jerry Gumbs standing on the beach holding a "God Save the Queen"
sign?

But wait, there's more.  How about the Anguillan flag, with *iguanas*
replacing the dolphins...


Can you tell the equinox is over?

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
