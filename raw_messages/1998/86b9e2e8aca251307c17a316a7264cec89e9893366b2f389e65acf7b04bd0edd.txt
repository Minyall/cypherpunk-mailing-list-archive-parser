Given the Head of State's alleged affinitity for 
"covert personal operations", consider the potential
for manipulating him by any three-letter-agency skilled
in surveillance.  E.g., getting the Clinton
administration behind Clipper, supporting our man Freeh, etc.

There are advantages to having a POTUS who's a security
risk, after all :-<   


-Gedanken memo, no such agency.
