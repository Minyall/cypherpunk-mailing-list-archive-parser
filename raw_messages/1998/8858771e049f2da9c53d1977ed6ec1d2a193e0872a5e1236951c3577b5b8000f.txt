Interesting thread. While we're on the topic of chemistry and heat:

Does anyone happen to know how to figure the energy requirements or yields
for a reaction? My college chemistry book doesn't say a whole lot about it.
In fact it doesn't say enough to actually be useful at all; it gives
energies for four or five different bonds in a table and then launches into
a really bad explanation of how to calculate this. 

If I have to use a table of bond energies is there one available online? Or
is there a simpler way to just calculate the bloody things?

I really ought to take more chemistry courses before I get my diploma. Or at
the very least audit them.
