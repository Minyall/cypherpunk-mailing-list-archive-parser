As to calculating a realistic estimate of range to intercept, I disagree
strongly.

I am aware of how to do Tempest in practice as well as in theory.

The process goes something like this. The first target is the vertical
retrace. This signal is usualy the strongest because the voltage required
(and hence the dv/dt) is the largest to sling that e-beam from the lower
right to the upper left. It usualy resides in the 50-70Hz range. The next
target is the horizontal retrace. It slews the beam from the right edge of
the display to the left in order to start another trace. You can use this
signal to syn both the vertical retrace steps (in order to move the beam
down verticaly to start another trace) as well as the ramp that is required
to slew the beam across the screen to write the pixes. Once these 4 signals
are aquired and fed to the appropriate control terminals of a CRT you are
ready to begin decoding the actual trace data for each line of the display.
This is the hardest since the actual modulation of the e-beam is done via a
screen grid (who said tube theory was out of date?) and that signal is quite
small and generaly has a cardoid emission pattern aligned axialy along the
central axis of the CRT tube. So if given a choise you want your antenna to
be behind the viewer in line with the display.

It is of some import to note that larger displays are easier to aquire
usable signals from since the distances the e-beam is slewed and as a result
the control voltages are much larger.
