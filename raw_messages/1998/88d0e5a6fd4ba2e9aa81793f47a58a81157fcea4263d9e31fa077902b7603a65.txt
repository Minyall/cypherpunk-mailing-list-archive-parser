Not realy,

Post it to one unnmoderated newsgroup      Canceling it would be rouge
Post it to one moderated newsgroup         Moderator may cancel it
Post it to more then 20 newsgroups         Anyone can cancel it as spam

The post was canceled because the moderator can canel anything in there
newsgroup.  It is censorship, but by posting to a moderated newsgroup you
are concenting to that censorship.
