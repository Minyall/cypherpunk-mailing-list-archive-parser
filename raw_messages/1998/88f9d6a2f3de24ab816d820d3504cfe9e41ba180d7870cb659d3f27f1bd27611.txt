You don't have the internet? You didn't get it with your CD? - I heard you can get it
on 3 x 1.44 MB disks from KwikMart (only $1.99).

Now, I'm not too sure how all this 'internet' stuff works (all rather complicated), but
don't you need one to send an e-mail? Boy have I been burned... ;)

PS: If you would like serious answer then feel free to send me a serious question
and I'd be happy to help you out (I'd say the questions are off topic from this list :).
