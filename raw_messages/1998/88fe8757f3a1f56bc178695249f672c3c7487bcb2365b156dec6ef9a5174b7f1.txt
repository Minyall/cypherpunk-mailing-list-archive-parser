*** EU considers letting police snoop on Internet

European Union justice ministers agreed Thursday to consider letting
police snoop on Internet users as a measure to tackle organized
crime. Police, who fear the Internet is being used by international
criminals for money laundering and other crimes, are currently barred
from tapping into the computer messages. The ministers, gathered for
an informal meeting in Birmingham, England, agreed police should be
given new powers but added they should be tightly restricted so as
not to damage the rapidly growing computer industry. See
