As long as this feature isn't turned on, on the remailers, not at all.
All the remailers use a replyable e-mail as the from field, they ust dumpe
anything e-mail to that, so if Sendmail goes out and does a VRFY on an
e-mail, it'll work, but not mean a heck of a lot..

All it really does is force spammers to search for someone's real address
to spoof and harass.  (They can just scan usenet, and pick on random
people if they want..)
