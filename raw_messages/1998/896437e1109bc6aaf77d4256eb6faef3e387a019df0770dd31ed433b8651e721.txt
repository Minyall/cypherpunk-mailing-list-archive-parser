As far as I know, the only bio-weapon test that occured in San Francisco
was when they scattered some large volume of apparently harmless
bacteria over the city in order to find out what effect a bio-attack
would have on them, and to get an idea of what countermeasures are
useful, and of course, to test their own delivery systems. :)

I don't know what kind of bacteria they were, so I've no idea if they
were harmless or not.  Suffice to say that a bunch of people in San
Francisco think they weren't (harmless), and get upset about it
frequently.

It seems unlikely, however, that the few deaths that people have tried
to attribute to the bacteria were actually caused by them.  San
Francisco is a big city, with lots of people.  If the bacteria really
were dangerous, *manY* people would have died, rather than the handful
(10-15?) that did in fact die, for one reason or another.
