Your question is too vague to get any kind of simple answer.

Regulate *what* exactly? Protocol standards? Pricing? Volume 
of traffic? Traffic content? Internationally or domestically?
If domestic, which countries? Use of encryption? Anonymity?
Digital signatures? Taxation? Email content? Spam?  Porn? 
Usenet? Web sites? IRC? DNS naming services? Digital telephony?

Packets currently fly around the world as free as migratory
birds, and as hampered by borders.
