Hi,

I have a question related to Goldbach's Conjecture:

All even numbers greater than two can be represented as the sum of primes.

Is there any work on whether odd numbers can always be represented as the
sum of primes? This of course implies that the number of prime members
must be odd and must exclude 1 (unless you can have more than a single
instance of a given prime). Has this been examined?

I'm assuming, since I can't find it explicitly stated anywhere, that
Goldbachs Conjecture allows those prime factors to occur in multiple
instances.

I've pawed through my number theory books and can't find anything relating
to this as regards odd numbers.
