You have to differentiate between information carrying emanations
and non-information carrying ones. The horizontal and vertical
deflection coils produce a lot of radiation at harmonics of the
line and frame rate of your CRT, but this signal energy is not
related to your screen content (only to your video mode), and therefore
not of much concern for the eavesdropper. The low-radion monitor
standards look only at those signal (<400 kHz). Therefore having
a TCO92 monitor provides you absolutely no advantage with respect
to eavesdropping.

The information carrying signals of VDUs are in much higher frequency
ranges in the VHF/UHF bands. Laptops are pretty good broadcasters
there, too.
