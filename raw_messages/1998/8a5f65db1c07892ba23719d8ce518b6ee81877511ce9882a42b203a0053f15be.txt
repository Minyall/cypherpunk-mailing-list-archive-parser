	Keystroke logging technology exists commercially as a result
of the shit reliability of commercial OSs.  Turning one of them
quite stealth wouldn't be hard; they're very innocous as is.

	Also note things like the recent MS 'send chunks of ram in
Word documents' bug in Word for the Mac.  (Actually an OLE bug.)

	The benefit to encryption is not that it makes your data
secure, but that it allows you to communicate safely in the presense
of adversaries.  (Rivest's definition.)
