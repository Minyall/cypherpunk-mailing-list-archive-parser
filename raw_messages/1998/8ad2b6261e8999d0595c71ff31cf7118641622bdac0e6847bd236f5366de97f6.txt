OK, but to be technically correct, you arent *transmitting* all 2^n
possibilities.  That would be like saying that when you blowfish encrypt a
64-bit block and send it, you are sending all 2^64 plaintext, because given
all 2^128 possible keys you will cover the entire "plaintext-space".  while
it is crucial to make sure that you leave the possible decryptions
exponential, you are not transmitting all possible plaintests. That would
be .... uhhh... bad.
