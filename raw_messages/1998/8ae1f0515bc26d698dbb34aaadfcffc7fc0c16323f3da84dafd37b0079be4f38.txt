Ray has widened his definition of "spam" even more.

You've mentioned that spam is theft. If the courts agree with you on your
definition of what spam is, then pretty clearly the legal system gets
invoked. (But to forestall any confusions in the courts, the anti-spam
sentiment being discussed by Ray and many others is likely to lead to
specific legislation. Sadly.)

So, your definition of spam has now been expanded to include someone who
sends _you_ (you, not thousands, not tens of thousands) a message you don't
care for.

Well, not much more I can say here.
