Hi,

Here in Austin we have a local radio dj who does a public access show on
various issue localy and nationaly, Alex Jones, who has put a piece on some
sort of bio-weapon test that occurred in '66 in San Francisco. He is
claiming that deaths resulted.

Anyone have a clue what he's talking about?
