Here's a reference to a conference session I just found on the Web.
The presenters claim that prior demonstrations of the A-B effect were
bogus, produced by the magnetic field of the moving particle
interacting directly with the adjacent magnetic field.
 
It also states that no evidence of a magnetic vector potential acting
on a particle in the absence of a magnetic field has ever been
demonstrated.
 
Any comments?

[K19.04] Ehrenberg-Siday-Aharonov-Bohm (ESAB) Effect Has Not Been Observed
 
Gordon R. Freeman, Larry D. Coulson (University of Alberta)
 
The beautiful results from two types of experiment that were claimed
to confirm the existence of the (misnamed) Aharonov-Bohm Effect, with
coherent electrons in split beams (Tonomura amp; co.) and split
conductors (Webb amp; co.), are explained quantitatively by the energy
of interaction of the magnetic field produced by the moving electrons
with the magnetic flux of the adjacent applied field. The electron
velocities (and phases) change by opposite amounts in the two parts of
the split beam, and de Broglie wave interference occurs in the
rejoined beam. No effect of a magnetic vector potential in the absence
of a magnetic field has been demonstrated, so the ESAB Effect has not
been demonstrated to exist.
