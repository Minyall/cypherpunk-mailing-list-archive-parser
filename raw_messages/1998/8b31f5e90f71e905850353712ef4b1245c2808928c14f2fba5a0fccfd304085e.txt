It's not at all odd.

In the New World Order, you Aussies are children. As children, your role is
to die in wars like Viet Nam and the Gulf, under orders from the New World
Reichsfuhrer.

And like the American children sent to die in wars at age 18, but too young
to either vote or drink alchohol, children cannot be allowed to possess
dangerous crypto tools which might let them deviate from parental wishes.

(Seriously, what the holy fuck are you Aussies doing getting involved in
our Moral Leader's vanity war with Saddam? The United Nations authorized
action in 1990 to "liberate Kuwait." That was done. All this recent
folderol about "ensuring Saddam complies with inspections" is outside the
original charter. And, of course, pointless. If the U.S. launches Bill's
War, I hope it gets paid back in full with some attacks by freedom
fighters. Maybe then Amerika will lose its desire to boss the world around
and will get back to basics.)
