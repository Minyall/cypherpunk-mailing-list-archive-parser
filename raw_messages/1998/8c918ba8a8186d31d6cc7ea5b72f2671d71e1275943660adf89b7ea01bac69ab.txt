I assume you are refering to the meeting at Cambridge University that
you chaired.

My subjective impressions of that meeting were that PZ was certainly
sincere.  I seem to recall he told us that he was unware NAI had even
orginally been a member of KRA until he was telephoned by a journalist
in his car and was opposed to this.  Presumably this was before NAI
bought TIS and rejoined (?)

I would add an option

(4) PZ didn't know -- cockup not conspiracy

But all this leads to a lack of confidence in the future of the PGP product,
which is too precious to be left in the hands of one (American) company,
whose policy is in doubt.

I  am not currently convinced by their actions that NAI are
serious about strong crypto and I believe that a truly free and open
version of PGP (GPG?) would be superior.
