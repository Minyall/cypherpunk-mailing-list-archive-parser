The engineering issue is this: no matter how great you filter out 
the junk, you don't have a perfect analog measurement to start with.
(Note that filtering out junk reduces info content).

So the question is how to distill the bits out of your binary digits.
You need to reduce the number of bits; you need to make them equiprobable.

I have not had luck*time implementing Shannon's method for distilling bits,
mentioned as suggestion #2 in the RFC.  This method produces perfect 0:1 ratio
but takes indeterminate input bits to do so.  Please post if you play with
this.
