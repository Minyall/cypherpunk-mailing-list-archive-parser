Hey guys,

I found this in a web site.
|---v
A knapsack that holds a total....and N indivisible objects....
My quetion is does indivisible means that the object cannot be divided as
dividing a grain of rice? Does this imply I can divide an array of
integers but not the integers? 
--------------------------------------------


If I'm going to use 0/1 knapsack algo then I'll just place a tag on each
element let us say 1 for true and 0 for false? which ever element satisfy
the condition?

What is dynamic programming approach (wavefront calculation)? Is it with
the use of pointers? or
different concept? 


Thanks.

Bernie
