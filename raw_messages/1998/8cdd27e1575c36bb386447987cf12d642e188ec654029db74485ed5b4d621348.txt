Correct, multiplication by a non-zero residue modulo 65537 is a
permutation of the non-zero residues.  The central notion behind IDEA is
to use this operation, which can be expressed expeditiously in terms of
the unsigned 16x16->32 multiply, as a builtin wide S-Box.  This is how
IDEA manages to do strong encryption using only a few ordinary arithmetic
and logical instructions with no necessity for table lookup.

I didn't bother to read the rest of the rant.
