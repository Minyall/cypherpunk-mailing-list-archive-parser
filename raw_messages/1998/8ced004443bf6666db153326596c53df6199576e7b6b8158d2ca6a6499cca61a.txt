Our tests have determined that you are severely lacking in the clue
department. As per the advice of "Porker" <PTPPork@aol.com>, you are
advised to upgrade to 32-bit AOL immediately. We have been advised that
upgrading to 32-bit AOL fixes problems with cluelessness. 

Remember: with the Advent of 32 bit AOL, you can actually use all of the
TCP/IP protocols.
