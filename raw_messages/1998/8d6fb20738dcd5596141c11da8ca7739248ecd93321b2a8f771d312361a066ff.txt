They sew for fashion houses, and there are more fashion
houses than anyone can count.

Even if there was only a single redistributor, there would be
no monopoly, since the cost of entry to the business of
specifying garments, buying them, transporting them, and
reselling them is completely insignificant.

Jim's present day "monopolies" are as utterly fantastic as
his past monopolies.
