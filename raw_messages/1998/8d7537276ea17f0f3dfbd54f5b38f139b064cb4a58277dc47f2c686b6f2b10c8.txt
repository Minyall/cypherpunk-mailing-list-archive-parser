Ah yes; once it's established that a parent owing alimony can be forced
to work "to protect the children", expect similar treatments for taxes
and credit card debt and judgments.
The credit card issues are also lobbying very hard to exempt credit card
debts from bankrucpy.
For most of humanity's history, interest rates on loans to individuals
were around 100-200% per annum; default rate was proportionate; bad
debtors were jailed or enslaved; children inherited debt; etc.
