Congrats to Mr. Gilmore, EFF, et. al. for a very impressive DES crack.

It seems that Gilmore and Moore's Law have just turned the
once-respected DES into cryptographic snake-oil. He keeps hurting
snakes like that, he's gonna get himself canonized. ;-).


Seriously. Many thanks to Mr. Gilmore for proving, once again, that
lobbying is pointless, and that physics is not optional.

Outstanding. Marvellous.

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
