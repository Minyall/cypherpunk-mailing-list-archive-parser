Ye gods, Robert, what'd you do to Vin, told TRW the facts of his Ponzi,
sent his name to the IRS assassin bot with e-$3, broadcast his secret key,
revealed his criminal nyms, told his deadbeat kids where he really hides, 
scrambled his biometrics so he'd never access offshore stashes, 
crayoned his sweetie's moniker, skills and number on John Glenn's
overalls, or merely plonked, readied, aimed as is the privilege of 
demigodish ganglia atwitching.
