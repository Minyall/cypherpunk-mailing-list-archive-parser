I read the arrest warrant and a couple of things strike me as 
strange.

1. Why would anyone post an encrypted message along with the password 
to decrypt it?

2. I thought the public portion of a key was required to authenticate 
a signature, the secret part is only used to sign a message.

I believe that anyone who is now subscribed to the cypherpunks list 
is now under surveilance. I suspected that this might be true but now 
my belief is confirmed.
