Ah good -- I thought you'd taken leave of your cypherpunkly senses for
a moment there!  (re my `fuck copyright' post).

That it might be, if it is a social says that it is polite to honor
peoples requests about bit flow.

But hey, if more and more people find ignoring the supposed social
convention convenient, then perhaps this social convention isn't as
widely adhered to as people making money off subsidized copyright

conventions on copyright are moving, and quite fast.  And copyright
has a hidden cost which we are all paying for.
