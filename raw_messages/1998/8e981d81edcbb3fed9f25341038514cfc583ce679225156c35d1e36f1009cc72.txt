Put it like this, it took the Feds a long time to be willing to accept
RTTY (Radio Teletype), because it used this 7(?)-bit ASCII CODE stuff.
On the other hand, they've relaxed a lot, as amateurs have largely become
computer hackers as well, equipment changed, Morse became less relevant....
As long as the ham user community doesn't get annoyed at you,
and you don't abuse the available bandwidth, you ought to be able to stego
a certain amount of traffic through the net, either using some sort of
PointyHairedBoss code, or low-order bits in GIFs, or whatever.
