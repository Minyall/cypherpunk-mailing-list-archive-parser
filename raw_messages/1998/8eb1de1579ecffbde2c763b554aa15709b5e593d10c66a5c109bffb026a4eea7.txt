Not really. If the service providor is to be held accountable for what 
its members post/say/etc., they would have to monitor *all* traffic in 
order to police their members. In addition, even if the providor *were* 
monitoring, they can only be reactive - do you expect them to monitor and 
censor all traffic before releasing it?

Looks like an attempt to bring in a "deep pockets" defendant.
