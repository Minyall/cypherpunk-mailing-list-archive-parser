EURO HOLOGRAM IS MISSING
Somewhere between Paris and Munich, a unique hologram design, intended to
deter counterfeiting of the new euro currency, has turned up missing.  The
French-made hologram was on its way to a high-security printer near
Nuremberg for testing.  One European Union monetary official called the
disappearance "startling" and there's speculation that the EU may have to
change the design of its high-denomination euro banknotes, due to be issued
in 2002.  The hologram was designed by a small business in Paris and was
taken to be loaded onto an Air France flight at Roissy airport by Brink's
security services.  Officials in Paris say the theft bears the hallmarks of
a well-organized crime, as only an expert would understand the significance
of the hologram in the note-printing process.  (Financial Times 21 May 98)
