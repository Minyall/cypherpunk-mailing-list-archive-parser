We'd Like Your Help

ViewZone is an on-line magazine that looks at life from different angles. 
It's hard to describe but we think you'll enjoy it - AND we want your opinion.

Viewzone is a little crazy at times, thought provoking, sometimes
controversial - but always entertaining. 

""""We hate spam (except for breakfast) - but we thought you'd want to
check out this new on-line magazine. It's FREE and, well, we'd like your
opinion on what you see."""""

Weird science, humor, reality(!), interesting personalities and
interesting adventures... check us out! (e-mail back from the site)
