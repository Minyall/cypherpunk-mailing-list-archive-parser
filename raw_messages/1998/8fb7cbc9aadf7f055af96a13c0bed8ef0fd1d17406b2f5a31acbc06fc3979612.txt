If I were doing it, I would probably feed the raw bytes into a stream
cipher with feedback, like Sapphire II, and then select every nth byte from
the output stream (just to match the output bit rate to the estimated
actual entropy in a conservative fashion and improve the effective
avalanche performance of that particular algorithm). This would be faster
than a hash like SHA-1. Indeed, you could just use a good mixer, like a CRC
or non-cryptographic hash to whiten the noise if speed is an issue. As long
as you restrict the output bit rate to less than the actual estimated
entropy of the source, you should be alright, provided that your noise
source is as random as you think it is.

Then again, the truly paranoid may beg to differ.
