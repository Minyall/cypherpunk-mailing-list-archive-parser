	Further, as the net becomes more and more integrated with
	your OS, to the point that FTP/HTTP sites are accessable from your
	command-line prompt as if they were just really slow drives, 
	will we see some truly clueless customs officials arrest you
	because they can find the Playboy site *in* your computer?
	
	And how about random noise?  Random strings could be ciphertext.
	If I design PRNGs, and have my laptop drive stuffed with huge
	random files for DIEHARD analysis, would that one day be 
	illegal to carry across a border?

	From an information-theoretic perspective, we have the asymptotic
	equipartition property telling us that almost all strings are almost 
	equally extremely suspicious.  Will a dartboard w/ the alphabet on it
	be vanishingly unlikely to generate a message one could legally
	carry outside the US?
