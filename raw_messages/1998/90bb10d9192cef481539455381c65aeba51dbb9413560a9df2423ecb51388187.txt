Never Never Trust GOST !!!  
The security of GOST depends on the quality of the S-Boxes (or whatever
the equivalent fields in GOST are called).  The Soviets provided
different sets for military and civilian use, and unless you know a lot
about the design, you can't tell strong ones from weak ones -
you have to worry about differential and linear cryptanalysis,
plus any other attacks that may have been developed over the years.
You're better off using 3DES if you like old slow algorithms;
in this case, I'd stick to Blowfish.
