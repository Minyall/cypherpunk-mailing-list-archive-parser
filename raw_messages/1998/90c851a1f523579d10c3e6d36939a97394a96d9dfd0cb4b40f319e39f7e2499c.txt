I saw an article on this in InfoWorld. NAI/TIS and DARPA talking about
putting self-switching packets into the network. I don't see this as too
far off from packets purchasing their passage across the network with
micromoney of some kind.

All spookiness of the current research principals aside, of course...

Cheers,
