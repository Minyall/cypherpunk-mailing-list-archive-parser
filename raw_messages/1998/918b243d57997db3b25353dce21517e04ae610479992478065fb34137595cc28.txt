Hmm - so if I defined a new crytpo algorithm, SED3, say, that looks like
this:

SED3(k,x)=3DES(backwards(k),x)

where backwards(k) is k with its bits written backwards, then the
3DES/SED3(k1,k2) combination is exportable (where k1 is related to k2,
of course, by k2=backwards(k1))?

Cheers,

Ben.
