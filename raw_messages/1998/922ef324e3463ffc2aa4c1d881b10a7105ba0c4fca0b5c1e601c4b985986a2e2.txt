Given that anarchist don't support a 'head' in regards to human activities
*and* that a free market monopolizes thus creating a 'head' it is clear 
that if we apply the ideas of human society (ie political systems) to
economics we derive a fundamental conflict, that a anarchist in the economic
sphere is left with no choice but to agree that economic systems must be
managed and creates a 'head' either by plan or monopolistic fiat.

Therefore the original thesis that such political models are applicable to
economic ones is flawed. It simply is not possible for an economic system to
exhist without some sort of 'head' or guiding structure. This is
fundamentaly at odds with the definition and spirit of anarchy.
