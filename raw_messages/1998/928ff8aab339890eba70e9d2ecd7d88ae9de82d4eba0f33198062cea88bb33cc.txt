Oh, I don't know. After all, we all know that blacks are so descriminated
against. That's why we "need" such things as quotas, affirmative action,
"dumbing down" of test scores, special versions of standardized tests for
blacks, ebonics, and other such great ideas. Therefore, analyzing the
government party line, it is perfectly reasonable to have assumed that
blacks would always be so descriminated against as to never get hired for
such a position.

Right.
