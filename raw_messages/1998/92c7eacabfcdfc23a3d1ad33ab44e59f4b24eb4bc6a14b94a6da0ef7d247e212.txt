I'm not here on the Internet to burden you with unsolicited advertising 
solicitations. If I've offended you in any way, I am sorry.  If you do not wish to 
receive any more information, then do not respond to this message and you 
won't hear from me again.  I do not re-use email addresses.  After they are 
used ONCE, they are deleted.


My point is brief.  

The reason I am writing to you is that I am overwhelmed with Leads.
I would like to find just a few quality people to work with who have 
the desire to make six-figure results so that I can help them get started.  
I will not sell to anyone, nor will I do any convincing, and neither will you.

If you would like more information, just say the words (words=GPG in the 
subject line of your return email) and I'll email a free, helpful file that will 
give you more information.

Sincerely, 
 
 Dobbin


 PS - Yes, I do read all your responses and I'll handle each one personally.
