I don't care if they call their boss Grand Wazoo Snail Mail Evangelist;
there are software and ice cream companies that use non-standard titles too.
"Postal Inspector" is a much more serious problem title, since they
seem to have quasi-police powers to do criminal investigations of
postal offenses like pornography and pyramid scams and running competing
formatted-tree-product information delivery services.
