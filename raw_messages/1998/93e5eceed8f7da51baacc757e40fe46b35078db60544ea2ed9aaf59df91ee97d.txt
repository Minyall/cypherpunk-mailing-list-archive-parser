So I guess foreigners can't buy booze in Oregon at all.  

The new (last 10 years) passports don't have a mag stripe but do have the ICAO machine- reabable text string including a replay of the Passport info together with checksum digits.  There is also space for a National ID Number for those countries which have one but it is blank on US passports since we don't have a national ID.
