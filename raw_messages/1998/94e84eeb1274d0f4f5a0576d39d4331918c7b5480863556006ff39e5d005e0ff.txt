    If you want to use our code in non-free software, and leave your users
    (who would then be our users also) no freedom, it is understandable
    that you would ask for this.

No, I simply don't want to discriminate against users who are writing
proprietary software, i. e. I don't want to restrict the freedom of
those users in the way that GPL does.

Public Domain status denotes more freedom than GPL.  It allows all of
the freedom of GPL and in addition, it allows the freedom of making
proprietary modifications.

The results of the proprietary step may be less free than GPL, but the
code placed in the Public Domain is still more free than the code
released under the terms of the GPL.
