Employees and employers make agreements all the time. To wear funny
uniforms, to bark when the boss says bark, to write in certain languages,
and so on.

If an employee does not wish to do what an employer instructs, he or she
may leave.

Sounds fair to me.

(And most employers will value work output--profits--over lesser
considerations. So, even though a boss has every "right" to demand that
employees where dunce caps to work, for example, few will. Those who do
will lose their employees and go out of business. Sounds fair to me.)

I "allow people to starve to death" each and every day because they are not
doing something I want. Think about it. Every time I elect not to send
money to starving Bengalis or Hutus or Ugabugus I am "allowing them to
starve," quite literally.

So?

If an employer chooses not to hire certain types of persons this is really
no different from my choosing not to marry certain types of persons (and I
can imagine I could save a woman from "starving" by simply flying to Bangla
Desh, finding a starving woman, marrying her, and then supporting her. So?).

These are well-covered issues in many books on libertarianism and freedom.

Freedom means freedom. That some people will not have as much food as they
would like to have in a free society is no reason to discard freedom.

More to the point, crypto anarchy means taking such decisions about whether
to discard freedom or not out of the hands of others.
