This is still unexcusable.  It would have been just as simple to include a
hidden reset switch in a pannel somewhere that would zap all the passwords
on the router without zapping the config, and maybe send some alarms out
via SNMP incase it wasn't something that was wanted.

That would be something the client could do themselves without opening
security holes.

That doesn't mean that the ankle biters won't find them.  For example, I could
put a sniffer on the network coming into the router and call up tech support
and say "Hi" I lost my password, here's my IP address, help, help.

I can then do the same thing a week later with the same router incase the
hash is time dependant, and then later with another router with a different
serial number, and I'll have much info to get started on how your hash works.

Piece of cake.

Yep.
