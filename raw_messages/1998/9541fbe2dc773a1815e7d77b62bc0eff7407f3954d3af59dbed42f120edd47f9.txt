One way a person could generate a battery suitable for the spark gap
experiment to address the conservation of charge issues related to the
battery is to build a mechanism such as:


                2N e-          1N p+

       |                                    |
       |                                    |

                                    \
                                      \
           spark gap               switch

The two vertical plates above are not a capacitor. They simply represent
some mechanism to hold charge, Leyden Jars for example.

Now when the switch is closed 1 N of e- will combine with 1 N of p+ to form
a neutralization of charge. That will leave a net 1N of e- that will
represent a point charge of that value. That charge will be exposed at the
right contact of the spark gap above.
