I know it's a mistake to reply to this stuff but it would be nice for
someone to maintain the context. Clinton was on trial for sexual
harrassment. When giving testimony under oath he chose to lie in order to
cover his own ass. I don't much care about the private lives of politicians
but I do care how they behave in public places like courts of law. That is
what he is trouble for, not for his filandering proclivities which were
public known before he became president. Just to help the Clintonites
understand: "It's about perjury, stupid!"
