If human skin cells comprise the majority of household dust, and dust can
so easily move from place to place, then how will they defend against the
claim that the suspect passed near by (five blocks away) six months ago and
the dust must have slowly made it's way to the crime scene...

Don't answer...I know...truth is not the objective, rather conviction of
the target. Now they'll have the tools to do it. The same cop investigating
your car this month could inadvertently (or not) deposit a few traces of
your skin dust at the scene of a crime next month. They keep getting
scarier all the time!
