Ah yes, the argument against required motorcycle helmets which looks for
the increased organ
harvest for transplants.

Bogus reasoning.  You are sovereign and can do with yourself as you please.
 *That* is why substances should be legal and helmets should be optional.
Pragmatics are irrelevant.  I *do*
wear seatbelts but it should be my choice, not
something the state can use violence to enforce.

Pardon for the off-topic..
