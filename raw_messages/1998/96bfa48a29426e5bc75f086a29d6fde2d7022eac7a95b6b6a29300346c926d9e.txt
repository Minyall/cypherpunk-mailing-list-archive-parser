Just a quick update from sixdegrees(tm). Unfortunately Christopher 
Barkley (barkley@cirr.com) asked not to be listed as your 
contact with sixdegrees.

The good news is that since you have other confirmed contacts, 
you'll still be able to have a productive sixdegrees experience. 
But, if you want to continue to increase your networking power, 
you may want to head over to http://www.sixdegrees.com , log-in 
and go to MY CONTACTS and list additional contacts.
