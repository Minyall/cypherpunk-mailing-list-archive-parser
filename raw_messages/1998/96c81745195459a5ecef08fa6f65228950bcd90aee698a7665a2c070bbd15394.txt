	Tell that to the thousands forbidden to leave the nations
	which claim or claimed to own them, on the basis that they
	once had access to state secrets.

	The thankfully defunct Soviet Union regularly forbade 
	dissidents to emigrate, on the basis that at some point
	in their lives they had had access to 'sensitive' information.

	I have no doubt that similar restrictions could be put in
	place in other nations.
