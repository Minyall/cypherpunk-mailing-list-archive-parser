Latrines aren't sufficient to the task.  In a city like NYC, latrines
might solve the problem for perhaps a week (assuming that we tear up all
the roads and sidewalks --something which we cannot do in time, even if
we wanted to), but then they'll be full, and there won't be any more
places the latrines can be rotated to.

Then we're back to doing it in the open.  Less concentrated cities might
last a while longer, but not much longer.  There's no getting around it,
we *need* working sewer systems to have modern cities.  Otherwise, the
cities die.
