Polish Telecommunications [Telekomunikacja Polska, TP S.A..]

I went to Polish Telecommunications on the 21/12/1998 
[na ul. Zamenhoffa w Warszawie - on Zamenhoff St. in Warsaw] 
and inquired what was being done about the Millennium Bug. 
What I got from a medium important chief was that there was an 
article not long ago about it, the name of the journal escapes me. 
She seemed pretty angry that I even asked about it. What made 
me angry was that she didn't know what was the bloody problem. 
Total ignorance. But I guess Polish Telecommunications are 
going to get a kick out it when the year 2000 finally does arrive.

Later,
Jan Dobrucki a.k.a. jdo
