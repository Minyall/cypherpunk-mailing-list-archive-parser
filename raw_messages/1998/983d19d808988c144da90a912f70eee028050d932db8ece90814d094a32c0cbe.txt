To introduce myself, I am Karthik Balakrishnan, a senior majoring in
 Computer Information Systems. I should be graduating at the end of th

 PhD program.
 I would really appretiate your help in guiding me through this proces

 this field, the schools that you recommend, and how to go about this
 process.
