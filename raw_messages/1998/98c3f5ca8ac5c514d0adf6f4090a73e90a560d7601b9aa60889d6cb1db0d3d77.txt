I don't quite understand the logic behind this. The fact that the
program's source is available is itself a proof that there are no
backdoors. Anyone can read the source code and make sure it's OK.

However, this argument does hold against non-OSS. It can even be used to
promote Linux (and other free open-source operating systems), since
someone could distribute some win32 trojans on download.com, tucows.com
and others.
