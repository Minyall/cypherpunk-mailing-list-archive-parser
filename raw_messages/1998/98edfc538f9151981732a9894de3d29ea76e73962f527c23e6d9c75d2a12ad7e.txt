I think it would be pretty hard to distinguish the Cracker Remailer from an
Internet presence provider.  If hotmail or tripod were to be covered under
the CDA, then I would have to think Cracker would be as well.

EFGA/Cracker offers accounts, has dedicated servers, and has no editorial
control over content. At around 20,000 individual messages per week, I'd
have to say we are as good of a small online service as anyone else - even
if we only offer specialized services.  Many ISPs only have 100 or so users
and only about 1/6 of the connectivity of Cracker.
