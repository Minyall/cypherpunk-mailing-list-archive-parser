	Woo!  This sounds like an easily doable, easily managable
	mass protest.

	We start a mailing list or website (a website would be better)
	of volunteers and the newspapers they intend to place ads in.
	Major papers would hopefully get multiple copies of the ad in
	multiple sections.  All on the same day.

	But then, they often charge per word, and one gigantic string
	of nonsense might not obey any newspaper's rules.

	But I like the idea of organizing a classified add campaign,
	or such.  Blitzing the nationwide press with a large number
	of tiny notes, all one day.  Maybe instead they could all 
	contain a URL, pointing to a carefully written, agreed-upon, 
	readable and fairly exhaustive collection of info about the 
	issues at hand.  Well, maybe they shouldn't all point to
	the same machine....

	Ferget just signing petitions, dammit.  Petitions are for
	wimps.  Ask folks to participate by buying an ad.

	I mean, communication is what a lot of us here specialize
	in.  And in our protocols, we have Alice and Bob writing out
	hundreds of anonymous money orders, broadcasting public
	keys via radio from prison, and hiding love letters in 
	GIFs of farm animals.  Surely there's enough imagination 
	here to turn even a small fund into a very effective PR
	campaign.
