Joel McNamara (author Private Idaho) has updated his Cryptobook page,
which now has information on newer software.  The configuration works
much better under Windows 95 now.

Check out: http://www.eskimo.com/~joelm/cryptbk.html

I have a text file full of notes comparing different hard drive
encryption software, if anyone would like a copy.  I settled on Best
Crypt, which uses BLOWFISH (or GOST, or DES if you're insane).  So far
it works well...except I haven't found a way to have Windows' swap file
encrypted.

Have fun...
