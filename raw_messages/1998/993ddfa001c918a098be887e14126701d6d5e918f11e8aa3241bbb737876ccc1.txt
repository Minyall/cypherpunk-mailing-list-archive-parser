Fox TV is currently running a week of Really Exciting High-Speed
Police Car Chases and Really Scary Police Shootout Videos.
I doubt that the raid on Don Scott's farm is included....

On the good side, they're also running a few shows on privacy
and identity theft, though tonight's edition mainly talked about
getting of junk mail lists.  And they run The Simpsons.
On the somewhat hypocritical side, they've got a series of 
commercials about <some issue side 1> <some issue side 2> 
"Is this for the media to decide?"
"our news is really objective, just the facts, you decide",
while also running America's Most Wanted Thought Criminals
and "Cops Are Cool - Heh Heh - Heh Heh".

				Thanks!
