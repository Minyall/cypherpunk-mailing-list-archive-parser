This is not the way to compare 2 stocks. Let me illustrate this with
a numericl example.

Stock A has been trading at about $10 for the last 10 years.  Every year
it paid $5 in dividends. (OK, so why is it to fucking cheap)

Stock B has appreciated from $10 to $20 over the last 10 years.

Which has better total returns?
