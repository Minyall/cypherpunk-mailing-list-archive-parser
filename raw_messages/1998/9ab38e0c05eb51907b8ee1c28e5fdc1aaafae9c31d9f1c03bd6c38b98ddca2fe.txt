Nice to talk to you a few minutes ago.  Even in person!

Judge Santiago Campos ruled in Payne and Morales v NSA 
Minihan. http://jya.com/whpfiles.htm  
http://www.aci.net/kalliste/speccoll.htm

Morales opted to meet and open the ruling even though it is
a week end.  Usually, I NEVER open a lawyer letter on near a 
weekend or a vacation.

But we do file lawsuits on Friday.  That way we get to blast THEM
[Great Satan supporters] on the Infobahn before the court has a 
chance to seal the complaint.  

Mail Boxes Etc. charges only  $.04 per page special copy charge on 
Fridays too V $.07 on other days.  

We, unlike DOE, are mindful of containing litigation costs.

The ruling is 56 pages long!

Morales read me only the first and last pages.

	1  We DID NOT LOSE
	2  NSA did not win
	3  We are not headed for jail

I mailed a priority mail copy to you.

Without Internet NYA, J Orlin Grabbe, and some really neat journalists
the
outcome would have far different, I conjecture.

Have a good weekend everyone [http://www.wpiran.org/].  We are!

We GOT TO GET THIS HORRIBLE MESS SETTLED!

Cowabunga, Yahoo, allahu akbar, etc.
