There is a set of Kernel patches at
ftp://ftp.kerneli.org/pub/linux/kerneli/v2.1/ . Look for the patch-int files.

Note: I have not been able to get these to compile cleanly.  It may take
some work to get them to work right.  (I know of at least one typo in
devices/block/loop_gen.c that prevents it from compiling on the patch for
2.1.131.)
