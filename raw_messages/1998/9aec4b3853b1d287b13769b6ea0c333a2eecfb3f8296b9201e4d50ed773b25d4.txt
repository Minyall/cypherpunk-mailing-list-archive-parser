The 14th supersedes this somewhat; states can't violate 
federal-constitutional rights in ways that they could before it
when they had the 10th to permit them.

Some freedom of choice - if you don't like what the government forces 
on you, move.  "Democracy" means that if 50% of the people
vote for a system like that, you're stuck with it.
Now, it's certainly better than systems like serfdom or Sovietism,
where you weren't allowed to move either, and it's also better
to have non-homogeneity available nearby.
				Thanks!
