Bellsouth do that here, sort of, with GSM SIMs. 

You buy SIMs with 'pre-pay' on them and after a certain amount of air time
have to buy another one. Presumably these are regular SIMs and the expirey
is done by the network.

There should be lots of these SIMs around in theory... can anyone say STM?

Check out http://www.bellsouth.co.nz/prepay/prepay.htm for details.
