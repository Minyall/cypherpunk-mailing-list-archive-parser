The militia groups have known this was a foregone conclusion from the
gitgo. This is why they are advocating frontier justice for Horiuchi.

(However, exhaustive searches for this murderer have not turned up evidence
of him. If he's "continuing to work for the FBI," it's from a safe house,
or with a new name. Probably a safe house, as no one has reported seeing
him near Federal buildings, either.)

The guy's probably dead meat anyway.
