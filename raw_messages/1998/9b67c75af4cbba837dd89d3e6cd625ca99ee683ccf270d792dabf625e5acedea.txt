If that was an intentional pun, a good one.

But I had been marveling at how the Clinton troubles were being ignored by
the Cypherpunks...I figured we were all so jaded about government and the
criminals who flourish in Washington that there was no point in commenting
on this latest revelation of corruption. (The apparent perjury, suborning
perjury, and witness-tampering, not the affair with Lewinsky, however
tawdry it was.)

It would have been interesting to see the whole process leading up to
Clinton's resignation (next week?) pass without any discussion by us.

(Actually, I threw in an aside yesterday about "President Gore," but no one
picked up on it.)

Personally, I think having a crippled and ineffective President is better
than having an activist bozo President Gore, so I'm kind of hoping this
whole affairs takes several more months to unwind.
