Actualy a black market is usualy goods gotten through theft or other illegal
means, not necessarily anything related to how or what is sold. If you don't
corrupt free-market to include legitimizing theft as a viable market
strategy then yes, you can in fact have a black market in a free-market.

Let's consider auto-theft. The issue isn't that you can't buy the car
through legitimate means, it just means you have to have more resources than
you have. So what do you do? You find somebody whose stolen a vehicle and is
willing to sell it to you at a discount.

Too strict and unrealistic a definition of black market.

Of course not since we've now legitimized theft and murder with your
definition.
