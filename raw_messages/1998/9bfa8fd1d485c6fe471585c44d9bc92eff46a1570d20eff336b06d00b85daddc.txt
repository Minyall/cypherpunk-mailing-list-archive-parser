1.  How can I generate 2 large prime numbers?  I doubt I could create 2,
100-digit prime numbers in my head :-)

2.  Is there an implentation of DES in perl?  I didn't see a link to one
on the export-a-sig page.  If not perl, is there one for DOS?  I'm
looking for a bare bones one, not something with tons of features
and a GUI.  A perl or dos version of the unix "des" program would be
preferable.

Thanks!
