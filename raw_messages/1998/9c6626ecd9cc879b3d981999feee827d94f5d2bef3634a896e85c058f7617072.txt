Hey:  Who made up the term "Politically Correct"?  Not Christians and not
Republicans. Your side did.  How does wanting a smaller government, less
taxes, the freedom to CHOOSE to pray in schools, the rights of the un-born( of
course you probably think they have no rights- just as slave owners thought
about their slaves), and who acts like the thought police??????
