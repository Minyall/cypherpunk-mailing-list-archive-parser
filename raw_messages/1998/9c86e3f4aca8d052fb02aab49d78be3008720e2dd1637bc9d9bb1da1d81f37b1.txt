On Thu, 24 Dec 1998, Reeza! finally got to the point of the matter:

<massive snip>
:, that does not mean I'm willing to allow one
:expansionist dictator to sanction another country and gain control of
:enough of the worlds oil supply to impact the well-being of my country.

I believe this is the the only true argument here.  The US (and you) are
not "pleased" with the fact that the one place on the planet that has the
worlds largest oil deposits is not beholden to the USG.  If Hussein were
to have remained a US puppet, he could do pretty much as he damn well
pleased, anywhere he damn well pleased - just as long as OUR oil prices
didn't escalate.  

	Weren't the old days wonderful?  A time when the USG could force
countries like Iraq to sell oil at or below cost?  And isn't that the
entire point of "allowing" Iraq to sell oil at the rate of some 50 billion
dollars every six months (IIRC)?  On the one hand, we "embargo" all food
and medicines, for their own good of course, and on the other hand we are
"willing" to forego that embargo, *if it benefits us*.  

	This has ZERO to do with Kuwait or weaponry, and *everything* to
do with the US id - we want *what* we want, *when* we want it, and at the
*price* we want it, *OR ELSE*.

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
