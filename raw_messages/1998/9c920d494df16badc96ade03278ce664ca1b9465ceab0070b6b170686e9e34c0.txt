Even though there basically aren't any foreign Commies left any more,
there's always The Pope, and Zionism, and Foreign Drug Cartels, and 
foreign embassies*, and foreign-based MultiNational Corporations, 
and people with accounts in Swiss banks or Anguillan computers.  
Power isn't just for governments any more.

Anarchists distinctly don't work for foreign powers, but it's
close enough for government work.

And more importantly, if by Executive Order, the President
claims that granting the executive branch "access"
to things makes it "lawful", then nobody's safe from fiat law.
