If the person strapping those systems together writes them from scratch
and the penultimate cipher gives a flat distribution, then I agree
100%.  However, many (most?) standalone encryption programs will put a
magic number or other identification at the beginning (e.g. encrypted
PKZIP) or will do a sanity check that actually tells you whether you've
decrypted with the right key, whether you see garbage or not (e.g.
EAY's stand-alone 'idea', 'des', etc.).  PGP also has distinctive headers,
I think.

In the world of existing cipher packages it's usually possible to tell what
you've got.  Assume Kerckhoff's principle, of course: the attacker knows
which packages you're using and which order you're doing them in.
