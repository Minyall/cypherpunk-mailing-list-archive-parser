You can also push atoms around with an AFM.  It's just slow.  But even if
it did take a week or two to make something, it would still be practical.
You'd probably have to wait a week to get something delivered by
mail-order, so you might as well make it yourself.

I wonder what Tim 'copyright is dead' May will think when anyone can make
a Pentium clone in their back bedroom. :)
