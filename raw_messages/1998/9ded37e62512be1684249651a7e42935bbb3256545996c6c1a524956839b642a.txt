Some cars now use a smart-key that is unique for each vehicle, though I'm
sure there are 'master keys'.

What a cool way to do rental cars.... insert your smart-card and it
activates and charges your account until reset by the rental agency on
return to a distributed system of drop-off points.

I noticed the other day we now have a washateria down on Guadalupe in the
old Antone's Club building that operates only by smart-card, no cash sign
right on the front door. There's a perfect application for something like
GNU/cash with a crypto/e$ module.
