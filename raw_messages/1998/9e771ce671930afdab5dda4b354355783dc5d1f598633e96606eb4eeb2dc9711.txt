	I work for a company who displays much of their work on the 
Web, and we are often sited by Digimarc as a "customer". 

	We (AFAICT) stoped bothering with their product (probably an older
version) simply because it didn't work. 

	I can take any image where the watermark IS NOT visible, and 
make it so that your scanning software doesn't work, yet most people wouldn't
notice a bloody thing. 

	Suckerware.
