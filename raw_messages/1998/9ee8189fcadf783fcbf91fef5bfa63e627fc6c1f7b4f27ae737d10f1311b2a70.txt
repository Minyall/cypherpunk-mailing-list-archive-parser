In truth, I mistyped. Tim not only was talking about the frequency (and I
gather, the danger) of the conferences, he was responding to the ACM one,
not the WW one. 

Now, who attends these things?

1. Journalists
2. Government bureaucrats happy to have a day off from work, who want to
position themselves as "Net-savvy"
3. Lobbyists who bill it to clients
4. Think tank people who hope someone reads their papers

The Naderite "Appraising Microsoft" conference seemed to be populated
mainly by journalists, at some points.

These conferences can be dangerous. If the best thing for the Net is for
DC to leave it alone, that principle leaves no space for Washington
lobbyists who bill by the hour (and through the nose) for their expertise:
pressuring various portions of the government. This is why lobbyists,
including so-called "Net-lobbyists" are not what the Net, and freedom,
need.
