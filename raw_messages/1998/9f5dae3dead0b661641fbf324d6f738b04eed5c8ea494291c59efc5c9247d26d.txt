I was under the impression that 40-bit RC4 was accomplished by revealing 88
bits of the 128-bit key in a header. If a new 56-bit-RC4 browser was
implimented by setting16 of those 88 bits to zero, would any existing
server know the difference? If not, you would get an immediate improvement
in security, at least for browser to server messages, without waiting for
the servers to be upgraded.

No doubt I am missing something, but what?
