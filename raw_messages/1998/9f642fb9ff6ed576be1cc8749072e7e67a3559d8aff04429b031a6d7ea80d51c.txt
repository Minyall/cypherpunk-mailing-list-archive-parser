Perfectly acceptable to me personally. Please show how it will result in proving that Iraq does not, and will not in the near or forseeable future possess weapons of mass destruction that may be utilized against neighbors, foreign or domestic. Or how it will result in turning the public opinion, iraqi and/or american, touted by the biased US press in such a fashion that it would result in a munificent display of openness, agreeablility, and welcoming to the UN inspectors by the iraqi hosts. Or show how Hussein is now trustworthy, and thereby qualified by the MIB office of the USG to possess said weapons.

You FOOL. 
You deserve to be subjugated. 
Don't expect me to willingly go with you. 
Don't try to take me with you,,, you will bleed.

Terrorist threats are increasingly used to justify invasions of privacy, meanwhile real threats to Freedom and Primacy are neglected because all the Doves endlessly recite the litany of fatalism: The Evil Russian Empire Is Dead, Eradicate Our Own Military. 

In the face of a dovish regime, anything that will work is used to justify expenditure for the military. GET IT RIGHT.

The installed power base seeks to stabilize and solidify its possession of the reins of authority. MUSH,,, MUSH,,,, MUSH,,, I SAID MUSH,,,, <CRACCKKK>

EAT MY MILITARY FUCKING SHORTS YOU PUSSY FUCKWAD FAGGOT SON-OF-A-BITCH. The powers of the military are being abused by CIVILIANS who cannot fathom the true purpose of the military, think the military doesn't earn its pay. I have something for YOU to earn, you ewe you.

OH YEAH, OH YEAH, THAT is why we dropped leaflets advocating the iraqis do everything in their power to maintain their present, totalitarian regime. GET A FUCKING CLUE YOU GREASY STAIN ON THIS MAILING LIST.

Like the good doctor in nevada who appeared on national tv TWO WHOLE FUCKING DAYS BEFORE the feds ransacked his lab, only to have their entire "just cause" falter and be riddled with inexcusable and inexplicable faults, to ultimately be thrown out for lack of evidence? 

If ANTHRAX recipes are so easily obtainable, if it is so easy to make, so easy to disseminate, and public knowledge to boot, POST IT HERE, POST IT HERE. 

24 hour time limit, IF IT IS EASY, You shouldn't have any trouble making the deadline now should you? And none of that "I don't want to give away inappropriate information" pussy shit. It is wholly relevant, not inappropriate, and will MAKE ME APOLOGIZE TO YOU AND THE LIST. 

DO IT. DO IT. DO IT, 


you make me want to vomit.

shut the fuck up and go the fuck away.

Don't try to do any good deeds for me, you Do Gooder Piece Of Shit.
