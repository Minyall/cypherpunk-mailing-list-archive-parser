Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy must create it for
themselves and not expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless
organizations to grant them privacy out of beneficence.  Cypherpunks know that
people have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers,
envelopes, closed doors, and couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek to prevent
other people from speaking about their experiences or their opinions. >>

I agree with all that.

But when it's used as simply a means of identifying yourself on a public list,
is that really privacy protection?  Seems like a mis-use of the technology to
me.
