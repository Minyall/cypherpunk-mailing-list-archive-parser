 The idea of a 'cellular remailer' will run afoul of the fact that the
FCC has control of the spectrum allocations. Unlike an Internet remailer
where the FCC has little say, it is not likely that they would permit a
commercial enterprise that would be able to be setup and run in that
manner. I don't even mention 'non-commercial' as that spectrum is so
valuable there is no way it would ever be turned over to
'amateur/citizen' use ... it will either be setup according to the
FCC/FBI dictates or it won't exist.
