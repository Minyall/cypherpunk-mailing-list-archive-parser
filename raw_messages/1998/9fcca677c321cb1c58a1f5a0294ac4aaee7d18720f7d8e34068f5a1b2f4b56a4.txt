There's a transcript of today's White House press conference on
the new US encryption policy at:

   http://jya.com/vp091698.htm

VP Gore, Justice, FBI, DoD, NSA, CIA, BXA and cooperating
industry were there explaining the way it's supposed to satisfy
all interests of the agencies and a few good businesses if not 
the citizenry. 

Domestic crypto restrictions? Well, take a look at how that was 
punted. And what the FBI is setting up to see that law enforcement 
needs are met, and what DoD is planning for surveilling the globe, 
strong crypto or not.

Not a word about backdoors, TA, DIRT, keyboard snooping, covert 
chip features, compromising emanations, national technical means,
just assurances that the plan satisfies the interests of the protectors.
