This is a GREAT! idea John.

If you don't object, and since Austin Cypherpunks are dead dead dead, I
believe I'll start something similar.

I think the approach I'll use is a bit different in that I'm going to ask
participants to read say the first chapter and get together over some period
and actualy write a program (probably in Perl) that impliments the topic(s)
under discussion. If it were to meet say every other week for two hours they
should be able to go through a chapter every couple of months or so.

Now I've got to find a place suitable....:)
