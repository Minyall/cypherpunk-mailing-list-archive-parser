The names of perfumes are (generally copyrighted.  The perfumes
(fragrances) themselves are not.  This leaves the door open for
knock-offs of the scent that then market under their own names -- and in
some cases, claims of being just like "whoever".

The situation is not parallel to sw because noone but a linux freak
hopes to swep anyone off their feet by putting a ribbon around a tiny
bit of sw and giving it for a BDay or VDay or whatever, astheydo with
the top name parfums.
