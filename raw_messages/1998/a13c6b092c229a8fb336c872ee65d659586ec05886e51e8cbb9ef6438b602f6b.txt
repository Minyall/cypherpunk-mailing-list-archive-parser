A cloud of linear purity began to move over the 
sand-monster, billowing with precipitory anticipation.

Small blood puzzles aligned themselves like 
melanomas, forming patterns of infinite finality.

The puzzle-monsters coalesced as lasers, carving
lesions from flesh and riddling the brittle skin
with xray cracks.

Soon it would be as it before, finally.
