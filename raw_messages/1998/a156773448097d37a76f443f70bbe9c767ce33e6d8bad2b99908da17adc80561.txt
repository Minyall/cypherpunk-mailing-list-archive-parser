What Lucky said.

"Room for," certainly. "Economic incentive for," apparently not.

Look, if you can wave a magic want and give us "massively distributed data
havens on oil rigs, barges,....," I'll be the first to cheer.

But the factors I described, and Lucky described, are why it would be a

numbers you are contemplating.

Wishing won't make it so.
