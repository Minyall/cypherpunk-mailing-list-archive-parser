NYT's John  Markoff reports today on a suit to be filed 
today by the cellular phone industry against CALEA regs 
on wiretapping -- alleging improper FBI guidelines under
the legislation. A lead on getting a copy of the filing would 
be appreciated; U.S. District Court in Washington DC is
the venue.
