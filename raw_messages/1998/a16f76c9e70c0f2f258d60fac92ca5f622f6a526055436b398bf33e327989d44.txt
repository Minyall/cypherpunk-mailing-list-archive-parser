It was not originated as an acronym, though some have labored to find the
words to make it one, sort of. Best to treat it as not being an acronym.

It's a set of specs and testing methods for measuring and controlling RF
emissions by computers and other electronic equipment. Shielding with metal
enclosures, with filters on inputs and outputs, and so on.

The full TEMPEST specs are more or less classified, as might be expected.
(Because one does not lightly tell one's enemies what one is measuring for.)

Contrary to popular rumor, it is not "illegal" to shield computers, to "use
TEMPEST methods," as it were.
