I dunno.

But I've begun netcopping the Ignition-Point list on
an ongoing basis (starting Friday), and they'll be
an interesting test case of whether what they're
doing is "fair use".

Pobox.com/listbox.com is reluctantly assigning a person
to receive (my) copyright complaints, and will register
themselves with the FCO.

I like to post whole articles myself.

Anyway, for a test case, better them than me.
