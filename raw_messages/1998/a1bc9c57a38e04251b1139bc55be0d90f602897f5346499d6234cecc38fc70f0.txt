Mentioned: the EFF DES crack, PGP, offshore products,

Eligible Receiver, the difficulty of DoD meshing its legacy
decrepit systems with cutting edge warfighting technology, 
concern about foreign Y2K, the need to slaughter when no 
one volunteers to help.

DoD boosts strong encryption as the primary means to
protect mil and com info but insists on "balancing"
the needs of privacy and law enforcement. Questioners
bluntly challenged equating the two.
