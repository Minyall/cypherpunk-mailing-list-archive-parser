yes, agree.  In other words we need freedom for business to compete in
provision of all services currently monopolised by government.

But also you need multiple providers of services, otherwise your
freedom of choice is limited.

If you can opt out of literally any goverment service, I suspect
government revenues would nearly disappear.  Everything they "supply"
can be supplied more cheaply by business.  So what government remained
would have to compete on a fair basis with private industry.

I think the state should have no authority to collect anything.
Charity at the point of a gun is not charity.  The state is an
extremely inefficient distributor of charitable funds anyway.
