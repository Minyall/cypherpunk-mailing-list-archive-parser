Some US ISP's were seized in a cyberporn bust.

All three worth reading. This could be a big story. The theory against
the ISPs (not that they've been charged with a crime) is that they
knowingly carried the newsgroups:

alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.pre-teen
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.early-teen

This has broader application -- alt.binaries.warez.*,
alt.binaries.sounds.mp3, etc.

Is any ISP which carries suspect newsgroups at risk of having 
its equiptment seized, and who draws up the blacklist of 
newsgroups?

Or worse, is there no public blacklist at all -- just the
hovering fear of an up-for-reelection AG swooping down. And when
do naughty pictures start showing up in alt.fan.disney? And
what's the AG's move then?
