On the contrary, it is the server end that is hard.

Token generation is trivial.  Paying for tokens and getting
paid for them is not trivial.

The problem is that we do not want to force everyone in the
universe to be the clients of a single giant issuer.  That
would bring us right back to the old problem of the
tyrannical and oppressive central bank.

Visualize the following situation.  I buy tokens from Bob,
who may be my local ISP.   I spend them on a server on a site
in Sri Lanka.  The owner of the server cashes them with
Evonne.  My money, aggregated with a multitude of other
peoples money in a multitude of other peoples transactions
flows by some complex and indirect route to through several
different people, and eventually to Evonne, and finally to
the owner of the server in Sri Lanka.

This is the problem that IBM software, for all its faults,
does address, and it is a hard problem.
