Never understimate the power of blind chauvinistic patriotism. Killing Japs
was the honorable thing to do, even for Injuns.

"All crypto is economics." One doesn't have to jump to theoretical mumbo
jumbo about a putative "identical fundamental syntax" to know that the
Navajo code talkers were not using an unbreakable system.

But what mattered is that, for the level of security needed on the
battlefield, the system was "essentially secure" against Japanese
translation. Sure, in time the Japanese could have found some experts on
Navajo, could have trained their own code talker translators, etc. But they
didn't have this time. (And if we posit "enough time," then the U.S.
military would have had enough time to drop the Navajo code talkers and
replace them with Ebonics code talkers. Dat be da jive, mo fo.)
