Making proprietary changes to GPLed software for your own use seems
to be fine with the GPL.  The problem occurs if you are giving away
changed versions of software: While GPL will force you to give your
distributed software's users the same freedom you enjoyed yourself
when creating the software, PD won't preserve that freedom.

Thus, GPL is the license model which most consequently follows the
freedom for end users thread of thinking.
