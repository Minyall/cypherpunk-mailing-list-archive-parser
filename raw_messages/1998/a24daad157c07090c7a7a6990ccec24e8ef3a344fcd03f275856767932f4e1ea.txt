I'm watching Headline News, and they are reporting
that "now", under new provisions in the Brady Bill,
and 'instant' background check is being made. This
even is for simple rifles and shotguns.

Just think, soon there might be 'instant' background
checks, even just to use simple 56 bit DES. Or somewhere
lurking around in your browser code, a teeny tiny program
that sends a cookie to the NSA, FBI, etc every time you
use crypto. Who knows, it's probably there already.

Or a realtime NCIS check to buy a copy of PGP! Wild!
