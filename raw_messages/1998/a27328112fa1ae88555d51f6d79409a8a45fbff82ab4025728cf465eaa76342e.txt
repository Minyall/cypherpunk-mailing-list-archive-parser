Regarding the tracking of mobile phones, are all current types of phones
susceptible?

There was a recent post here regarding tracking of GSM phones.
TDMA/CDMA, analog/digital, PCS-band, etc, are they all equally capable
of being tracked?

However pagers are not, correct? They just broadcast an entire area to
page instead of the pager keeping the network informed of their
location.

One thing I have long wondered: Why don't they make phones that
"wake-up" by a paging signal and then accept the call? It might increase
the connect time significantly, but it would also increase the potential
stand-by time indefinitely, and the location of the user is only exposed
when calls are in progress, not while the phone is on stand-by.

Are there any paging services (particularly alpha paging) that work on a
global scale? You would think daily pager rental service (esp. at
airports) would be popular. You could have an email address, even a
static phone number, that could re-route messages to any pager that you
happen to have at the time (PSTN-IP-PSTN, or even easier if the pager
service gives SMTP addresses, which most do these days).

Similarly a PSTN-IP-PSTN interface for voice could give you a static
phone number that you could dynamically forward anywhere untraceably.

BTW, why are most businesses so hostile to pseudonyms? I go to rent a
mailbox, paid 1 yr. in advance with cash, and they still want two pieces
of photo ID to copy.
