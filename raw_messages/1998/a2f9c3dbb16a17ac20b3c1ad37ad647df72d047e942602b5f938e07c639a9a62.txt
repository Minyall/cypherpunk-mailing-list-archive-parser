Chief cleans house after half the Department makes fun of him via email on
Patrol Car Computer Terminals (PDC's)... 
(Plus it's a rally cool website - listen to police scanners while you read
FBI FOIA files on people like Frank Sinatra).

OAKLAND, N.J. (APB) -- Half of this small borough's police force may be
suspended for allegedly using computer terminals in their patrol cars to
send one another disrespectful comments about the chief and the borough.
