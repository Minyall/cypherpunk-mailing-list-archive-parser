Because the thermodynamics assume a *closed* model. The base assumption of
your model is that it is closed. This means that not only the mirror, and
the two focii are in the system, but also the light source. When taken as a
whole the entropy is constant. Now if you allow the light to pass through
the mirror from outside an initial axiomatic assumption, a closed system, 
is broken.

This is the reason that thermodynamic arguments against evolution fail, the
Earth is most certainly *not* a closed system.
