Well, how do you plan on ftping it, if you use a PCMCIA modem car and a  
cellular phone and the cell it transmits to is in the US it could be 
argued that you exported crypto because the data went 
mexico->USA->elsewhere, however, using a normal land-line would be 
totally legal, having said that the program would have to be written 
outside the US, not just carried out on a laptop then ftp`d as otherwise 
you`ve exported. Overall I would recomment flouting the export laws, as 
jumping through hoops to obey these regulations merely panders to the 
wishes of the authorities, anyway, how likely do you think you are to get 
caught?
