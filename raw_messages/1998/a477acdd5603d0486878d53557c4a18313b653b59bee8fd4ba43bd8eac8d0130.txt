I have never looked at the WebTV set-up but I am assuming they are running
a series of proxy servers which then provide content for the WebTV boxes?
Or are they providing an AOL type of thing, with their own proprietary
network and gateways to the real world?

Exactly what is getting encrypted and what is not in this system? If this
is just point to point encryption between the WebTV box & the WebTV
hub/proxy/whatever it seems rather worthless IMNSHO.
