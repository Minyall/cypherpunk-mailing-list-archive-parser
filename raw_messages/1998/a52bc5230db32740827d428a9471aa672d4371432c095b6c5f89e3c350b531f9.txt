Hey guys,

I wasn't suggesting that they do record exactly where everyone is
at the highest resolution possible.

Just suggesting that should they want to investigate an individual,
they could do it with pretty high detail.

Though I'm sure they'd record when and where you switch your
phone on, switch off / loose signal, switch cells and make and
receive calls and messages. That wouldn't be all that much data.

Bye for now.
