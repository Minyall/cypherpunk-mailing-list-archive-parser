I expect how one responds will in part depend on how rational you think "they"
are, or suppose them to be.   I know that if I had been just subpoenaed with a
piece of paper I would have said 'no' or just not shown up, in spite of the
trouble that might get me into.   But I generally wouldn't prevent from talking
to Authorized Government Officials, although only a very little.   I think it's
best to try to understand the situation first, and see what the deal is, before
jumping to conclusions and alarming them into attack mode, like Hyper-Anon
mentioned (I hadn't envisioned such a scenario, thanks for the notice (how do
you know about this, or are you just imagining that that's what will happen?) ).

I did say that everyone should think about their own responses to trying
situations, because it is a valuable mental exercise.   Some people's bark *is*
louder than their bite, after all, and they do bark pretty loudly in email,
especially anonymously.
