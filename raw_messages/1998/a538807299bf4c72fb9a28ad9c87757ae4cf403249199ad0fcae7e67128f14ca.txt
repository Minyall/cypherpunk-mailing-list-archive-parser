Could this process not be simplified by Netscape (hint Tom) having a
non-exportable version of the source including all crypto code.

Then an interested third party may print it on paper and snail it out
of the US, or simply make use of a remailer; either way once it is
outside the US we have legal full strength netscape.

Another area which could use some attention is that the netscape
distribution license seems to result in large european ftp sites
carrying only the 40 bit version.  Anything that would free up the
license might encourage more sites to carry the 128 bit versions.
(Such as carried by replay.com and others).
