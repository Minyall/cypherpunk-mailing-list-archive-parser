Yeah.  Credit-card verification terminals and similar devices are typically
locked into some low speed, 300 baud or 1200 or rarely 2400,
because they don't have many characters to send in a standard transaction,
and the slow speeds have a much faster setup/training time, especially
when they don't have to adaptively negotiate a connection speed.
				Thanks!
