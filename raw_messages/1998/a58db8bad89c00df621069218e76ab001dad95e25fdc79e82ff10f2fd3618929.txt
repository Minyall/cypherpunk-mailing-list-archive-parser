This may or may not be of interest...

Spy v.s. Spy action figures are now available!  There is a black spy and a
white spy (sorry, no grey spy).  Each comes with lots of gadgets (knives,
blackjacks, saws and a bomb).  Each spy has "bomb throwing action".

They are distributed through comic shops at the moment.  They sold out
pretty quick where I got mine, so you will not want to wait if you want one.
