Cypherpunks have discussed this intensely;
ask AltaVista where to find "nymserver"s and
"encrypted reply block"s.

The Anonymous Remailer List claims to be at
http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~raph/remailer-list.html
(though it might be on publius.net these days), and has some
pointers to starting places.

Private Idaho is a convenient user-interface tool for crypto
and remailers, and really simplified setting up and using some
of the early servers.

Another approach is to create a PGP key for your nym
(or a Crypto Kong key), always sign your postings,
and use anonymous remailers for sending mail,
and either read replies on the cypherpunks list
or on some broadcast medium like alt.anonymous.messages.
				Thanks!
