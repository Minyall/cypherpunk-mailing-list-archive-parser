Starr did an Impeachment Referral with the stuff he had incontrovertible
proof of.  Proof is very difficult when dealing with someone like Clinton
and you don't want to do a Referral with insufficient proof.  Notice that
even with proof of multiple felonies the Clintonistas say that they aren't
important felonies.

The Special Counsel was appointed at the request of the President after 6
Democrat Senators called for it.  Republicans don't like Clinton but they
don't have to.

He's just behaving in the way the Democrats designed the OIC to behave.  A
prosecutor on speed with no boss and no budget.  That was their intent.  US
Attorneys or local DAs would behave the same way if they had the cash.  Law
& Order Liberals like Clinton can hardly complain.  Better him than some
18-year-old drug lookout sentenced to 40 years or some accident-free drunk
driver sentenced to life (Texas recently).

Like Clinton, right?  I certainly like to see the damage to the Presidency.
 We also don't have to worry about any tobacco legislation for a few years.
