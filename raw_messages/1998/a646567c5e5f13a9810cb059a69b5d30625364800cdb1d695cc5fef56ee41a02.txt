ok, fair enough..to actually regulate the internet would require a
"coming-together" of sorts by the major countries in the world..have
they been able to accomplish this as of yet? no..now, granted, there
could be possible laws, rules, etc made that would enforce (somehwat)
this policy in differnet parts of the world..but..eventually, there's
going to be some "stepping on toes" of one nation on another..or one
region on another..or whatever..it just won't "jive".

But, provided they did manage to pull a universal proposition off that
everyone could agree on..do you honestly believe the people that
actually know how to conrol/manipulate these sytems would allow it?
there're a lot more people that have the technical savvy that would
oppose that, than there are that would defend it..if you ask me..
