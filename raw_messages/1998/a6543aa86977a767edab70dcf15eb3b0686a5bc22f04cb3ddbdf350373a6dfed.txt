Subject: ACM conference on computer-related policy (DC, 5/98)

[The best policy for the Net is probably no policy, or at most a hands-off
one. We don't have national "policies" for how we should regulate, for
example, newspapers or bookstores, and we don't need such policies for the
Net. On universal service, we already have Internet connections that are
cheaper than cable TV; on copyright, the safest course is to let federal
courts decide; on crypto, most agree that the current "policy" is
misguided at best. --Declan]

    ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTING (ACM) ANNUAL CONFERENCE

                * * *  POLICY98  * * *
         "Shaping Policy in the Information Age"

            Washington, DC, Renaissance Hotel
                    May 10-12, 1998

                  Preliminary Notice

      For Conference and Registration information see:
         http://www.acm.org/usacm/events/policy98/

The ACM Annual Conference will focus on public policy issues
affecting future applications of computing.  Our goal is to
forge stronger links between computing professionals and policy
makers.  Attendees will interact with prominent leaders from
academia, industry, Congress, and Executive agencies, and
participate in debates on policy issues including Universal
Access, Electronic Commerce, Intellectual Property, and
Education Online.

The conference will promote more regular engagement of computing
professionals in democratic processes related to productive use
of computing and information processing innovations.  A blend of
technical skills and policy insights are essential to cope with
the inherent opportunities and dangers of any transformational
technology.  Continuing collaborations between computing
professionals and policy makers will benefit citizens, consumers,
entrepreneurs, researchers, and students.  You can make a difference!

May 10: Ethical and social impacts papers and panels
May 11-12: Public policy panels and featured speakers

All Policy98 attendees are invited to the Annual ACM Awards Banquet
on Sunday evening May 10th, and a conference reception on Monday
evening May 11th.

Universal Service: Ollie Smoot
What can be done to promote widespread access to the benefits of
the Internet? What is the role of government and the role of the
private sector in wiring schools, libraries, and medical facilities?

Electronic Commerce: Jim Horning
How much public policy does EComm need?  What problems would
inadequate, excessive, or misguided policies cause?  Can compromises
in areas like fair trade practices, fraud prevention, security, privacy,
law enforcement, and taxation advance the interests of all stakeholders?

Intellectual Property in Cyberspace: Pam Samuelson
What will be the impact of the WIPO agreements on copyright in
cyberspace? How should intellectual property be protected  and what
safeguards are necessary to protect libraries and academic institutions?

Education Online: Charles N. Brownstein
The Internet offers unparalleled opportunities for learning and teaching.
What public policy and technical challenges must be met to realize
these prospects?
