I think the paper letter/envelope analogy is perfectly adequate, and easily
understandable. The difficulty will be with the additional layer that must
be completed. If one of my sisters is representative of anything, it _will_
be a long, hard uphill climb.

A plugin for the gui interface that defaults to encryption for recognized
e-addy's would simplify, and enhance this effort.
