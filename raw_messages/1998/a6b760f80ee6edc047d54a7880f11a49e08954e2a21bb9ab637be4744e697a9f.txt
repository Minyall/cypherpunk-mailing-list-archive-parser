We are meeting with Microsoft tomorrow (1/29, 10am EST) to discuss the
problems in and needed enhancements for Internet Explorer 4.x.  If
anyone would care to pass along their comments, I would welcome them.
Note that I would prefer serious comments, although any that are both
sufficiently humorous and not too defamatory towards Microsoft might
also be passed along.  (We currently have lists of 73 bugs and 27
enhancement requests...)
