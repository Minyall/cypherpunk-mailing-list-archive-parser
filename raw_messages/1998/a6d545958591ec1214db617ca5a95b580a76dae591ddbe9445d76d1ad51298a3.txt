Insurance regulatory agencies who monitor the behavior, investigation by a
reasonably impartial fire dept after every fire. That's at least two.

What police and security forces? You mean the ones the same insurance
company co-oped?

What makes you thing that Company A or B will even advertise their actions?

like anyone is going to ask their permission.

And I'm the 'fucking idiot'.
