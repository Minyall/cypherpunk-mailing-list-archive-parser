Check out <http://www.cyberpass.net/~winsock/>, for a remailer that will
run on any winsock compatible connection.  I think there is a ftp site in
europe.  I can't remember if it runs on NT, so check out the site.

Unfortunatly it's going to have to run on an NT 4.0 box, so the winsock
remailer is out of the question, right? And I'm not in the US, so I can't
use the juno stuff -- so what (if anything) *can* I use?
