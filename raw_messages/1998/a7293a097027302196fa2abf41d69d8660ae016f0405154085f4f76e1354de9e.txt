Interesting that David Friedman kept using language like:

"Some of my ideas...."

"I have developed this set of ideas..."


And yet this constellation of ideas, except for his discourse on digital
watermarking of intellectual property, is what I laid out beginning in
1988, and in thousands of essays here on this list. And in other fora.
