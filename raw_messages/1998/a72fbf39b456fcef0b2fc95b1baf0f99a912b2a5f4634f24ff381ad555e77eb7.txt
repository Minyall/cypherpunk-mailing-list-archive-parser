What's the difference between compression and encryption?


Correct me if I'm wrong,  in compression we lose something, like in 
image compression and audio compression,  but in encryption, we don't. 

One sure protection againts evil hackers is encryption (?), but what if 
that evil hacker deletes the ciphertext file and the plain text file (that
is assuming the evil hacker just deletes every file he wants to delete).
---at least he/she didn't read/saw the file.
