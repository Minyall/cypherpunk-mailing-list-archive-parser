Where are you from?
Bum-fuck nowhere to you and bum-fuck nowhere to me are two different places.

A letter costs 32 cents (presently) whether you send it across town, or
across the country.
This knife cuts both ways. Once the precedent is set, other industries
would quickly join in.
How long would it take, do you think, until some whizbang at the electric
company decides 'lectric usage rates should be determined on distance from
the 'lectric generating plant?
