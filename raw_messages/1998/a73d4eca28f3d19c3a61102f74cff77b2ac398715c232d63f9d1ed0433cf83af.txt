Well the way I see it the author of ICKill told the company that puts out
ICQ that you have this problem and you need to fix it..  The way he's
looking at it is fix this because it's a problem.  They did not fix it
after his requests to have them fix this so he shared it.  I don't think
he did anything wrong in this case.  Any way like the FBI could figure out
how to use it I don't give them that much credit as it is.
