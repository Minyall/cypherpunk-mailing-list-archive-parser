This does sound like a fun way to protest.  I'd be willing to donate 
a little cash if people would send me copies of the papers that it
gets 
put in.  Heh.. it would be good for a laugh to visit an airport on
that 
day just to see all the people taking news papers with them on 
international flights :)

Anyone want to take a stab at a date?
