	RSA in 3 or RSA in 5?  Is there a new version?

	Now, all *real* Nettites know that the original 
	shirts were by Joel Furr, are no longer for sale, 
	and have an X-ed out Bill of Rights (or excerpts
	thereof) on the back, rather than any of this ITAR
	stuff.  And!!  It glows in the dark.  Rock rock.
