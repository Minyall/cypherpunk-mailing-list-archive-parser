I will, in the next few days, see if there is a way I can get money
this fast. I have a margin of credit at LL, so I could use that with
my investements as collateral and reimbursement.

I need to get myself sane and physically well, and this is not totally
trivial.

My boss, besides, is in his usual pre-bitching mood. So I need to
watch out.
