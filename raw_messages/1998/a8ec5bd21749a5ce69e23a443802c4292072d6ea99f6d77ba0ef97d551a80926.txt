If some of y'all out there would go ahead and post some of your
reasons for "striking," I'll be more than happy to air it on my
web page.  Try to post these to the list [ATTN: Sheriff] by
the 12th, or the 13th at the latest.  All such posts will be
slapped up on my web page, at the URL mentioned in my sig.  Cheers.

Love, luck, and marijuana lollipops,
The Sheriff. -- ***<REPLY TO: sheriff@speakeasy.org>***
