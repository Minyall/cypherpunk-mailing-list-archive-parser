Thanks to JM's pointers we offer three related May 1998 
USAF docs on emissions security:

AFI 33-203 - Emissisions Security

   http://jya.com/afi33-203.htm  (61K)

AFSSI 7010 - Emission Security Assessments

   http://jya.com/afssi-7010.htm  (110K)

AFSSM 7011 - Emission Security Countermeasures Reviews

   http://jya.com/afssm-7011.htm  (515K)

Or, a zipped package of the three:

While there's a fair amount in the last two docs about  
security for classified NONSTOP and HIJACK systems,
we'd welcome more detail to fill in the deleted parts.
