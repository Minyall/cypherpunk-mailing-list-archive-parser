*STOP* sending such *RATSHIT* to this mailing list
you unforgivable dickheaded *SACK OF SHIT*
Keep your fucking .EXE files to yourself.
*SMASH YOURSELF* on the head with your nice little
m$-windoze manuals. At least that would knock you
unconscious and you won't be bothering us with
your *BLATHERING CRAP*. *WE DO NOT WANT WINDOZE CRAP* on this list, you *RABIDDOGWHOREMONGER* can you get that through that *FUCKIN THICK* skull of yours?
