I remember Harald Fragner from a lot of forums on
the Swedish Fidonet back in around 1991-1992. He was
a trusted technophile who had an answer to every single
IMB-PC related question (and most of his answers seemed
accurate).

A search has him now working for IDG Sweden, a publisher of
computer magazines, as head of it's computer department.

I'm sure that Harald could take anybody off any list but it's
questionable if he has the time, or feels like it. :-)
