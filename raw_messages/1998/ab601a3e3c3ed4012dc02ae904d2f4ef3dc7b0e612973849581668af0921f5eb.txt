Any trendy new diagnosis always gets some recruits...dyslexia, ADD (*), the
abuse excuse, etc.

(* Like any trendy thing, it gets renamed to keep its panache. ADD has been
renamed to something with four letters, which I now forget (must be ADD).)

We've had some nutballs and losers (luser spelling: loosers) on this list.
People who claim the reason they can't make a coherent argument or hold a
steady job is because of something some psychobabbler told them was their
excuse.

So what else is nu beside e over h?
