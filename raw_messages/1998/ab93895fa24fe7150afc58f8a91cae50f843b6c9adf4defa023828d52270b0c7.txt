Good day list.

I was just in the process of mailing off a copy of the GNU
junk email contract to some sammer or another, and it occured to
me;

It would certainly be nice to collect that 10buks a hit for this
crap,

It will never happen,

Seems alot the spam I recieve originates with a node from uu.net and I am
no big
fan of Ubermesiter John Sidgmore,

Wouldn't it be nice to hold uu.net culpable for all their spamming ways. They
want to own the internet, let them hang for it.

Just a thought, anyone intested in doing a class action to recover
email processing fees?

luv
chipper
