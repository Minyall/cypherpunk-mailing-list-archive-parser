Setting policy on national security risk for the entire USG, 
the DoD proclaims a trustworthy person does not engage in 
the following:

Sec. 147.14  Guideline L--Outside activities.

    (a) The concern. Involvement in certain types of outside employment
or activities is of security concern if it poses a conflict with an
individual's security responsibilities and could create an increased risk of
unauthorized disclosure of classified information.
    (b) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be
disqualifying include any service, whether compensated, volunteer, or
employment with: 
    (1) A foreign country;
    (2) Any foreign national;
    (3) A representative of any foreign interest;
    (4) Any foreign, domestic, or international organization or person
engaged in analysis, discussion, or publication of material on
intelligence, defense, foreign affairs, or protected technology.
