It would be fitting for this list to be distinguished as
the place where crypto-in-a-crime was first committed.

What might that be? A match of the crime committed
to prevent widespread strong crypto?

Crypto-criminal anonymity in the national interest (governmental
secrecy) fighting to prevent crypto-criminal anonymity in the 
public interest (private secrecy).

This is not a troll, but query on what could be done to to tip the 
hand and identify those unnamed who are most fearful of strong 
cryptography, not their public rougers in the 3 divs of gov.
