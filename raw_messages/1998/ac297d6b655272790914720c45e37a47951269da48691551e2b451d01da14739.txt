I remember seeing on one of those science specials on The learning channel
(or mabye the Discovery channel) that a professor did figure out
(accidentally) how to send information faster than light.  The only thing I
remember about it was the the signal was some kind of music.

I remember now, it was a special on time travel on a month ago.  Anybody
catch it?
