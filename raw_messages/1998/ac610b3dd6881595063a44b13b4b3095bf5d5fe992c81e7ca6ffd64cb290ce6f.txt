The Department of Defense has published today three 
interim final rules on protection of classified information
(apparently issued confidentially months ago):

32 CFR Part 147, Personnel Security Policies for Granting 
Access to Classified Information

32 CFR Part 148, National Policy on Reciprocity of Facilities 
and Guidelines for Implementation of Reciprocity

32 CFR Part 149, National Policy on Technical Surveillance 
Countermeasures
