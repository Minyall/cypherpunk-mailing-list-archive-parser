It's not the raw volume that's critical but rather the percentage of the
average personal space per inhabitant versus how much to store a weeks
worth. For the average person storing a weeks worth of solid waste in a
platic bag with bleach, lye, or similar material is reasonable.

I've gone on long duration camping trips of about a weeks length and the
storing and portage costs are not excessive (having a boat or horse helps
move it around).
