    d) As far as I can work out, someone who wants to free part of a
    product, but not all of it, can't practically do so under GPL.

I'm not really sure what that means, but I have a feeling that there
is a misunderstanding at the root of it.  Could you describe the scenario
more clearly, so I could tell for certain?
