In Georgia, the state appeals court declared that faxes are "beeps and
chirps" and therefore not writings.  As a fax is not a writing, it cannot
have a signature.  Therefore the signature cannot be valid.  This was in a
case that involved a required notice to arrive by a certain time.

Traditionally, on a writing anything is a signature including an 'X', spit,
and the words "Mickey Mouse".
