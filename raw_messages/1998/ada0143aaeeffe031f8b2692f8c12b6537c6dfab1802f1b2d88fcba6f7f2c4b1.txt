   Declan McCullagh is ending his longstanding "Netly News" column and
   leaving Time magazine today because of the magazine's recently
   restructured technology coverage. He will join Wired Oct. 12 as chief
   Washington correspondent. His agreement with Wired lets him continue
   to run the Politech e-mail list, a popular industry source of breaking
   news and analysis on technology and politics. (By Adam Clayton Powell
   III)

   Time Warner on Thursday quietly shut down Netly News, melding the
   operations of its Internet-beat news service and the online version of
   Time Digital.
