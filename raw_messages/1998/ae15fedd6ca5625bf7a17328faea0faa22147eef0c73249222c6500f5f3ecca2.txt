No. Actually, we're convinced that you're just a lamer. Usually spamming
and mailbombing goes along with that.

You need 100 accounts on the same ISP for that? Your implied claims of
being Internet savvy are pretty suspect considering that you haven't even

means is that you installed a password sniffer on a university LAN or you
ran crack on a passwd file.
