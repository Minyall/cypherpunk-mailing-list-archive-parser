You might want to consider to read van Ecks paper yourself:

  Wim van Eck: Electromagnetic Radiation from Video Display Units: An
  Eavesdropping Risk? Computers & Security 4 (1985) 269--286

If you don't have C&S in your library, you might also find a
scan on <http://www.eskimo.com/~joelm/tempest.html>

Please explain! I was more thinking in terms of digitizing everything
and solving large per-pixel systems of equations to separate the drifting
images, which does not sound much like something equivalent to a
single hardware integrator, but more like something that keeps a
workstation very busy for a few minutes.
