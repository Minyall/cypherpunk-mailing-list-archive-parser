I've received two messages from Carl Johnson in letter form. He seems in,
um, good spirits. He also mentions a BabyTruthMongerel at one point. 

He asks that his messages be passed on to cypherpunks, and I have no
objection, after I'm done writing the fourth part of the article. We could
presumably scan them in and put them up on pathfinder.com.
