Apparently we are talking at cross purposes.

Currently, there are rather large ftp crypto archives that are
"protected" by a scheme using randomly generated directory names. 
This is considered acceptable by the export authorities.  The export
authorities would have a hard time, therefore, arguing that an archive
protected by encrypting the files with DES would not be sufficiently
protected.

It would be a stunt, of course.  Merely another stunt to illustrate 
the inconsistencies in the export laws.

I quite disagree.  Frequently a clever stunt does engage the layman 
-- at least the intelligent laymen.
