Tim's thoughts on the archives are all the more ironic for being rehashed
from "the good old days (TM)".

     I realize we're all supposed to smile knowingly at this cynical remark;
but I can't let the cynicism pass without a commentary. If the list is 
advanced, then the issues being discussed may strike newbies as arcane -- 
this is noise only to the uninitiated. And repeated threads may strike 
old-timers as rehash -- and therefore a kind of noise.  But -- at least 
as far as Cypherpunks goes -- even apparently repetitive threads have 
new slants, unforeseen shadings of personal meaning, and new contexts to 
save them from being considered as just noise.
  "The main cause of failure in education," said A.N. Whitehead, "is 
staleness." And a stale reader will hear only noise if the attention 
isn't focussed enough to see the actually new within the apparently old.
