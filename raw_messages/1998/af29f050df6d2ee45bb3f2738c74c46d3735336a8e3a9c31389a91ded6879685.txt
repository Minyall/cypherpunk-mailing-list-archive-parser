What is with these fascist ISP who think they have a *right* to regulate
the data stream of others? What's next, are they going to start blocking
domains because they don't like what is on a web page, or because they
don't like an e-mail message someone posts??

Don't have to worry about government censorship there are plenty of
civilians that are willing to do the work for them. :(
