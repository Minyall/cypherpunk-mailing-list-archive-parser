Senators Lott and Kerrey have made crypto core dumps
in recent days:

Lott says 56-bit crypto is bad, and recites its weaknesses,
reading a script he doesn't know shit about, hair and mind
immutably fixatived.

Kerrey Lincoln Monuments long dead Nat sec with Info Tech 
faux marbre, frutilessly limoing around DC torrist piles looking 
for The American People, while Super-Coifed Cohen aimlessly 
sends Cold War B52s to PR-bomb Menwith Hill targets -- unruly 
wildhair ups -- protecting what Kerrey can't find.

Clinton and Yeltsin will shortly morph into Serbian hair ball.
