A practical 128-bit key-cracker could be built with about 10000 cubic
meters of silicon.  (Figure one transistor per cubic micron, 1 ghz
operation, do the math...)  The technology to build a computer of that
size is still a few years away, but it is theoretically possible to build
a 128-bit key-cracker without using quantum computers or travelling to
other planets.
