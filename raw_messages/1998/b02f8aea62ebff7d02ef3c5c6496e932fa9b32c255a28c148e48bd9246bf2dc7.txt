|Adam, you should know better than to ask.  Everyone knows you can't

	Its clear to me that Nobuki baits Tim, and Tim baits Nobuki.
Its not as entertaining as the Detwieler days (where we would have
gotten the claimn that Tim and Nobuki were the same), but hey..

	I'm perfectly happy to let bigots do my cryptanalysis for me.
As long as they get positive results, hey, I'm more secure.  Not
believing that the Americans could break German engineering was one of
the failures of the Enigma team.
