And if a mine worker suffercates to death in a poorly venterlated mine
then there engaging in behavior that's been viewed for centuries as one of
the occupation hazards for workers in poorly venterlated mines.

Which is fine when the ecomomy is strong and there is pleanty of jobs
going around but when the economy is on a downturn (like say because your

I'd rather have power spread around so no one has a signifigent amount of
it.

Depeaning on the laws and cercomstances you may get procuted in simmler
situtaions.  Indeed the coronor is going to have allot of questions to
ask you.

[2] Lit Right of the first night.  The boss had the right to fuck your
wife on the first night of your marrige.  The only refereces we have for
this are the laws out-lawing the practice.
