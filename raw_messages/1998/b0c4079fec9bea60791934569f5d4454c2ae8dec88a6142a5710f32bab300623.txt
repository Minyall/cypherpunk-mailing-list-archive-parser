I was looking at my RAM when I noticed several passwords I have 
frequently used were still there, and as I never turn off my comp, I 
was wondering if there is a way you can "clean" your RAM?
I also got errors when installing LILO on my DOS partition, so now I 
*CAN'T* boot without a bootdisk, and I think LILO sticks itself on 
the master boot record, is there an MBR editor?
Where can I get a list of Candian Remailers?
Is there a DOS and/or Winbloze 3.* Email program that I can "forge" 
headers? (ex: Like in Linux fastmail adding: -f billc@whitehouse.gov)
thnx.
