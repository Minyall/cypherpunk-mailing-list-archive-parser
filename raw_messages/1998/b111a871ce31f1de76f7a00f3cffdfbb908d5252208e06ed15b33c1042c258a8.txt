>Is CDMF secure?  and, What sort of algorithm is it?  Thanks.

CMDF is a version of DES watered down to 40-bit key strength.
I think IBM was to blame; it was designed for exportability.

It makes Louis Freeh feel secure, I guess, but it's not
useful for data that needs to be secure.
				Thanks!
