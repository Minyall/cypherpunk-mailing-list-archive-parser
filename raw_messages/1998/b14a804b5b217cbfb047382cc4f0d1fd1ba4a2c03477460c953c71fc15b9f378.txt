It occurs to me that since the court saw fit to assign an attorney over CJ's
objection he may have constitutional grounds to have his arrest and the
consequential proceedings overturned.

The Constitution says that a person has a right to counsil if the issue at
hand is worth more than $20. It doesn't say the court must appoint one and
it most certainly doesn't say a defendent requires one. Since the
Constitution leaves the issue up to the defendant any action that is
contrary to their desires is un-constitutional. The 10th prohibits
these sorts of excess or self-appointed authority.
