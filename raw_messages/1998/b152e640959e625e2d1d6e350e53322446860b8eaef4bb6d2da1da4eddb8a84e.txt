    sounds good to me; I've raised 5 children who know how to _read_.

    I've never owned a television, never saw the need to bring cancer
    into the home. TV could have been one of the greatest educational
    tools in the existence of mankind --and, what is it? nothing more
    than bread and circus for the mass, a tool for social reoganization 
    and the destruction of the family.

    babysitter?  momma's little helper? not really; a creator of a
    vast unthinking social wasteland --which, of course, fits the
    policy goals of Hillay's Global Village where everybody is just
    another butterscotch pudding to her recipe.
