This could be a good sting opperation. Send an anonymous e-mail message
that points to a childporn site. The [add your jackbooted thug
orginization here] kick in your door as soon as they get the signal that
your machine has connected to the site and downloaded the images.

Hmmmm I wonder if there is a way to get the browser to DL an image without
displaying it. The pictures would be sitting in your cache without even
knowing it. Probably not a big issue I would imagine that a jury would
convict on website logs alone even if no pictures were found on the
machine.
