There's a recent notice that the CIA has become an
associate member of the Microelectronics and Computer 
Technology Corporation <www.mcc.com>, the research 
consortium of several high-tech firms located in Austin. 
The notice also lists a project there called "InfoSleuth." 
See the notice (among other national security 
opportunities) at:

A reporter working on the story has asked for any information
on the CIA enrollment and InfoSleuth. Send it to her, or
to me if a cut-out is needed:

Heather Harreld, senior reporter covering security at
Federal Computer Week in Washington.
