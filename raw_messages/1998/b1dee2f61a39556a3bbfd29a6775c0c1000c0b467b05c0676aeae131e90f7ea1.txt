Unfortunately the "if" is false.  I have no idea if your fancy PK signature 
really represents you.  Just look at the recent trouble Black Unicorn has 
had with someone else using the same name affiliated with a key stored on 
the Network Associates PGP key server. Dave could not verify a PK signature 
for the PGP software distribution itself.  PKI, or a web of trust, looks 
good on paper but in practice it does not work when scaled up to large 
numbers of networked users.
