I have just looked into my cookies file, and noticed an interesting
kookie (pun intended):

www.netscum.net FALSE   /       FALSE   123456789      visited the%20Home%20Page%2c%20Name%20Q.%20Deleted

(Name Deleted is the name of one of the well known USENET personaes,
and there is a number instead of 123456789).

This is really interesting. If netscum.net ever comes up again, do not
view it except through the anonymizer or the crowds, and filter out the
kooks' kookies.
