>    More related sites... NEW YORK (CNNfn) - Engineers at an International
>    Business Machines Corp. research facility in Austin, Texas, Wednesday
>    demonstrated the world's first computer chip to break the 1,000 MHz
>    barrier.
>    [INLINE] The chip operates at 1 billion cycles per second. The fastest
>    commercial microprocessors today operate at around 300 MHz. However,
>    computer users won't be able to run out and buy a PC containing the
>    chip anytime soon. IBM isn't expected to make it available
>    commercially for at least two years.
>    [INLINE] The news comes just days after rival Digital Equipment
>    introduced a new version of its Alpha chip that it said would break
>    the 1,000 MHz barrier. Digital Equipment, which hasn't yet hit that
>    mark, also said it would take at least two years for the chip to be
>    available.
>    [INLINE] IBM will issue a research paper detailing the chip, along
>    with two related microprocessor papers, at the International Solid
>    State Circuit Conference in San Francisco Friday.
