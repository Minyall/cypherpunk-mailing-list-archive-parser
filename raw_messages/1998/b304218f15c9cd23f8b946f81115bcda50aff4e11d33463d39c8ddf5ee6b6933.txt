I wonder sometimes whether or not there is hope for us to ever stop
this tyrrany.  I've seen a bunch of us diss the strike saying it was
an outlandish and foolish idea, but I hadn't seen anyone of you come
up with something better.  That act of protest, no matter how small,
serves to raise awareness.  Whether it's five minutes after finding
out that a war has errupted, or ten years into the war, each serves
its purpose.  At least it was na idea, it was a start.  We're never
going to be able to do anything at all if we don't start somewhere and
the strike seemed as good an idea as any.  Hopefully we can follow in
the footsteps of our ancestors who fought and died for freedom, true
freedom not this crap we see displayed on the tube everynight.  I hope
we don't fall into that catagorie of the kinds of people that talk and
talk and never do, for if this is the case, then we have already lost
and might as well drive ourselves to the concentration camps.
