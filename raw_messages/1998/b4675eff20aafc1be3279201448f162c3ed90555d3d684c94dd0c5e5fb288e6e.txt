 Bob, I am afraid you are showing your ignorance here. SSB is just one of 
the many modes of emission standardized in radio communications, its used 
by the amateur radio service (ham) , the citizens radio service (cb), the 
military, etc ...

 The real problem is that to build any sort of network would require some 
fixed positions, which, if it were intended to be 'clandestine' would be 
compromised sooner or later ... either that or several poor shnooks would 
have full time jobs driving vans around and around to keep the RDF snoops 
guessing ...

 In general there would be a better chance of pulling it off if you 
stayed away from the ham radio bands. 'self-policing' is not a character 
of another bands except the commercial broadcast bands.

 Spread spectrum would have more promise as many stations could be on the 
air at once on the same frequency thus making life quite confusing for 
the T-hunters.
