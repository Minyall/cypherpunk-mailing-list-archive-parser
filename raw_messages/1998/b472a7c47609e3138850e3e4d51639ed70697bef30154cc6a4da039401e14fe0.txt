There was an article in a recent EETimes about a new type of very fast
imaging sensor, whose circuitry provides for very short exposures, which may
find uses in consumer items.

I was thinking that very fast image grabbers could be used to identify
moving people, e.g., in their cars at an airport, or even on the street.
The performance limit will be the sensitivity of the pixels and available
light.  But motion blur goes away.

(In my part of Calif, there are video cameras mounted on signalling poles
or streetlights in wealthy suburbs, for 'traffic monitoring' reasons.  Images
from them (as released to the public) are wide-angle, and people can't be
ID'd.
But things change.)
