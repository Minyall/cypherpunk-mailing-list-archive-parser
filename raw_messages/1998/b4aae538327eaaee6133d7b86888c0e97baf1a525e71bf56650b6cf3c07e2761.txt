Windows NT4.0 has been tested under the red book spec published by the
NCSC. That means in effect, NT is C2 compliant in a stand alone
environment. Howver, NT does NOT comply with the orange book spec which
defines additional requirements when the machine is used in a networked
environment. It *IS* possible for an operating system that is on a
networked machine to be C2(Orange Book) compliant. Microsoft has never
stated that it is C2 compliant on a network, however their page about C2
and NT is poorly worded, and effectively discounts the importance of the
Orange Book spec.

It would be fun to get ahold of the specs from the NCSC.
