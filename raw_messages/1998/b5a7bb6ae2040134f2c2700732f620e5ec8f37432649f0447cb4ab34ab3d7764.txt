Well sitting down and writting a device driver is above and beyond the
ability of the average WinBlows user. More than likely it is above and
beyond the average "programmer" (ASM what's that??). M$ is already playing
around with using crypto and only allowing signed programs to run under
their OS (Crypto API, Active-X) it is not hard to imagine that they could
have the new version of their OS only allow device drivers that have been
approved and signed by microsoft (when you control +90% of the market you
can get away with silly shit like this).

Yes but I wouldn't want to use ScreenCam to copy a 100 page document. My
point was it would not make it impossible to copy the data just that it
would raise the "threshold of pain" above what the average user is willing
to endure.
