Ooops, 178,000 joules w/ 1 mol each (about 36 grams Hcl & 40 grams NaOH), 
so the "one gram each" example (wrong unit of measure, btw), assuming 
about 1/40 the quantity, would be about 4450 joules, or about five 
kitchen matches. bfd. OTOH, IANAC(hemist).

Looks like the answer to the original question would be "somewhat salty 
ammonium hydroxide", with the given quantities. Don't drink (drano) and 
drive.

-r.w.
