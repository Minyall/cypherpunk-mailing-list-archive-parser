The 'Secret Service With A Smile' chapter of SPACE ALIENS HIDE MY
DRUGS!!! 
was sent to the CypherPunks Disturbed Male LISP as secret.as1 -->
secret.as7
earlier today. It is a DOS .prn file, which is the only type of copy I
could save
with the FAX software I am using.
I was forced to delete the original text file from the computer I was
using, but 
the Secret Service has copies of it, so anyone who wishes the original
text
file can contact:
