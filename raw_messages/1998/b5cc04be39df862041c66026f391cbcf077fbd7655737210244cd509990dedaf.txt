These early systems have got to have some major problems. 

The appropriate way of dealing with them is to wait for some people to
be misidentified and then file suit against the municipality using the
equipment. Harassment, false arrest, invasion of privacy, abuse of
power, loss of reputation, loss of the ability to earn a living - take a
few of the cities for $10 or $20 million and they'll get the message
that they've been had by the SW vendors.

However much I like technology, it looks more and more like politics is
king. For now.
