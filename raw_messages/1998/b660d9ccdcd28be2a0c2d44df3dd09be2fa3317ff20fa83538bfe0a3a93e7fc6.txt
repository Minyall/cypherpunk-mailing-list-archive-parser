Then I would be a fucking idiot for willingly giving my business to
a phone company that  would allow this.
The fact is, the only phone company available to me is a monopoly
who will no doubt institute this 'feature' because of your suggestion.
I will have them forward my bill to you...

Then they should expend the time, energy and resources that will
enable them to deny the use of their commonly shared resources
with members of the InterNet community which they do not wish
to support.

The InterNet is a shared resource. If the ISP does not want to
share certain resources with this-or-that entity on the communal
resource of the Net, then they can configure their system to
deny reciprocal services to their fellow Netizens.

Perhaps they should spend their time configuring their systems to
allow what they feel is most useful to their customers, and tell
those who complain to go somewhere else.

I will petition the government to pass laws to prevent your ISP 
from spamming me with posts such as this, which reflect nothing
more than the standard Sheeple position that anything which you 
do not personally desire should be outlawed.
