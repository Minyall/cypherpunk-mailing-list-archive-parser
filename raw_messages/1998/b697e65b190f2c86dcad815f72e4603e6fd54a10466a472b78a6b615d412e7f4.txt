It depends on the frequency. Last time I checked a laser or a maser (both
are radio waves strictly speaking) travel LOS. The scattering comes from
beam divergence and incidental refractions and reflections from the
molecules in the air and supported detritus.

Depends on the size of the hole and location. In most microwave ovens there
are definite dead-spots (corners and the exact center of the area are
notorius).

If the microwaves (for example) are transmitted parallel to the open side it
might very well work just fine. It's going to depend on a variety of
factors that will preclude such a blanket statement from being valid.

For these to work there must be a time-correlated aspect to the signal that
doesn't appear in the noise. If you mask the signal with the same sort of
time correlated cover (eg phase shifting) it also might work.

The absolute magnitude isn't really important.

Most of the signals that are emitted by a computer are not in the 100dB
dynamic range (@2x=3db that's a signal range of 1:33) , more likely 40-50db
if that. For a TTL (5V) signal it barely covers 3dB (LOW is <2.5v and a
high is >=4.75). There simply is no way in hell a signal with a 3dB range is
going to emit a rf signal that is 100dB. There are other logic families with
wider dynamic ranges (eg CMOS w/ 18V Vcc can be nearly 18V or approx. about
12dB).
