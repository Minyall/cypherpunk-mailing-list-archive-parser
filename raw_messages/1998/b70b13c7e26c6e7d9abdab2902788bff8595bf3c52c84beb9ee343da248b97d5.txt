Hold on hear a second, let's get the facts straight.

I am NOT being accussed of anything. I have been asked to act as a witness
for the prosecution (not explicitly the target thereof). Unfortunately for
the prosecutions case, I'm not a witness to anything relevant. If I were
aware of some kook running around building bombs with the intention of using
them on people, their property, or animals I'd be the first to turn their
nutty butts in.
