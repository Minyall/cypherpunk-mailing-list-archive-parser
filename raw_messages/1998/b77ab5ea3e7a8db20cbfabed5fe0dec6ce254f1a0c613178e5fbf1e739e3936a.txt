On 2/9/98 12:25 PM, Tim May (tcmay@got.net)  passed this wisdom:

As I write this there are advertisements up in the halls at the HS 
(obviously with school blessings) where I teach (a few miles east of 
Burlington, VT) specifically soliciting 17 year olds to work for a 
private company under contract to the state to 'test buy' tobacco 
products. I haven't heard about any takers yet nor anything backfiring.

  I wonder, though, how long it would go on if some shopkeeper indeed did 
this? But, is it a crime to try to buy booze or tobacco underage, if you 
do not try to show fraudulent indentification?
