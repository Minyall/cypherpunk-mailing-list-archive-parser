Probably a bit late, but I would ask, "If the government is going to
require GAK, how is it going to demonstrate that all the keys is accessed
were accessed according to legal proceedings?"  Another way of asking is,
"How do we ensure that all government accesses to keys become publicly
known within a reasonable amount of time."  (I would define reasonable as
much less than 5 years.)

(I've been reading David Brin's "The Transparent Society".)
