NYT, May 17, 1998, on the Birmingham Summit:

G8 leaders spent considerable time discussing arrangements
for international cooperation in fighting cross-border crimes 
like money-laundering, computer fraud and arms smuggling.

In a communique, the leaders endrosed efforts to negotiate
a United Nations agreement to provide law enforcement
officials with more tools to fight international organized
crime.

They called for talks with the business community on an
international legal framework for obtaining computer data
as evidence in criminal cases, while preserving privacy
protections.

-----

A pointer to the communique or other G8 reports from this
session would be welcomed.
