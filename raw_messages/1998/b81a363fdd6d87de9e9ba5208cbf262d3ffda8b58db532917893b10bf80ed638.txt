And in whose local Lorentz frame would such communication be
"instantaneous"?

Uh, no.  The operators for corresponding observables at both ends of such
an experiment commute, so it is not possible to transmit information
non-locally using such an apparatus. 

This was discovered when the first experiments to verify the
Einstein-Rosen-Podolsky effect were done.  You need the results of
measurements on the opposite end to decrypt the information at the end you
are at.
