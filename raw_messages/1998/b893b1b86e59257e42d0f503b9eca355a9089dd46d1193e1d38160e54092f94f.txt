That reminds me... in PR Newswire on 16 Dec 1997 it was reported that
IBM had endorsed Meganet's VME, and recommended that NIST replace the
DES standard with it (presumably in the AES bake-off).  This was
humorous enough that I thought it worth sharing with IBM -- I
ingenously asked them whether it was true, and, if so, how they came to
the conclusion that it was a useful product.  They responded:

       I would like to apologize for the length of time it took
       to reply to your message. I had to make a few phonecalls
       and had to wait for someone to get back to me. I spoke with
       a Cryptography Specialist and she informed me that IBM
       has, in fact, not tested their product and therefore has not
       endorsed it. IBM has no further comment regarding the report.

       I hope this helps.

       Thank you for using askIBM.

I, too, have no further comment.
