I cannot discuss that here, as Tim May will likely enter the discussion 
to enforce his intellectual property rights and remind us that he 
discussed this before the rest of us were born. All worthwhile 
discussions of cryptography were held prior to 1994. This list is to be 
henceforth used for the posting of long rambling prose induced by the 
inhaling of household chemicals. Contact sniffmonger toto, check the 
archives, and bring me another scotch.

I'd like to tell you, but I cannot tell you that which you do not already 
know.

Where on the 'net are Tartaglia and Cardano? How about Hakken and 
Appel? How many colors do you need to color a map, such that no two 
regions that share a boundary also share a color? Have I screwed up, and 
in my effort to prove to you that I know the secret, perhaps revealed it 
to you after all?
