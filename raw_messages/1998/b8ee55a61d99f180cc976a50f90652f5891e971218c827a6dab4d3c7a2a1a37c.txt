No it does not.

The date that a Key becomes comprimised and the date that the owner of a
Key knowns it is comprimised are two very different things and somthing
that time-stamping can not solve.

You also have at issue of what does one do with long term signatures if
the undelying technology is broken. Say you sign a 30yr morgage
electronically and 15yrs latter the algorithms that were used and now
broken.

Not to mention what does one do when the time-stamping key is comprimised.
