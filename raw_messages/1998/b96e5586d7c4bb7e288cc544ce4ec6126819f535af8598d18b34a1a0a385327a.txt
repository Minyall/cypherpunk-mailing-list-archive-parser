I know this is a little off topic, but has anyone
 verified the integrity of a web site called 
"Spy & CounterSpy" located at http://www.spycounterspy.com/?

The site is basically a citizens' guide to 
counterintelligence, and covers topics ranging 
from anonymous email and encryption to evading 
FBI surveillance.

The author, Lee Adams, claims to have years of 
experience in these areas but I'm wondering if 
this site isn't quite what it appears to be -- 
a site put up by some freedom-loving guy who wants 
to help everyone enjoy their privacy.
