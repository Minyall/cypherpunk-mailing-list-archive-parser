>From Vlad Ze Prophet:

:sheeple are like, "that's
: not my job". cpunks are like, "it is a waste of time and energy
: to do that job". what's the difference in the end??
:
: the govt can be turned around very, very quickly if the public
: stops sucking down sixpacks and being hypnotized by meaningless
: dribble of sporting events and sitcoms that parade endlessly
: across their nanosecond attention span.  [. . .]

Sheeple are like, "that's not my job".
and cpunks are like, "YOU're not my job".

And to the govmt-as-is cpunks are like, "get off my space and out of my face".

And if I, non-exemplary Citizen of the Galaxy, choose to sit around guzzling
down sixpacks, listening to the dribble of sporting events and sitcoms (can you
see it!),  and you personally don't like it, I would say " I'M like, so not your
job".

I would like to know what exactly you've done for me lately, Vladimeer, for to
turn the government around.

Blanc - like, sitting around hypnotized, urp, waiting for visionary inspiration.
