Here's the bottem line issue with Gilmore's RSAREF site.

It isn't Gilmore's, it's EFF's.

It isn't Gilmore's butt on the line as it would be for person who
participate in his call to action.

What's EFF going to do to protect those participants? Nothing.

What's Gilmore personaly going to do to protect those participants? Nothing.

He's asking others to put their butt in the line of fire while he sits
safely in a rear area.

In effect he's asking YOU to be cannon fodder for his rights.
