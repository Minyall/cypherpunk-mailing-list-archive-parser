It's not that much disk space.  The million entries was a methphor.  They use
mathematics instead of raw disk storage.

Of course.  It's less secure than hardware solutions.

Agreed.  Think of AOL as the ideal user for this idea.  They want something
a little more secure than passwords, but don't want to spend the money on
hardware.  Passwords can be guessed, or sniffed.  This system doesn't
allow passwords to be guessed, and there are some more additions to 
prevent sniffing (all pretty standard).  Sure, if the client machine is
compromised (installing a sniffer, etc), there is no security, but that's not
the real threat.

Sure.  But it's good enough for some things.

That's not the best way to operate in the real world.  I'd much rather have
friends, get married, and have a fun life than to trust no one.  I'd much
rather
take the occassional hit rather than sit alone in the dark holding a gun.
This
is the real world of ninny net users in chat rooms, this isn't online real
estate.
