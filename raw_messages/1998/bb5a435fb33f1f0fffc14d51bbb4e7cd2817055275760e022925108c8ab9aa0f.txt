OTTAWA - Canada's ultra-secret spy agency is not eavesdropping on the
private conversations of Canadian citizens, Quebec's former chief justice
says. <P>

 For the past 20 months, Claude Bisson has scrupulously monitored the
activities of the Communications Security Establishment (CSE), a
half-century-old agency that operates so clandestinely its very existence
was not even publicly acknowledged until 1983. <P>


 ``My mandate is to assure that the CSE is abiding by the Constitution and
after 20 months I can assert it is abiding by the law,'' Bisson,
commissioner of the CSE, said during his first interview since taking on
the task of reviewing the agency's activities in June, 1996. <P>

 ``There is no targeting of Canadians in general and Quebecers in
particular. I am satisfied and I can assure the Canadian people that CSE
abides by the law.''
