I obtained a bunch of totally EMPTY posts from

      owner-cypherpunks@Algebra.COM

in intervals of about half an hour. Does anyone have the same
experience and know what's the matter? (Further it appears that
a couple of posts of mine have been delayed and have not yet appreared
after the usual waiting time.)
