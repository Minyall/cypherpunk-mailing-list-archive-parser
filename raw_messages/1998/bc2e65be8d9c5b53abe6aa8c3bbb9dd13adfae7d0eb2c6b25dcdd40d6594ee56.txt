Jeff,

Alia Johnson reports that CJ has not had his teeth and
glasses returned. Can you tell me, or refer me to someone
who can, what is needed to get that done. Or if I have no 
right to get involved who else should make the request. 
Got a Fedex account ready for use.

Thanks much,

John
