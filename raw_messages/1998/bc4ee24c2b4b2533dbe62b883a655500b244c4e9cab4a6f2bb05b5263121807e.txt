Not really true, IMO.  Consider

http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:HR03396:@@@L

Signed into law in 1996, The Defense of Marriage Act, seeks to define 
"marriage" as a marriage between one man and one woman, in an attempt to 
prevent gay people from getting, say, married in Hawaii and then getting 
the same protection as other married people.

Unfortunately, it it seems to be in character with the "full faith and 
credit" clause (Article IV, Section 1) of the U.S. Constitution, which 
follows "And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the 
Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved,
and the Effect thereof."

The same rationale could be used in turning state-issued driver's 
licenses into National ID Cards, couldn't it?
