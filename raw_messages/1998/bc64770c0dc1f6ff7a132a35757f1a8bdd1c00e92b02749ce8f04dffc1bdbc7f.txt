You also have no right to do anything to make their life worse either.

THAT is my objection to anarchism, it has zero, nada, null, nul, nil,
none, zipo recognition of others peoples rights and an individuals

It further refuses to recognize that to help others is to help oneself in
many cases.

Get your facts straight (but that's probably asking too much).
