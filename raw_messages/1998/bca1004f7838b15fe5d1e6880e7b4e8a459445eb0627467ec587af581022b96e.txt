Well, I take a lot more seriously the claims of a Palestinian orange grower
in Jaffa who is farming land that has been in his family for many
generations than I do the claim of an Auschwitz survivor from Krakow who
claims that YHVH or some other bearded Sky Father gave his lineage the
entire land 3000 years ago.

What was done to the Jews by Hitler in WWII was horrible. But the solution
was not to take ethnic Northern Europeans (much more of their genetic
material is Russian, Latvian, Polish, northern European in general, than is
Semitic) and resettle them on the lands of people who've actually been
living in the area and farming it for at least the past several
generations, and probably closer to the past few thousand years. A claim
that Yahweh "gave" Palestine to those who have been living in Poland for a
thousand years is just pure bullshit.

And it wouldn't have happened had the victorious superpowers decided the
sand niggers in Palestine could be kicked off their land. (I have no beef
with those Jews who peacefully bought land in Palestine prior to this mass
resettlement.)

Frankly, I've always thought the suitable place for the Allies to have
resettled the Jews--to the extent it was our business at all--was Germany
itself. Plenty of conquered villages, plenty of seized castles and villas
and chalets.

And if the Jews thought this was too "icky," to be resettled in the land of
their oppression, and insisted instead that the Alllies push the sand
niggers out of their orange groves...well, fuck 'em. Given 'em a loaf of
bread and wish them good luck and send them on their way.

(And let us not forget the actions of the Stern Gang and such in blowing up
the King David Hotel.)

The chickens are coming home to roost.
