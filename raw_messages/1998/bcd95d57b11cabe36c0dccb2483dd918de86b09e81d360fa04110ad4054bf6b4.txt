But even Cluelesser is the guy who just asked for help with a firewall
configuration on the NT system admin list and gave a 5 screensfull
description of how they have set up their firewall and servers, 
what proxies they have, what they block and allow through... 
down to and including saying that they *haven't* installed the 
MS recommended hotfixes for NT security.

Of course, it could always be bait.

As, I suppose, could the Italian Bank post, although
if I was dragnetting for stupid hackers I'd have hoped
I'd be able to come up with something more plausible.
