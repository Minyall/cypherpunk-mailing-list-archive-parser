For now, most of those services all live on machines dedicated
to the banner service, rather than on the same machine as the server.
Making machines vanish is easy - put them in your hosts file as
aliases to 127.0.0.2, and if you're behind a proxy server,
put them on your "no proxy" list.  Of course, if everybody
starts doing this, then more systems will start using ad servers
that have names in their own domain, but it works for now on
most of the major servers.  I've found that killing doubleclick.net
and linkexchange.com gets rid of most of the banners.

What I'd really like to see in a browser is an option to
turn off animated GIFs (other than by killing all images.)
