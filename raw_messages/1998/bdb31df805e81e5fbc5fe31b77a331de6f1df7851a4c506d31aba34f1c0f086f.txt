Have algorithms been chosen? If I understand right, letting different users use
different algos would make some users' messages look different from others
while bouncing around in the network. I don't think anyone even suspects
3DES and a KEA cognate would fail.

The "topologically close" tradeoff (i.e, a gain in performance for an
unmeasured loss in security) seems to be more exploit-bait than optimization;
it might be wiser not to enable this part of automatic route selection by
default unless/until its effects on security are investigated more thoroughly.
At least give me a while to make an attack on it. :)
