Ray Ozzie, founder of Iris, the company which developed Notes and sold it
to Lotus, discussed his "40 + 24" hack a couple of years ago. It was met
with much derision in the community.

(He sent me a nice letter explaining his motivations for the 40 + 24 hack,
but I was of course unconvinced. BTW, my recollection was that they were
trying to get the industry to adopt this as a way of satisfying _domestic_
calls for GAK, not just for export to those dumb Swedes :-}).
