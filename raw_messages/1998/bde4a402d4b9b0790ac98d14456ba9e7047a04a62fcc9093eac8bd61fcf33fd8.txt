Ah, but these are all chump change models.

How about:

There's the Mosaic model--develop a product with university funds, watch it
catch on, and then help found a company and make a quick $20 million or
more.

(A model also loosely paralleled in the founding of Cisco and Sun.)

And, quite seriously, the most important thing "shareware" does is to
establish one's credibility as a programmer. Many of the Mac shareware
programmers made almost nothing off of the paltry donations, but the
elegance of their products led to job opportunities and, even better,
startup opportunities.

(Lloyd Chambers, at PGP, Inc., for example, if I haven't confused him with
someone else.)
