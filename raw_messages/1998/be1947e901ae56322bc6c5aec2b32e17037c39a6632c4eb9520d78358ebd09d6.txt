See: http://www.ping.be/bios/ for bioses and flash upgrades.

Come on guys, this is silly. Why the fuck would the UK tempest scan your 
notebooks?  Manufacturers produce new machines every month, each with modified
BIOSes for the features in their new notebooks, with hardware variations and 
imperfection, with different power levels of batteries, different PC cards
installed, different CPU speeds, different options and other inconsistencies
you get a very difficult situation.  

Your speculation that someone out there will tempest scan to see if you've
modded your notebook is silly.  Are you just pissing against the wind, or do
you have knowledge that they actually do this?

You're forgetting your threat model and planning for a level that's beyond
demented paranoia.
