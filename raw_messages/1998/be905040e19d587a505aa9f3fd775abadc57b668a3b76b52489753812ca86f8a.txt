    The fact that government "officials" would use their power to extort
money should not come as a shock to anyone (absolute power corrupts
absolutely).

    Why they were allowed to get away with it is the interesting part.

    There is an underlying hatred of success in this country. The vast
majority of Americans loath anyone who has done better for themselves than
they have (better know as the sin of envy). This was not always the case.
At one time Americans had hopes and dreams of success. They always
believed that no matter how poor or uneducated they were their children
could find themselves on top ("Yes Johnny, someday *you* can be
President"). They understood that it was the equality of opportunity that
made this country great. That if a man, through hard work and a little
luck, could take his destiny into his own hands and become anything he
wanted.

    This is no longer true. Through decades of socialist control of the
education and entertainment industries Americans have lost the dream. They
no longer believe that their destinies are in their own hands. Rather than
looking to themselves for the solutions to their problems they look to
government. Rather than blameing their own sloth and ignorance for their
lot in life they blame those who are still willing to strive and succeed.

    Such attitudes are most prevalent among those who need to strive the
hardest. They blame the "establishment", and "angry white men", for their
plight, never once acknowledging their own complacency. When uneducated
immigrants come to this country, unable even to speak the language, and
through hard work and perseverance are able to succeed how can any
legitimacy be given to the claims of the socialist?

    Proof is all around that America is still a land of opportunity. All
one has to do is look to people like Bill Gates, who without benefit of
education or wealth, made himself one of the richest men in the world. 

    Millions of people immigrate to America as they know what
opportunities are here for them. They are not immigrating to Europe, or
Russia, or China, or Cuba because they can see what socialism has made of
these places. Unless Americans wakeup and take notice of the bankruptcy of
the victim mentality of socialism their lot in life will never improve.
