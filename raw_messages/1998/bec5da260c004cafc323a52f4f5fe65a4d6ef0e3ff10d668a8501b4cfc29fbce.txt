That's silly! I mess up my credit card strips all the time by keeping
them in my pocket with keys on motorcycle rides, or in my tool belt when
I used to do carpentry, or even slipping them into my money clip the
wrong side out....the tape has never lasted longer than a month on any
of my cards...I doubt, seriously, that a cop will harrass anyone who
does not come out and say, "Yes, officer, I intentionally defaced my
DL.  And ya know why, Mr. Poleesse Man? Well, I'll tell ya <yadda,
yadda, yadda, privacy, yadda, yadda, biometrics, yadda....>"

I do agree that it is proably better to do the damage without it being
noticable.  Less suspicion is ALWAYS better.

Best,
