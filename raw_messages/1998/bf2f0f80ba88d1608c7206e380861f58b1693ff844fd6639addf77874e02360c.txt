	No, he is saying you get the energy equiv. of 300 gallons of gas
from 4 tons of seed, PLUS the other stuff from the stalks.

	I can't speak for the veracity of the numbers, but that would be my
interpretation.

	Also, he is talking when processed into fuel oil/gas, not put in a
pipe and...

	Never mind.
