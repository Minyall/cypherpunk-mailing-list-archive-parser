Has anyone else experienced posts sent via the anon.lcs.mit.edu
mail2news gateway not propagating to Compuserve/Sprynet's news
servers?  I've made a couple of posts, both anonymously and
non-anonymously via that gateway, and they haven't been showing up
at CIS/Sprynet.  Yet they've been archived on Dejanews and replies
to them from users on other servers have shown up.

Is this a propagation problem, or are Compuserve and Sprynet
blocking posts from that gateway?
