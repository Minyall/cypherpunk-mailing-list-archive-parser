HTML is a fine format for email.  It's ASCII readable, and supports
content description tags that the user's mail reader can render as
bold/italic/underline/header-levels//color/etc.  It's far superior
to using bloated undocumented Microsoft Word attachments.
95% of the HTML email I get IS spam, but that's a separate problem :-)
(After all, SPAMMERs like bright colored blinking attention-getting mail.)

Doesn't even need a prompt - a basic missing-picture icon is fine,
with a load-images command somewhere.  While it's not as dangerous as
auto-processing, autodownloading is annoying, and can be both a
security risk (the auto-outing problem) and a denial-of-service risk.

Needs to be either off by default or not there at all.

Netscape mail is adequate for many people, just as Eudora is.
Newer versions are pretty bloated, but including S/MIME mail encryption
for everybody is a Good Thing.
