Brian, that post was a feeble one-time attempt to write straight prose, 
uninflected, unaccusatory, undiabolical, un-nuts, un-understandable. 

It took days of agony to arrive at empty perfection, to say nothing with 
crystal clear aplomb, foreign policy piquant, transparent balderdash 
cover-up of bald-face lies delivered deadpan grammatically.

I been studying James Rubin's disarmingly weird repartee at the State 
Department press conferences. Today he asked a reporter to define 
"who's got the con"  for foreign policy. (Laughter, the transcript hooted.)

"Charming weirdo" is the Secretary of State's and Rubin's demonic 
auto-epithet for her, emulating homicidal Maggie Thatcher hiding her 
demure will to slaughter.

Swear to god this is the last time I'll try to ape well-mannered civil 
discourse. You got the con: It's too sicko wacko. Back to incoherent 
snarl of ignorant brutes chewing leg off for freedom.
