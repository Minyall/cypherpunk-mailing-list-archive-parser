If you are using the accounts of others without permission then you 
are a thief and you don't come up to the standards of the least 
intelligent user at AOL or anywhere else for that matter. You will 
eventually be caught and hopefully be put away somewhere dark where 
the guards will not care how loud you scream.

Of course you will think this is an empty threat but it is not a 
threat at all. It is a prediction. You are to young and stupid to 
cover your tracks well enough to not be caught.

If you are just boasting then grow up!
