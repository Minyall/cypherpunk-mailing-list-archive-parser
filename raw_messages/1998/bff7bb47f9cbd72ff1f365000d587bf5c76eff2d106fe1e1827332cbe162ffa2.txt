   CRYPT WARS, UK-STYLE

     UK's Privacy International has awarded the Department of Trade and
Industry a Big Brother award for its contribution to invading privacy. The
DTI wants all companies offering encrypted services to be licensed, which
means using a third party holding keys to the user's encryption code.
Encryption licensed outside the UK will not be recognised, and thus would
not be protected by law. And only the recommendation of senior police is
needed to get a key - users aren't allowed to know if their key has been
given to the police. More Big Brother awards at http://www.privacy.org/pi/
