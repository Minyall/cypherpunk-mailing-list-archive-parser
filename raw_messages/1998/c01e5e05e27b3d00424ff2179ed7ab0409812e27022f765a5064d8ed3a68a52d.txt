This makes me think of something that I probably missed in the bowels of
someone's long previous stego posting (um, stego^stego? :-)), how would you
go about either:

Stegoing an encrypted partition as "blank" hard drive space without
actually writing over it unless you wanted to?

or, even,

Stegoing an encrypted partition as not even *there* at all?


Doesn't seem like it would be too hard conceptually (hah!) and, if done,
might actually defeat such Archie-look-up-the-dress as the British
customsfolk are wont to do these days.

Obviously, even if the partition were found, it would look, to sniffer
programs, as if it were empty, right? :-).

Cheers,
