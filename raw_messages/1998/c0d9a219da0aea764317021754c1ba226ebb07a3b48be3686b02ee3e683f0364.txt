Understanding dawns...

See, perhaps for you, personally, profit maximisation for yourself is
more interesting than crypto deployment.  But as I said in the section
quoted above "If your aim is to maximise crypto deployment", use BSD.

ie. Cypherpunks may choose to sacrifice profit, or recognition for in
the interests of deployment.

Tho' actually even these assumptions you are making are not always
correct: for example Eric Young does not charge for his software, Eric
gets lots of recognition (partly because his license asks for this --
"this software includes work by Eric Young" requirement); Eric I dare
say has as much consultancy work offered to him to work on developing
free code as he has hours for.

I ended up doing some paid crypto development work on SSLeay (the
resulting additions were also BSD licensed), and the person asking me
to do this commented that they had asked Eric, but he had too much
work.

So your theory doesn't work in this case: Eric is getting to make
money, get recognition, and maximise deployment.
