I beleave that this is quite unlikely.  Usenet is infact bigger then the
internet as a whole.  Shutting down usenet would be a difficalt task,  how
are you going to convinvince all thouse peaple who like usenet to give it
up.  In fact how are you going to convinve copernise like zippo and
altoba who are dedcated to providing usenet connectiverty to give up there
primery money sorce.
