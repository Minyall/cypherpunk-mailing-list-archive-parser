So hide the keyscan in the memory counter code. Would work externaly, would
probably not show up on TEMPEST. Since both the keyscan and the memory scan
are repetitive TEMPEST might have a problem telling them apart. Provided you
could get the keyscan in the same footprint as the mem check the BIOS
would not show up as anomolous in size. As long as they're not running
around doing checksums you'd be ok (I suspect).
