And computerized textual analyses of Shakespeare was one of the most
publicized applications of the computers in the 60s. I remember reading
several stories about this then. And I recall an exhibit on the results of
such computerized search, as of around 1968 or so, at the Folger
Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C. (a class outing).

As when Detweiler or someone proposed this as a "neat thing for Cypherpunks
to do" a couple of years ago, the idea was old before 98% of this list were
born.

Not saying it's not still an interesting research topic, just that it's a
well-established field. And most of the low-hanging fruit has been picked.
