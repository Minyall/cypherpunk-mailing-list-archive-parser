Or, delay the return signal and use a paraboloid reflector.  This would
limit a spy's knowledge to the angle from the tower that you were
transmitting from, and the maximum distance from the tower that you could
be sitting at.  The paraboloid reflector would limit the ability for
someone to triangulate your location, depending on how narrow the beam is
focused.. Of course, if they really wanted to find you, they would walk
along the line of transmission until they ran right into you :).

Sure, the average joe is not going to go to the trouble of modifying his
cell phone and using a paraboloid reflector.. and even if he did, a
remailer type of system would be much more secure.  I guess the average
unaware joe is just going to have to get used to being shafted as a result
of his ignorance.  Isn't that how it's always been?

Question: How could true anarchy be guaranteed for stupid people like Joe?

What me worry..
