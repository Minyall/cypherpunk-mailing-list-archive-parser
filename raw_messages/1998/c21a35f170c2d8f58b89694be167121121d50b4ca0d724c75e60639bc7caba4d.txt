Yep. Give the man a cigar.

The paralysis of the U.S. government is heartwarming. No talk about sending
troops to Kosovo, no plans to give the IMF more money to send to Russian
and Wall Street mafiosos (mafiosi?), no talk of sending life preservers to
the tens of millions of Bengalis drowning and sinking into the muck in
Dacca, and not much of anything else.

I love it.
