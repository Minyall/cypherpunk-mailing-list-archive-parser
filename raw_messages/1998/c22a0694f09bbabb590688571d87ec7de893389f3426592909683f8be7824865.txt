	And it clearly isn't.   With the exception of cellphone to
cellphone traffic on one providers system (especially if it is GSM) the
traffic gets sent in the clear over trunking which is not particularly
well protected (and on occasion over microwave backhauls from cell sites
in the clear), to wire line phones which are often very vulnerable to
wiretaps.  And all of these are subject to CALEA access, and many also
to various  subrosa access via mechanisms provided for test and
maintainence and remote configuration of the system and trouble
diagnosis (mechanisms well and trully exploited by phreakers over the
years and well known and understood by the spooks as well).

	Without end to end encryption with secure key material the
security of any phone is weak at best, link encryption of vulnerable
links such as RF paths will keep the nosey out and raise the bar enough
so as to discourage that kind of penetration by professionals, but if
the call goes through switching and trunking infrastructure in the clear
it is  hardly difficult for large and powerful organizations to get
there hands on it if they really need it...

	And of course if they really get desparate, they can bug
the area the conversation is taking place in... or even the phones...
