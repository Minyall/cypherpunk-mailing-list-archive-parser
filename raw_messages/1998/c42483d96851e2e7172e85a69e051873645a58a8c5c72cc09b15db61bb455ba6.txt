          Repeat/Meganet's Unbreakable Virtual Matrix Encryption Takes
          the Market by Storm; Finally in 1998 Absolute Security...

          LA Times 02-JAN-98 LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 31,
          1997--Finally Meganet's highly acclaimed unbreakable encryption,
          Virtual Matrix Encryption (VME) is for sale. Meganet, a San
          Fernando Valley software development company, is proud to
          announce the release of a full line of encryption products.

          VME 98 is available in six (6) levels of front-end applications
          in three (3) flavors: DOS, Win 16 (Windows 3.x), and Win
          32 (Windows 95 & NT). The VME 98 Standard Edition, VME
          98 Professional Edition, VME 98 Enterprise Edition, VME 98
          Custom Client Edition, VME 98 Custom Server Edition, & VME 98
          Batch Server Edition provide unprecedented security, options,
          and flexibility. The pricing ranges from $100.00 for a single
          retail license to over $1,000,000.00 for the most sophisticated
          VME 98 Batch Server Edition.

          In addition, three (3) SDK's (Software Developer Kits) are
          ready to assist software developers in easily integrating
          VME 98 into their existing and future products. The three (3)
          SDK's include an 8bit DOS Engine, 16bit Windows DLL (Win 3.x)
          and 32bit Windows DLL (Win 95 & NT).

          The possibilities are endless with the array of VME 98
          products. Now any application including but not limited
          to Internet commerce, Government communications, banking
          transactions, corporate secrets and personal computer data
          can be guaranteed complete impenetrability.

          Yes, the VME 98 is the same product that was posted on the
          Internet with a $1 million reward for anyone that could break
          a VME encrypted file. Over fifty five thousand (55,000) tried
          with zero (0) success.

          Yes, the VME 98 is the same product that challenged Microsoft,
          IBM, AT&T, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, America Online,
          Netscape, etc. to break a VME encrypted file. All the great
          computer minds in this country have had an opportunity to
          dispel the bold claims of unbreakable encryption, yet none have.

          Meganet is pleased to offer the same standard of excellence
          with all of the VME 98 packages.
