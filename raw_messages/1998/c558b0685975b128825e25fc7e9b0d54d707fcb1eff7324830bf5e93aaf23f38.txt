There is some of the latter involved, but the military
does have times they'd like to check out web pages
without traffic analysis, just as they'd like
to be order lots of pizza without folks figuring out
that they're up to something.  This includes several cases -
using the public or civilian-government internet,
and also using their own intranets which may be less
than totally secure.
