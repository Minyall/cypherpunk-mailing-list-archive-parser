>From Tim May:

: "You've stolen my property, you've imprisoned my friends, you've passed
: laws making us all criminals, you've started wars to enrich your
: military-industrial complex friends, and you're corrupt bastards. You can
: forget about some kind of "libertarian amnesty." It's going to be payback
: time, with at least hundreds of thousands of statist judges, politicians,
: cops, soldiers, and other such persons going to the gallows.
: Payback time.  Welfare recipients are going to have to pay back all that
: they have stolen, with compounded interest. Out of their pockets, or while in
: labor camps.  Payback time."
