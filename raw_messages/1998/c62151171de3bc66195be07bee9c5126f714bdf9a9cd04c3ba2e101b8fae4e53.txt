Do you have some kind of emergency which requires that you get a web TB with
java Real Soon Now, but that stinkin' rotten billg is making life hard on
you?  Like there aren't other companies working in this market as well, and
will jump at the opportunity to include features left out by their
competitors (in particular, Microsoft) for the benefit of whiners like you?
It's not like he (or the other companies working on this project) *owe* it
to you, you know.

It's more like you have to wait for someone to come up with the idea, then
to do all the work of putting it together, then you have to decide whether
you want it, then you put your money down.   You're so juvenile.  But so
amusing.
