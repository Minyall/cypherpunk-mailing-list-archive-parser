The destruction of the al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum,
Sudan, has left that country with little reserve of a medicine to fight
malaria. The factory, which was thought to manufacture chemical warfare
agents, was destroyed by US cruise missiles. The factory produced half
of Sudan's medicines, leaving no supplies of chloroquine, the standard
treatment for malaria. By destroying the means to make medicine to treat
malaria, endemic to Sudan, the US has essentially engaged in biological
warfare by proxy.

A request by aid workers for more aid from the British Government to
help supply medicine to Sudan has been rejected. Story at:
