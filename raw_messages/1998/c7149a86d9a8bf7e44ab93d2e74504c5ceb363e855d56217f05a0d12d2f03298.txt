Subject: UK Government unveils crypto escrow legislation

The UK government has announced legislation designed to force 
escrow of confidentiality keys on UK netizens.

They are planning a licenced system of Certificate Authorities in an 
attempt to force key escrow down the throats of British computer 
users. This could be a model for other governments. The idea is 
that digital signatures get preferential legal treatment if certified by 
a licenced CA, but to get a licence you must escrow confidentiality 
keys.  

The licensing authority will be OFTEL, the telecoms regulator.
