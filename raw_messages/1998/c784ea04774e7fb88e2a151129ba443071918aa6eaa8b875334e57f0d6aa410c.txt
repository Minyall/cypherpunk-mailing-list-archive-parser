And the demand for such ecash systems is real. I personally carried a $10
million offer for a non-exclusive license for the blind signature patent
to David Chaum. He declined the offer. "The patent is not for license". 
DigiCash's CEO since March of last year, Mike Nash, also told me that
DigiCash was not considering licensing the patent. I knew that day that it
was time to quit. Not surprisingly, nobody heard from DigiCash since.
