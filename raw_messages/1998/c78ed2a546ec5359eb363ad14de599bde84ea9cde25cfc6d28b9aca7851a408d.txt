I'd wager we all saw  it, and couldn't think of anythign clever to say.  

Funny thing about all this:  In a recent Newsweek a former Congressman who
just got out of jail was talking about how he was disgusted byt the
current Congress.  *ALL* they do is posture, they don't even bother going
through the motions of passing legislation.   The Congress of the 80s at
least *did* something.  (Okay, so it wasn't very useful, or good, but a
Congress that does nothign can't be changed with any effect, one that
actually gets things done once in a while, if persuaded to change a
little, might be a benefit...)

If anyone cares, I might still have that one, I can look up who it was...
