Well, first you get a big, long pipe. You cut a hole in the top to let
some oxygen in. Attach one end to the natural gas line, and stick your
head in the other end. Turn on the gas. Wait about a minute, then drop a
match into the hole at the top and congratulations, for you've reached a
different and greater incarnation. 

Remember: Inhaling natural gas won't normally kill you, and it needs
oxygen to burn. So you have to blow it up. Instant pipe bomb.
