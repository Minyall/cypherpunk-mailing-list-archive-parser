Why does the Navy research onion routing?

Only reason I can think of is so that .mil can 
study other sites anonymously, or communicate
amongst themselves using anonymous-routing-tech
to avoid traffic analysis.

The other practical possibility is that they're happy
to have smart CS people and will fund whatever they
want to do, just to keep them.
