(AES is the Advanced Encryption Standard, a NIST standardisation
process ongoing at present to select a replacement encryption
algorithm for DES.  Algorithm submissions were requested by NIST from
any interested parties.)

AES requires submitters to include reference java implementations.

Systemics provides a BSD licensed (free for commercial and
non-commercial use) java crypto library called cryptix.  Cryptix has
an IJCE interface which means that it integrates with other java
crypto apps as a standard java cryptographic service class.

Systemics are interested to add AES candidate algorithms to cryptix,
and are offering to provide the java implementation to any AES
algorithm submitters, see:

Systemics also are interested in encouraging programmers to join in
this effort:
