Let there be a large number of sites. If part of these fail, there
are others that are successful. (Compare evolution.)

How, for example, can they affects the functioning of an archive, if 
you get the right people and machine?

It is not true that there are more gangsters in the small than in 
the powerful nations. What do you mean by stability (which has plenty 
of meanings)?

I suppose that running an archive is a voluntary (self-sacrificing)
act of a benovolent person ready to offer his service to the public. 
If his site has to close down sometime later, he has to accept his 
bad luck. Why should you care so much minutely for him? (And you
say below that the money problem is trivial!)

So it rests to find people who have the time and (that small) money 
and energy to run sites and some countries that aren't going to
have strict cryto laws in the near future. THAT, however, is
difficult, I believe.
