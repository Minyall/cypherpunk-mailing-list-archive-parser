Odd.  When I first got a card with the stripe, I was a little paranoid so
I took a bar magnet and erased it.  Actually, I don't know whether my
eraser worked because nobody has ever asked to swipe my card thru a
reader.  I got a wallet with a plastic fold-out so if someone asks to see
my id, I open my wallet and show it to them, then put it away.
