(Cypherpunks, the Brave Combo's latest studio release ('Group Dance Epidemic -
Fun .... and Functional!' - Rounder Records) is themed on my war with the
Bucketheads that led me to this list.  The cover picture depicts the
Bucketheads (a group of people pretending to be having a good time.)  It was
the leader of the Bucketheads that subscribed me to this list (I'm VERY sure).
The song, 'The Jeffrey', in particular, is all about the 'flame' (as 'they'
call it) war, and based much on some of my posts.  The list is now un-
moderated, and in the control of free persons.  Check out that cd.)
