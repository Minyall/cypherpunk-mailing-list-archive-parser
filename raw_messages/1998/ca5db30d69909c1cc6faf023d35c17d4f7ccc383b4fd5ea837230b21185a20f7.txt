These companies are attempting to provide the services desired by
their customers.  These are generally cautious, conservative parents
who want to allow their young children access to the internet without
them stumbling over dangerous or disturbing information.  Like it or not,
many parents are very protective of their children.  We have no right
to force our own views of childrearing on them.

The filtering companies are filling a legitimate need in the marketplace.
They are not evil and they are not trying to prevent adults from viewing
the material they desire via their own personal accounts.  They give
concerned parents a sense of safety in allowing their children to use
the internet, and in that way allow young people access to the net who
would not otherwise be allowed to use it.
