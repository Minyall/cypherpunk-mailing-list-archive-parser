That's Joel McNamara's bountiful and ever-growing TEMPEST site:

   http://www.eskimo.com/~joelm/tempest.html

While the work of Markus Kuhn and Ross Anderson provide more recent
unclassified information Joel has a standing request for any TEMPEST
material that is created by research or liberated from tax-pits and fat
corp labs. Some black stuff comes over the transom.

RF and EM offensive and defensive weapons are whitehot in national 
security labs around the globe, and probably equally so in commercial 
cages where NDA transgressors are hoovering dual-usage technologies 
out of MOD's coffers like subway turnstile-suckers.
