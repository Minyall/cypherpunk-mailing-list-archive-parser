	Traditional usage of the term "black market" (at least in my
experience with the term) includes the markets for things often proscribed
(such as weapons, drugs, abortions) or marketed outside of the legally
mandated channels (food, clothing, liquor etc. purchased from non-approved
stores) or w/out government approved taxes being levied. Legal issues, not
moral ones. To try to discuss the markets in terms of "human rights", or to
expect the market to reflect ones own morality is ridiculous.

	Is slavery wrong? Would a Saudi Arabian, or a Kuwaitee (Kuwaition?)
agree? What about drugs, does their use violate your human rights
principle? Would someone from the South Side of Chicago, or Watts agree?

	The market itself is only concerned with legality, not morality.
Discussions of right and wrong do not take place at that point, and neither
do questions of "human rights".

	My point was that as you move towards the "ideal" of a free market,
there is less and less that one can call a "black market". True, things can
still be illegal--Slavery, drugs and the rest, and those things which

	Oh, and Extortion is already part of the market, it's called taxes.
