I fail to see any crypto-relevance in this question, but Mr. Clinton
has made it perfectly clear that he doesn't consider getting a blow
job to be sexual relations.

As for his telling anybody to lie, hmm... we have his deposition where he
admitted having sex with Gennifer Flowers (sp?), and we have a taped
phone call where he asked her to deny it.

Clinton has as much credibility as Semeer Parekh, Sandy Sandfart, and
the rest of the C2Net gang. (Gotta say something cryptorelevant :-)
