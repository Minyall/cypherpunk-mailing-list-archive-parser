Duncan,

I apologize for my ignorance. I am not very well aware of this Heinlein
fellow.

What I am looking for is a practical guide book on how to deal with
cops and other law enforcement/jackbooted thug types, in the manner
that minimizes my long term damage. Something along the lines of "You
and the Police!", by Boston T. Party, a book that I greatly enjoyed.

The ideal book would explain my rights, typical reactions of LE, 
precedents, some practical matters, dealing with hostile LE, etc etc.
Would be especially valuable to me as I am a foreigner.

What I am NOT looking for is something about UN troops hiding in
my backyard, choosing the best gun to shoot tax collectors, etc.
