	I've recently begun looking for internet telephony products that
employ reasonably secure encryption on-the-fly.  Now, I've found Nautilus,
and PGPFone, but neither product appears to have been updated for quite a
while now.  I was just wondering if anybody could give me recommendations
for more up-to-date products, and perhaps comparisons between those
available.

	Thank you.
