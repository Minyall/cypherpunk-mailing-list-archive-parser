Just a quick update from sixdegrees(tm). Unfortunately Isaac 
Lee (zac@pulp-fiction.com) asked not to be listed as your 
contact with sixdegrees.

We also wanted to make sure you were aware that you currently 
have no other confirmed contacts, so it will be hard for you to
have a productive sixdegrees experience. As you probably know, 
without any confirmed contacts, you won't get any results from our 
networking searches. 

So, we just wanted to recommend that you head over to 
http://www.sixdegrees.com , log-in, and go to MY CONTACTS 
to list additional relationships.
