I traveled by train all the way to Florida from Rhode Island once.  24
hours straight it took man and I swore I would never do it again. 
40-50 people per car and basically one bathroom per car.  Come morning
time man, the lines for the bathrooms stretched out of the cars. 
Screw that, I could have flown and made it in 3 hours. Plus it's
easier for the gov't to stop trains and search them, I'd rather go
with the flight.
