Even if the signals can be distributed on par with the distribution
of the data itself?  Could this be a 'meta' application that has not
been
considered?  Perhaps not, because sigint analysis normally increases an
attacker's intelligence on the subject and doesn't decrease it.

No, I wouldn't either.  Your point here indicates that whereas
historically
privacy was increased through movement, the reverse may be true now or
at least at some future date.  Namely, that entities are (or will be)
tracked by their movement and not simply location.
