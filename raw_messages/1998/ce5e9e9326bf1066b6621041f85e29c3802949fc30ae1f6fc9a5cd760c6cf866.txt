Spamming is theft of services, sir.  I am forced to pay for a "service"
that I did not request.  I, and everyone else, pays for spam either
directly in connect time, or because my ISP wastes bandwidth handling the
stuff.  I am not that much bothered by that it is advertising, or pure
junk, but that I pay for it.

Make people bear the true cost of spam, and it will stop.
