Both Right and WrongC2 (or other) certification is given to a product system,
not an OS  nor an installation.  NT on a specific configuration of a specific
manufacturer, fo instance. (and with a specific mix of other software)  The
intent was to make available Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) systems for gov
purchase.)  But the concept was generated in the mainframe/Mini frame of mind.

The network issue is one with deep ramifications and not as simple as listed in
the above Para.  Two totally secure nets can be not secure when connected to
each other because of the data interface for security levels, user permisisions
etc.

NCSC has a whole line of books on it all.  Red is the Network Interpretation,
Orange is the Criteria itself.
