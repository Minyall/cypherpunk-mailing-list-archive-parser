You need to be careful about posting information like that about your
children, especially since there is a registered sex offender, Gary Lee
Burnore <gburnore@databasix.com>, living in your neighborhood.

Why did you post information like that publicly in the first place if you
didn't want people to read it?

Also, it's amazing what people can dredge up on you.  One fellow was harassed
by having a 10 year old California tax lien posted worldwide to usenet in an
attempt to silence his dissenting opinions.
