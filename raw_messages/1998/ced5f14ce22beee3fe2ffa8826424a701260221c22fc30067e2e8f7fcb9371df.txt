What we need is a mechanism to punish the politicians who go down the
Big
Brother path *and* the companies who are making big profits helping
them.
Simple check and balance alternative #4:
    Receive a buck of public funds as income, lose your
right to vote due to conflict of interest.  This applies to all civil
servants, politicians, military personnel, LEAs, welfare recipients, subsidy
recipients, medicare recipients, social security recipients, incarcerated
prisoners (they already have it)  -- and any others who have a vested
interest in the continuance of the gravy train. Hereafter referred to as
the 'Separation of Socialism and State amendment'. Perhaps they could all
form a union and tax each other for their common good.  Actually,
when you read the wording of the tax code, this is exactly what was intended
(http://www.tax-freedom.com), and is, in fact, the law.
