Why pay attention to ill-supported rumors? The source code is publicly
available at www.pgpi.com. If there is a security issue then it can be
critiqued with reference to the places in the source code that are the
cause of the problem. If someone has done this, I haven't been paying close
enough attention and I apologize for ranting. If not, then I would dismiss
such claims as almost certainly baseless.
