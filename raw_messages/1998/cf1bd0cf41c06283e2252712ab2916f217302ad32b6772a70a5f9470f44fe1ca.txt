Uh, how so? Distribution copyright covers first-sale only, after that
the owner can lend or sell that item. If it were not for this, public
and private libraries could not exist.

This works for IP protected in tangible form, but falls down for
electronic IP. Software is not protected by distribution copyright, it
is instead licensed.
