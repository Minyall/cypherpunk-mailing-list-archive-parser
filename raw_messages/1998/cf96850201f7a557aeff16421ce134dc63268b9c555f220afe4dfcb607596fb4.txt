Very true.

There's already a way to do this: cloning. This is not always done
just to avoid paying for service.  Certain cloners are entirely able
and willing to pay for cellular service, but they demand anonymity.

Somebody should point out to the carriers that they could get rid of
much of the incentive to clone phones if they simply offered a
legit way to remain anonymous.
