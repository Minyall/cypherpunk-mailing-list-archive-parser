If you send me a check for $350 I will agree to issue the statement "Hey!
respect intellectual property!"

But it is by no means a duty of anyone to make any kind of political statement.

That is, to arguments along the lines of "It is the duty of all to protect
X." Or to condemn Y. Or to support Z.
