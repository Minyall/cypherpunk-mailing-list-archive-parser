I have collected the available loop-crypto patches in the
international kernel patch.  It contains blowfish,twofish,serpent, and
cast-128 modules (and an idea module which I haven't ported yet).  The
loopback modules have been updated to work with the latest loopback
patches.  I plan on adding other AES candidates - I have free
implementations of rc6, rijndael, mars, and dfc.  The patch is
available from:

ftp://ftp.kerneli.org/pub/linux/kerneli/v2.1/patch-int-2.1.125.2.gz

I have a collection of utilities you'll need and other 2.0-crypto
stuff mirrored at:

ftp://ftp.kerneli.org/pub/linux/kerneli/net-source/
