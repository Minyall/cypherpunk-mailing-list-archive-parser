Sorry to intrude on everyone, but I'm looking  to fill a position in the
Northern Virginia area.  I'm looking for a secure messaging engineer,
dealing heavily in S/MIME and/or PGP.  It is a very llucrative spot for
the person with the right qualifications.  If anyone could help me, I
would appreciate it.

P.S. If this is out of line, let me know, and I'll apolizgize profusely.
