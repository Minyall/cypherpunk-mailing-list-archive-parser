The weakness of Bell's scheme was always that it only worked (so to speak)
with well-known people.

While there are some who want well-known people dead, most murders-for-hire
happen for personal or financial reasons.

Given untraceable payment systems, and buttressed with untraceable escrow
systems, a much more efficient approach is simply to hire the killers
untraceably.

And the fluff about "picking the death date" is a side issue, one which
merely makes the whole thing more cumbersome.
