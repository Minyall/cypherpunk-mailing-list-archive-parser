There's a batch of PKZip and other program cracker tools at:

   http://www.theargon.com/tools.html

With links to other sites, which link to more, into the dark psychoses
of Trans-Ural and Andean regions -- some of the DNS's are off the
charts.

Even so, none seem to work on the pci-pack.exe I grabbed, at least
not for me. The file may not be complete, or it's a decoy, or all the
vile crackers I unzipped are DIRT-virii death-writhing in my unzapped 
prostate.
