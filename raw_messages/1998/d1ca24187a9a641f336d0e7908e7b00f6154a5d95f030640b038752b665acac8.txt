Tthe remarkably hackable nature of  Netscape's "weak" crypto has been marveled
at here and in the press, but has no one else speculated on how this state of
affairs came to be?  I, for one, would like to thank the anonymous cypherpunks
toiling in the bowels of Netscape.  An amazing feat, achieving world-wide
distribution of millions of copies of strong crypto, the Feds all unknowing.  
Does anyone here _not_ think this was the deliberate act of one or more
cryptoanarchists?
