In response to your request for a new sixdegrees(tm) password, 
we have sent you the following temporary password: leapsink. 

As soon as you come to the site, http://www.sixdegrees.com , and use 
it to log-in on the home page, it will become your official 
password, and your old password will be deactivated. 

(If you end up remembering your old password and use that to 
log-in at the site before using this new temporary password, 
the temporary password will be deactivated.)

This may seem wacky, but it's for your security. And, either 
way, once you successfully log-in at the site, you can go to 
your personal profile and choose whatever password you like - 
in fact, we encourage you to do so.

If you never requested a new password and got this message in 
error, just continue using your old password and e-mail us at 
issues@sixdegrees.com.
