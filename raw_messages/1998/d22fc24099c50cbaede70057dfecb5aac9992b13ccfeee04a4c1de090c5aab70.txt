This camel and banana thing has gone WAY out of cypherpunk lane. This sounds like
material for a 'how-to-feed-a-camel-over-long-exposure-to-desert-heat newsgroup'
which, surpassingly, just might exist... not? :- ) prove me wrong :- )

About a year ago there was this program about cars on the Discovery Channel...
forgot it's detail... anyway, this weird prof. and a bunch of his student wanted to
prove that you can make cars with anything... so they got banana peals, cut them
into slices and made forms out of them. This did not create the essence of a car,
the engine, however they did make the chassis into a very nice bright yellow :- )
... OUT OF BANANA PEALS <:- )

So next time you eat breakfast, eat a camel ! .. WAIT... I mean a banana ! :- )
