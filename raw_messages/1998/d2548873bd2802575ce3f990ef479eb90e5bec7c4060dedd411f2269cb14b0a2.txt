My rough understanding: the 'P' value is a measure on the hypothesis that
the test sample is a truly random sample, where truly random is defined by
the expected 
statistical properties being measured.  Eg in 100 bits you expect to find
50 1's; 
if you count 48, is your 100-bit sample consistant with it being
unpredictable?

If you get values near 1.0 your sample is not likely taken from a random pool.


Try this: generate 10Meg from a block cipher feeding back on itself.  Diehard
will pass these.  (Diehard needs 10M samples)

Now run FM hiss into your soundcard.  Sample this at 8Khz (to avoid
temporal correlation)
and save to a file til you have 10Meg.  Diehard will reject this.  Make a
larger
file, and then gzip it down to 10Meg.  (That it shrinks indicates its symbols
don't carry a full bit.)  Run Diehard on this.  It will pass more tests but
not all.


Take the FM hiss, feed it into a stream cipher, and start burning those OTPs.


Do this with a detuned *video* tuner for more bandwidth.
