Indeed, discussion of "what to do about spam?" periodically consumes all of
the main lists I'm on. Discussion of spam is worse than the actual spam.

Same for me. I can delete commercial advertisements ("spam") in seconds.

Well said. "Be careful what you ask for."

Anti-spam bills are already wending their way through Congressional
committees. If passed, an FCC-like authority over the Net will have been
granted.

(Though probably ineffectual, given the use of offshore sites, throwaway
accounts, etc. The real effect will probably be to usher in an era of
mandatory identification for account opening, which is pernicious, and
various other tracking and surveillance systems.)


The only  "spam" which really bothers me is/are _mail bombs_, where
hundreds or even thousands of messages fill my mailbox. I've been hit twice
with these attacks. And a friend of mine received 25,000 messages from one
sender...he sued and won a substantial settlement from the employer of the
guy who mail bombed him.

But such attacks will likely not be affected by anti-spam laws anyway.
Perps can use sites in other countries, beyond the reach of the laws. And
remailers. And so on.
