Ahh, but it's not *you* who's putting the restrictions on your software,
but the U.S. government.  As far as I know (not that I'm a lawyer, or
anything) the U.S. govt. doesn't care what your license says --if it's
strong crypto, it's not supposed to be exported. 

The license is probably irrelevant, as far as import/export is
concerned.
