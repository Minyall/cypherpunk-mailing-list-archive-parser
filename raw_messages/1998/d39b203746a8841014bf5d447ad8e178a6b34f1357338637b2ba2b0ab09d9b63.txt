A bit more on getting a copy of the report:

   An Appraisal of Technologies of Political Control

It is Scientific and Technological Options Assessment (STOA) of the
European Parliament offering the report, not British MEP Glyn Ford, 
who was its sponsor. For a copy to be sent by snail, fax a request 
to STOA in Luxembourg:

  352-4300-22418

No electronic version is available from STOA. Draft reports
remain in paper format until finalized by the European
Parliament, which may take a while.

STOA's publications web site was last updated in July 1996, 
and its rep apologized for the trailing-edge tech.
