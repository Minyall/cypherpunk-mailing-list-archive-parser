    well, I would have gone up to Nevada to get a license, but they
    have been doing it longer than CA.  now Utah is doing it....
    it will be universal before long. when I asked in CA if I could
    refuse to be fingerprinted, they said; "sure... as long as you 
    dont want a license"  --real white of 'em.  Utah said basically
    the same thing.

    that and they already have us feeling like.

        when cash is outlawed,
        only outlaws will have cash.
