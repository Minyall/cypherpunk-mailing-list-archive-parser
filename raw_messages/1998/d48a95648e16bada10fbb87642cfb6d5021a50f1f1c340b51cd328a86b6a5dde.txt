DNA testing can never prove anything.  It can rule out someone completely
and statistically make it
very unlikely to be anyone else.  But what about identical sib's.  They all
have exactly the same DNA!

There are cases of such children where one becomes a pillar of society and
the other less so.

A DNA database would allow loads of stuff to be done.  How about a designed
disease or toxin that
only affects certain gene carriers.  This could be added to the food chain
at any time you wanted
to incapacitate a particular person or group of people without comprimising
any one else.

Fun hmmm!!!
