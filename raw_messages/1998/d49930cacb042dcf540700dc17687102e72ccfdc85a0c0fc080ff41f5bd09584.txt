This allegedly is forwarded from CJ, though from an unknown source 
so think twice:

    Thu, Sep 09 1998 

    part of a communication received via the anonymous route:

      "In the meantime, I hope that anyone who has possession of 
      the PGP Secret Keys for Toto, TruthMonger, Son of Gomez, Magic 
      Circle, etc., feels free to use them to digitally sign messages 
      to the CyperPunks Disturbed Male LISP.

      "Passwords:  sog, sog709, sog709cejCJP,sog709cjpCEJ, D'Shauneaux, 
      D'shauneaux, and others..."
