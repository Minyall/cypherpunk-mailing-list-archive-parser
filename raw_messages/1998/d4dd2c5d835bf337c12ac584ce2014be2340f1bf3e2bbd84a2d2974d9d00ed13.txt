Come on, Igor, just go out and make a bonfire. I can't see why this is
turning into a major thread, "How Igor can burn a box of documents."

As for buying H2SO4, of _course_ one can buy it! But it's a really dumb way
to destroy some papers.

Just burn them. I don't get what the problem is.

(And don't repeat that they are "hard to burn." Unless they are made of
some other than paper, which is doubtful, they will burn.)
