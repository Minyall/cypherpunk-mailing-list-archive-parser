Oh come on, let's not get into sophistry. And lasers are not considered to
be radio frequency devices by anyone I know of...visible, IR, and UV lasers
are all treated as _photon_ devices, "light."  (Yes, yes, I know about
particles vs. waves.)

Nope, they'll still get out. The parallel mirror scenario.

We're talking about signal strength of the emitted RF  being knocked down
80 or 100 dB  by the shielding. This is a common way of talking about the
effectiveness of a Faraday cage.
