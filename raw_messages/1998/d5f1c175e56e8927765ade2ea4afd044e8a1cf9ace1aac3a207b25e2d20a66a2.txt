I maintain a list of college and gruaduate level courses in security 
and cryptography at

   http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~rubin/courses.html

>From time to time, I like to update the list. If you know of
a full semester course in crypto or security that is not on my
list please let me know. URLs are especially useful. Also, if you 
see something on my list that is out of date, let me know.

Thanks,
Avi
