I'm more than suspicious....the thing is written in a spoof motif.

On the other hand, remember how several of us were apparently "warned" (in
the threatening sense) by the Internal Revenue Service by weird forwardings

Maybe someone from the State Department is pulling the same trick.

If so, Matt still has enough time to lock and load.....
