The 1999 RSA Data Security Conference will be held
in San Jose, Sunday January 17th thru Thursday,
January 21. It will bring a lot of out-of-town
members of these mailing lists into the Bay Area.

Last year, the date of the January Cypherpunks
Physical Meeting was shifted so that conference
attendees who stayed over the weekend could turn
up. Several did, and I gave a repeat performance
of my conference presentation.

I'd like to suggest shifting the date again. The 
physical meetings seem to be normally held second 
Saturdays, which  suggests a Jan 9 date. If it 
could be moved up to the 16th, people could 
arrive on Friday (or early Saturday) and 
attend the cpunk meeting. Many conference
attendees will be staying over that Saturday
night to take advantage of the cheaper airfares.
