In addition, the last man impeached and convicted by Congress (circa 1988)
Judge Alcy Hastings (sp?) was convicted for perjury in a tax evasion case
in which he was acquitted of the original charges.  Hastings was later
elected to Congress from Florida and last week dissed Clinton by not
attending a fundraiser he held there for the Democrat candidate for
governor.  Hastings said that he has yet to make up his mind on Clinton and
wants to review the evidence.
