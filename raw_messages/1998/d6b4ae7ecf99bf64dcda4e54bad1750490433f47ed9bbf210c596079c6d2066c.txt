Hi all,

First of all, since I am not subscribed to the list, please reply to my
address atu5713@compuserve.com

You know, there is a program written in the Euphoria programming language
that helps in chaining remailers.  It also works with PGP.  Before I try
it, however, I want to know if the remailers in the .ini file are still
operating.  Would someone please tell me if the following remailers are
still operating.  * means that the remailer supports encryption by pgp.
