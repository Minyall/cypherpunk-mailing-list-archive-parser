No, this isn't maths, this is camels, and they'll give you as much
resistance as they feel like, and *you* may be looking for the most
bananas moved across the desert, but the camel's perfectly happy to
sit here and eat all the bananas here, crossing 0 miles of desert,
or dump you 50 miles out in the desert and come back and eat the
bananas.

But other than the PERL book, what's it got to do with cypherpunks?
Just that bananas are related to Bill Clinton?

				Thanks!
