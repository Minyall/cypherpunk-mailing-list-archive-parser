The Fall issue of Foreign Policy has an article, "The Great
Superterrorism Scare," which critiques the national "obsession"
with the threat of terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction:

It examines the reasons for the obsession, who is promoting
it, who benefits, and what problems it may cause by diverting
attention and resources away from genuine threats of lesser
magnitude from religious cults, loners, antitaxers, militias and
those with raging paranoia against the government.

It's worth noting that the author recommends arrests be 
allowed of suspicious domestic hostiles though there is no proof 
of criminal intent, and that the FBI and CIA be freed from 
limitations on surveilling and investigating US citizens.
