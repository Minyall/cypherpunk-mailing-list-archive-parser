On the 10 Freeway about 2 miles east of Downtown Los Angeles, three are
overhead rails on both sides of the freeway with a "sensor" of some type
over EACH lane. A total of about 10 sensors. There are also cameras all
over the place. I would imagine that it is a future revenue center for the
state of California. Obfuscate your license plate to lower your road taxes.
