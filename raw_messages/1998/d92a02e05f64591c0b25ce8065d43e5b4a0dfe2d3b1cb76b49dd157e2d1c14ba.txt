	The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments.  When 
sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation.  When the 
President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: 
and no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of 
the Members present. 

	Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to 
removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of 
honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted 
shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and 
Punishment, according to Law.

This would seem to indicate that the only issue a federal prosecutor needs
to be interested in is proving *some* illegal act took place. Not what that
act may have actualy been, though describing it may be required.

Once that is resolved the other legal aspects fall to the attorney general
or district attorney in the appropriate region.

With that in mind, its pretty interesting at all the money and effort that's
been spent on nothing that is materialy relevant to the issue at hand.

Though it is interesting that the issue of profit (running a business?)
comes up in the consequences.
