    very true, for those who have never been deployed into the
    face of the beast. 

    those who have been in combat have an entirely different
    attitude.     

    the peacetime Army is a often a goldbrickers union for lack
    of something better to do. and it is definitely not true in
    the Corps with the exception of the few who take the two
    year stint and four years active reserve and are somewhat
    disillusioned by the inactivity as they never hit the floats
    or are otherwise deployed.
