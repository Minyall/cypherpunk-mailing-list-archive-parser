Probably. Under RICO and associated laws they can get anyone for anything.
Well, except Komrade Klinton.

Quite.

One partial solution I see is to rewrite premail in C so it runs at a
respectable speed[1], fix some of the bugs[2], integrate it with more
mailers, and then encourage everybody to subscribe through nyms. I'd love
to see them try to prosecute users at nym.alias.net by presenting a court
order to Community Connexion in Oakland. ;) 

[1] Yes, it's really slow on slower machines. 
[2] One of the most obvious is when Premail sends out 3 copies of a
message for a 2 remailer chain, 9 copies for a 3 remailer chain, something
like 27 for a 4 remailer chain, and so on. If nothing else, that's a
security hole which allows people to know how many warrants they will
need.
