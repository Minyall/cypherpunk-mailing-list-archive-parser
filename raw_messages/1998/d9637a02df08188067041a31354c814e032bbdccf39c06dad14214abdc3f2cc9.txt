For all those watching the watchers, BXA recently changed their
configuration. corvette.bxa.doc.gov is now known as jade.bxa.doc.gov.
The IP addresses are different, but look at the configuration.. looks
like they just swapped two machines:

$ ftp corvette.bxa.doc.gov
Connected to corvette.bxa.doc.gov.

220 jade FTP proxy (Version 2.0) ready.
