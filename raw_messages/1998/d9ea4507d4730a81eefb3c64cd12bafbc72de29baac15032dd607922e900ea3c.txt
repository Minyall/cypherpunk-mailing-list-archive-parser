Come on people. We are talking SURVIVAL here. Can you ski your showers
if you do not have enough water?

The true answer is, if shit hits the fan and there is no water in the
faucet, almost all activity except drinking and washing hands and dishes
can be curtailed.

Even flushing toilets is not necessary as anyone can shit outside.

I am speaking out of personal experiences, living with water outages
while we were in the Russian countryside. It was no big deal, period.

It is included.

Much less.

Total: 2-3.

Correct.

Gary North is not stupid. he realizes all this, as it is not
rocket science.

Then why he keeps telling all this?

The answer is, to peddle his wares.

I am not suggesting that Y2K is going to be a cakewalk. Quite possibly
not. But Gary North is not worth listening to because he is biased and
has a conflict of interests.

I think that you had a good point... A long time ago I posted a "Skills
vs. guns" article to misc.survivalism. its point was, that in the long
run having good skills and health was more important than stocking up.

You can make semi-good "soap" from animal fat and ash.

No biggie.

Besides, if you don't want to be despised, just don't be clean.
