You are making the same mistake the previous poster made on this.

Orange Book == Standalone
Red Book    == Network

The numerious criteria for the various levels of trusted systems are too
numerious to list here. I *strongly* recomend obtaining copies of the
Rainbow Series from the NSA (they will mail a copy for free) and studying
the documentation. They are well written and easy to read (unlike many
such papers which are techno-bable filled).

There are aprox. 30 manuals in the Rainbow Series that cover a wide range
of topics related to Trusted Systems of which the Orange Book is a small
part. I doubt you could find more than 5 M$ employees that have read more
than a quarter of the manuals let alone are able to implement their
principals.
