OFFICIAL RCMP HATEMAILER

"Police physicians still slap newborn babies on their
soft little bottoms because they know that this new
little citizen will eventually be guilty of _something_!"
-
This message is NOT from from some namby-pamby, pacifist
citizen who bitches and whines every time that Canada
hosts foreign dictators who know how to keep their
citizens in line (to conserve the firing squad's
bullets).  
It was remailed by *real* men and women who have the
guts to make citizens *pay* for attempting to draw
attention to non-official viewpoints and values by 
assaulting them with potentially deadly toxix
substances.

Send all complaints and requests for blocking to:
<PRESIDENT@WHITEHOUSE.GOV>.
