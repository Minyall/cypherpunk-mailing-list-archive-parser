That would be my analysis as well. Note that the van Eck demonstration I
saw didn't even make use of the common analog tricks, such as using a
super heterodyne receiver. Not to mention the near magical capabilities of
a few Fourier transforms for pulling a nice, fat signal spike out of all
that "white noise".

There wasn't a single person watching said demonstration in that brutally
hot tent at HIP'97 that didn't walk away impressed. And I can off the top
of my head come up with a design that would improve the gain by at least
20dB over what was used there..
