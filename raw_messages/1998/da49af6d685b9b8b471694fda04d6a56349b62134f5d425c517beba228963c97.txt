It might be best not to develop encryption software in the US.  You
might enjoy working on encryption, but if export control makes it is
hard for the whole world-wide free software community to take
advantage of your work, it would be better to work on something else
not subject to export control, and leave encryption to people outside
the US.  There are plenty of people in other countries interested in
working on encryption.

The GNU replacements for PGP and SSH are being written outside the US,
by people who are not US citizens.  We will import them to the US, but
we will never need to export them.
