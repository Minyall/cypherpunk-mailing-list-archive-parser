Michael,

Was the amount of work involved really necessary? What do three layers
accomplish compared to just one?

Right.

Glue? Perhaps some weak glue that would not destroy the underlying paint.

My window has a mesh on it. Is that not enough?

Is that confirmed by evidence?

The reason for my question, I think that I somewhat value TEMPEST
protection, but not enough as to cover my whole room with expensive and
ugly looking copper or three layers of mesh and ferrite. I don't want
all of it to be too conspicious.
