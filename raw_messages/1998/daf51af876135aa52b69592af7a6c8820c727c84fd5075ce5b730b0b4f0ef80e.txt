Cpunks (and Bcc list),

I've had a kind offer from Judith to scan my HIP photos and
display them on the web (www.sabotage.org).  This should happen
in a few days.  The photos include Alex, Judith, DDT, Ulf, Ian Grigg,
Lucky, Sameer, Joichi and others.

I found Sameer perfectly pleasant.  IMO the best view to take on
mainstream views is that you can't usually tell.  Silence could indicate
killfiles rather than assent.
