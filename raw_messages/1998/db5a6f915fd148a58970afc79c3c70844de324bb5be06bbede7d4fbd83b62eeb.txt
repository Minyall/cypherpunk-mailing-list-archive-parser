In an age where it is accepted (and unpunished) behavior for the black-clad
ninja warriors to shoot through pregnant women, to burn children to death
in the name of publicity for the BATF, to raid the home of a woman who
refused to answer questions of the State psychiatric police, to shoot to
death a retired doctor who the raiders accidentally hit, and on and on,
other measures are needed.

(In none of these cases have the guilty parties been punished. If the State
will not restrain itself, other measures will be needed.)

This may well be why militias and survivalist groups are so actively
developing chemical and biological agents. (I hear that even some of the
dopers in the hills have gotten interested in Sarin release systems. Hoo
boy!)

Sad, but maybe one has to fight fire with fire. If a hundred SWAT
stormtroopers surround a compound and prepare to burn it down, releasing
the countermeasures may be needed.

In fact, leaking (no pun intended) word that a home has CBW deadman
switches may make the ninjas a bit less trigger-happy.

--Tim May, whose house is _not_ booby-trapped with Sarin, or Tabun, or
anything else, but who will defend to his death his right to talk as he
wishes about such things.
