10K civvies are predicted to expire for this little excercise.  The 
republicans in grand style stopped the impeachment vote obediently.

Whats your definition of evil?

This is totally out of control.  As much as I dislike the UN, Klinton
is supposed to get agreement with the UN security council.

This amount to a war crime under UN law and maybe that matters to
senate democrats.

This definitely seals the "abuse of power" charges.

Murdering 10k civvies to avoid impeachment just verifies everything
I believed about this guy.
