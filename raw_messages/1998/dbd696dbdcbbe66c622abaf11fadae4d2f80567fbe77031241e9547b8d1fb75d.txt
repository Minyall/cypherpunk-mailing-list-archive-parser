"It has been claimed, for example, that free application of cryptography
enables drug traffickers and terrorists to communicate in secret, without
the law enforcement officials being able to intercept their messages. In
some countries, strong encryption has been banned or the keys have to be
escrowed for government officials. With invisibility readily available to
anyone with moderate programming skills, it is obvious that any such
measures are ineffective. "
