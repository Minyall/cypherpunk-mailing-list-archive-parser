<< ... It seems ironic and hypocritical that an act as viciously condemned
 in Oklahoma City is now a "justified" response to a problem in a
 foreign land. Then again, the history of United States policy over
 the last century, when examined fully, tends to exemplify
 hypocrisy. ... >>

I tell you folks, that's some of the best written propaganda I've ever seen. 

Here's it's only faults that I see.  Tim McVeigh is now taking the position
that the OKCity bombing was a bad thing.  I don't ever recall him ever taking
that position before.  And, while his post recognizes the old saying '2 wrongs
don't make a right', the post still goes against that saying (thanks to his
history.)

But he's definitely got some valid points as to how it relates to the USA's
use of weapons of mass destruction and Iraq, it's an excellent argument for
that.
