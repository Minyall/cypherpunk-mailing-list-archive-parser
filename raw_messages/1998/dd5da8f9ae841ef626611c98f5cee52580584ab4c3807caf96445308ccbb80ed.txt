The only thing that would be worse, and definitely should NOT be carried out
by a cypherpunk, is if someone tracked down a certain list like
srbeanies@interhop.net and somehow listed the sixdegrees as a friend.

Seriously, don't even think of torturing those poor 2000 beaniebaby traders
with a gag like this.

I predict that naughty cypherpunks will use these passwords to repeatedly
add the following names to "Schlomo"'s list of contacts:

mark@sixdegrees.com
webmaster@sixdegrees.com
postmaster@sixdegrees.com
issues@sixdegrees.com

If that doesn't work, really naughty cypherpunks may also add the addresses
of prominent journalists.

Of course, those things would be WRONG.
