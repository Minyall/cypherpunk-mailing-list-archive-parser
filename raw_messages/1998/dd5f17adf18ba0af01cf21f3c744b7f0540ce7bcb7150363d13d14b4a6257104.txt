	Don't bother, take a book (say Crime & Punishment, or John Lott's
"More Guns, Less Crime, anything hard bound should do). State your opnions
on capital punishment, and on "victimless crime" & drug crimes. Mention
Jury Nullification, and you should be back on the street in an hour.

	Or, you can do your civic duty, get on the jury and do your best to
do what is right.

	I'd suggest the latter.
