"But Clinton is on their side!"

I think the gender feminists are being quiet because they supported
Clinton.  It all comes down to politics.  There are other feminists I know
(of the non-politically correct variety) that have very unkind things to
say about the man.

Actually this is *JUST* the time for moralistic political posturing.
Expect to see a great deal of "holier than thou" legislation put through
under "bringing back morality to America". (And anyone who tries to fight

It is scandals just like this that fuel the fires of the anti-sex league.

And remember that Tipper is part of that baggage.  Expect a moralistic
crusade or two from the first lady if that happens.
