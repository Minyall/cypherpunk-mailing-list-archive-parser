    as I said, I am personally against abortion, but your point is
    absolutely correct: it is "the freedom to chose" on the part of
    the woman who must carry the _potential_ child to term  --and,
    yes, the woman is the 'sine qua non' condition.

    what the absolutists in the Right to Life movements do not
    understand, and refuse to accept, is that they have _no_ God
    given right to tell another what they can or can not do that
    does not _directly_ infringe on their own rights; as a
    consequence, the fanatics believe they have the God given
    right to legislate morality --and then there are back alley
    coat hanger abortions where the nascent mother is placed
    at an unacceptable risk.

    and, there is nothing sadder than an unwanted, often fatherless, 
    child.
