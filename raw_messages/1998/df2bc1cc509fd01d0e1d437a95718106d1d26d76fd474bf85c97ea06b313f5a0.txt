I read it. After a while I noticed that I had a lot in common with
the young programmer that she had an affair with. 

It took a while to come to terms with being a "type" :)

There were two things about the book that I disliked:

1) Macho-computing. A number of consultants tend to act as if they are
   sliting the atom or landing a man on the moon as they work. While I
   agree that programming is hard work, and that a lot of what programmers
   do is on the edge, it is hardly ground breaking to implement YA DBMS,
   even if it is Java based and web-centric.

2) I think she was tring to hard to look technical.
