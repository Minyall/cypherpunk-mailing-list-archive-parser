The NY Times reports today that the National Security Archive 
has obtained under FOIA the sole remaining copy of the
CIA's 1962 Top Secret survey of the Bay of Pigs disaster. 
The highly critical document is termed one of the most secret 
documents of the cold war. We've put a copy of the article at:

   http://jya.com/cia-pigs.htm

The full declassified docs are at:

   http://www.seas.gwu.edu/nsarchive

They are entirely in JPG images, over 400 of them. We're
transcribing to ASCII but it will take a day or two.
