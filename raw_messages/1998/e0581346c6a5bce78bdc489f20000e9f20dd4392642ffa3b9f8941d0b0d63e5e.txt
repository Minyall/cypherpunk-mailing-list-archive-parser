Which is why this discussion is a perfect example of why thematic or
monotonic solutions don't work for 'people' systems. The GPL folks want
credit, reward, and a say in the life cycle of their work. The BSD folks
aren't interested so much in their own credit as an economic incentive to
distribute and develop code. While  the PD group cares not one whit about
credit, economics, or distribution, just so it's available. Then there is
the 'other license' group which without specificying the prefered license is
a smorgasboard of beliefs and tastes piled into one category because of a
lack of other clear characteristics. Clearly implying that even the
GPL-BSD-PD-Other categories are insufficient to reasonably define this
issue. An apparently simple but very complex set of issues and goals.

It simply must be admitted that one license won't fulfill any groups goals
in toto, cypherpunk goals or not.

What I find really interesting about this discussion is the clear examples
of inertia in personal taste regarding licenses, all the arguing in the world
won't change that. The second aspect is that way people talk about
'cypherpunks' as some homogenious entity with definable and fixed goals.
Especialy when it is clear cypherpunks are anything but. It's almost like
some folks believe being a cypherpunk is like joining a lodge.
