Actually, Tim, the way the Men in Black work is that they keep their bans on
domestic crypto under wraps until the last moment and then get them adopted
with no public hearings in the crisis atmosphere of a heavily lobbied markup
session at some critical point in the legislative calendar.  They know that
the more people actually understand what they are up to, the less they are
likely to get what they want.  But do not underestimate the power of having
useful stooges like Jerry Solomon and the shamefully clueless Jon Kyl in
positions where they can do last-minute switcheroo on bills that are being
moved to the floor.  One of the major reasons why we didn't get the
Goodlatte bill on the floor this year is that moving it to the Floor would
have resulted in putting Oxley Manton or the House Intelligence Committee
bill on the Floor at the same time.

I'd forgotten about that little one. Of course, it has not gone anywhere
(no Senate version or committee markup, right?), so I'm not yet ready to
say there's official action on its way. And, fortunately, the session is
over but for the shouting about Clinton and his cigars.
