Microsoft Mail and some of its broken successors keep your mail in
one big hulking file using "compressible encryption",
which may not be good enough to keep the NSA out,
but is good enough crypto to keep you from fixing it when
it gets corrupted.  
It's really a shame how often MSMail files get corrupted,
and how quickly the things can grow to 100-200MB if people from
Marketing keep sending you mail with attached Powerpoint files.
Does anybody know a compressed disk driver that lets you start
at an arbitrary offset in a file so the headers look fine?

				Thanks!
