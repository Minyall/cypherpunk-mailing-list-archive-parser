Sorry, but you've got it slightly wrong, or maybe you don't...

"Free speech is essential in an open society." Yup, true enough.

"Freedom from discrimination is essential in a democracy." Well, maybe.

I do take notice of your change in terms, there. All democracy means is mob
rule. We don't live in a democracy, and I think you should be glad you
don't.

Frankly, I think a better observation would follow the form of your first
one - "Freedom to discriminate is essential in an open society."

The phrase "Freedom from..." has always meant a curtailing of freedom, in my
experience.
