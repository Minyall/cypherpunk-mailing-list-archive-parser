The wire loops (in sets of two a few meters apart) are in every stretch of
freeway in California. They report the numbers and speed of all
vehicles. Have so for decades. This allows the Caltrans operation centers
to instantly identify backups due to accidents, etc. Once in a while, the
evening news do a story on these operation centers.

So we still don't know what the grey sensors do. Note that these sensors
are typically mounted only above the two right lanes.
