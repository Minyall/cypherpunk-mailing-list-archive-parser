well I personally am very careful to credit
Timmy as the orginal originator whenever 
I lecture on cryptoanarchy, either
in person or in any "fora" hehehe. modulo whatever
BH has invented on geodesic markets or whatever.
btw I was RBLL at BH's recent rant/diatribe/harangue against
timmy (rolling in my barcolounger laughing) .. you two
truly deserve each other<g>
