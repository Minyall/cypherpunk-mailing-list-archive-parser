Yes. SSL and HTML does that to paper, even telephone, credit card
transactions. As long as you're using the net anyway. :-).

Actually, it's *SET's* burden to proove that it's 1000X cheaper (including
the cost of fraud) than SSL, the status quo ante of internet payment

I don't think SET is cheaper, much less three orders of magnitude cheaper,
than SSL.
