Yes, I assumed as much. But it is electronic circuits that are EMP/nuclear
hardened, not the "encryption technology." We have a populace that doesn't
understand what cryptography is, such reckless statements don't help,
especially putting nuclear and encryption in the same sentence.

For as much as I hate Clinton, encryption is mathematics, period. National
security fearmongering to spite Clinton does not help the encryption
awareness/freedom campaign.
