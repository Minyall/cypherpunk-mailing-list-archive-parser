Payne's previous claims were examined on one of the other crypto lists a
few months ago.  (Actually "ripped apart" is a better term.)  Wei Dei and a
few others examined the mathmatical basis of his "break" of RSA.  Turns out
that is is not nearly the shortcut claimed.  (Actually not a shortcut at all.)

Based on that previous experience, I would be very suspect of such a claim
from Mr. Payne without any proof.
