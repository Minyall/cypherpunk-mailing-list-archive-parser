Well that would help a lot, then. Find the begin and end headers for the
PGP message, pipe it into pgp -da, throw away the output, check the exit
code, which should be set if the armor was invalid (or perhaps look at
stderr). Like I said, though, you could still make the armor valid by
correctly calculating the CRC, or even make PGP generate the armor with
the insult/flames/whatever in the output (just a matter of shifting some
bits around before armoring, could be done in perl). But this is certainly
not worth worrying about.
