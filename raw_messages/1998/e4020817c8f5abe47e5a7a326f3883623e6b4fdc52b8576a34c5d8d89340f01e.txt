Worse, there may be any number of "controlling legal authorities".

You don't suppose that all the existing radio monitoring equipment is
going to stop working just because the infrastructure for managing it
is in disarray?

Or that people with access to that equipment are going to have any
problem getting fuel for their helicopters from government fuel dumps?

But your communication network is going to become a valuable resource,
and more than one tin-pot wannabe is going to want to get his hands on
it.
