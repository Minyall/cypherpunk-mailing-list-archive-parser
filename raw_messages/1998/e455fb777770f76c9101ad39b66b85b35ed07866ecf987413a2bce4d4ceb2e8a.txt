I could care less if he had an affair, personally. But he had an affair
with a subordinate in his direct employ. When CEO's do that, they get
ostracized. I'm in the military. If I did that, I'd be on the carpet seeing
the Ol' Man, perhaps even court martial, and then out of the military. And
this is the example set by my Commander in Chief???
Many other presidents have had affairs while in office, starting with G.
Washington himself. The difference is, they exercised better judgement and
discretion re: who the affair was with, when and where it was consumated.
Certainly the CIC is projecting a bad image, certainly it is his business
if he has an affair, but when he does it in such a manner that it becomes
front page material in every newspaper around the world, there is something
terribly, desperately wrong.

In case you hadn't noticed, the investigation of him, vis-a-vis the rules
established by other demicans, his supposed compatriates, is still ongoing. 

Methinks this is just the tip of the iceberg, a bone for the populace to
chew on so that when the rest of the story breaks, we (the dog) won't
notice the prime rib and sirloin.

I congratulate you for your defense of a person who demonstrably has broken
his marriage vows, his oath of public office, and purjured himself while
under an additional oath in a court of law.

You, too, are a few neurons short of a functional synapse.

I suggest you discuss it with the maker. The best way is large caliber
bullet at sufficient velocity to penetrate and exit the cranial cavity.

God speed, you fucking idiot.
