Unfortunately, not yet. The European Commission has proposed amending the 
Dual-Use regulations to allow the free circulation of crypto products among 
member states, while extending controls to 'intangible' goods (i.e. Internet 
downloads). Until then an export license is required. Licenses are granted 
more readily and with fewer conditions (e.g. permitted end uses) for exports 
to other EU nations and Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, 
Switzerland and the US.

Amazing the minutiae you have to trawl when co-authoring a paper on crypto 
export controls ;)

Ian.
