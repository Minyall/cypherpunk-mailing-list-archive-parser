According to
<http://www.thestandard.com/articles/display/0,1449,1721,00.html?home.mf>,
Mark Twain Bank/Mercantile Bank will no longer support DigiCash. They are
no longer listed as an issuer of ecash on Digicash' website. Neither
organization seems to have information available via the web about the
decision to terminate the service.
