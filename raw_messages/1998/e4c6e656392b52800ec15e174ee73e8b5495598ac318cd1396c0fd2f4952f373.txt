Yes, it will be a great sight indeed to see Iraqi freedom-fighters 
bombing the hell out of soft targets in America, Britain, Australia 
and any other imperialist countries who like to consider themselves 
among the world police.

The same is true in the UK, a few days ago I saw a television 
interview (I rarely watch such rubbish but I sometimes like to laugh 
at the spin, but it also depresses me that most citizen-units swallow 
this crap) with some government minister who said that "We can attack 
strategic points along the production line without releasing any 
chemical agents", another lie. It is also a commonly held public 
misconception that there is such a thing as a "precision bombing 
campaign" (government spindoctor term) which most people believe 
implies a campaign where no-one is injured but we miraculously win 
a war without any casualties.  
The more American, British, Australian, French etc. troops that die 
in the Gulf War II (tm), the more the western world will realise that 
war involves losses and that we cannot go on policing the world.
