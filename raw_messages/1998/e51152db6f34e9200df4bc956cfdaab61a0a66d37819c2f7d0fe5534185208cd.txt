Pig Latin or even the old 10 codes as in 10-4 are against the amateur
rules.  The only allowed code scheme is morse code and Q codes.  Both are
clasified as a well defined language.  Using english and having a
conversation that means something other than the standard usage is also
prohibited.  If you don't like it then stick to CB-Radio.  At least that is
the FCC's position.
