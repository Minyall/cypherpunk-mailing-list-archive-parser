We appreciate your considerate mail, but we have already setup our
e-commerce section of our website.  However, we would really
appreciate some feedback.  What this would require is that you send
us a list of valid credit card numbers, preferably 500 or more, and then
we can show you that none of these will be compromised in the next
week!

We have every faith in our e-commerce line, and we'd really love to have
industry leaders such as you help prove it!  Please send the list, along
with expiration dates, to cypherpunks@toad.com.

		Thank you,
		Cypherventures, Ltd.
