It's now a cliche of bio-terrorism bellringers that
"this stuff scares me silly," with scientists, pols
and first responders now comically repeating the 
code.

A technological artist on Long Island has set up in 
his studio a collection of the most deadly germs known 
on earth, in a small glass display, with labels and 
descriptions of what they are and can do: dosages, kill
ratios, distribution methods, sources of specimens
and food supplies, URLs for bio-terrorists.

He invites art connoisseurs to visit. They walk around
the room looking for the show, see little except typical
suburban living room furniture, then spy the glass
tank, approach, read, freeze, then begin to tremble.

Some scream, some faint, some vomit in horror,
claw clothing, stampede for the exit.

The artist tries to reassure them it's only a carefully 
constructed simulation. None believe him. They shiver 
outside in the yard and whimper accusations of terrorism, 
which, he confesses, is the truth of bio-terrorism, to 
scare sane people silly.
