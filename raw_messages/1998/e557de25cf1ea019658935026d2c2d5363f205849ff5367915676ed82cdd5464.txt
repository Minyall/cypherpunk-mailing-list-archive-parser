There were rumors that governments had meddled with the A5/1 voice privacy
algorithm design, causing a weakening of A5/1. I am unaware of any proof
for these claims. A5/2 was of course designed to be weaker, a fact that
has been acknowledged by the GSM consortium.

We found undeniable proof that the keygen algorithm used by A5/1, called
A8, has been deliberately weakened by the designers. We found the smoking
gun. And it is smoking red hot.

Any weakening in A5 itself would come in addition to the weakening of A8.
