Militiamen Assault Federal Command Post
Shots Exchanged, No Injuries

November 17, 1998

Andrews, NC -- An unknown number of militiamen attacked a federal
command post late last week, exchanging fire with agents.  No injuries
on either side were reported, and the unknown number of militiamen were
said to have fled.  The Rudolph Command Post, in Andrews NC, is the base
from which more than 200 federal agents are conducting a search for Eric
Rudolph, suspected bomber of a number of abortion clinics and of the
1996 Olympics.

    Federal agents say that bullets whizzed by their heads and that one
agent was barely grazed when nearly a dozen shots were fired into their
headquarters.

    Eric Rudolph, 32, has been charged in numerous bombings, including
one that killed a police officer, and has fled into the woods of Western
North Carolina.  The eighty agents that had been assigned to the case,
until recently, when their number was boosted to 200, have been unable
to locate Rudolph.  ANS correspondants on the scene that the local
residents overwhelmingly support Rudolph, and that many have pledged
that they would support and shelter him if they felt it necessary.

    Rudolph is linked to far-right Christian organizations.  ANS's North
Carolina correspondents are not sympathetic to these organizations.
