In other words, instead of China taking over Hong Kong, Hong
Kong takes over China.

We shall see.

Right now Hong Kong is being run by some rich capitalist
chinese.

(What else is new, you may ask)

The problem with such systems is that they are vulnerable to
the same disease that struck down Venice.  Rich merchants
aquire state power, soon are tempted by the easy and safe
returns from confiscation and taxation, rather than the
difficulty and risk of commerce, soon become aristocrats,
equally contemptuous of the poor, of real businessmen, and of
earning an honest living.
