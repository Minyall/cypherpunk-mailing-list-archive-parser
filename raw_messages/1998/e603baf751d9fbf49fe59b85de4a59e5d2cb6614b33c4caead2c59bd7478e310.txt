Dunno, but that sure looks like authentic Toto doesn't it (and the
rest of the long post of which excerpt quoted above).  Either someone
has a very high quality mimic function for his writing style, or is
rather good at imitating his writing style manually, or Toto is still
around, and Toto isn't Carl Johnson.

Who knows, if it is Toto, he has been rather careful not to sign
anything recently :-).

(If he were to sign things it might be helpful for Carl
Johnson... Toto?)
