A powerful statement of the obvious, with one important ommission: The
United states is the largest researcher, producer, experimenter with, and
user of biological weapons.  Despite 'honest' Dick Nixon's unilateral
pledge in 1972 that the US would not produce offensive BW weapons, they
have been doing so, keeping pace with developments in molecular biology.
Much research and development is privatized; it is not prohibited for
private corporations to develop such weapons.

A few observations:

The Army has used the term "Ethnic Biological weapons" since the late
60's.

There are 2 kinds of BW weapons development:
  o	battlefield weapons
  o	weapons of class warfare ( suitable for covert long term use
	against all or subsets of the civilian population ). 

And finally as one observes "new" diseases, one should remember that the
main thrust of the major BW research since the end of wwII, has been
against the immune system ... so that no defense can be mounted.
