Police Report Stirs Up Militia Groups

          (MARTINSVILLE) -- A confidential state police report... which
          looked at the dangers of right-wing militia groups in
          Indiana... is causing a stir among elected officials and
          militia members in Morgan County. While the report discounts any
          immediate threat of terrorist attacks from Indiana militias, it
          does suggest that militia members are getting involved in local
          politics and may have too much influence in some areas. Morgan
          County commissioners think they're the ones referred to in
          the report... and they say they're offended at the implication
          they're controlled by any special interest group.
