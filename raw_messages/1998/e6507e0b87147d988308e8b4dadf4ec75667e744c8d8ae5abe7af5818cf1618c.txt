I think this item, and your other frothings, show why you should not be
taken seriously.

Once again, a lurker who has never posted any substantive ideas delurks to
foam and spew insults.

In any case, all of the arguments I have seen from you boil down to that
tired old chestnut:

"My country, right or wrong."

A good attitude for cannon fodder to have.  Not such a good attitude for
free men to have.

Time to add you to my ever-growing killfile.
