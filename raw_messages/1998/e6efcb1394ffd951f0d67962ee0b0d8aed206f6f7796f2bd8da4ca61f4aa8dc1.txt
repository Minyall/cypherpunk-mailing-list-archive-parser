As of 6:57 this morning, according to the timestamp in
ftp://bbs.bragg.army.mil/library/
they removed pgp262.zip from their ftp site.  Though of course they didn't
bother to clean up
their link to it  :-P.  

Thanks to the civil servant readers of this list who phoned the boys at
Bragg.  The world is safe
again.  Apologies to the sysop who probably caught some abuse.
