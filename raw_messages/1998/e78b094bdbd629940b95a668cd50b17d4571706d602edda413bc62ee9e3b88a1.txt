I have a little bit of a different take on things...

I expect the first world to start to take after the East German model.

-- Those who are precieved as being a possible threat will be
marginalized, jailed, forced to flee, or co-opted.

-- A large portion of the population will be devoted towards control of
the population.  (Either in law enforcement, paid snitches, propaganda, or
similar activities.)

-- Much of the Government's budget will be devoted to citizen control.
(More will be spent on fighting internal threats than defending from
external threats.)  And since "The imposition of order = the escalation of
disorder", it will only spiral downwards.

In 50 years I expect that the creative citizenry will either be
underground, fled, or no longer participating in the active discorse of
the society.  All of the life will be sucked out of the population in
order to fight the "Scapegoats of the Week/Month/Year/Century". 

It will only fall apart when we reach a level where no one wants to live
here any more and it falls apart from internal system failure and
hemoraging.
