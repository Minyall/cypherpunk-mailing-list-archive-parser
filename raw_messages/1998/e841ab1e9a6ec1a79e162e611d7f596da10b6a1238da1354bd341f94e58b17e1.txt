The Libertarian Party of California is on record as being in favor of
re-legalizing ferrets, which are not legal pets in California,
though officials apparently look the other way while pet stores
blatantly aid and abet illegal ferret-possession.

Their most recent press release on the subject was titled
	Release: Ferrets
(There is no formal record of the Republican response to
this obvious terrorist threat, or whether the Green Party's
position was more strongly influenced by animal rights activists
who support releasing ferrets or deep ecologists who don't
want the non-native wild animals more widely dispersed :-)
