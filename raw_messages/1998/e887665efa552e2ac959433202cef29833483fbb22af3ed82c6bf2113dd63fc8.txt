I found your name on a kiddy porn site.  At first I was disgusted, and
immediately called the FBI.  But then I got kind of turned on by the
whole idea, and decided that maybe we could get together and have
hot sex, and you could wear a wig with pigtails, and it would be just
like we were screwing children, just like I know you love to do.  Then
maybe we could switch roles.

So anyway, let me know if you're interested.  But also, expect the
FBI to be calling on you in the near future, pervert!

Tah tah lovey,
Joe C.
