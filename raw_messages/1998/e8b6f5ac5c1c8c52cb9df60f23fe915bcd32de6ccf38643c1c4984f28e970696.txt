As far as algebra.com is concerned, the list went down because
my upstream site just installed anti-relaying rules, and everything
going to algebra.com was rejected. Also, sendmail was not setuid
and could not create mqueue files.

I wish I could boast receiving attention from the IRS/BATF or 
whatever, but so far i has not happened.
