A population *must* undergo variation in its
heriditary units since 
1. there's always errors in copying the code
2. equivalently, you can't drive the error rate
of a channel down to 0, just arbitrarily close.

So your herd of clones will eventually acquire
some genetic diversity and selection necessarily
follows.

Geez are we off-subject.
