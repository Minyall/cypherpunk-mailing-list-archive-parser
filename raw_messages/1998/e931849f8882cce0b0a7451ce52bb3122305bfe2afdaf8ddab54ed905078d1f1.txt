I love this to death.  Some asshole sends crap data to sixdegrees
including dredged up real email addresses, then when sixdegrees and the
contacts given react in a totally appropriate manner other (?) assholes
berate them for living.  And this one even manages to toss in an
anti-AOL rant where AOL plays no part.

Such witticisms I haven't seen since my kids turned 7.
