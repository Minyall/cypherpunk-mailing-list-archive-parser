Hello everybody ,

My name is Sergey. I'm new here and I need your help ...
I'm very interested in cryptography and I just don't know
what should I know for the first and where I can find a papers
about cryptography . My problem is that I haven't on-line
access to the Web I have only e-mail therefore many things
are not possible for me ( or not ? ) It will be very pleasant
for me if someone can help me ...

Thank you very much ,
Sergey.
