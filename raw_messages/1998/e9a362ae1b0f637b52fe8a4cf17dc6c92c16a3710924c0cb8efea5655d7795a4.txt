My concrete problem is: With the bunch of p-values how does one
(in accordance with the intention of the designer of the package)
go about to determine that the test is passed at a certain confidence
level. I don't see anything in the documents instructing the user
to do this. Maybe I indeed missed something. Please point that out
in this case.
