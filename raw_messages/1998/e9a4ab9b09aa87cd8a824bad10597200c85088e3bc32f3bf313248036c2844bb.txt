_____________________________
Pulpit Confessions: Exposing The Black Church is an honest,
behind the scenes look at the African-American church. The
author spent a decade as a preacher and pastor in the black
church and is actually betraying an unofficial code of
silence by writing this book.

The author began ministry in his teens and was pastoring
by his early twenties. He speaks frankly about his and other
ministers' odysseys from sincere, well intentioned prodigies
to cynical, sinful, showman.

He soon discovered that things in the church were not as they
seemed. In this ground-breaking book, he describes a secular
and often profane ministerial community that is often shrouded
in pseudo holiness.

He exposes the thoughts and motivations of both ministers and
congregations and their degenerate power struggles which
often turn violent.

He pulls no punches when he untangles the myths, unravels the
mystique and reveals the secrets of the Black Church.
