Yes, yes, yes, I know this. (Had I not known it before, I would have after
the Monicagate matter.)

However, one is still at risk in grand jury matters, and attorneys are
usually used to advise. Also, one can leave the grand jury room to consult
with an attorney.

Too bad this is so, but nearly everyone who receives a subpoena hires an
attorney to advise on risks, consequences, etc. Anyone who gets sucked into
the Great Cypherpunks Conspiracy Trial probably ought to have competent
legal counsel.

(I received a subpoena from one of my neighbors, and it was written in
legalese that I had no way of understanding without a lawyer.  And I always
thought "Deuces take 'em" was a version of poker.)
