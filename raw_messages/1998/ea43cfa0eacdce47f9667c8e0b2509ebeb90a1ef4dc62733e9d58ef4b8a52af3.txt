If you do decide to play with charges stored on glass plates wear eye
protection because every once in a while the mechanical stress is more than
the glass can take and it will shatter.

One way you can do this is to go to your local video arcade and purchase one
of the glass sheets they use to cover their pinball machines. Then carry
that glass plate by the edge in your hand as you scuff your feet across a
nylon pile carpet (again wear safety glasses). The result about 1 out of 100
times, or if you've got lots of patience and can afford hours to scuff feet
on carpet, is that the glass plate will shatter with a report about
equivalent to a .22. Anyone watching should also wear eye protection as the
shards can go 20ft. or moe. It's best if you do this on a cold dry day.
