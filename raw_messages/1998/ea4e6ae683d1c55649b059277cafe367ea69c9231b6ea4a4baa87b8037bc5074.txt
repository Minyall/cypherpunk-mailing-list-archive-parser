It is your choice to live in the cesspool know as NYC. I am originally
from Chicago, I got the hell out of there the 1st chance I got and have
never looked back.

Large metropolitan complexes are obsolete and their problems greatly
outweigh their benefits. I am a land owner and *like* owning land, I enjoy
having grass and trees, streams to fish and swim in, not living in a cage
with my neighbors on the other side of a paper thin wall. I have enough
land that I could plow it up and do subsistence farming to survive if the
collapse ever comes (subsidized with fishing and hunting).

Why anyone would want to live like a rat is beyond me.
