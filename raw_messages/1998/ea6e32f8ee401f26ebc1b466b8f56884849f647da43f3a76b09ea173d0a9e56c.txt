d00d!  would you mind posting some of those access codes, logon id's, phone
numbers?  i sure could use a few!  certainly you don't need all 100.  thanks a
million!  make sure that you send them to the cypherpunks list so that all the
fed guys reading this list will see them.  the feds like to use stolen accounts
too, they can cover their tracks better that way.
