Fortunately the most cost effective method of eliminating all
competition is that followed by Alcoa, to deliver a
satisfactory product at the cheapest possible price.

In the cocaine market a number of organizations have

competition, but here in America these methods have generally
proved not only unprofitable, but also for the most part
fatal.
