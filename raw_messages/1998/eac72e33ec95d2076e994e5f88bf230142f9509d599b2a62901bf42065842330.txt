Dear old method,
Encryption from the old days
Security once

Read block, write block
Quickly through the S boxes
Look, no moving parts

Particle flies
Gas ionizes briefly
Hear a speaker click

Ron's bored today
Security is algebra
Algebra is good

Pretty damn great
Genie out, bottle broken
Privacy for you
