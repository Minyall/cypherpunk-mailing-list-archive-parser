I particularly dislike articles that are things forwarded from other
lists without comment (IP seems a particular offender here).  These are
rarely interesting.

Click through rates are something like 2%, so most are screening them out.
I rarely noticed what the ads actually said.

I don't know which ones you have tried but junkbuster 

http://www.junkbuster.org/ (a proxy on port 8000)

works _very_ well on my linux system, particularly with the "blank gif"
patch.

It blanks out 99% of banner gifs, which makes pages like metacrawler and
wired look more visually attractive and load faster.

Until I lost all the banner ads I hadn't realised how distracting all those
animated gifs at the top of the screen were and its now much faster and
easier to read the info you want, without them.

I tried this but found it made the net too hard to use.

It would give a brave browser manufactor (Opera?) quite an advantage if
they built the banner ad killer into the browser directly.
