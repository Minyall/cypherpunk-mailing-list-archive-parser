Morales and I met for lunch.

I just finished documents referencing the two Tenth circuit
docket sheets you posted on our cases.

Morales is going to come over review, then we will send you AND
ABOUT EVERY Member of Congress A COPY.

Mitchell's attempt for the in camera ex parte meeting with the court
may have failed.  Thanks to you and Orlin.  And, consequently, some
upset Members of Congress.

I, of course, DENY I called judge Santiago Campos a FASCIST PIG.
Try searching for PIG.

That is likely the reason Mitchell phoned this morning to say she going
to file to remand the first FOIA [algorithms] request to NSA.

Later
bill
