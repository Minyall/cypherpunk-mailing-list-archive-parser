Talking of factoring I wonder if anyone on the list has seen the article 
in this months new scientist regarding a new link found between energy 
levels in hydrogen atoms and generation of large primes, I don`t remember 
the details (I only scanned the article as even the elementary 
explanation of the physics involved was beyond me), The thrust of the 
article was that work was in progress on a variant of this that could 
factor large numbers significantly faster than current methods. 
Anyone with more background in this sort of thing care to comment?
