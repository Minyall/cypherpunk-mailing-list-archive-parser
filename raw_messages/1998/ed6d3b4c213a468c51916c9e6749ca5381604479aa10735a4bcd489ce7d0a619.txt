So, what has the issue of defining something got to do with its existance?
Is this bozo really claiming that God can only exist unless somebody thinks
him up? Sounds like religous hubris to me...

God was shinning on this asshole that he never had to argue face to face
with me at that age...

The spelling.

Agnosticism has *nothing* to do with scientific proof. It existed eons
before anyone even thought of the scientific method. Skepticism is a part of
human nature, not philosophy, beliefs, or science.

Atheism is saying that while God could exist he doesn't. In other words it
is the belief that God doesn't exist and can't be proven contrary. There is
a fundamental belief that all proofs are flawed.

Agnosticism is the inability to believe one way or the other. It could be
characterized by a total lack of faith in anything (assuming one doesn't
want to argue about the meaning of 'total' and 'anything'). What keeps
agnosticism appart from nearly all other beliefs is that it is really trying
to answer two question and not one (Does God exist?), they are:

1.	Does God exist?

2.	Do I believe the proof in 1.?

It is the embodyment of skeptiscism. The fact that most religions that
accept 1. accept 2. as a given is why they are hubric.

My own personal suspicion is he's going to ask you whether you lived your
beliefs even in the face of overwhelming opposition. As long as you say
"Yes" he's going to be a happy camper.

To borrow a Christian icon, he's going to want to know if you worshiped
false idols.

Ditto.

Since this doesn't particular avenue has little more to be said I'm going to
drop it.
