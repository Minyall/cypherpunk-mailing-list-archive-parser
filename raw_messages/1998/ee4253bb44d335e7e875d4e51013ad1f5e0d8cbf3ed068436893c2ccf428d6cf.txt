Ready availablity of defensive weaponry to citizens does create very 
unusual circumstances in that a motivated population can defeat the 
government by pure force of numbers, the fact is, the population is not 
motivated and most of the sheeple swallow the state BS, and just in case, 
most governments restrict citizens access to weapons and ignore the 
citizens right to defend themselves against attack (not that this will 
stop those of us who are motivated).
