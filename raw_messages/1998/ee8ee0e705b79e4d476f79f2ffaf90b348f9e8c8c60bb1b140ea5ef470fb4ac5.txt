I found a few interesting ones.

S. 1023

Making appropriations for the Treasury Department, the United States
Postal Service, the Executive Office of the President, and certain
Independent Agencies...

	$3,000,000 shall be available to the Financial Crimes Enforcement
       Network, including $2,000,000 for the money laundering threat initiative
       and $1,000,000 for the Secure Outreach/Encrypted Transmission Program;

	$7,800,000 for automated license plate readers,

[The above bill seems to have evolved into the following, which was
passed by the House and Senate and awaits the President's signature.]

H.R.2378 
Making appropriations for the Treasury Department, the United States
Postal Service, the Executive Office of the President, and certain
Independent Agencies, for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1998,

	$1,000,000 shall be available
       to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network for the Secure
       Outreach/Encrypted Transmission Program; 

	...to the United States Secret Service, including ...
       $1,460,000 to provide technical assistance and to
       assess the effectiveness of new technology intended to combat
       identity-based crimes,
