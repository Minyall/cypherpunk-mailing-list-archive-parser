"No dictator, no invader, can hold an imprisoned population by the force of arms forever. There is no
greater power in the universe than the need for freedom. Against that power governments, and
tyrants, and armies can not stand. The Centauri learned this lesson once. We will teach it to them
again. Though it take a thousand years, we will be free."
