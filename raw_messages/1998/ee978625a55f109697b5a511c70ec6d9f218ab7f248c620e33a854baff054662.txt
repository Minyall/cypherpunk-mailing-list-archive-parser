The TVMessenger utilizes the powerful medium of Television to display Telephone Caller ID information. 
While watching your favorite movie or TV show, the TVMessenger will display incoming callers name 
and number in the upper left hand corner of your TV screen. 

This convenient easy-to-read caller display lets you make an immediate decision on how to handle the 
call. In addition, the TVMessenger keeps track of your calls while your away. The callers name, number, 
date, time, and the number of times they have called are stored in the callers log for future reference - 
Ideal for number retrieval! The TVMessenger also works with your voice messaging service - it provides 
a visual indication that a message is waiting.
