With Arcot's system, an attacker could determine the key *software only,
most likely even by remote*.

Extracting keys from a smartcard requires *hardware and physical possesion
of the token*.

Which touches at the very core of the difference between
tokens and software based solutions. The claims made on the vendor's
homepage are simply false. There is no other way of putting it.
