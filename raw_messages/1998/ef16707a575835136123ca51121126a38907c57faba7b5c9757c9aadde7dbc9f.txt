It is never entirely safe nor fittin' to attribute the words put in a
characters mouth by an author to the author.  Lazarus Long, the
character in question, while having many fine qualities, was not the
type of person who could be depended upon to tven follow his own
judgement nor one that could be trusted anyfurther than you could throw
Him. 

But in this case, I do believe that it did reflect RAH's views quite
well.
