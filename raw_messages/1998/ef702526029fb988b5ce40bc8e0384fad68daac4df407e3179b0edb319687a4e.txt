	In the New York Times yesterday there was an article about a hacker "game"
where the pentagon said that most unclassified computers were breeched, and
supposedly none of the classified ones were hit, according to the
spokesman. I don't know how much validity my idea has, probably very
little, but if there was a "contest" going on like the article implied,
perhaps it wasn't limited to government computers. AOL went down recently,
along with alot of other power outages, if some computers had been
breeched, how difficult would it have been for someone to cause something
to overload and cause a power outage? But then again, perhaps I have a
vivid imagination.

PS: The article from the NY Times could probably still be accessed from the
archive there at www.nytimes.com
