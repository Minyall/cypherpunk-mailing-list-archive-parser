This is the classic intro into a dictatorhip and militarisation
of a society. I wonder if someone can dig up Hitler's speeches
on the subject.

Sure. I bet this has nothing to do with the surge of false
"bomb threats" in Austin and SIlicon Valley high-tech companies
or flooding mass media with descriptions of dangers from domestic
terrorism.

Public must be aware of the "presence" of undesirables first.

Who is it going to be this time, after cpunks are dealt with ?
