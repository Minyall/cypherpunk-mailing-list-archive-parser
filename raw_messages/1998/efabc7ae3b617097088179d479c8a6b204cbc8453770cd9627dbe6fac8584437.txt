Stan is an asshole, an annoyance on this list. I've 
killfiled anything with his email address in any 
header. I suggest everyone do the same. When he gets 
no responses to anything he posts, he will eventually 
go away, probably to where "Liberals Go To Die." If 
you encourage him, I won't see your responses.  I 
don't wade through the blizzard of this list to have 
to wipe splashes of airhead liberal shit out of my 
eyes at every other step.
