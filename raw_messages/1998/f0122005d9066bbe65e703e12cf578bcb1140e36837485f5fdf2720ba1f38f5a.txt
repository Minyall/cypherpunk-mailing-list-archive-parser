Over in Europe, prices are mostly about $1 -- per liter.

Back here in California, prices have been varying a lot, and
are generally higher in areas with lots of people, lots of money,
or lots of restrictions on gas stations.   Here in San Francisco,
it's about $1.30, and down in Silicon Valley it's mostly about
$1.20, with some cheaper stations and some more expensive.
We have different gas - for environmental reasons, they add
chemicals designed to pollute water and irritate people's lungs
(while reducing smog a bit.)

Those New Jersey prices, while lower than New York, are still
articifially high, since they're "full-service".  The People's 
Republic of New Jersey *knows* that regular untrained citizens
can't be trusted to pump their own gasoline reliably -
otherwise you'd be having frequent explosions at gasoline
stations like you do in the rest of the country.
Any time the legislature begins to suggest legalizing
self-service gas, small gas station owners pretending to be
little old ladies write to all the newspapers protesting that
they'd have to pay a lot more money to have gas pumped for them
and how dare these politicians be so mean to YOUR grandmothers,
and the threat disappears again for a few years.
				Thanks!
