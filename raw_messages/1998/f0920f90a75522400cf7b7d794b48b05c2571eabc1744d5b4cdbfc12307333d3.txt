There is something called TCFS - transparent cryptographic file
system.  You could take a look at
ftp://ftp.pvv.org/pub/Linux/kerneli/v2.0/. I'm just starting a project
to provide an easy to use and up to date international patch for the
linux-kernel.  The current patch integrates the steganography and
crypto-patches for loopback filesystem, CIPE, and TCFS in one patch.
I'm looking at integrating IPsec as well, but at this time, there are
at least 5 different implementations of it.
