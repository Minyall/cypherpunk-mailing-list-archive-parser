* William Garland, the father of the late rap singer Tupac Shakur,
fighting for part of Shakur's multi-million-dollar estate in Los
Angeles in August, despite his having had no contact with his son
after age five, pointed out at a hearing how he was a good father.
For example, he said he would often tuck in little Tupac, a bed-
wetter, with another Garland son, also a bed-wetter:  "They could
pee with each other."
