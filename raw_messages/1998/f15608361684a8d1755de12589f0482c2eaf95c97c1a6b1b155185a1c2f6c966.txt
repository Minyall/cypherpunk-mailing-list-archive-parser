Or trying to be consistent.

Raygun: abortion is killing, but pro-death penalty.

If killing is wrong, killing again is wrong.

Also, there is the part about his brother turning
him in to get help (UB tried to get mental help,
but couldn't get it), and didn't turn him in
to get killed.

Next time, the killer might not be caught because
the person who recognized (yea traffic analysis)
his talktalk might not want them killed as a result.

i.e. in the long run it will save lives.
