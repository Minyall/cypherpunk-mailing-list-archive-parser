Oh wow, thanks for the update on the Clinton situation.  I'm grateful
since I couldn't find that information anywhere else, unless of course
I looked in the FIVE BILLION OTHER FORUMS BEATING THIS
GODDAMNED SUBJECT INTO THE GROUND!

Please do me a favor and FUCK OFF, or go stick your head up Clinton's
ass and quit spamming the list with FUCKING GARBAGE!  This shit is
worse than the sixdegrees mail.
