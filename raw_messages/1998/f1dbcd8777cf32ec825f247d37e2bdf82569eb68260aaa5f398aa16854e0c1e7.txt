I'm looking for a good HD encryptor.  The best one seems to be secdrv,
 Is this compatoble with win95? I'm asking because I know secdrv uses
tsr programs and drivers, but I am not familiar enough with win 95 to
be sure they will work together.  In win programming you don't use
interrupts and I'm sure that the drivers try to capture interupts. it
could still work if win95 calls int's to do it's work though.  Any info?
