What are the algorithms used in PGP 5.x, symetric ones, that is?  For
anything besides 3DES and IDEA, what are their relative strengths to 3DES
or IDEA?  Could someone tell me what their key lengths are?

Also, what's the relative strength of Blowfish to 3DES or IDEA?  Its key
length is variable, as I recall.  Could someone tell me the range?
