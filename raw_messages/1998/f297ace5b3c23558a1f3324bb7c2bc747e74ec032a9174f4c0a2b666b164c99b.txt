Apparently restrictions on online anonymity have been discussed at
the meeting of the Justice and Interior Ministers of the G8 in
Washington, Dec 8--12, 1997 on "high-tech and organized crime".

>From Janet Reno's press release <URL:
http://www.usdoj.dov/opa/pr/1997/December97/518cr.html>: "each nation
has committed to develop faster ways to trace attacks coming through
computer networks, so that we can quickly identify the hacker or
criminal who is responsible."

What are these fast ways to trace attacks? Did the ministers also
discuss anonymous speech?

Anyone have the full text of the declaration and the action plan?
