A few years ago the plaintext attack was implmented. One of the first
tests was on an encrypted file released in Europe that was supposed to
contain the source code and emulation of the Sky 0A smartcard. It

The implementation worked exceedingly well and ran on Linux. The page
says that the w95 version is also available.
