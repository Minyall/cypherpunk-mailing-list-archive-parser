	All night grocery stores within walking distance.

	Ready access to work and entertainment.

	10 different "ethnicities" of restraunts within walking distance
(if you consider "all night diner" to be an "ethnicity").

	Decent Mass Transit.

	Very little Country Music on the radio, and NO hog reports.

	Oh, and I haven't owned a car in 6 years.

	I don't really _like_ living in Chicago, but I'd like living in the
middle of BFE even less.

"To sum up: The entire structure of antitrust statutes in this country is a
jumble of economic irrationality and ignorance. It is a product: (a) of a
gross misinterpretation of history, and (b) of rather nave, and certainly
unrealistic, economic theories." Alan Greenspan, "Anti-trust"
