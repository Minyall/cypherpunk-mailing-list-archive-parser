I assume Tim is joking here, but this info really isn't too hard to find.

Just as an example, call USAir at 1-800-428-4322, press 1 for automated
service.  It will give you options to check scheduled flights and
departure times.  After you find the flight number, select the option to
confirm your reservation or select a seat.  It will ask for your frequent
flyer account number, but if you don't enter one, the helpful computer
will let you enter the passenger's last name instead.

Several other airlines have similar services..  Happy hunting!
