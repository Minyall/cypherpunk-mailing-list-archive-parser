Jan,

Last week I did a USIA (think Voice of America) video broadcast to Poland,
and delivered a speech to Polish journalists about Y2K. The consensus among
them and the US embassy staffers who facilitated the discussion was that
bigger companies might be okay and smaller ones wouldn't. But since (the
journalists told me) the Polish people are used to hardship, it wouldn't be
as big of a deal as it would be in the US.

Best,

Declan
Washington, DC
