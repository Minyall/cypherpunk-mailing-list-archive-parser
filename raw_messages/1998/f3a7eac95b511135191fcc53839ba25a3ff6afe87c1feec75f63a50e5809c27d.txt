 "I CANT PARTICIPATE IN THE REVOLUTION BECAUSE I DIDNT
  GET ENOUGH NOTICE OR ITS TOO INCONVENIENT OR THEY
  ARE USING LEFTIST PROTEST TECHNIQUES"
  EXPORTING PGP WITHIN MINUTES OF ITS RELEASE
  NOW THAT WOULD IMPRESS ME...
  (BEEN THERE DONE THAT!)
   NOW I am trying to shake the apathy from all of you..
   Its so much easier to talk about revolution than
   participating or contributing...
   Talking about revolution does NOT make it happen
   magically..
  
   I suspect the revolution will die given the above
