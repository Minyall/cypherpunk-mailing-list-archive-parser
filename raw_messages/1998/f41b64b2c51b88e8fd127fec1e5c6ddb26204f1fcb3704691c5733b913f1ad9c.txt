Don't ignore the fact that 6degrees of spam, like most other organizations that
pose as a free service do so to make money from ads.  The more sheep view the
ads of their true clients, the more money they make.  They have no interest in
cutting down the supply of viewers.  If a mailing list gets spammed because of
an asshole, so much the better since many of that list might go and check out
the site, even if just to find contact info to complain to.
