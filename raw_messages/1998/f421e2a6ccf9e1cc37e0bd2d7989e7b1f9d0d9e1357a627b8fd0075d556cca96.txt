	Crap, the U.N. (what was that about "United?") started the shit
when they ham-fisted decided that the "homeland" the "Jews" needed was land
considered holy by the Moslems AND Christians, and ignored the fact that
the jews were just as racist and bigoted as a group as the Kikes that had
been trying to cook them.

	Israel was a DUMB idea, like mixing Nitric acid and Glycerol in a
blender. Anyone who thought it wouldn't end in violence was a total fool,
anyone who thinks that the Powers That Be want it cool down is a bigger
fool.
