A person of my acquaintance was recently involved in a traffic accident in a 
Northeast state.  Out-of-state (but in country) car registered in someone 
else's name and carrying a drivers license issued by a NATO ally.  Ticketed 
for running a red light.  No further problems.  Could have been a deadbeat 
dad for all I know...

As legal as church on a Sunday.
