I'm in El Paso Texas... so close to the border
I can see Old Mex outside my window as I write this..
I'm over there nearly every day for lunch ( I actually
walk there from my house it's so close) If I write
a crypto program on my laptop over there and ftp
it to a web page I have on a server outside the US
will I have avoided the foolish export regs??
Does anyone know of someone trying this before??
