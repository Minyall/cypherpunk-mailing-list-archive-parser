There was an SBIR solicitation for an amusing version of this several
years ago. They ( army? ) wanted a robotic version that would detect and
'affix' itself to the target. Probably been built already. I can see
them now : popping out of the ground like bouncing bettys, dropping from
trees like mountain lions, crawling up your leg like disease-carrying
ticks...each one with its own address and destruct code.

Connection to crypto - secure communications probably.

TITLE: Tracking and Reporting System (TRS)
OBJECTIVE: To conceive, design, implement, and develop a small
(vest-pocket-size) satellite transceiver that can be overtly (and
possibly
covertly) affixed to personnel, vehicles, or goods in transit for the
purpose of tracking and position reporting of the host.
