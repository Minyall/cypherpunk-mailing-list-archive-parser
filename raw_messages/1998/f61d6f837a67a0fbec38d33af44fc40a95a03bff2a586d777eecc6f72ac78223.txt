The big issue I see with GPL and Crypto software is that with the GPL
you cannot add any redistribution restrictions.  The problem is that
due to the United States export rules, I cannot export Crypto
software, which means I must legally put a restriction on any Crypto
code I write.  But, this is a "further restriction" as far as the
GPL is concerned.  This, in turn, means I cannot use the GPL for
Crypto software.
