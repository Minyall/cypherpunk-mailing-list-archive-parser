The original stings were done by young-looking cops, but a few
judges (maybe just New York, maybe Federal?  it's been a while)
threw them out - if the cop is 24, then it wasn't selling to a minor,
so it wasn't a crime or necessarily even a liquor license violation.
So the cops need to hire kids (and for tobacco stings, minors.)
This gets into the interesting legal question of whether you can
insist that the decoys be prosecuted.

Yup.  It's really annoying to have to give the California DMV lots of
personal information about myself so they can track down deadbeat dads,
given that I'm not even a dad, much less a deadbeat dad, and so they
can track down Mexicans who want to drive without citizenship papers,
and similar presumptions of potential guilt.
