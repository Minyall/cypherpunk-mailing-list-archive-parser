Declan, a few questions on the CDs of the Starr report: 

1. Did the press get the CDs, say, embargoed, before the House 
authorized release? 

2. Who handled the CD distribution, the House or Starr or 3rd 
party?

3. Do you know anything about how the CDs were made, by 
Starr's op or some other party, and when made?

4. Will there be pre-releases of press-only CDs of the remaining 
material, that is, is there a boxed-series prepared of the whole
wad for lobbing week by weekly?

This is a query about fake news, lying, perjuring, you know, to
the American People, whatever that junk-populace is cooked 
up to be.
