I think people here seriously underestimate how long nanotech will take.
Suppose you have a machine which takes atoms and deposits them onto a
surface, building it up layer by layer.  This is possible with today's
technology, but it's a slow process.

Consider this: If someone builds a replicator which takes a week to make
a copy of itself, every person on this entire planet could have one within
eight months.  Think about it.
