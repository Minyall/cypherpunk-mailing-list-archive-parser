That depends on what current and near-future medical technology can do
to extend the lifespan of humans. If your assumption is that most folks
younger than about 50 will be dead in 75 years I suspect that you're in for
a nasty surprise. The reason I posted those cc:'s regarding such research is
enough that current estimates of key strength based on human life times need
to be re-evaluated. It is my suspicion that within 10-15 years it will be
possible, as a matter of course in regards employer medical insurance, to
have ones biological clock reset such that the lifespan will be extended 3-4
times with the main limiting factor being cancers. Under those conditions
key strength lifetime computations need to be re-evaluated.
