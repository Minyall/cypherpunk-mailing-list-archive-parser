Has anyone done any work that you are aware of under the Plan 9 os? With
it's fundamental seperation of i/o, process, and file servers along with
it's inherent bidding/scheduling mechanism it seems to me that a lot of this
work has already been done. In addition there are programs that allow Linux
boxes to participate as Plan 9 compliant file servers.
