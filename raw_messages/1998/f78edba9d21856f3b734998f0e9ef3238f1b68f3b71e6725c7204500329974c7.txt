I've created a new mailing list, called "tamper-resist", for technical/etc.
discussions of tamper resistance, both through distributed techniques
and hardware tamper resistance.  It's hosted at venona.com.  To subscribe,
send mail to tamper-resist-request@venona.com.

I encourage people to crosspost, etc.
