You're quite right...I stand corrected.

Though in some sense it was a "secessionist movement," which is subtly
different from a revolution. As with Quebec, whose secession the USG
opposes. As with Kurdistan, whose secession the USG sometimes supports and
sometimes doesn't, depending on geopolitical calculations and on the party
in power. As with the Basque region, whose secession the USG emphatically
does not support, to the point of sending intelligence experts to Spain to
help crush the secessionists. As with the outlying regions of the former
Soviet Union, which the USG attempted to destabilize by dropping agents in,
assassinating politicians, etc.
