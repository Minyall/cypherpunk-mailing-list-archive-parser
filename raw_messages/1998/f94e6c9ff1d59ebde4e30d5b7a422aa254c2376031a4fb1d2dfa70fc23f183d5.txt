I would like to congratulate and thank you for the courageous stance
that you
have taken by doing your part to help stop the spread of anarchistic and
possibly
illegal content on the InterNet by denying access to those who use the
freedom
and rights granted them by the Constitution to abuse those privileges.

  Your stance is particularly admired by those of us who share your
interest in
preventing the spread of free access to all types of information, in
light of the
fact that you have not shied away from persecuting those connected with
the
Circle of Eunuchs, thus possibly putting yourself, your family and your
business
in physical danger, as well as virtual danger.
  Given the current dissension within the ranks of the Cirle of Eunuchs
and the
Army of Dog, concerning whether their assault on censorship and censors
should
be consumated in CyberSpace or MeatSpace, there are few who are willing
to put
themselves in the line of fire to support the same ideals that other
great
Americans, such as Senator Joe McCarthy and J. Edgar Hoover, have
championed.

  Regardless of the possible physical danger you will be subjected to if
the
proponents of MeatSpace retruibution to censorship supporters win out in
the
current battle for control of the resources of the Army of Dog, your
choice
to submit to government oppressors and legal threats is likely the right
one,
since the government currently has more and better armed thugs than
those
who oppose them.
