Indeed, which was my point.
 
This type of operant conditioning of the sheeple is becoming almost
routine.
 
Witness the "Arab Oil Embargo", where there were long gas lines and
blaming of the Arab world, without one drop of oil ceasing to flow
into the United States.
 
"Drug Lab" busts, with prolonged evacuation of several square blocks
of neighborhood by men in astronaut garb are very routine now, every
time the police find a can of ether or other organic solvent in some
person's apartment.
 
Children are marched outside a school, stripped, and hosed down by
biohazard teams, because someone broke a mercury thermometer in class.
 
Now we have the latest incarnation of adjusting sheeple motivational
inperatives, Anthrax Theatre.  Genuine Anthrax not required, of
course. Yes children, see what happens because of Saddam Hussein?
There'll be a test later, to see if further attitudinal adjustment is
required.
