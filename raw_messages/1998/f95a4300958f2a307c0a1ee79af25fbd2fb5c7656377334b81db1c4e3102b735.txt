These are two address I thought might be useful.

This is a guide on tracking down real addresses in
usenet faked posts.  Once you find the real addresses or at least have a
couple good guesses on what provider they use reply to their message and
cc: it to the postmaster and technicle contact of all the ISP's you think
it might be.  They can use message ID's and logs to check where the message
originated from.

this is the same for forged e-mail.

The reason I'm sending this is because of the fact that I almost never get
spam.  When I do I respond quickly and appropriately and the spam dies out.
When I joined and then posted to this list I was flooded with mail.
Personally I this has to be one of the stupided lists to spam.  How many
technical peopl that are interested in crypto are really gaing to respond
to some of these stupid ads
