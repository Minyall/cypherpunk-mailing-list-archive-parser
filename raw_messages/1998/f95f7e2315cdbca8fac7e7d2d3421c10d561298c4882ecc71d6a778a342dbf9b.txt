Simple.  You set the bios to boot off the hard drive.  You could even set your
notebook to sleep, then when they ask you to turn it on, you wake it and have
your emulator boot from the floppy.  This is especially effective if you
scratch up the case of your notebook and make it look older by modifying it's
case to look like it's a 486 or 386 to account for the difference in speed.

Shit, if you had the source to something like SoftPC or Virtual PC, you could
modify it to work on a Mac notebook (of course the nice Apple Logo would give
you away, but I'm sure you can figure out how to modify the case and the apple
keys.)

I'll worry about them using TEMPEST scanners when I hear reports that say
they're using it.  Until such time, you're being overly paranoid.

Until they start, this point is moot.  In any case the answer to that silly
idea is tempest shield your box, but include RF transmitters in various places
outside the shielding to emit the frequencies that a normal unaltered notebook
would transmit.
