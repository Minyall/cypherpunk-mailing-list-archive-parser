Unless I've missed some absolutely major announcement, IBM is betting on
the PowerPC in all their servers.  Well, at least in their RS/6000 and
AS/400, which is pretty much their entire high-end market.

The PowerPC never had a serious entry into the desktop market anywhere but
the Macintosh to my knowledge.
