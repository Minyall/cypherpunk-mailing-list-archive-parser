My fault: the extension .exe is used for cgi-scripts @replay, so the
webinterface thinks that the file is a cgi script, and not a downloadable
archive so it tries to execute it which ofcourse doesn´t work.

try the following URL:

ftp://ftp.replay.com/pub/crypto/browsers/128bit/

Sorry for the mess ..
