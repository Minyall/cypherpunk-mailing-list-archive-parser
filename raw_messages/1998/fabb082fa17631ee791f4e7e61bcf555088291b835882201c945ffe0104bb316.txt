	And both Lasers and Masers scatter under certain conditions. If you
can see the laser, it is scattering a bit of [energy light photons]

	That is what Mr. May is talking about.

	I was under the (apparently false) impression that things like
animal bodies, and ordinary building materials (like wood, Lathe &
plaster/drywall) wouldn't stop or significantly bounce the beams back the
way you didn't want them to go.

	I was thinking more of controling the direction of the RF, rather
than trying to completely supress it.

	It doesn't appear that will work.

	We're not cooking Hotdogs here, and we aren't using (for the most
part) microwaves. Yes, you can heat a hotdog on a PII, but that is more
from heat radiation than RF.

	Microwave ovens also leak RF.
