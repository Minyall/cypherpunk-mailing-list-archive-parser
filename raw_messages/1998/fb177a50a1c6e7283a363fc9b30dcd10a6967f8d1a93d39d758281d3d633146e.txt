There have always been two groups in Texas, one in Austin, and one in
Houston, I think.  Austin is of course the famous home of the Steve Jackson
raids.  Rumor has it that the two groups are merging into one to be called
something similar to EF-Texas.  If you want more info, you'll have to get
it from Jon Lebkowsky, Gene Crick, or one of the others in Texas.  I'm sure
Jon will address this during his chat.

Hopefully we'll have the text of the chat session, or at least the first
hour, on a web page after the chat.  Jon's chat session will be on
Wednesday, January 7, 1998 at 7:00 EST (5:00pm Pacific)

The session hosted by EF Australia should be Saturday, January 17, 1998 at
8:00pm EST (11:00am Sunday, Brisbane, AU), Hosted by Greg Taylor of
Electronic Frontiers Australia.  (maybe 7:00 EST - it is not set in stone)

To be honest, I'm getting confused on the time zones.  Today I noticed a
mistake I made earlier when I added when I should have subtracted.  Plus I
haven't figured out Australia and GMT time yet, to do it without thinking.
More info about times, and hopefully any corrections can be found at
