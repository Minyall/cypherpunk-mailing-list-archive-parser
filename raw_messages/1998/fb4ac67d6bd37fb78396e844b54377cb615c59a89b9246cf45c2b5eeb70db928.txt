Cool.  So they'll help me make sure my taxes aren't used irresponsibly, 
and make sure they aren't given to murderers or terrorists, 
or prosecutors and cops attacking people for drug use,
or bureaucrats interfering with legitimate businesses
or distributing stolen money?  
Is this mission statement enforceable, or just hype?   :-)

				Thanks!
