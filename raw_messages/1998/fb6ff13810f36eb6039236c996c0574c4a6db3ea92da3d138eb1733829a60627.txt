Several of the servers where I work have multiple monitors.  While it is
rare that I have several instances of the same application being
displayed on these monitors, I do, at times, do just that.  Easier for
cutting and pasting large blocks from one to the other as well as other
editing of code.  So, when the software police pull up outside of my
place of business see that there are six instances of a program being
displayed with one license I can expect a warrant to be issued?  That
would suck.

Unfortunatley, I do not have the time to read through the entire
document at the URL provided, and can't save it either from the .pdf ...
the defensive measures sound interesting.

Also, does this only work with CRTs or can it detect LCD too?

I have worked on contract with several 'large' companies who are running
illegal copies of software, often without the knowledge of the sys
admin...better check those 'findings.'
