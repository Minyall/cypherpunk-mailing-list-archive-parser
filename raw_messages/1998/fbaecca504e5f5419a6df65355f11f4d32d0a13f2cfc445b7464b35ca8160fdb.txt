I was scanning the dial on my shortwave radio recently and landed on Radio
Havana. I was thinking about how in many countries (presumably including
Cuba)  it's a thought crime to tune in to banned broadcasts.

And we in the West unctuously decry this.

But are we all that different?

Suppose "Radio Pedophilia" started broadcasting on 6223 KHz. Fill in the
details on program content, etc.

By any reading of the various child pornography laws in the U.S. merely
_listening_ to such a broadcast would be a felony. Of this this there can
be no doubt.

Were such a station to exist (which it does not), I would expect FCC and
FBI, with NSA SIGINT assistance, would use technical means to isolate who
was tuned to this station and then bust in the doors.

The only difference with the Sovs and Cubans and Berkeleyites would be the
reasons the broadcasts were illegal to listen to.
