 From high-tech privacy to low-tech politics, Clinton's
                video testimony raises novel issues. There is the basic matter
                of preventing electronic eavesdropping, a presumed concern
                of all the parties and one that will require the use of
                sophisticated encryption technology. There is the political
                consideration that, under certain circumstances, tape of
                Clinton's testimony could end up in Republican attack ads or
                television news shows.
