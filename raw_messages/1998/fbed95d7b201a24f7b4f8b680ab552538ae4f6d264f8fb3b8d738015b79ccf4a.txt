Yes, that's easy...

Just drop it from a 1 meter down straight fall... :-)))

... or simply run DELPART and erase any partitions on the disks...

... or install a separate copy of NT in another folder and run deltree

... or go into \CONFIG and delete the registry

...


There are a thousand ways to acomplish that... can you be more specific ?

:-)))
