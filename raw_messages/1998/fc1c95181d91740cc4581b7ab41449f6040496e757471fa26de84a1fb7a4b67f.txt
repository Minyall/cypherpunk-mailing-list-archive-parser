Good God what kind of double talk is this? It doesn't need Red Book eval.
and networking can be treated as a sub-system?!? Well I guess the guys
down at NSA just wrote the Red Book (which is significantly larger than
the Orange Book) because they were board.

I would not trust Micky$lop to tell me that the sky was blue and water was
wet let alone trust them to provide *any* form of security product.
