1. You have the option of telling them to leave your property at
once (if you can pull this at work, e.g., if you're the boss).

2. You do not have to identify yourself when asked, unless
you're driving a car in public.  You do not have to accept a subpeona.

I remember my dad sending me to tell the man who drove up to the
house (to serve my dad, a lawyer) to get lost.  Pretty cool thing

If you have the presence of mind to remember these things, you can
at least get advance notice, and send your blue dress to the cleaners.
