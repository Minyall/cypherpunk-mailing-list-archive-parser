Versions are important, too...

Quote from current Microsoft Web site...

"<The NT 3.51 ITSEC> evaluation along with the US TCSEC class C2 evaluation
completed in 1995 for Windows NT 3.5
demonstrates Microsoft's commitment to building a secure operating system
and continuing to provide customers
with assurance of its security characteristics based on these evaluations>"

NT 4.0 has never passed ANY security evaluation. NT 3.51 passed a UK one in
October 1996, NT 3.5 passed C2 in
1995. Both these earlier versions are effectively unusable due to diverse
and numerous bugs unrelated to security,
and both the evaulations were without a network card.


Later,
Andrew.
