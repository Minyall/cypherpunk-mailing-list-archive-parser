For those of you who use mail-reading/downloading softs
that let you filter your messages based on header/body 
content (ie Eudora, ect), I've found a helpfull tool
that assists in the filtering out of spam.

If the Sender: header is "owner-cypherpunks@toad.com"
and the To: line does not contain the list address, you
can easily get a lot of the spam that comes through here.
I've resigned myself to creatively filtering out the spam
into the trash folder (or your equivilent, like deleting)
and leaving it at that, because of time constraints.

Best wishes and fresh-roasted peanut taste,
The Sheriff. -- ***<REPLY TO: sheriff@speakeasy.org>***

Comments: I was stewing about cliques when the rhyming
          bug bit.

          Watch them gather,
          watch them play.
          Watch the mailman
          blow them away.
