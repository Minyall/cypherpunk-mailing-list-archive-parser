In other Florida news, a 23 year old female daycare worker picked up a
kitchen knife and stabbed a mother to death, after the mother complained
that the worker had hit and pinched her 5 year old son. 

We don't really know what the counselor said or did to this 5 year old
girl before the biting started, and given the anti-youth bias of the
mainstream press, we are unlikely to find out.  Even if some horrendous
tale of harrassment by school staff emerges, it will simply be suggested
that they were "disciplining" her for her "behavior problem." 

Now she may have a legitimate problem, and may have started biting and
scratching in response to the counselor saying - "Good morning.  You look
lovely today." 

Then again.... 

It is rarely useful to take things like this at face value, especially
given the spin control talents of school administrators and the teachers
union.
