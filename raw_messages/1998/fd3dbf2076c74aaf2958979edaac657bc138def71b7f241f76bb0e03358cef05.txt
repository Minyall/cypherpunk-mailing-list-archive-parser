ping just tells you that a host is reachable. finger gives you information
on who is logged in, which real name is associated to an address etc.
traceroute gives you a list of hosts that are used to connect from your
site to the other host. you can use traceroute and whois to figure out
where a host is located, who is their isp, etc.
