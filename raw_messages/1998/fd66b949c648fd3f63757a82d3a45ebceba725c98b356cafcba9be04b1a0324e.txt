	Subject:	Update on New Zealand crypto policy



	As part of my recent effort to prepare a useful home page after
2 years of 
	having instead a mini text adventure, I've finally got around to
finishing off 
	the web page containing the recent history of, and current state
of, New 
	Zealands crypto export policy as decided by several intelligence
agencies and 
	a supporting cast of bungling bureaucrats.  This policy has
resulted in New 
	Zealand enjoying the dubious distinction of having the strictest
export 
	controls on earth, with everything ranging from crypto hardware
down to 
	software, library books, computer magazines, and journals being
restricted 
	from export.  It's not even possible for a university to publish
academic 
	research without prior permission from a government agency, and
the 
	requirements for obtaining this permission are structured to
ensure that they 
	can never be fulfilled.  You can find the information on:
	 
	  http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/policy/
	 
	The page also contains links to a sizeable collection of
never-before- 
	published documents including correspondence with relevant
government 
	agencies, and media reports on the situation.
	 
	If you're going to send me mail about this, please note that
I'll be at Usenix 
	in San Antonio for the next week, so it'll take awhile for me to
reply.  My 
	PGP key's at the bottom of my home page if you need it.
	 
	Peter.
