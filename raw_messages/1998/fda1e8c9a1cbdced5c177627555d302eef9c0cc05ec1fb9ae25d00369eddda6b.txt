Hi cypherpunks,

I grabbed your email address of an html posting of this newsgroup - in
other words, your my randomly selected answer person(s).

My question:  My isp doesn't have an NNTP Server, but I'm under the
impression that I can use a "free" news server somehow.  I need to be
pointed in the direction of how to set up news with a server other than
my isp.

Thanks,
