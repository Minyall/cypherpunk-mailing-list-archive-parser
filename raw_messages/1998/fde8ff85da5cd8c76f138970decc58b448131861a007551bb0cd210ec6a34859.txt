Whine Whine Whine.
You want some cheeze?

Sweaping generality, yes those of us that want everything we don't agree
with put
under penalty of death.

Instantly.

No, wait.  Lets change that, we put those that don't agree with us on work
projects for the 4th Reich.

Yeah, thats what I really meant
but you have to look really hard into the message to find that undertone
or you have to be a shitneck.

Anyways.

1.  Its theft of services because its using my bandwidth to "harrass" my
customers.
2.  It may destroy my mail server.
3.  It may detrimentally effect the quality of my business.
4.  It destroys other ISP mail server.

So back to your normal ranting, as I doubt anyone doesn't have an
entrenched opinion concerning this.

Im not the happiest person to be inviting the U.S. Goverment into this
media, im pretty opposed to the U.S. Goverment in general and specific terms.

You want to know who we currently call for situations like this?
FBI, executive order gave them all venue over crimes on the Internet via an
executive order.

So guess what, the U.S. goverments already here.
I just don't want Joe Smoooze Dick the Marketing stud starting up his
garage business selling e-mail lists for $99, cause he can.

by the way, putting @dev.null in your return address
thats pretty tricky, I bet you have a business card
that says 31337.  I bet they teach that in all canadian
schools.  Elite 101.
