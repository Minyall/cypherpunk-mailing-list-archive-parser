As with the previous round of Desert Scam, very few invaders will die,
because the military objective is to cause mass destruction, not to 
conquer and hold.  And the press will focus on the invaders that die,
not on the tens or hundreds of thousands of Iraqis killed.

They'd also be focusing on the great job they've done eliminating the
entire US stock of CBW and nukes.  Oh, we haven't?  Well their weapons 
of mass destruction are Evil, and ours are Freedom Fighting Tools.
Actually the US and Former Soviet Union have substantially reduced the
nuclear forces, especially older missiles that are hard to maintain,
but the US refused for a long time to sign the CBW treaties,
and I'm not sure they ever did follow through and destroy their supplies.
				Thanks!
