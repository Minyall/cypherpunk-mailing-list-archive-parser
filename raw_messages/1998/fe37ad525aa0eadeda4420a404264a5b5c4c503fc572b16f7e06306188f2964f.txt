I recently started a mailing list for the marketing, advertising and PR
industry.  We've already got over 100 subscribers from all over the globe.
The conversation is really flowing now and we're ready to expand.  So far
we've have touched on office politics, how to's, compensation and critiques
of national campaigns, job openings and a whole lot more.  We'd love to have
you on board.

All you need to do to sign up is send an email to the address:

Also, please do me a favor and copy me at M_harlow@villingandcompany.com if
you sign up.  That way I know to add your name to the roster.

Hope to see you at the forum!  We're getting some great exchanges and I'd
love to get you in on them.

Feel free to pass this message on to anyone you feel might be interested in
the group.

Sincerely,

P.S. If you're already signed up or if I've recruited you before, Sorry!
It's tough to recruit for a project like this and sometimes I get a name
twice in my efforts not to miss anyone.
