cool editorial, but where do you get in the mandatory
plug for strong crypto? everyone here agrees (and
points out to everyone willing to listen)
that the internet would be much more secure if we
had good crypto.

if the internet is insecure, blame the real source
of the problem: the multibillion dollar NSA that
has a vested interest in keeping the world technology
weak..

makes ya wonder-- are they the only parasitical govt agency
or business that has an interest in keeping its
host weak, without killing it?
