So why not _send_ the plaintext in the clear?
Send the 0 bit, and the bit from the MAC0, and the 1 and the MAC1 bit
	0 0, 1 1, 0 1, 1 0, 
Yes, it's expanding the data 4:1, but that's much better than before.

I strongly agree.  I had proposed using a short checksum,
e.g. 8 bits of the MAC, which does leave collisions every ~256 sets,
but this is almost as short a checksum as you can get,
and eliminates the collision except every ~2**64 pairs.

If you do include the data bits, you maintain (very marginally)
the letter of the requirement here.  What you do lose
with this method is the ability to mix traffic from different people;
1 bit of MAC just isn't enough to pick out your own bits.
Any short MAC limits the amount of mixing you can do;
an 8-bit MAC lets you mix a bit without too many collisions,
and a 64-bit MAC should be enough for any mixture you'd
ever bother with (probably 16 or 32 would as well,
though especially for 16 you'd still need a longitudinal
checksum or some method of handling rare collisions.)

Is it close enough for government work?  Probably.
				Thanks!
