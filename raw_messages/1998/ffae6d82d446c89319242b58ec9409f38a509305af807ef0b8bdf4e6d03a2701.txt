trust me, it's ok, he was using '32-bit AOL' to post his message, so
EVERYONE but you realized that he was talking about garbage anyway.  maybe
AOL64 will have a clue(tm) built in.


an appeal to listmembers:

listmembers, can't we make this list 'request for access'?  iLoV2HaCk and
his AOL ilk are getting a little too 'elite' and 'k-rad' for me. pipebombs,
posters, spooks, music, what the hell is happening to this list?  I know
that I mainly lurk, but don't you think that having to request to join this
list may filter out the worst of the AOL (et al) newbies?  they obviously
cannot get a clue(tm) and continue to cause a landslide of off-topic
(albeit funny) posts that ridicule them, and keep this list awash in
non-cypherpunkish dialogue.  

oh, and I am also sorry for perpetuating this thread.

The people to worry about are not those who openly disagree with you,
